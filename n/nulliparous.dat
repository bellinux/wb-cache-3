Fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors. Those who have been treated for infertility but remain <b>nulliparous</b> are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer; however, those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk.

25|$|Dysmenorrhea is {{estimated}} to affect approximately 25% of women. Reports of dysmenorrhea are greatest among individuals {{in their late teens}} and 20s, with reports usually declining with age. The prevalence in adolescent females has been reported to be 67.2% by one study and 90% by another. It has been stated that there is no significant difference in prevalence or incidence between races. Yet, a study of Hispanic adolescent females indicated a high prevalence and impact in this group. Another study indicated that dysmenorrhea was present in 36.4% of participants, and was significantly associated with lower age and lower parity. Childbearing is said to relieve dysmenorrhea, but this does not always occur. One study indicated that in <b>nulliparous</b> women with primary dysmenorrhea, the severity of menstrual pain decreased significantly after age 40. A questionnaire concluded that menstrual problems, including dysmenorrhea, were more common in females who had been sexually abused.|$|E

2500|$|High-dosage NET {{has been}} used to {{suppress}} menstruation in women with severe intellectual disability who were incapable of handling their own menses. A study of 118 <b>nulliparous</b> women treated with 5mg/day NET for a period of 2 to 30 months found that the drug was effective in producing amenorrhea in 86% of the women, with breakthrough bleeding occurring in the remaining 14%.

Another study of 5mg/day NET in 132 women also made no mention of androgenic side effects. These findings suggest little to no risk of androgenic side effects with NET at a dosage of 5mg/day. A study of 194 women treated with 5 to 15mg/day NETA for a median duration of 13 months of therapy to suppress symptoms of endometriosis observed no side effects in 55.2% of patients, weight gain in 16.1%, acne in 9.9%, mood lability in 8.9%, hot flashes in 8.3%, and voice deepening in two women (1.0%).|$|E
2500|$|Associated {{terms for}} {{pregnancy}} are gravid and parous. Gravidus and gravid {{come from the}} Latin for [...] "heavy" [...] and a pregnant female is {{sometimes referred to as}} a gravida. Gravidity is a term used to describe the number of times that a female has been pregnant. [...] Similarly, the term parity is used for the number of times that a female carries a pregnancy to a viable stage. Twins and other multiple births are counted as one pregnancy and birth. [...] A woman who has never been pregnant is referred to as a nulligravida. [...] A woman who is (or has been only) pregnant for the first time is referred to as a primigravida, and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a multigravida or as multiparous. Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. [...] In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/ or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as <b>nulliparous.</b>|$|E

Through observing these groups in both species, he suggested that two factors are most important in determining how obviously a female displays the ovulatory stage in her cycle: the level of scramble competition that exists between the females of the group for resources such as food; and the difference in travelling costs for parous and <b>nulliparous</b> females.|$|E

50|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are used to}} reduce the risk of tearing, but with little evidence for efficacy.

50|$|The copper IUD can be {{inserted}} {{at any time}} in a woman's menstrual cycle as long as the woman is not pregnant.

The IUD can be inserted in women with HIV or AIDS as it does not increase the risk of transmission.Although previously not recommended for <b>nulliparous</b> women (women who have not had children), the IUD is now recommended for most women who are past menarche (their first period), including adolescents.|$|E
50|$|Tatum {{developed}} {{many different}} {{models of the}} copper IUD.

These devices had higher surface areas of copper, {{and for the first}} time consistently achieved effectiveness rates of greater than 99%. The last model Tatum developed was the TCu380A, the model that is most recommended today. In addition to T-shaped IUDs, there are also U-shaped IUDs (such as the Multiload) and 7-shaped Gravigard Copper 7 (with a mini version for <b>nulliparous</b> women introduced in the 1980s).

40|$|Background. The Active Management of Risk in Pregnancy at Term (AMOR-IPAT) {{protocol}} {{has been}} associated in several studies with significant reductions of group cesarean delivery rate. Present within each of these studies were <b>nulliparous</b> women with risk factors for cephalopelvic disproportion.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effect of {{childbirth}} delivery method on vaginal pressure and abdominal thickness during the Valsalva maneuver (VAL). [Subjects] Thirty healthy female volunteers (26 – 39 years of age) were selected for this research. Their delivery histories were: <b>nulliparous</b> 10, vaginal delivery 10, and Cesarean delivery 10. None of the participants had a history of incontinence. [Methods] In the crook-lying position, a perineometer probe was inserted into the vagina and the transducer was placed transversely on the right side of the body during the Valsalva maneuver. [Results] There were significant differences in the thickness of the transverses abdominis (TrA) between in all the groups rest and the Valsalva maneuver, and there were significant differences in the internus oblique (IO) in the <b>nulliparous</b> group. During the Valsalva maneuver, there were sig-nificant differences in the TrA between the <b>nulliparous</b> group and the vaginal delivery group, and there were sig-nificant differences in the IO between the <b>nulliparous</b> delivery group and the vaginal delivery group, and between the <b>nulliparous</b> group and the Cesarean section group.
