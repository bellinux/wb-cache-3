40|$|Abstract Background Many {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the immune response may {{play a crucial role in}} the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, our aim was to establish a (i) functional culture of primary human tumor hepatocytes and non-tumor from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and (ii) a co-culture system of HCC and non-HCC hepatocytes with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in order to study in vitro cell-to-cell interactions. Methods Tumor (HCC) and non-tumor (non-HCC) hepatocytes were isolated from the liver resection specimens of 11 patients operated for HCC, while PBMCs were retrieved immediately prior to surgery. Four biopsies were obtained from patients with no liver disease who had surgery for <b>non</b> <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> (normal hepatocytes). Hepatocytes were either cultured alone (monoculture) or co-cultured with PBMCs. Flow cytometry measurements for MHC class II expression, apoptosis, necrosis and viability (7 AAD) were performed 24 h, 48 h and 72 h in co-culture and monocultures. Results HCC and non-HCC hepatocytes exhibited increased MHC-II expression at 48 h and 72 h in co-culture with PBMCs as compared to monoculture, with MHC II-expressing HCC hepatocytes showing increased viability at 72 h. PBMCs showed increased MHC-II expression (activation) in co-culture with HCC as compared to non-HCC hepatocytes at all time points. Moreover, CD 8 + T cells had significantly increased apoptosis and necrosis at 48 h in co-culture with HCC hepatocytes as compared to monocultures. Interestingly, MHC-II expression on both HCC and non-HCC hepatocytes in co-culture was positively correlated with the respective activated CD 8 + T cells. Conclusions We have established an in vitro co-culture model to study interactions between autologous PBMCs and primary HCC and non-HCC hepatocytes. This direct interaction leads to increased antigen presenting ability of HCC hepatocytes, activation of PBMCs with a concomitant apoptosis of activated CD 8 + T cells. Although, a partially effective immune response against HCC exists, still tumor hepatocytes manage to escape. </p...|$|E

40|$|Desmoid {{tumors are}} a rare group of locally aggressive, <b>non</b> <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> of fibroblastic origin {{that can lead}} to {{significant}} morbidity due to local invasion. Despite advances in the understanding of these tumors, their natural history is incompletely understood and the optimal treatment is still a matter of debate. Local control is the main goal of treatment {{and there has been a}} change in philosophy regarding the management of these tumors from aggressive surgical resection to function preservation. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to plan local control with acceptable morbidity. The current Mayo Clinic algorithm for the treatment of these tumors is based on institutional experience and the available evidence in the literature: asymptomatic/non progressive lesions away from vital structures are managed with observation and regular imaging; primary or recurrent desmoid tumors which are symptomatic or progressive or near vital structures are managed with wide surgical resection when wide surgical margins are possible with minimal functional and cosmetic loss. When positive or close surgical margins are likely, surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy or definitive radiotherapy is preferred. If likely functional or cosmetic deficit is unacceptable, radiotherapy is the treatment of choice. Unresectable lesions are considered for radiotherapy, chemotherapy or newer modalities however an unresectable lesion associated with a painful, functionless, infected extremity is managed with an amputation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Non</b> <b>malignant</b> {{invasive}} <b>tumors</b> of {{the colon}} and rectum are very rare. Gastrointestinal Basidiobolomycosis can present as a mass lesion mimicking colorectal cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56 year old Caucasian male was evaluated for abdominal and pelvic pain for 4 weeks complicated by acute urinary retention. Radiological evaluation showed him to have recto-sigmoid and cecal mass. Endoscopic examination and biopsies did not reveal a definite diagnosis. Computerized tomography guided biopsy of the mass showed fungal elements consistent with gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis. He was treated with Itraconazole for 12 months with very good clinical and radiological response. CONCLUSION: Basidiobolomycosis of the gastrointestinal tract should be considered during evaluation of colorectal masses with atypical presentation. It is a rare entity seen more in endemic {{regions of the world}} for basidiobolomycosis including southwestern United States...|$|R

Serum total andlipid bound sialic acid determination was performed by the thiobarbituric acid methoddescribed by Warren and, the resorsinol method described by Katopodis, respectively. Student’s T test and Z test were used to analyze the results. The mean serum total andlipid bound sialic acid levels were found to be 63. 01 ± 11. 89 mg/dl and 15. 77 ± 2. 44 mg/dl, respectively in patients with benign skin tumors; and 65. 95 ± 7. 30 mg/dl and 16. 70 ± 3. 80 mg/dl, respectively in patients with non-melanom <b>malignant</b> skin <b>tumors.</b> Serum total sialic acid and lipid bound sialic acid of patients with benign skin tumorswere not different from those of patients with non-melanom <b>malignant</b> skin <b>tumors.</b> Thepercentage of lipid bound sialic acid was found to be 25. 3 in patients with non-melanommalignant skin tumors, 25 in patients with benign skin tumors. There was no significantdifference between the value of lipid bound sialic acid percentage in these groups. Ourfinding that there is no significant difference between serum total and lipid-bound sialicacid levels of patients with <b>non</b> melanom <b>malignant</b> skin <b>tumors</b> which are not able tometastase and patients with benign skin tumors supports the studies reporting that sialicacids {{play an important role in}} metastases...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the elimination of excess scar tissue from the body is achieved by specialized killer cells, which are activated by vascular changes in the scar tissue.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in classifying a tumor as benign or malignant is its invasive potential. If a tumor lacks the ability to invade adjacent tissues or spread to distant sites by metastasizing then it is benign, whereas invasive or metastatic tumours are malignant. For this reason, benign tumours are not classed as cancer. Benign tumors will grow in a contained area usually encapsulated in a fibrous connective tissue capsule. The growth rates of benign and <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> also differ; benign tumors generally grow more slowly than <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors.</b> Although benign tumors pose a lower health risk than <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors,</b> they both can be life-threatening in certain situations. There are many general characteristics which apply to either benign or <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors,</b> but sometimes one type may show characteristics of the other. For example, benign tumors are mostly well differentiated and <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> are often undifferentiated. However, undifferentiated benign <b>tumors</b> and differentiated <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> can occur. Although benign tumors generally grow slowly, cases of fast-growing benign tumors have also been documented. Some <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> are mostly non-metastatic such {{as in the case of}} basal cell carcinoma. CT and chest radiography can be a useful diagnostic exam in visualizing a benign tumour and differentiating it from a <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor.</b> The smaller the tumor on a radiograph the more likely it is to be benign as 80% of lung nodules less than 2 cm in diameter are benign. Most benign nodules are smoothed radiopaque densities with clear margins but these are not exclusive signs of benign tumors.|$|R

40|$|<b>Malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> carry a {{high risk}} of death, and the {{prevention}} of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> is a crucial issue in preventive medicine. To this end, many chemopreventive agents have been tested, but the effects of single agents {{have been found to be}} insufficient to justify clinical trials. We have therefore hypothesized that combinations of different chemopreventive agents may synergistically enhance the preventive effect of chemopreventive agents used singly. To provide the treating physician with some guideline by which to choose the most effective agents to be combined, we propose a strategy which we have termed the “combination-oriented molecular-targeting prevention” of cancer. As the molecular target of our model, we focused on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which specifically causes apoptosis in <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> cells. Many of these agents were found to up-regulate the expression of death receptor 5, a TRAIL receptor. They were also found to synergistically induce apoptosis in <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> cells when combined with TRAIL.
