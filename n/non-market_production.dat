5000|$|However, in {{national}} accounts the term {{has a more}} specific meaning. The reason is that many producing organizations exist in the economy which either do not produce for any distinct market, or which partly produce for the market, and partly don't. These are non-commercial or partly commercial organizations, which can be mainly self-funded, but not for profit, or mainly funded by sources {{other than their own}} revenue. Statisticians therefore have to define [...] "market production" [...] much more exactly, {{in order to be able}} to separate out market production in a consistent way, and distinguish it from <b>non-market</b> <b>production.</b> If they would be unable to do so, they would be unable to measure market production in a meaningful and consistent way.|$|E
5000|$|Secondly, it is {{necessary}} to create an operational statistical coverage of production itself, which can be used to allocate incomes, activities and transactions in the economy as either belonging to [...] "production", or falling outside [...] "production". Thus, some work produces something in the economic sense, other work does not. In general, national accounts adopt a very wide definition of production; it is defined as any activity of resident [...] "institutional units" [...] (enterprises, public services, households) combining the factors of production (land, labour and capital) to transform inputs into outputs. This includes both market production as well as <b>non-market</b> <b>production,</b> if it recognisably generates an income. The advantage of the wide definition is, that practically all flows of production-related income can be captured (but {{at the same time a}} large amount of unpaid work -housework and voluntary work - is not accounted for). Nevertheless, some incomes are ruled out of production and regarded as transfers of wealth. A transfer is defined basically as a payment made or income received without providing any good, service or asset in return, for example: government benefits. Some forms of interest on loans, some property rents, and most capital gains on financial assets and property are also excluded, they are effectively transfers (flows of income and expenditure which are regarded as unrelated to production and to the value of new output) or intermediate expenditure.|$|E

40|$|Smallholder {{dairy farmers}} in the Kenya {{highlands}} generally intensify their farming systems by integrating dairy with crop production and shifting from free-grazing to semi-zero- or zero-grazing. They consequently change the breed composition, size and structure of their herds with resultant change in herd demographic rates. The intensification of smallholder dairying has underpinned changes in the farming systems to sustain more intensive land use and support more people per unit area of land in smallholder households. However, the concern is whether smallholders will continue to benefit from dairying through continued intensification when facing the pressures of continuously shrinking landholdings, worsening soil fertility and reduced access to formerly public delivered livestock input and output services, while imported nutrients remain relatively low and non-agricultural job opportunities remain lacking. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to quantify the consequences of the intensification of farming systems in the Kenya highlands on the dynamics of smallholder dairy herds in order to better understand the constraints to, and opportunities for, the continued intensification of smallholder dairying. Data collection was through a random stratified cross-sectional survey of smallholder households. Data from the cross-sectional survey sample were complemented with additional information from longitudinal and targeted semi-structured interviews, which involved a randomly selected sub-sample of the previous cross-sectional survey. The drivers of intensification of smallholder dairying were identified and the relative changes were quantified {{at the level of the}} farms and farming systems. Intensification requires increased use of external resources including sources of replacement animals, feed resources, animal health and breeding services and credit to sustain the herd population and production. Prospects for maintaining and expanding smallholder dairying in the Kenya highlands depend upon the proportion of free-grazing farms maintained within the farming systems, because these supply semi-zero- and zero-grazing farms with dairy replacements. The rationale underlying smallholders' breeding decisions is based on multiple objectives of more milk, adaptability to local feed conditions and diseases and the provision of <b>non-marketed</b> <b>production</b> such as manure, insurance and financing roles of cattle. Feeding interventions to support continued intensification of smallholder dairying must be within the context of the household's economy, which is characterised by limited cash flow and low risk bearing capacity. Smallholders need affordable working capital to sustain intensification with use of external resources. Solutions to constraints of intensification must concurrently involve both technical and institutional innovations that may encourage greater complementarities and stratification in the dairy sub-sector...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{households}} in the non market production {{and the importance of}} the household production has come topical {{in the last few years}} as a result of studies on the measurement of economic well-being of society. <b>Non-market</b> household <b>production</b> covers the goods and services household members produce for their own consumption by combining their unpaid labour and goods and services they acquire on the market.

The sorts of variations in the basic concepts regards a different production boundary, an enlarged concept of consumption or capital formation, an extension of the scope of assets, and so on.

50|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continues to dominate Kenya's economy, although only 15 percent of Kenya's total land area has sufficient fertility and rainfall to be farmed, and only 7 or 8 percent {{can be classified}} as first-class land. In 2006 almost 75 percent of working Kenyans made their living on the land, compared with 80 percent in 1980. About one-half of total agricultural output is <b>non-marketed</b> subsistence <b>production.</b> Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), after the service sector. In 2005 agriculture, including forestry and fishing, accounted for about 24 percent of GDP, {{as well as for}} 18 percent of wage employment and 50 percent of revenue from exports. The principal cash crops are tea, horticultural produce, and coffee; horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya's exports. In 2005 horticulture accounted for 23 percent and tea for 22 percent of total export earnings. Coffee has declined in importance with depressed world prices, accounting for just 5 percent of export receipts in 2005. The production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations.

Indeed, these behaviors create a priori less efficient economic performances, which should lead these enterprises to disappear. However, these strategies helps to maintain large corporate farms, which should not be compatible with the market (because of the economies of scale). This way, Russian agriculture became heterogeneous, while the reforms should have mainly helped only the emergence of small farms. Our main thesis is that a sectoral regulationist approach, which considers that the actor have a specific rationality links {{to the fact that}} this actor {{is also a member of}} a community, is able to analyze the choice to product some non market goods.

Ours empirical works in the oblast of Orel allowed us to represent the regulation of the agricultural sector as four “productive configurations”. We explained the plurality of the configurations as the result of the diversity of agreements consented by heterogeneous actors. These agreements allow each actor to maximize his interests according to his power and to reproduce the community to which he belongs to. To defend their individual and collective interests the actors create some legal structures on the land market which prevent the standard capitalism development in the Russian agriculture.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} it is {{necessary}} to focus on gender rather than exclusively on women in discussions on global poverty eradication. It argues firstly, that the drivers of poverty are complex and multifaceted leading to a least two different forms of deprivation – transitory and structural poverty – each requiring different forms of analysis and treatment. Transitory poverty can arise as a consequence of an event or shock that would diminish an individual’s capacity to retain or secure employment and where a State lacks an appropriate form of social protection. Structural poverty, on the other hand, arises where groups are excluded from the workforce on a more permanent basis due to a wide variety of factors of discrimination such as sex, race, ethnicity, and age. Focusing on the sex of an individual alone cannot explain why some are more likely to experience different forms of poverty than others. Policies that protect women against transitory poverty, such as care related allowances, are not sufficient to eradicate structural poverty. Secondly, structural poverty prompts an examination of gender roles and relations. Unlike the category of ‘women’, the concept of gender demands consideration of a wider range of intersecting factors that influence life chances. The structure of contemporary gender relations, where women continue to experience higher levels of violence, and carry the greatest burden of responsibility for <b>non-market</b> based <b>production</b> activities, create the social conditions where domination and dependence thrive, and where persistently high rates of poverty seem inevitable. Such circumstances are generated by human agency. Thus, thirdly, it argues that these circumstances can and should be changed through human action.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1980 s Jonathan Gershuny developed a bold framework for thinking about what kinds of social organisation might come ‘after industrial society’. The development of the theory of ‘social innovation’ coincided with Gershuny’s deepening interest in the information provided by time-diaries. At the centre of the theory of social innovation is the relationship between market and non-market provision of services. Gershuny argued that, over time, the relative market prices of durable goods and final services produces a tendency toward ‘self-service’, where households eschew the purchase of increasingly expensive final services and substitute them with home produced services. On this basis, Gershuny predicted the decline of time devoted to market work, a tendency he calls the ‘diminishing marginal utility of income’ and an increase in the time spent at home in self-servicing (<b>non-market</b> <b>production)</b> and in leisure consumption. Time spent in <b>non-market</b> <b>production</b> would be in turn diminished by the increasing productivity of domestic technology and the increased sexual equality in the domestic division of labour, producing a society of greater leisure.

40|$|Many recent {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} role of household food production and forms of reciprocal inter-household networks in 'post-communist' East Europe have argued that such economic activities represent a rational response to the austerity brought by economic decline and contracting incomes during the 'transition to capitalism'.
