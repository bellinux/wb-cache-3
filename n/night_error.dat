The efficacy of the technique is also tested predicting the 2005 Eusko Legebiltzarra elections from real data. Results confirm that the procedure generates highly reliable and accurate forecasts.

The Phillies' home stand continued with a three-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kendrick started game one; despite his continued first-inning struggles (he allowed three runs in the first, raising his season first-inning ERA to 9.69), the Phillies batted around in the third to take a 5–4 lead and strong pitching from both teams enabled them to hang on for the win.

40|$|Abstract — To {{determine}} the influence of sleep deprivation on the occurrence of errors by registered nurses working in night shift in intensive care departments. The study utilized a multi-part questionnaire which included items about demographic characteristics, reported medical errors, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 300 questionnaires were distributed to registered nurses working in intensive care departments. 138 of the 153 (51 % response rate) collected questionnaires were analyzed using correlation and stepwise logistic multiple regression. Registered nurses who were sleep deprived had worse sleep quality in terms of high PSQI than those who were not. None of the demographic variables was statistically significant, not providing evidence that these variables may explain odds for being sleep deprived in the population. Work schedule changes, offering shorter periods of time on night shift and less working hours in the week may lead to better sleep quality and less sleep deprivation.

As South Dakota was no longer receiving enemy fire and there were no remaining targets, it withdrew, met Washington at a prearranged rendezvous, and proceeded to Nouméa. Out of the American destroyers, only Gwin returned to port; the other three had been severely damaged early in the engagement: Walke and Preston were sunk, and Benham had part of its bow blown off by a torpedo, and, while en route to Nouméa with the damaged Gwin as its escort, had to be abandoned.

The license plate detection uses Edge detection, Gaussian Analysis, Feature extraction and character recognition which makes it robust to detect license plates in both day and <b>night</b> conditions. Median <b>error</b> was reduces to 11 % by use of 2 -lines algorithm. Vehicle classification using kalman filters gives accuracy of 82 %.
