These <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> {{can be just as}} troublesome for exporting companies. <b>Non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> include technical measures, customs rules and procedures, transport regulations or costs, lack of knowledge of regional markets, and import policies. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> faced by U. S., and more specifically North Dakota, exporting businesses, especially those involved in agriculture, and to identify difficulties involved in exporting products. A survey of North Dakota businesses is conducted to identify important trade barriers. Phytosanitary regulations and railroad problems are two frustrating issues that create barriers to export for North Dakota agribusinesses. Other <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> mentioned in the survey include labeling, paperwork, registration, and language differences.

5000|$|Non-tariff {{barriers}} to trade (NTBs) or sometimes called [...] "Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs)" [...] are trade barriers that restrict imports or exports of goods or services through mechanisms other than the simple imposition of tariffs.

They may take the form of import quotas, subsidies, customs delays, technical barriers, or other systems preventing or impeding trade." [...] According to the World Trade Organisation, non-tariff {{barriers to}} trade include import licensing, rules for valuation of goods at customs, pre-shipment inspections, rules of origin ('made in'), and trade prepared investment measures.|$|E

30|$|Art. 2.2 TBT bars {{technical}} regulations {{that are more}} trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective. Since the extended authorisation requirement is trade-restrictive (<b>non-tariff</b> <b>barrier)</b> {{the question is whether}} the regulation is also more trade-restrictive than necessary (necessity test). This includes an examination of (1) whether the regulation pursues a legitimate objective, (2) whether it is appropriate to fulfil such objective and (3) whether it is more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil the objective, taking account of the risks non-fulfilment would create. Additionally, the necessity test also includes (4) a comparison with possible alternative measures. A relational analysis of all four aspects and the regulation’s actual intrusiveness allows determining whether the extended authorisation scheme is more trade-restrictive than necessary in terms of Art. 2.2 TBT [21].|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of the WTO {{accession}} Ukraine has to liberalize both its tariff and non-tariff trade regimes. However, while tariffs have been studied more or less deeply, the country’s system of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> remains almost terra incognita both for scientists and policy makers. The situation is quite usual, since <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> have drawn special attention only several decades ago, and the interest was closely associated with the success of the GATT trade rounds in reduction of tariff barriers and, as a result, expected growth in the non-tariff protectionism. In this paper, it is proposed an augmented index of non-tariff protection. Its major distinction from the import coverage index lies in estimation of differentiated intensity of various types of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers,</b> as well as in construction of additive index that incorporates a whole spectrum of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers.</b> In the frame of the research, index of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> for Ukraine is calculated for the period between 1994 and 2001. It is shown that during the investigated period the structure of Ukraine’s non-tariff protection has evolved from “core ” barriers like quantity and price control to technical barriers, known by controversy in their protective nature.
