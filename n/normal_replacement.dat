Sections were viewed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope and areas of staining were quantified. Results: Before 12 months of age, little degraded collagen staining was detectable in +/+ or cho/+ mice. By 15 months, however, cho/+ mice showed significantly more degraded type II collagen than age-matched controls. Degraded collagen staining was localized at the articular surface, not distributed generally throughout the articular cartilage.

40|$|The {{canonical}} (13 -catenin dependent) Wnt {{signaling pathway}} {{has emerged as}} a likely candidate for regulating tooth replacement in continuously renewing dentitions. So far, the involvement of canonical Wnt signaling has been experimentally demonstrated predominantly in amniotes. These studies tend to show stimulation of tooth formation by activation of the Wnt pathway, and inhibition of tooth formation when blocking the pathway. Here, we report a strong and dynamic expression of the soluble V∫ inhibitor dickkopfl (dkkl) in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) tooth germs, suggesting an active repression of V∫ signaling during morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation of a tooth, and derepression of Wnt signaling during start of replacement tooth formation. To further analyse the role of Wnt signaling, we used different gain-of-function approaches. These yielded disjunct results, yet none of them indicating enhanced tooth replacement. Thus, masterblind (mbl) mutants, defective in axinl, mimic overexpression of Mt, but display a normally patterned dentition in which teeth are replaced at the appropriate times and positions. Activating the pathway with LICI had variable outcomes, either resulting in the absence, or the delayed formation, of first-generation teeth, or yielding a regular dentition with <b>normal</b> <b>replacement,</b> but no supernumerary teeth or accelerated tooth replacement. The failure so far to influence tooth replacement in the zebrafish by perturbing Wnt signaling is discussed in the light of (i) potential technical pitfalls related to dose- or time-dependency, (ii) the complexity of the canonical V∫ pathway, and (iii) species-specific differences in the nature and activity of pathway components. Finally, we emphasize the importance of in-depth knowledge of the wild-type pattern for reliable interpretations. It is hoped that our analysis can be inspiring to critically assess and elucidate the role of V∫ signaling in tooth development in polyphyodonts...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} Phase II of {{a project}} conducted for the Mechanical Utilities Division (UTel), Energy Management Program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) by Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC). The overall project covers energy efficiency and water conservation auditing services for 215 modular and prefabricated buildings at LLNL. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate compliance with DOE Order 430. 2 A, Contractor Requirements Document section 2. d (2) Document, to demonstrate annual progress of at least 10 percent toward completing energy and water audits of all facilities. Although this project covers numerous buildings, they are all similar in design and use. The approach employed for completing audits for these facilities involves a ''model-similar building'' approach. In the model-similar building approach, similarities between groups of buildings are established and quantified. A model (or test case) building is selected and analyzed for each model-similar group using a detailed DOE- 2 simulation. The results are extended {{to the group of}} similar buildings based on careful application of quantified similarities, or ''extension measures''. This approach leverages the relatively minor effort required to evaluate one building in some detail to a much larger population of similar buildings. The facility wide energy savings potential was calculated for a select set of measures that have reasonable payback based on the detailed building analysis and are otherwise desirable to the LLNL facilities staff. The selected measures are: (1) HVAC Tune-up. This {{is considered to be a}} ''core measure'', based on the energy savings opportunity and the impact on thermal comfort. All HVAC units in the study are assumed to be tuned up under this measure. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and HVAC unit. (2) HVAC system scheduling. This is also considered to be a ''core measure'', based on the energy savings opportunity and ability to control units centrally during a shelter-in-place event. All HVAC units in the study are assumed to be controlled under this measure. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and HVAC unit. (3) Cool roof. Savings estimates for the measure were applied to all roofs scheduled for replacement in the LLNL deficiency list. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building. (4) Window shading. Savings estimates for the measure were applied to all non-north facing windows. Although the simple payback is not a good for this measure, it should be considered for the associated benefits on thermal comfort and to alleviate some of the zoning and thermostat placement issues. (5) HVAC upgrade at <b>normal</b> <b>replacement.</b> Savings estimates for the measure were applied to all HVAC units scheduled for replacement on the LLNL deficiency list. A total of 642 units (about 55 % of the total) are on the replacement list, so this represents a major opportunity. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and HVAC unit. (6) Indirect/direct evaporative cooling. Savings estimates for the measure were applied to all HVAC units scheduled for replacement on the LLNL deficiency list. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building and HVAC unit. Due to the magnitude of the potential energy savings, this measure should be considered as the new generation IDEC systems become commercially available. (7) Super T- 8 's. Savings estimates for this measure were applied to all buildings in the study, assuming that the new generation lamps will be rotated in during normal lamp replacement operations. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building. (8) Occupancy sensors. Savings estimates for this measure were applied to buildings surveyed as candidates for occupancy sensors during the Level 1 audits. See the Appendix for a detailed calculation by building.

40|$|The {{mechanisation}} of {{the dairy}} industry in New South Wales has proceeded gradually {{over the past}} fifty years; however, {{the rate of increase}} in the use of mechanised equipment during that period has been far from uniform. The introduction of milking machines {{at the turn of the}} century resulted in the first significant use of machinery in the dairy industry. Prior to 1900 the quantity and value of machinery on dairy farms was almost negligible, but by 1920 dairy machinery was valued at almost Â£ 1 million, the value having doubled between 1900 and 1910, while between 1910 and 1920 it almost doubled again. Nevertheless, during the twenties the use of machinery did not continue to expand at such a rapid rate as during the years prior to 1920, and with the onset of the depression of the early thirties there was a distinct falling off in new machinery purchases by dairy farmers. In some years of the early and mid-thirties the total value of machinery on dairy farms showed a fall, largely due, no doubt. to the fact that <b>normal</b> <b>replacements</b> were not being made owing to the depressed state of the industry. However, with the outbreak of World War II another period of rapid mechanised expansion began, and still continues. While milk and butter prices remain high and dairy farmers continue to enjoy the present relatively prosperous conditions it is likely that the use of machinery will continue to expand at a rapid rate. The two periods of rapidly increasing mechanisation differ, however, in at least one important respect. In the early part of the century the increased use of machinery was due primarily to the introduction of the milking machine. The present period of expansion is due in part to a further significant increase in the use of milking machines, and again this is the main factor, but also to a significant, and economically important, increase in the use of tractors by coastal dairy farmers. Prior to World War II the ownership of a tractor by the dairy farmer was rare; to-day it has become relatively common. Livestock Production/Industries, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

The {{progress of the}} reaction was analyzed in quenched samples by immunoassay and immunoblotting for fibrinopeptide A (FPA), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), factor V activation, and osteonectin. In hemophilia A blood (factor VIII:C < 1 %) treated with 25 pmol/L TF, clotting was significantly delayed versus <b>normal,</b> whereas <b>replacement</b> with recombinant factor VIII (1 U/mL) restored the clot time near normal values. Fibrinopeptide A release was slower {{over the course of}} the experiment than in normal blood or hemophilic blood with factor VIII replaced, but significant release was observed by the end of the experiment. Factor V activation was significantly impaired, with both the heavy and light chains presenting more slowly than in the <b>normal</b> or <b>replacement</b> cases. Differences in platelet activation (osteonectin release) between normal and factor VIII-deficient blood were small, with the midpoint of the profiles observed within 1 minute of each other. Thrombin generation during the propagation phase (subsequent to clotting) was greatly impaired in factor VIII deficiency, being depressed to less than 1 / 29 (< 1. 9 nmol TAT/L/min) the rate in normal blood (55 nmol TAT/L/min). Replacement with recombinant factor VIII normalized the rate of TAT generation. Thus, coagulation in hemophilia A blood at 25 pmol/L TF is impaired, with significantly slower thrombin generation than normal during the propagation phase; this reduced thrombin appears to affect FPA production and factor V activation more profoundly than platelet activation. At the same level of TF in factor XI-deficient blood (XI:C < 2 %), only minor differences in clotting or product formation (FPA, osteonectin, and factor Va) were observed. Using reduced levels of initiator (5 pmol/L TF), the reaction was more strongly influenced by factor XI deficiency. Clot formation was delayed from 11. 1 to 15. 7 minutes, which shortened to 9. 7 minutes with factor XI replacement. The maximum thrombin generation rate observed (approximately 37 nmol TAT/L/min) was approximately one third that for normal (110 nmol/L TAT/min) or with factor XI replacement (119 nmol TAT/L/min). FPA release, factor V activation, and release of platelet osteonectin were slower in factor XI-deficient blood than in normal blood. The data demonstrate that factor XI deficiency results in significantly delayed clot formation only at sufficiently low TF concentrations. However, even at these low TF concentrations, significant thrombin is generated in the propagation phase after formation of the initial clot in hemophilia C bloo...|$|R

40|$|Aboveground {{competition}} is often argued {{to be the}} main process determining patterns of natural forest regeneration. However, the theory of multiple resource limitation suggests that seedling performance also depends on belowground competition and, thus, that their relative influence is of fundamental importance. Two approaches were used to address the relative importance of above- and below-ground competition on regeneration in a nutrient-poor pine (Pinus sylvestris) boreal forest. Firstly, seedling establishment beneath trees stem-girdled 12 years ago show that a substantial proportion of the seedlings were established within two years after girdling, which corresponds to a time when nutrient uptake by tree roots was severely reduced without disrupting water transport to the tree canopy, which consequently was maintained. The establishment during these two years also corresponds to abundances high enough for <b>normal</b> stand <b>replacement.</b> Secondly, surveys of regeneration within forest gaps showed that surrounding forests depressed seedlings, so that satisfactory growth occurred only more than 5 m from forest edges and that higher solar radiation in south facing edges was not enough to mediate these effects.

40|$|Biological tissues operate through {{cells that}} act {{together}} within signaling networks. These assure coordinated cell {{function in the}} face of constant exposure to an array of potentially toxic agents, ex-ternally from the environment and endogenously from metabolism. Living tissues are indeed complex adaptive systems. To examine tissue effects specific for low-dose radiation, (1) absorbed dose in tissue is replaced by the sum of the energies deposited by each track event, or hit, in a cell-equivalent tissue micromass (1 ng) in all micromasses exposed, that is, by the mean energy delivered by all microdose hits in the exposed micromasses, with cell dose expressing the total energy per micromass from multiple microdoses; and (2) tissue effects are related to cell damage and protective cellular responses per average microdose hit from a given radiation quality for all such hits in the exposed micromasses. The probability of immediate DNA damage per low-linear-energy-transfer (LET) average micro-dose hit is extremely small, increasing over a certain dose range in proportion to the number of hits. Delayed temporary adaptive protection (AP) involves (a) induced detoxification of reactive oxygen species, (b) enhanced rate of DNA repair, (c) induced removal of damaged cells by apoptosis followed by <b>normal</b> cell <b>replacement</b> and by cell differentiation, and (d) stimulated immune response, al...|$|R
40|$|Two {{rare cases}} of {{pheochromocytoma}} were reported. Case 1 was 39 -year-old housewife who was referred for history of high fever with left hypochondralgia {{twice in the}} previous 15 months before coming to our department. The patient had neither {{elevation of blood pressure}} nor that of central and peripheral venous catecholamine concentration. A left suprarenal mass was found in CT, which was suggested to be a cyst due to the numerical value between 23 - 24. Further ultrasonographic study indicated a solid tumor. Left adrenalectomy was done. Histologically, some of the viable atypical adrenal cells were found in the capsulating tissue contained the necrotic material which was almost occupying the entire mass. Case 2 was a 64 -year-old female with hypertension who was admitted for further examination. On the hospital course, the blood pressure returned to normal without medication. Circulating blood volume was extremely reduced (below 1 / 2 of <b>normal),</b> the <b>replacement</b> of which raised the blood pressure to cause hypertension. An angiographic study indicated only a right adrenal mass, whereas left adrenal venous catecholamine concentration was significantly higher than that of the right side. After confirming right adrenal with no other disorders by CT scan, right adrenalectomy was carried out. Intraoperative correction of hypertension has been sustained and cardiovascular symptoms have disappeared...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Lobsters have {{numerous}} adaptive specializations of the {{olfactory system}} {{that make them}} especially suitable model organisms {{for the study of}} olfaction. Recent work using genomics and physiological genomics to study the lobster olfactory organ extends the advantages of their use further. A subtracted cDNA library from the mature zone of the olfactory organ and 3 physiological genomics experiments have helped identify numerous functionally interesting genes. These include specific markers of 3 cell types that previously could be discriminated only in anatomical sections, plus a marker of reactive epithelial cells at sites of cellular proliferation for both the <b>normal</b> ongoing <b>replacement</b> of olfactory tissue and the regeneration of damaged olfactory tissue. The approaches were instrumental in the discovery of a new exocrine gland, the aesthetasc tegumental gland, which is linked to grooming and the prevention of fouling of the olfactory aesthetasc setae. They also suggest a previously unknown endocrine or paracrine function performed by auxiliary cells of the olfactory aesthetasc sensory units. Other discoveries include candidates for gene products involved in olfactory transduction, presynaptic modulation of olfactory neuron axons by ionotropic receptors, and neuromodulation of both the olfactory sensory neurons and the interneurons in the olfactory lobe of the brain...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis {{patterns}} of myosin heavy- and light-chain isoforms, tropomyosin and troponin, {{have been studied}} in chicken fast muscle denervated at both neonatal and adult stages. Denervated neonatal muscle does not synthesize the adult myosin heavy-chain isoform {{at the time of}} denervation, but it does synthesize the adult isoform several months after denervation. Thus, innervation {{does not appear to be}} necessary for the <b>normal</b> sequential <b>replacement</b> of embryonic and neonatal myosin heavy chain by the adult variant. Nerve is required, however, for the regulation of tropomyosin and troponin expression. Normally the pectoralis major muscle represses synthesis of both beta-tropomyosin and leg-type troponin T during late embryonic development. After denervation, however, the muscle relaxes its ongoing repression of these proteins and significant amounts of both beta-tropomyosin and leg-type troponin T are synthesized by the muscle. Denervation also results in an altered pattern of myosin light-chain synthesis so that the ratio of fast light-chain 3 /fast light-chain 1 decreases. Similar results are found in muscle denervated at the adult stage. In denervated muscle, therefore, synthesis of these myofibrillar proteins is not coordinated: ongoing isoform shifts proceed to express an adult pattern of myosin heavy chain while tropomyosin, troponin, and myosin light-chain patterns appear to revert to embryonic configurations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Suboptimal {{thyroid hormone}} {{replacement}} may carry harmful health consequences. AIMS: Our objectives were {{to determine the}} prevalence and factors associated with inadequate replacement in patients receiving treatment with levothyroxine. DESIGN: Retrospective general practice audit. METHODS: We identified levothyroxine users through electronic searches of primary care records in all 11 practices within a county borough. The adequacy of thyroid hormone replacement was determined from the current serum, serum thyrotropin (TSH) as: (i) adequate <b>replacement</b> (<b>normal</b> TSH; 0. 4 - 4. 0 [*]mU/l); (ii) over replacement (low TSH; 4. 0 [*]mU/l). RESULTS: Out of a registered patient population of 58 567, we identified 1037 patients who were first included in the hypothyroidism disease register between January 2004 and December 2009 (mean age 62. 4 [*]±[*] 15. 9 years; female 85. 9...|$|R
