40|$|An {{extensive}} characterization {{was carried}} out on various biomass samples representative of the diversity in France, including forestry samples (softwood and hardwood woodchips, eucalyptus and poplar short rotation coppices), very short rotation coppices (VSRC) samples and agricultural samples (wheat straw, triticale, fescue, miscanthus and switchgrass). The following properties were measured to evaluate suitability with thermochemical process: elemental analysis (C, H, O, N, S, and Cl), chemical composition (extractives, lignin, mono/polysaccharides, acetate groups), ash content and inorganic composition. Carbon and hydrogen contents are quite similar between biomasses. Agricultural biomasses are usually less oxygenated than forestry biomasses. Nitrogen content is generally higher for agricultural biomasses (up to 1. 4 %) than for forestry biomasses, but important amount {{is also found in}} VSRC (0. 8 % for poplar). Chlorine and sulfur are species-dependent. Fescue and eucalyptus show high values of Cl, while wheat straw has the highest sulfur content. Ash content is very low for forestry and perennial biomasses (miscanthus and switchgrass). For <b>non-perennial</b> <b>crops,</b> values up to 8. 5 % (wheat straw) were measured. Agricultural biomasses contains more silicon (2 % for triticale), magnesium (0. 16 % for fescue), potassium (1. 9 % for fescue) and phosphorus (0. 18 % for fescue), while forestry biomasses are richer in calcium (up to 0. 97 % for poplar VSRC). Other inorganic elements, especially heavy metals are present in very low concentrations {{and most of the time}} below detection limits. Regarding chemical composition, extractive content is very high (20 – 25 %) for <b>non-perennial</b> <b>crops</b> (fescue, wheat straw and triticale) and eucalyptus VSRC. Lignin content seems to be higher for forestry biomasses (21 – 29 %) than for agricultural biomasses (16 – 23 %). The same trend was observed for cellulose, while the opposite was observed for hemicelluloses. These differences in organic and inorganic composition are expected to significantly impact the behavior of these biomasses in thermochemical processes such as gasification for biofuels production.

40|$|Is {{shifting}} cultivation (slash-and-burn) just inefficient, and destructive {{of the soil}} and local biodiversity? Or does it offer promising models? For thousands of years, {{shifting cultivation}} has fed many, {{and it continues to}} support the livelihoods of 300 million people worldwide. And that is a conservative estimate. It can be defined in numerous ways but it is best described as a practice whereby farmers clear a patch of forest or savanna, often using fire to release the nutrients for growing crops, and then alternate periods of cultivation with periods of fallow, during which the forest and soil fertility are allowed to be restored, while the farmers shift to a new patch. Besides having many names, milpa in Belize, swidden on Niue or chitemene in southern and central Africa this way of farming has many faces, which for a long time were not recognised but lumped together. The general belief has been that in cases of low population densities and abundant forests, the periods of fallow were long enough to make this method of farming sustainable. Steady population growth during the twentieth century was assumed to have increased the pressure on the forest, unacceptably shortening fallow periods. This also led to soil depletion and shrinking forests and forced farmers to move to more marginal lands. Combine this with agriculture being modernised and intensified, and needing to meet growing demands for food, and it seems not so strange that shifting cultivation was denounced as irrational and destructive. This has certainly been true in part but research in the 1990 s found that it might be a pity to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Limiting their shifts The lessons were not slow in coming. The Alternatives to Slash-and-Burn Programme, coordinated by the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF), was established in 1992 on the basis of assumptions similar to those described above. They did not entirely hold true. Case studies around the world indicated that although more than 15 million ha of tropical moist forests disappeared each year due to slash-and-burn farming, only 17 % of the shifting cultivators cleared actual primary forest and an even smaller percentage eventually brought about a permanent treeless form of land use. Increased deforestation {{is more likely to be}} the result of civil war, drought, market mechanisms and government policies than of slash-and-burn. For instance, changes from communal to private ownership of land is giving way to loggers, miners, plantation farmers and cattle ranchers, at the same time literally stopping the shifting cultivators in their tracks. This applies less to central Africa, where deforestation in the forest fringes of the Congo basin is indeed largely caused by smallholder agriculture. Yet there are other reasons for farmers to abandon shifting cultivation and to adopt a sedentary way of farming: the vicinity of markets, schools and infrastructure also encourages people to settle. Low yielding but stable No two farmers are the same, and shifting cultivation is not one uniform way of farming. The Overseas Development Institute, a UK based research body, points out that indigenous communities, who often live in remote areas, have developed their way of farming over generations and apply long fallow periods and complex farm management practices. Each decision is carefully taken on the basis of sound agronomic criteria, resulting in a low yielding but stable and sustainable food production. On the other hand there are the new settlers, often nearer to urban areas, who focus on short-term gains from cash crops, use short fallow periods until the soil is depleted, or just move on and on. In between these two extremes, there isa continuum of farming men and women who shift part of their operations once in a while but return later. In forests, which can sustain the existing population of shifting cultivators, the practice even contributes positively to the system s biodiversity. In these cases it is crucial that the mosaic of patches in different stages of fallow, forest cover and cultivation does not get too fragmented and threaten any of the natural tree species in their survival. Where the shifting cycle cannot be maintained, a conversion to sedentary agro-forestry cultivation systems can be an option too. The central issue here is to maintain soil fertility more effectively. In recent years a whole spectrum of viable alternatives to expensive chemical fertilisers has become available. For instance improved fallow techniques which enrich the natural fallow vegetation through the planting of nitrogen-fixing and multipurpose trees to improve soil productivity. Applying manure from livestock, green manuring, mulching, planting cover crops for inter-cropping and alley farming are other examples. Agroforestry systems can be good alternatives too, such as multi-storey cultivation, systems that allow natural tree species to rejuvenate alongside annual crops and economic trees. It would not harm to lend an ear to the traditional shifting cultivators themselves or, as Paul Sillitoe of the University of Durham in England argues, to combine anthropological research with soil science. His work explained how the Wola of Papua New Guinea have developed their own sustainable system while avoiding their traditionally long fallow periods. They grow <b>non-perennial</b> <b>crops</b> semi-permanently by incorporating compost from grassy fallows into soil mounds, with sweet potato as a staple crop. Where there s a will, there s a way.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+CARE+AGFInternational audienceCombustion {{characteristics}} of two woody crops (BP (black spruce and Pinus banksiana mixtures) and W (willow)) and three herbaceous <b>non-perennial</b> energy <b>crops</b> (CR (common reed), RP (reed phalaris) and S (switchgrass)) were studied {{by means of}} TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) coupled with MS (mass spectrometry). The combustion process of these biomasses {{is divided into two}} stages: devolatilization and char oxidation. TGA data showed that sample BP had the best ignition characteristics (burnout temperature of 507 degrees C). However, DSC analysis demonstrated that samples W and RP released a higher amount of combustion heat (> 8 kJ/g). Kinetics was evaluated assuming single separate reactions for each combustion stage using PMSM (pseudo multi-component separate-stage models). The process was successfully modeled obtaining the maximum error of +/- 3. 35 % for the sample S. CO, CO 2 and H 2 O were the main components obtained during the combustion process. Nitrogen compounds (NO, NO 2 and HCN) were found in higher proportions that sulfur compounds (SO and SO 2). Nitrogen compounds were released in both combustion stages, whereas sulfur compounds evolved mainly in the low temperature range. Other pollutants were found in lower concentrations (CH 3 Cl and C 6 H 6). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
