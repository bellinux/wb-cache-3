50|$|<b>Network</b> <b>analyzers</b> {{are used}} mostly at high frequencies; {{operating}} frequencies {{can range from}} 5 Hz to 1.05 THz. Special types of <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> can also cover lower frequency ranges down to 1 Hz. These <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> {{can be used for}} example for the stability analysis of open loops or for the measurement of audio and ultrasonic components.|$|R
5000|$|From 1929 to {{the late}} 1960s, large {{alternating}} current power systems were modelled and studied on AC <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> (also called alternating current network calculators or AC calculating boards) or transient <b>network</b> <b>analyzers.</b> These special-purpose analog computers were {{an outgrowth of the}} DC calculating boards used in the very earliest power system analysis. By the middle of the 1950s, fifty <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> were in operation. AC <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> were much used for power flow studies, short circuit calculations, and system stability studies, but were ultimately replaced by numerical solutions running on digital computers. While the analyzers could provide real-time simulation of events, with no concerns about numeric stability of algorithms, the analyzers were costly, inflexible, and limited in the number of buses and lines that could be simulated. [...] Eventually powerful digital computers replaced analog <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> for practical calculations, but analog physical models for studying electrical transients are still in use.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} calibration {{that can}} be performed on a <b>network</b> <b>analyzer</b> is a transmission measurement. This gives no phase information, and so gives similar data to a scalar <b>network</b> <b>analyzer.</b> The simplest calibration {{that can be}} performed on a <b>network</b> <b>analyzer,</b> whilst providing phase information is a 1-port calibration (S11 or S22, but not both). This accounts for the three systematic errors which appear in 1-port reflectivity measurements: ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{category}} of <b>network</b> <b>analyzer</b> is the microwave transition analyzer (MTA) or large signal <b>network</b> <b>analyzer</b> (LSNA), which measure both amplitude and {{phase of the}} fundamental and harmonics. The MTA was commercialized before the LSNA, but was lacking some of the user-friendly calibration features now available with the LSNA.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1929, AC <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> were {{constructed}} to solve calculation {{problems related to}} electrical power systems that were too large to solve with numerical methods at the time. These were essentially scale models of the electrical properties of the full-size system. Since <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> could handle problems too large for analytic methods or hand computation, they were also used to solve problems in nuclear physics and {{in the design of}} structures. More than 50 large <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> were built {{by the end of the}} 1950s.|$|R

40|$|A new {{error model}} for a special class of {{multiport}} vector <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> (VNAs) is presented in this paper. This model {{can be applied to}} multiport <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> with noncomplete reflectometers, i. e., when the measurement of the incident waves at each port is not always available. The method used to compute the error coefficients proposed here is based on a compact and easy formulation. This method is an extension of the already existing general theory for complete reflectometer multiport <b>network</b> <b>analyzers.</b> Furthermore, the new error model generalizes the theory for three-sampler two-port VNAs. The proposed model has been tested against the complete reflectometer one and exhibits the same accuracy leve...|$|R

50|$|Once digital {{computers}} {{of adequate}} performance became available, the solution methods developed on analog <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> were {{migrated to the}} digital realm, where plugboards, switches and meter pointers were replaced with punch cards and printouts. The same general-purpose digital computer hardware that ran network studies could easily be dual-tasked with business functions such as payroll. Analog <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> faded from general use for load-flow and fault studies, although some persisted in transient studies for a while longer. Analog analyzers were dismantled and either sold off to other utilities, donated to engineering schools, or scrapped.|$|R

50|$|By 1947, {{fourteen}} <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> {{had been}} built at a total cost of about two million US dollars. General Electric built two full-scale <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> for its own work and for services to its clients. Westinghouse built systems for their internal use and provided more than 20 analyzers to utility and university clients. After the Second World War analyzers {{were known to be}} in use in France, the UK, Australia, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Later models had improvements such as centralized control of switching, central measurement bays, and chart recorders to automatically provide permanent records of results.|$|R

With the levels of processing that are available today, some very sophisticated solutions are available in RF <b>network</b> <b>analyzers.</b> Here the reflection and transmission data is formatted to enable the information to be interpreted as easily as possible. Most RF <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> incorporate features including linear and logarithmic sweeps, linear and log formats, polar plots, Smith charts, etc. Trace markers, limit lines and also pass / fail criteria may also be added in many instances.|$|R
