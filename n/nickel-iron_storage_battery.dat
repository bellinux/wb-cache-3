In 1899 {{he invented}} the <b>nickel-iron</b> electric <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> (NiFe), the nickel-cadmium battery (NiCd) and the rechargeable alkaline silver-cadmium battery (AgCd). As an inventor he also fabricated a fire alarm based on different dilutions of metals. Worked on the electrolytic production of sodium carbonate. And patented a rock drilling device.|$|R
