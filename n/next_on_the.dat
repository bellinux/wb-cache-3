5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of {{a plan for the}} company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. <b>Next</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.|$|E

5|$|Cancellara {{earned his}} first victory in 2004 at the Tour of Qatar. Cancellara won the race's fourth stage after attacking {{in the final}} {{kilometers}} of the race and then out-sprinting the riders {{who were able to}} keep pace with him to win the stage. His next victory came in the first stage of the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, where he won the opening stage's bunch sprint. Up <b>next</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> calendar for Cancellara was the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara crossed the line in 42nd place, just a little over two minutes after the winner Steffen Wesemann. The next weekend, he raced the Paris–Roubaix for the second time. Cancellara showed great form during the race and {{was a member of the}} four man group that was first to reach the finish line. He lost the sprint to the line and crossed the line in fourth. Cancellara's next success came in the Tour de Luxembourg, where he won the stage four individual time trial by fourteen seconds over the second-place finisher. He then went on to win his second Swiss National Time Trial Championship in late June. Cancellara's next success came at the Tour de France. He won the prologue around the Belgian city of Liege and took the first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Cancellara lost the lead after the second stage to Thor Hushovd. Cancellara did participate in both the time trial and road race at the Road World Championships. Cancellara performed well in the time trial and came in eighth place; he finished over two minutes behind the winner. He entered the men's road race four days later, but did not finish the course.|$|E
5|$|UConn {{started the}} season strong, winning their first five games. The Huskies easily won their first game 35–3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) {{opponent}} Hofstra. The second game, at Temple, was played as {{the remnants of}} Hurricane Hanna hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12–9 in overtime as Donald Brown ran for a then-career high 214yards and scored the game-winning touchdown. Connecticut next avenged their loss to Virginia from 2007, winning the rematch 45–10. Baylor was <b>next</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> schedule; the Huskies pulled out the win in a back-and-forth game, 31–28. Connecticut opened Big East conference play in their next game against Louisville. The game was not decided until UConn linebacker Lawrence Wilson returned an interception for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Huskies a 26–21 lead they would not relinquish. This was the second straight season where Connecticut won their first five games; before 2007, they had not opened a season so successfully since 1995, when they won their first six straight. Following the game, UConn achieved their first and only ranking of the year, appearing at No.24 in the Associated Press (AP) and Harris polls and No.23 in the Coaches' poll. However, starting quarterback Tyler Lorenzen broke his foot in the Louisville game; the Huskies {{would be forced to}} rely on backup Zach Frazer for the next few games.|$|E

Harrison arrived 21 July and lent fire support to Marines ashore in addition to patrolling the transport areas. This operation not only constituted a break in Japan's inner ring of defenses, but dealt a death blow to the Empire's naval air arm at the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Harrison sailed back to Espiritu Santo via Eniwetok 16 August.|$|E
25|$|The first ship {{to arrive}} on the scene was the small Coast Guard Patrol Boat USS CG-218, which found a {{lifeboat}} holding three survivors and three bodies; the survivors {{reported that they had}} dived overboard and swum to the boat. <b>Next</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene was the Coast Guard cutter , which had heard the gunfire and arrived just fifteen minutes later. The Legare found a second lifeboat with a body aboard; the boat was discovered to have been riddled by gunfire, and lent strength to the widespread belief at the time that U-boats were deliberately murdering the survivors of ships they had sunk. The Legare landed the three survivors and four bodies at Chincoteague Island Coastguard Station, then returned to sea to search further.|$|E

25|$|The English {{retained}} a fort they had established at Langholm in the Scottish borders. Unable to secure its return by diplomatic leverage, Regent Arran reduced it by force on 17 July 1547 following an unsuccessful attempt in June. At the same time, a French naval force took St Andrews Castle from the Castilians. On 24 July Arran ordered seven signal beacons {{to be prepared}} to warn of an expected English invasion by sea. The first was at St Abb's Head, the second at Dowhill near Fast Castle, <b>next</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Doun Law near Spott, North Berwick Law, 'Dounprenderlaw', at Arthur's Seat or Edinburgh Castle, and at 'Binning's Craig' near Linlithgow. The keepers of these 'bailes' were instructed to have horsemen ready to carry news of the invasion to the next beacon if it came in day-light. The towns of Lothian, the borders and Forth valley were ordered to ensure that all men between sixty and sixteen living in sight of the beacons were ready to respond to the signal.|$|E
25|$|John Roth and Sophie Maisnier-Patin {{reviewed}} the approaches {{in both the}} Lenski team's delayed mutations and the Van Hofweges team's rapid mutations on E. coli. They argue that both teams experienced the same sequence of potentiation, actualization, and refinement leading up to similar Cit+ variants. According to them, the period of {{less than a day}} during which citrate usage would be under selection, followed by 100-fold dilution, and a period of growth on glucose that would not select for citrate use, ultimately lowered the probability of E. coli being able accumulate early adaptive mutations from one period of selection to the <b>next.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, Van Hofwegen's team allowed for a continuous selection period of 7 days, which yielded a more rapid development of citrate-using E. coli. Roth and Maisnier-Patin suggest that the serial dilution of E. coli and short period of selection for citrate-use under the conditions of the LTEE perpetually impeded each generation of E. coli from reaching the next stages of aerobic citrate utilization.|$|E
25|$|The {{concert was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} held at San Jose State University's practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead were told the city of San Jose was not in the mood for another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was <b>next</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list. However, a previously scheduled Chicago Bears–San Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the Sears Point Raceway. However, a dispute with Sears Point's owner, Filmways, Inc., arose over a $300,000 up-front cash deposit from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway was chosen at the suggestion of its then-owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was switched on the night of Thursday, December 4.|$|E
