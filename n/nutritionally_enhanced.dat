The goal of environmental enrichment is to stimulate captive animals to exhibit similar foraging behavior of their wild counterparts, e. g. to extend foraging time. We conducted a 12 -month study on the foraging behavior of Japanese macaques in a semi-naturally forested enclosure to understand how they use both provisioned foods and naturally available plant foods and what are the nutritional criteria of their consumption of natural plants. We recorded time spent feeding on provisioned and natural plant foods and collected the plant parts ingested of their major plant food species monthly, when available. We conducted nutritional analysis (crude protein, crude lipid, neutral detergent fiber-‘NDF’, ash) and calculated total non-structural carbohydrate – ‘TNC’ and total energy of those food items. Monkeys spent 47 % of their feeding time foraging on natural plant species. The consumption of plant parts varied significantly across seasons. We found that leaf items were consumed in months when crude protein, crude protein-to-NDF ratio, TNC and total energy were significantly higher and NDF was significantly lower, fruit/nut items in months when crude protein and TNC were significantly higher and crude lipid content was significantly lower, and bark items in months when TNC and total energy were higher and crude lipid content was lower. This preliminary investigation showed that the forested enclosure allowed troop members to more fully express their species typical flexible behavior by challenging them to adjust their foraging behavior to seasonal changes of plant item diversity and nutritional content, also providing the possibility for individuals to <b>nutritionally</b> <b>enhance</b> their diet [Current Zoology 56 (2) : 198 – 208, 2010]...|$|R

40|$|The Brazil nut is {{the seed}} of the Bertholletia excelsa tree and grows in the Amazon basin. Over the {{years there has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of individuals describing allergic symptoms following ingestion of Brazil nuts. The reason for this increased prevalence is not known though some researchers attribute this to an increased exposure to these nuts. Brazil nuts have one of the highest naturally occurring concentrations of selenium and some people ingest them for health reasons associated with this mineral. ^ The Brazil nut 2 S albumin has a high content of sulfur containing amino acids, which makes it attractive as a source to <b>nutritionally</b> <b>enhance</b> plants deficient in these amino acids. ^ Brazil nut 2 S albumin, Ber e 1, is the major allergen of Brazil nuts. To characterize Ber e 1, overlapping recombinant proteins were expressed in E coli and five linear IgE epitopes were mapped to the large subunit of the Brazil nut 2 S Albumin using sera from 6 Brazil nut allergic subjects. The overall pattern of IgE recognition of the epitopes amongst the different subjects was polymorphic. Out of these five epitopes, Epitope 3 was recognized in 3 out of 6, of the subjects suggesting it to be immunodominant. While all five epitopes appear to be linear, we cannot eliminate the existence of conformational epitopes as 2 subjects recognized the full-length recombinant protein with IgE immunoblotting but failed to recognize smaller segments of the protein. ^ With the aim of better defining epitope 3 and generating hypoallergenic variants of Ber e 1, each amino acid in this epitope was mutated to encode an alanine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Fourteen mutants were generated and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild type and mutant plasmids were then directionally cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector, pRSET that encodes an N-terminal 6 X HIS tag. Proteins from the wild type and mutants were expressed and purified by metal-affinity chromatography on a nickel resin column via the HIS tag. IgE binding assays were performed on the purified proteins with sera from 2 Brazil nut allergic subjects that had previously recognized epitope 3. Attenuated IgE binding was established with a number of the mutants. While the two subjects had 4 amino acid residues in common that were sensitive to the modifications, the overall pattern of recognition of the individual amino acids in this single epitope is polymorphic. This is interesting as it suggests that even within a single epitope, of Ber e 1, the pattern of IgE binding varies amongst the different patients. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{achievement}} of sustainable feeding practices in aquaculture {{by reducing the}} reliance on wild-captured fish, via replacement of fish-based feed with plant-based feed, is impeded by the poor growth response seen in fish fed high levels of plant ingredients. Our recent strategy to nutritionally program rainbow trout by early short-term exposure to a plant-based (V) diet versus a control fish-based (M) diet at the first-feeding fry stage when the trout fry start to consume exogenous feed, resulted in remarkable improvements in feed intake, growth and feed utilization when the same fish were challenged with the diet V (V-challenge) at the juvenile stage, several months following initial exposure. We employed microarray expression analysis at the first-feeding and juvenile stages to deduce the mechanisms associated with the nutritional programming of plant-based feed acceptance in trout. Results: Transcriptomic analysis was performed on rainbow trout whole fry after 3 weeks exposure to either diet V or diet M at the first feeding stage (3 -week), and in the whole brain and liver of juvenile trout after a 25 day V-challenge, using a rainbow trout custom oligonucleotide microarray. Overall, 1787 (3 -week + Brain) and 924 (3 -week + Liver) mRNA probes were affected by the early-feeding exposure. Gene ontology and pathway analysis of the corresponding genes revealed that nutritional programming affects pathways of sensory perception, synaptic transmission, cognitive processes and neuroendocrine peptides in the brain; whereas in the liver, pathways mediating intermediary metabolism, xenobiotic metabolism, proteolysis, and cytoskeletal regulation of cell cycle are affected. These {{results suggest that the}} <b>nutritionally</b> programmed <b>enhanced</b> acceptance of a plant-based feed in rainbow trout is driven by probable acquisition of flavour and feed preferences, and reduced sensitivity to changes in hepatic metabolic and stress pathways. Conclusions: This study outlines the molecular mechanisms in trout brain and liver that accompany the nutritional programming of plant-based diet acceptance in trout, reinforces the notion of the first-feeding stage in oviparous fish as a critical window for nutritional programming, and provides support for utilizing this strategy to achieve improvements in sustainability of feeding practices in aquaculture...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} nutritious, safe, and healthy food {{because of a}} growing population, and the pledge to {{maintain}} biodiversity and other resources, pose a major challenge to agriculture that is already threatened by a changing climate.

Cultivar diversity and nutritional quality are crucial.

40|$|Molecular {{farming is}} defined as the {{production}} of proteins or other metabolites valuable to medicine or industry in plants traditionally used in an agricultural setting. Crop plants can synthesize a wide variety of proteins that are free of mammalian toxins and pathogens. Crop plants produce large amounts of biomass at low cost and require limited facilities. Since plants have long been used as a source of medicinal compounds, molecular farming represents a novel source of molecular medicines, such as plasma proteins, enzymes, growth factors, vaccines and recombinant antibodies, whose medical applications are understood at a molecular level. Bio-pharming promises more plentiful and cheaper supplies of pharmaceutical drugs, including vaccines for infectious diseases and therapeutic proteins for treatment of such things as cancer and heart disease. “Plant-made pharmaceuticals ” (PMPs) are produced by genetically engineering plants to produce specific compounds, generally proteins, which are extracted and purified after harvest.
