5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided that <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, and a second trial might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E
5|$|His dispositions for {{the battle}} are {{described}} as a clear mistake leaving the right far too strong and the left much too weak. Only the fact that Bagration and Barclay were to cooperate fully saved the Russian army and did much to mitigate the bad positioning. <b>Nothing</b> <b>would</b> be more damning than 300 artillery pieces standing silent on the Russian right.|$|E
5|$|Jim avidly {{read the}} Liverpool Echo or Express, liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His {{attitude}} to life {{was based upon}} self-respect, perseverance, fairness and a strong work ethic. His political views were far from left-wing, as he insisted {{that there was nothing}} anyone could do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, and <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> ever change.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to continually retain or return gifted experts (Experten) to front line battle proved extremely costly, {{resulting in the}} death in combat {{of many of the}} earlier experts and aces. This, coupled with the acute shortage of well trained pilots and the fact that by 1943 they were facing a better equipped and well-trained enemy, meant the life expectancy of even the most gifted was tragically short. Author John Weal says that, although other Geschwaderkommodore would end up dying in combat, <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> showcase the changing fortunes of Luftwaffe fighter forces than the death of Walter Oesau.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the peace {{agreement}} were {{that no one would}} be enslaved, no harm would be done to the temples, <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> be taken as booty and that safe passage was given to Thomas, Harbees, and every citizen of Damascus who was not willing to live under Muslim rule. The peace agreement also stated that the peace would end after three days and that the Muslims could attack after these three days without violating the agreement.|$|E
5|$|Despite the support, {{the state}} caved {{to some of}} the {{complaints}} of the opposition, resulting in a delay of the project. By November1963, the state told Caroline officials that the design of bridges along NY330 required changing to new state highway standards. The state began working also on assessing property values of the land required for the new position. They stated that unless the state budget could not afford it, the project would begin the process in 1964. Patience ran thin by February1964 with the Caroline town officials, who demanded progress from the state, who stated that the project could not move forward until there was funding. By November1964, the state admitted <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> happen until at least 1965, two years behind schedule. This time, the construction would be delayed due to delays in acquiring land and personnel.|$|E

5|$|The 1968 Liberty Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 14, 1968. As in the Hokies' {{previous}} {{appearance in the}} Liberty Bowl, Virginia Tech {{got off to a}} fast start. On the game's second play, Tech ran 58yards for a touchdown, courtesy of a trick play. After Mississippi fumbled, Tech recovered and scored another quick touchdown. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Tech added a field goal to the two touchdowns it had already earned, making the score 170 at the end of one quarter. From that point onward, however, almost <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> go in Virginia Tech's favor. Tech attempted an onside kick following the field goal, but were unable to successfully recover the ball. With good field position following the kick, Mississippi quarterback Archie Manning orchestrated a 49-yard drive for the Rebels' first points of the game.|$|E
5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting {{to hold back the}} shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} even if the animal were {{conscious}} <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by Cabanis (1802), and was further explicated by Hodgson (1870) and Huxley (1874). Jackson gave a subjective argument for epiphenomenalism, but later refuted it and embraced physicalism.|$|E
25|$|While Obama set a conciliatory {{tone for}} his {{relations}} with Venezuela during his candidacy, saying {{he would be willing}} to meet with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez without preconditions at a July 23, 2007, presidential debate, the Venezuelan leader had been fickle in his opinion of Obama. Even during the election he varied from liking Obama to saying that <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> change with the US.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{injuries}} {{he suffered from}} the car crash, Heatley's season did not start until January 2004 and he appeared in only 31 games. A disappointing season ended with an early elimination {{in the race for}} a playoff spot and 25 points. During {{the last part of the}} season, the Thrashers and the Atlanta community, including Snyder's family, were largely supportive of him, including telling Atlanta prosecutors and the judge that <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> be gained by imprisoning him.|$|E

25|$|On Thursday, May 15, 1969 at 4:30a.m., Governor Reagan sent California Highway Patrol and Berkeley police {{officers}} into People's Park, overriding Chancellor Heyns' May 6 promise that <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> {{be done without}} warning. The officers cleared an 8-block area around the park while a large section {{of what had been}} planted was destroyed and an -tall perimeter chain-link wire fence was installed to keep people out and to prevent the planting of more trees, grass, flowers, or shrubs.|$|E

25|$|In organisms with a {{changeable}} shape, such as amoeboid organisms, most directional {{terms are}} meaningless, since {{the shape of}} the organism is not constant and no distinct axes are fixed. Similarly, in spherically symmetrical organisms, there is nothing to distinguish one line through the centre of the organism from any other. An indefinite number of triads of mutually perpendicular axes could be defined, but any such choice of axes would be useless, as <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> distinguish a chosen triad from any others. In such organisms, only terms such as superficial and deep, or sometimes proximal and distal, are usefully descriptive.|$|E

25|$|According to Polish {{historian}} Piotr Łossowski, {{the method}} used {{in most of the}} attacks was the same. At first, local Poles were assured that <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> happen to them. Then, at dawn, a village was surrounded by armed members of UPA, behind whom were peasants with axes, hammers, knives, and saws. All the Poles encountered were murdered; sometimes they were herded into one spot, to make it easier. After a massacre, all goods were looted, including clothes, grain, and furniture. The final part of an attack was setting fire to the village. In many cases, victims were tortured and their bodies mutilated. All vestiges of Polish existence eradicated with even abandoned Polish settlements burned to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Bund also {{states that}} nothing {{that had taken}} place in the war {{produced}} more controversy than the way in which Rupert treated Birmingham, and that it was certainly harsh, but by the laws of war as understood on the Continent, in the school in which Rupert had been brought up, there was nothing illegal or improper in it. If the owners of a house allowed firing from that house on the soldiers of the other side, the soldiers fired on were justified in destroying that house. Burning has always been one of the recognised means of destruction. Bund says that if Birmingham had been a Continental town <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> ever have been heard of it; but because the Continental laws of war were applied to an English town the outcry was terrible.|$|E
25|$|After The Tracey Ullman Show, Ullman {{went on to}} {{make her}} big screen {{starring}} debut with I Love You To Death in 1990. That same year she hit the stage with actor Morgan Freeman for Shakespeare in the Park's production of The Taming of the Shrew; she then made her Broadway debut with her one-woman show, The Big Love. She had no aspirations {{to return to the}} television. In 1991, she had given birth to her second child, Johnny, and her husband was bidding on a television franchise in the South of England. Along with the bid he included a potential television programming lineup. Listed was a Tracey Ullman special. Ullman thought <b>nothing</b> <b>would</b> come of it, but to her horror, she learnt that the bid was successful.|$|E
