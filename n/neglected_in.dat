40|$|Hemispatial neglect is an {{enabling}} {{disorder that}} is most common after right-sided brain lesions and {{is perceived as a}} heterogeneous syndrome. For example, patients can show <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> different sensory modalities (visual, auditory, e. g.) and at different spatial distances (near and far). According to recent studies, neglect is related to non-lateralized impairments such as deficits in selective attention, sustained attention and spatial working memory. Based on these non-lateralized dysfunctions found <b>in</b> <b>neglect</b> patients, the current study explored whether there would be a difference between neglect patients (n = 59) and stroke patients without neglect (n = 127) on a neuropsychological test battery, containing tests that measured the non-lateralized functions short term memory, working memory, executive functioning (planning, mental flexibility) and (divided) attention. In addition, research shows that the degree of certain non-lateralized impairments correlates with the severity of the hemispatial <b>neglect.</b> <b>In</b> the present study, this was also investigated for the (non-lateralized) domains memory and executive functioning. The final part of the study focused on the association between non-lateralized dysfunctions and hemispatial <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> different regions of space. Because of the dissociation between <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> near- and in far space, the present study investigated whether patients with <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> near space (n= 17) and <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> far space (n = 14) would perform differently on the test battery. The test results reveal that neglect patients do not perform better or worse on the neuropsychological tests included in the test battery compared to the stroke patients without neglect. Moreover, there was no relation between neglect severity and cognitive performance on the domains memory and executive functioning. Finally, the results show there are no differences in cognitive profile between the patients with <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> near space and the patients with <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> far space. It is suggested that the test {{results of the present study}} can be accounted for by the anatomical organization of non-lateralized functions, and its association with the brain sites related to the neglect syndrome...|$|R
5|$|Bayard's Cove Fort, {{also known}} {{historically}} as Berescove or Bearscore Castle, is an English 16th-century artillery blockhouse, built {{to defend the}} harbour entrance at Dartmouth in Devon. Constructed {{in the early part}} of the century, it had eleven gunports for heavy artillery and was intended to engage enemy vessels that broke past the external defences of the Dartmouth and Kingswear castles. It remained armed during the English Civil War, but was <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> the 18th century and used for storage. The fort was restored in the late 19th century and is now managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges taking up the post in 1610, but the castle was <b>neglected.</b> <b>In</b> 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only {{four or five of}} the castle's twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E

Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, the mechanics of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.|$|E

5|$|The general {{first degree}} (for Magister) centred on the {{teaching}} of philosophy, theology and Greek under the conservative Scholasticism which gave prime place {{to the authority of}} Aristotle. Although the trivium was now augmented by the quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music), their coverage was <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> comparison with theology and philosophy and consequently Mercator would have to resort to further study of the first three subjects in years to come. Mercator graduated Magister in 1532.|$|E
5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants {{have often}} been <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> historiography {{is not that they}} were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade. It rather {{originated}} with the way history was written in Byzantium, which was often under the patronage of their competitors, the court, and land aristocracy. The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime violence of the Italians.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's {{works have}} not been {{completely}} <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> recent years. The Herries stories have seldom been out of print, and in 2014 WorldCat listed a dozen recent reissues of Walpole's works, including The Wooden Horse, The Dark Forest, The Secret City, Jeremy, and The Cathedral. In 2011 the BBC broadcast a reappraisal of Walpole, The Walpole Chronicle, presented by Eric Robson. In 2013 a new stage version of Rogue Herries was presented by the Theatre by the Lake company in Walpole's adopted home of Keswick. The BBC speculated that this could mark a revival in interest in his works.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{quantitative}} measure, we analyzed {{the relationship between}} visuospatial and representational <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> right- and left-brain-damaged patients and found signs of representational <b>neglect</b> only <b>in</b> right-brain-damaged patients. Although representational neglect was always associated with visuospatial neglect, suggesting that the two forms share a common underlying mechanism, the most frequent finding in right-brain [...] damaged patients was that of visuospatial <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> isolation. A strong influence of the phenomenon of attentional attraction toward space ipsilateral to the lesion in visuospatial, as opposed to imaginal, tasks can account for this finding...|$|R
40|$|A {{patient with}} a right sided parietal lobe {{infarction}} manifested left sided sensory extinction in the visual, auditory, and tactile modalities but had only mild exploratory-motor <b>neglect.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, another {{patient with a}} right frontal haemorrhage demonstrated only left sided exploratory-motor hemispatial neglect. Tasks that combined perceptual and exploratory features elicited varying degrees of <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> each patient. These two cases with dissociated neglect behaviour lend further evidence for behavioural specialisation within components of a cortical network for directed attention: sensory-representational aspects mediated primarily by the parietal component, motor-exploratory primarily by the frontal component. These cases also highlight the need to include and distinguish among several different measures of <b>neglect</b> <b>in</b> the clinical investigation of patients with hemispatial inattention...|$|R

5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> {{the early stages of}} the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} Polish casualties—or {{according}} to one historian, possibly because of them—the battle has been largely <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> Polish historiography. During {{the period of the}} People's Republic of Poland it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle. However, since the fall of communism modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force. Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk. He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev, but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the NKVD) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero. The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.|$|E

5|$|Despite wide popular interest, Escher was {{for long}} {{somewhat}} <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> the art world; {{even in his}} native Netherlands, he was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. In the twenty-first century, major exhibitions have been held in cities across the world. An exhibition of his work in Rio de Janeiro however attracted more than 573,000 visitors in 2011; its daily visitor count of 9,677 made it the most visited museum exhibition of the year, anywhere in the world. No major exhibition of Escher's work was held in Britain until 2015, when the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art ran one in Edinburgh from June to September 2015, moving in October 2015 to the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London. The exhibition moved to Italy in 2015–2016, attracting over 500,000 visitors in Rome and Bologna, and then Milan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neglected</b> <b>in</b> her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars {{to make the case for}} emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E
5|$|Ina Coolbrith {{was born}} Josephine Donna Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois, {{the last of}} three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith, brother to Joseph Smith Coolbrith's father died of malarial fever four months after her birth, and a sister died one month after that; Coolbrith's mother then married Joseph Smith, in 1842, {{becoming}} his sixth or seventh wife. No children came of the union—Agnes felt <b>neglected</b> <b>in</b> her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of Smith. In June 1844, Smith was killed {{at the hands of}} an anti-Mormon mob. Losing her faith and fearful of her life, Coolbrith's mother left the Latter-day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis, Missouri, where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett. Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train. On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare's works and from a collection of Byron's poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front of the wagon train with the famous African-American scout Jim Beckwourth, riding with him on his horse, through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass. The family settled in Los Angeles, California, and Pickett established a law practice.|$|E
