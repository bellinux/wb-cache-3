60|$|I {{have before}} given my reasons (Sect. II. Chap.

I shall therefore, at present, merely set down a rough catalogue of the effects of light at different hours of the day, which Turner has represented: naming a picture or two, as an example of each, which we will hereafter take up one by one, and consider the physical science and the feeling together. And I do this, in the hope that, in the mean time, some admirer of the old masters will be kind enough to select from the works of any one of them, a series of examples of the same effects, and to give me a reference to the pictures, so that I may be able to compare each with each; for, as my limited knowledge of the works of Claude or Poussin does not supply me with the requisite variety of effect, I shall be grateful for assistance.|$|E
60|$|The true stage-illusion in {{this and}} in all other things consists--not in the mind's judging {{it to be a}} forest, but, in its {{remission}} of the judgment {{that it is not a}} forest. And this subject of stage-illusion is so important, and so many practical errors and false criticisms may arise, and indeed have arisen, either from reasoning on it as actual delusion, (the strange notion, on which the French critics built up their theory, and on which the French poets justify the construction of their tragedies), or from denying it altogether, (which seems the end of Dr. Johnson's reasoning, and which, as extremes meet, would lead to the very same consequences, by excluding whatever would not be judged probable by us in our coolest state of feeling, with all our faculties in even balance), that these few remarks will, I hope, be pardoned, if they should serve either to explain or to illustrate the point. For <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> never absolutely deluded--or any thing like it, but the attempt to cause the highest delusion possible to beings in their senses sitting in a theatre, is a gross fault, incident only to low minds, which, feeling that they cannot affect the heart or head permanently, endeavour to call forth the momentary affections.

Almost all of our species richness and hotspot analyses revealed that mountainous regions of Taiwan hold most of Taiwan's avian biodiversity. Previous studies showed a hump-shaped relationship between avian species richness and Taiwan's elevation gradient, meaning that the highest species richness was found in mid-elevation forests (Koh and Lee 2003; Shiu and Lee 2003; Hsu et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2004; Ding et al. 2005; Koh et al. 2006 b), which is unlike the species richness pattern found on Hainan Island, China in the northwestern South China Sea (Zou et al. 2012).

60|$|Passing {{from these}} simple {{examples}} {{to the more}} complicated relations existing between a manufacturer and his workmen, we are met first by certain curious difficulties, resulting, apparently, from a harder and colder state of moral elements. It {{is easy to imagine}} an enthusiastic affection existing among soldiers for the colonel, not so easy to imagine an enthusiastic affection among cotton-spinners for the proprietor of the mill. A body of men associated for purposes of robbery (as a Highland clan in ancient times) shall be animated by perfect affection, and every member of it be ready to lay down his life for the life of his chief. But a band of men associated for purposes of legal production and accumulation is usually animated, it appears, by no such emotions, and none of them are in anywise willing to give his life for the life of his chief. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> met by this apparent anomaly, in moral matters, but by others connected with it, in administration of system. For a servant or a soldier is engaged at a definite rate of wages, for a definite period; but a workman at a rate of wages variable according to the demand for labour, and with the risk of being at any time thrown out of his situation by chances of trade. Now, as, under these contingencies, no action of the affections can take place, but only an explosive action of disaffections, two points offer themselves for consideration in the matter.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> no less sycophantic {{than the}} people of monarchial countries; we are more so. We grovel before their exalted personages, and perform in {{addition}} a special prostration at the clay feet of our own idols--which they do not revere. The typical [...] "subject," [...] hat-in-hand to his sovereign and his nobleman, is a less shameful figure than the [...] "citizen" [...] executing his genuflexion before the public {{of which he is}} himself a part. No European court journal, no European courtier, was ever more abject in subservience to the sovereign than are the American newspaper and the American politician in flattery of the people. Between the courtier and the demagogue I see nothing to choose. They are moved by the same sentiment and fired by the same hope. Their method is flattery, and their purpose profit. Their adulation is not a testimony to character, but a tribute to power, or the shadow of power. If this country were governed by its criminal idiots we should have the same attestations of their goodness and wisdom, the same competition for their favor, the same solemn doctrine that their voice is the voice of God. Our children would be brought up to believe that an Idiotocracy is the only natural and rational form of government And for my part I'm not at all sure {{that it would not be}} a pretty good political system, as political systems go. I have always, however, cherished a secret faith in Smithocracy, which seems to combine the advantages of both the monarchial and the republican idea. If all the offices were held for life by Smiths--the senior John being President--we should have a settled and orderly succession to allay all fears of anarchy and a sufficiently wide eligibility to feed the fires of patriotic ambition. All could not be Smiths, but many could marry into the family.|$|E
6000|$|All true comradeship has in it {{those three}} {{elements}} which I have remarked {{in the ordinary}} exclamation about the weather. First, it has a sort of broad philosophy like the common sky, emphasizing {{that we are all}} under the same cosmic conditions. We are all in the same boat, the [...] "winged rock" [...] of Mr. Herbert Trench. Secondly, it recognizes this bond as the essential one; for comradeship is simply humanity seen in that one aspect in which men are really equal. The old writers were entirely wise when they talked of the equality of men; but they were also very wise in not mentioning women. Women are always authoritarian; they are always above or below; that is why marriage is a sort of poetical see-saw. There are only three things in the world that women do not understand; and they are Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. But men (a class little understood in the modern world) find these things the breath of their nostrils; and our most learned ladies will not even begin to understand them until they make allowance for this kind of cool camaraderie. Lastly, it contains the third quality of the weather, the insistence upon the body and its indispensable satisfaction. No one has even begun to understand comradeship who does not accept with it a certain hearty eagerness in eating, drinking, or smoking, an uproarious materialism which to many women appears only hoggish. You may call the thing an orgy or a sacrament; it is certainly an essential. It is at root a resistance to the superciliousness of the individual. Nay, its very swaggering and howling are humble. In the heart of its rowdiness there is a sort of mad modesty; a desire to melt the separate soul into the mass of unpretentious masculinity. It is a clamorous confession of the weakness of all flesh. No man must be superior to the things that are common to men. This sort of equality must be bodily and gross and comic. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> all in the same boat, but we are all seasick.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: In {{the world}} of {{research}} the ability to back up theories with relevant data, statistical techniques and results of analysis are vital to advancements in science and a successful career. Through an internship in the Spectrum Research Department, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to develop our statistical skills in a healthcare research setting. CHALLENGE: Currently the biostatistics interns are {{the main source of}} statistical support in the Research Department at Spectrum Health. It is often a daunting task to choose the appropriate technique and effectively communicate this methodology to non-statisticians, especially with limited statistical mentorship on the premises. Other challenges included meticulous organization and time management, as our statistical support extended over six Spectrum Health entities including Butterworth Hospital, Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital, Fred and Lena Meijer Heart Center, Lemmen-Holton Cancer Pavilion, Blodgett Hospital and Zeeland Community Hospital. EXPERIENCE: <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> able to hone and expand our statistical skills, we came to fully understand the magnitude of being statisticians in a medical research setting. We worked independently and as a team to consult on issues of sample size, experimental design, and data collection techniques. Further responsibilities included conducting data analyses, drafting statistical portions of manuscripts, and creating graphical displays for presentations. This internship offered a real-world setting in which to develop our SAS programming, data visualization, and writing skills. OUTCOME: Through this internship <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to enhance our communication skills {{with each other and with}} the entire research teams. We quickly learned effective techniques to explain statistical concepts and methodology to others who are not statistically minded. We received the opportunity to put together statistical designs, sample size and power calculations/analyses, write the statistical portion of papers, and help others narrow down their research questions to something measureable and therefore, obtainable. IMPACT: This experience has prepared us for the real world of statistics in a medical research setting. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> given an amazing opportunity to be a part of revolutionary research, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> supported and encouraged by everyone in the department throughout our journey. The diverse skill set we learned and developed within the Spectrum Health Research Department will carry over into the next chapter of our careers and be forever useful...|$|R

6000|$|It will be {{the same}} if we compare the {{conditions}} that have come about with the Revolution legend touching publicity. The old democratic doctrine was that the more light that was let in to all departments of State, the easier it was for a righteous indignation to move promptly against wrong. In other words, monarchs were to live in glass houses, that mobs might throw stones. Again, no admirer of existing English politics (if there is any admirer of existing English politics) will really pretend that this ideal of publicity is exhausted, or even attempted. Obviously public life grows more private every day. The French have, indeed, continued the tradition of revealing secrets and making scandals; hence they are more flagrant and palpable than we, not in sin but in the confession of sin. The first trial of Dreyfus might have happened in England; it is exactly the second trial that would have been legally impossible. But, indeed, if we wish to realise how far we fall short of the original republican outline, the sharpest way to test it is to note how far we fall short even of the republican element in the older regime. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> less democratic than Danton and Condorcet, but we are in many ways less democratic than Choiseul and Marie Antoinette. The richest nobles before the revolt were needy middle-class people compared with our Rothschilds and Roseberys. And in the matter of publicity the old French monarchy was infinitely more democratic than any of the monarchies of today. Practically anybody who chose could walk into the palace and see the king playing with his children, or paring his nails. The people possessed the monarch, as the people possess Primrose Hill; that is, they cannot move it, but they can sprawl all over it. The old French monarchy was founded on the excellent principle that a cat may look at a king. But nowadays a cat may not look at a king; unless it is a very tame cat. Even where the press is free for criticism it is only used for adulation. The substantial difference comes to something uncommonly like this: Eighteenth century tyranny meant that you could say [...] "The K of Brrd is a profligate." [...] Twentieth century liberty really means that you are allowed to say [...] "The King of Brentford is a model family man." ...|$|E

The highly localized nature of the cytoskeletal and cell surface alterations occurring during A/E lesion formation suggests {{that there should be}} equally localized EPEC-induced signalling events. To analyze further the calcium responses to infection of HEp- 2 cells by EPEC, we employed calcium-imaging fluorescence microscopy, which allows both temporal and spatial measurements of [Ca]i in live cells. Using this imaging technique, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> unable to detect any significant elevation in [Ca]i at sites of A/E EPEC adhesion, but, with several different classical EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains and three different infection procedures, each of which resulted in extensive A/E bacterial adhesion, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> unable to detect any significant alterations in [Ca]i in infected cells compared to uninfected cells. In addition, chelation of intracellular free calcium with bis-(aminophenoxy) -ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) did not, as previously reported, prevent A/E lesion formation.

40|$|Sequence-specific DNA-binding {{proteins}} play a {{key role}} in many fundamental biological processes, such as transcription, DNA replication and recombination. Very often, these DNA-binding proteins introduce structural changes to the target DNA-binding sites including DNA bending, twisting or untwisting and wrapping, which in many cases induce a linking number change (ΔLk) to the DNA-binding site. Due to the lack of a feasible approach, ΔLk induced by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins has not been fully explored. In this paper we successfully constructed a series of DNA plasmids that carry many tandem copies of a DNA-binding site for one sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, such as λ O, LacI, GalR, CRP and AraC. In this case, the protein-induced ΔLk was greatly amplified and can be measured experimentally. Indeed, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> able to simultaneously determine the protein-induced ΔLk and the DNA-binding constant for λ O and GalR, but also we demonstrated that the protein-induced ΔLk is an intrinsic property for these sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the protein-induced ΔLk does not correlate with the protein-induced DNA bending by the DNA-binding proteins...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a calcium {{messenger}} {{that can}} mobilize intracellular Ca 2 + stores and activate Ca 2 + influx to regulate {{a wide range}} of physiological processes. Aplysia cyclase is the first member of the ADP-ribosyl cyclases identified to catalyze the cyclization of NAD + into cADPR. The catalysis involves a two-step reaction, the elimination of the nicotinamide ring and the cyclization of the intermediate resulting in the covalent attachment of the purine ring to the terminal ribose. Aplysia cyclase exhibits a high degree of leniency towards the purine base of its substrate, and the cyclization reaction takes place at either the N 1 - or the N 7 -position of the purine ring. To decipher the mechanism of cyclization in Aplysia cyclase, we used a crystallization setup with multiple Aplysia cyclase molecules present in the asymmetric unit. With the use of natural substrates and analogs, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> able to capture multiple snapshots during enzyme catalysis resulting in either N 1 or N 7 linkage of the purine ring to the terminal ribose, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> also able to observe, for the first time, the cyclized products of both N 1 and N 7 cyclization bound in the active site of Aplysia cyclase. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
