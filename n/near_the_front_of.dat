5|$|Quantula striata is {{the only}} known bioluminescent {{terrestrial}} mollusc. Pulses of light are emitted from a gland <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the foot and may have a communicative function, although the adaptive significance is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|In the Carnian {{stage of}} the Late Triassic (228.0 - 216.5 Mya), capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar Metoposauridae. Metoposaurids are {{distinguished}} from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> their skulls. Another group of stereospondyls, the plagiosaurs, had wide heads with external gills, and adapted to life {{at the bottom of}} lakes and rivers. By this time, temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems. Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which was covered in temperate forests at the time.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> {{the upper part of}} the mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E

5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like {{those used in}} the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition {{in the event that}} he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types of teeth, uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids have a third type of leaf-shaped teeth. The first type of teeth, found <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype {{is represented by the}} canine-like or pseudocaniniform teeth. They are the fourth and fifth maxillary teeth, and are enlarged (about twice the size of the other maxillary teeth), more pointed, and more constricted at the base. The second type of teeth, which constitutes the rest of the teeth, are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} a solid showing at the {{traditional}} opener to the French cycling season, the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise. While 's Jérémy Roy easily won the race with a solo breakaway, Gautier rode to sixth place by finishing <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the peloton {{two and a half}} minutes behind. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, one of the early-season Belgian races, Chavanel also turned in a sixth place, in a large field sprint. That same day, Gautier secured a podium finish at Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, coming third in a selective 12-rider sprint {{at the front of the}} race. Chavanel rode to eighth place at Le Samyn, coming across the line 11 seconds back of the winner Dominic Klemme in a race decided by a late breakaway.|$|E

5|$|Within Stereospondyli, Yates and Warren erected {{two major}} clades: Capitosauria and Trematosauria. Capitosaurs include large semiaquatic temnospondyls like Mastodonsaurus with flat heads and eyes {{near the back}} of the skull. Trematosaurs include a {{diversity}} of temnospondyls, including large marine trematosauroids, aquatic plagiosaurs, brachyopoids that survived into the Cretaceous, and metoposauroids with eyes <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> their heads. In 2000, paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of stereospondyls, the Rhytidostea. This group included more primitive stereospondyls that could not be placed in either Capitosauria or Trematosauria, and included groups like Lydekkerinidae, Rhytidosteidae, and Brachyopoidea. While Capitosauria and Trematosauria are still widely used, Rhytidostea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses. Rhytidosteids and brachyopoids are now grouped with trematosaurians, but lydekkerinids are still considered to be a primitive family of stereospondyls.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara {{entered the}} Vuelta a España and helped assist RadioShack-Leopard to a second-place {{finish in the}} race's opening team time trial. He won the stage eleven {{individual}} time trial {{by a margin of}} 37 seconds over reigning world champion Tony Martin. Cancellara then rode in support of team leader and eventual Vuelta winner Chris Horner until the seventeenth stage, after which he left the race in order to focus on the World Championships. Cancellara was seen as a contender for the gold medal in both the men's time trial and road race events at the UCI Road World Championships. Cancellara finished the time trial in third position, 48 seconds behind the winner Tony Martin, earning a bronze medal. Four days after completing the time trial event, Cancellara entered the Elite Men's road race. For most of the race, Cancellara stayed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> race, before being dropped however on the final climb of the day and fighting his way to tenth place. In late December, RadioShack-Leopard's general manager Luca Guercilena announced that Fabian Cancellara would attempt to break the hour record during the 2014 season.|$|E
5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January, {{much earlier than}} in past years. Team Europcar had among their number French national champion Voeckler, though he lost that title shortly before the Tour, a de facto national hero after he wore the yellow jersey for ten days in the 2004 Tour de France. Confident of their inclusion, they were indeed among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. Voeckler was named as the squad leader, with Charteau and Kern his top support riders. Gène was also named to the squad, the first black rider in the Tour's history. The team started quietly, with no rider finishing <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the race on stage 1 at the Mont des Alouettes and 13th of 22 teams in the stage 2 team time trial. The team did not really figure into the sprint finishes that happened early in the Tour, having left their best sprinter Chavanel off the squad for the Tour. Turgot's eighth place in stage 7 was their highest such finish.|$|E

5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located {{on the sides of}} its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the store.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E

5|$|The thyroid sits <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the neck, lying {{against and}} around {{the front of the}} larynx and trachea. The thyroid {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes.|$|E
