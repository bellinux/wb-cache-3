40|$|Federal {{budget deficits}} {{continue}} to dominate {{discussions of the}} short-term economic future of the United States. This article by William G. Dewald stands {{in stark contrast to}} the aura of pessimism that pervades most such discussions. Dewald’s optimism derives from the inflation adjustment factors he applies to the CBO and OMB deficit projections based on the 1986 Congressional Budget Resolution. He insists that pessimism about deficits stems from a tendency to focus on nominal rather than real (i. e., inflation-adjusted) deficits. Inflation mitigates the burden of a given <b>nominal</b> <b>deficit</b> in two ways: first, it lowers the real interest rate that the government pays, and second, it reduces the real value of publicly held government debt. Dewald claims that if the Budget Resolution is implemented, then by 1990, the ratio of inflation-adjusted publicly held debt to GNP will begin to decline, and the real deficit will be eliminated.

This work was made available {{with the help of the}} Publications Office of the European Union, Copyright and Legal Issues Section. The macroeconomic challenges in Malta no longer constitute substantial macroeconomic risks and are no longer identified as imbalances in the sense of the MIP. Although indebtedness remains high, risks to the sustainability of private and public sector debt and the stability of the financial sector appear contained, even if they deserve continued monitoring. More specifically, the analysis in the IDR finds that financial stability indicators remain sound. Still, in light of the structural nature of the risks in the sector, a continuation of the current prudent supervisory and risk-taking practices is key. The housing market has stabilised and thus risks arising from over-exposure to property are limited. Private debt is on the decrease; the corporate deleveraging is taking place in an orderly manner and credit market pressures are limited. As regards public finances, Malta is expected to meet its <b>nominal</b> <b>deficit</b> targets in 2013 and 2014. As regards external sustainability, trade performance has been positive, thanks to product and geographical market orientation and non-cost competitiveness factors; the current account balance is in surplus. Still, external competitiveness could benefit from active policy response to cost-adjustments in competitor countriesN/...|$|E

In the firist chapter {{a model of}} endogenous technical progress is used to study the relations between growth of the agricultural productivity {{and the process of}} industrialization in a context of open economy. The concept of Dinamic Comparative Advantage is exhaustingly used and, additionally, seaechs to understand as the technological integration between the sectors agricultural and industrial contributed for the dynamics of the employ in the industry. In the second chapter a model of general equilibrium was used to analyze and to compare the effect of two fiscal adjustament rules: the rule of primary superÃvit proportional to the product and the rule of zero <b>nominal</b> <b>deficit.</b> In the constructed model the rules it was analyzed the impacts of these rules on the optimal allocations {{as well as on the}} welfare. In both the cases, the effect of short and long runs always are compared. Finally, the third chapter considers an alternative proofs of the HotellingÂs Lemma and ShephardÂs Lemma using new relations of duality in the theory of the production. The proofs proposals posses two advantages, relatively to the usual demonstrations, which are, not teh use of the known envelope theorem and the validity of the demonstration for interior points to the production set.

Ricardian equivalence fails because debt has {{a negative impact on}} its rate of return and on private savings, which is induced by assuming transaction services of bonds. Under aggressive monetary policy regimes, macroeconomic fluctuations tend to be stabilized if <b>nominal</b> budget <b>deficits</b> are low.

The present paper analyzes two related theoretical issues. First, it examines the direction of causal flows in the deficit-nominal interest rate relationship.

The causality test results indicate that deficits affect both of these components {{in the case of}} the long-term <b>nominal</b> interest rate. <b>Deficits</b> have adverse effects on economic growth because of reduced capital formation at higher real rates of interest. ...|$|R
40|$|In the aphasic production, the verb-noun (V-N) {{dissociation}} (a condition whereby {{brain damage}} selectively affects {{one of the}} two categories, while sparing the other) may have a different nature in different cases, reflecting semantic, syntactic or grammatical class effects. The observation that the V-N dissociations have a different nature goes in hand with the fact that in Linguistics it is hard to spot out the differences between nouns and verbs in a clear-cut way. In this regard, the nominalization phenomenon is explicative since nominalizations share both nominal and verbal properties. In the literature on aphasia, only few have studies tested how verbal and <b>nominal</b> selective <b>deficits</b> impact on closely related pairs involving verbs and the corresponding nominalizations. The present study aims at verifying whether the aphasic production of nominalizations can be affected by class selective impairments or by semantic/syntactic deficits. It will be showed that the aphasic speakers’ errors enlighten the crucial role played by the event structure, the Aktionsart and the grammatical aspect in the retrieval of the nominalizations. Such conclusions provide neurolinguistic evidence in favour of the idea that some features and properties can cross the boundaries of the verb-noun class distinction...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, {{the place}} and the {{importance}} of the fiscal criteria and the excessive deficit procedures (EDP) within the set of theMaastricht convergence criteria, as well as their basic importance for the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) were presented. Also, the evolution of the attitude of the EU zone countries towards these criteria before the birth of the euro zone and after its birth in 1999 was presented. The extent was examined to which the Maastricht Treaty criteria and the SGP provisions were applied in the period of 1999 - 2003 by the EU organs when assessing the fiscal policy of individual countries under the excessive deficit procedure. Despite the fact that the admissible ceiling of the deficit-to-GDP ratio had repeatedly been considerably overstepped by themajority of the euro zone countries, no sanctions or penalties were ever applied. The EU organs confined themselves only to the so-called early warning to the countries that chronically stayed in the zone of excessive deficit. The primary reason for the EU organs' abstention from applying the Treaty criteriaand the SGP provisions {{was the fact that the}} Maastricht Treaty had adopted thenominal deficit as the basis for the assessment whether and to what extent thegiven country had infringed the fiscal discipline. Whereas, in a situationwhere the GDP is growing more slowly than the potential rate of growth, it is necessary, in order to avoid adverse consequences of a restrictive fiscal policy, to be guided by the structural rather than <b>nominal</b> <b>deficit.</b> Despite the infringement of the principle of avoiding an excessive deficit by the biggest eurozone countries and the lack, even in cases of drastic infringement of the fiscaldiscipline, of applying the sanctions and penalties foreseen by the ExcessiveDeficit Procedure, both the EDP and the Stability and Growth Pact have fulfilled their function of non-discretionary (i. e. based on fixed rules) tools ofpublic finance improvement both in the euro zone and throughout the EU, as the ED procedure applies to all the EU member countries. It was against thisbackground that the Polish programme of fiscal convergence for 1995 - 1997, being a part of the general convergence programme filed in connection with thecountry's EU accession, was analyzed. The analysis has shown that, among thetasks under the above convergence programme, there are some that can proveto be the very difficult to implement: firstly, the adjustment of the Polish regulations (inclusive of the constitutional provisions) governing the position of thecentral bank to the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty, the ECB constitution and the statutes of the European System of Central Banks; secondly, theneed to accept after 2007, i. e. at the time when Poland's membership of theeuro zone can become practical, that the Open Pension Funds (OPFs) do notmake a part of the public sector and, consequently, the resources gathered bythem are not public funds and, thereby, the liabilities of the Social InsuranceFund to the OPFs are public liabilities that augment the ratio of the public sector deficit and the public debt to the GDP. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between public debt, external and internal disequilibrium and inflation in Hungary through changes {{in the public sector}} borrowing requirement and in the structure of budget financing. The analysis is based on data from the 1986 - 1997 period in order to put the changes in true perspective. Policy constraints stemming from high indebtedness and their macroeconomic consequences are analysed by comparing different measures of fiscal deficit, as well as by quantifying the factors determining the evolution of the public debt/GDP ratio. We focus on the operational deficit (which is derived from the <b>nominal</b> <b>deficit</b> by eliminating the inflation compensation component of interest payments) and on its financing. The study presents a detailed empirical analysis of the evolution of the financing structure (seigniorage - debt) {{as well as of the}} role and structural changes of debt financing. The calculations are based on net consolidated public debt, which includes the combined debt of the budget and the central bank to other sectors net of claims. The consolidation of budget and central bank balances is unavoidable in order to get reliable indicators of the fiscal stance since in Hungary the central bank has been responsible for borrowing abroad in its own name. We introduced the category of ?extended??consolidated public debt (including the stock of central bank’s sterilisation instruments) which enabled us to analyse the past eleven years in a consistent framework, and to reveal the trends as well as the dynamic relationships of the debt accumulation process. The analysis shows that the shift to a new regime of deficit financing based on issuing marketable government securities (in 1992) did not increase the fiscal burden, it merely revealed its true magnitude by separating monetary and fiscal functions and by increasing transparency. The analysis of consolidated debt revealed that throughout the last ten years the implicit real interest rates on public debt exceeded the growth rate of the economy, which led to the continuous increase of the debt ratio (the gross debt/GDP around 90 % in the middle of nineties). This effect was mitigated only from 1995 by the fiscal adjustment resulting a primary surplus in the budget. The seigniorage did not play an important role in financing after 1992, it amounted to 1 - 2 % of GDP. However, the major element in the significant (over 15 percentage points) reduction in the debt-to- GDP ratio over the last three years was the devotion of privatisation revenues to retire public debt. Analysing past developments, we came to the conclusion that despite the significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the last few years, the debt burden is still significant and a further reduction of the debt to GDP ratio is inevitable in order to create the conditions for sustainable growth and to ensure the continuous convergence to developed countries. This requires a structural primary surplus of 1. 5 - 2 % of GDP in the medium run, if we take into account the requirement of sustainability, the goal of further reductions in the inflation rate and the fact that with the end of the privatisation process privatisation revenues will not provide additional sources for financing. ...|$|E
40|$|THE ISSUE The {{strengthening}} of the European Union’s fiscal rules {{with the approval of}} the so-called ‘six-pack’, and the parallel worsening of economic conditions in Europe, re-opened the debate about the relationship between fiscal discipline and growth. Influential voices have argued against the EU’s perceived obsession with fiscal discipline, which risks being self-defeating in bad times. However, EU fiscal rules are not as rigid as commonly thought, but represent a sophisticated system of surveillance and ex-post control that provides sufficient room for manoeuvre under exceptional circumstances. POLICY CHALLENGE The EU fiscal framework has come under attack more because of the timing of the application of the new rules than for substantive reasons. The framework entered into force when most euro-area countries were under the Excessive Deficit Procedure. Linked to this {{is the fact that the}} six-pack suggests that the new surveillance procedure enters into force after EU countries have corrected <b>nominal</b> fiscal <b>deficits.</b> We argue that: a) fiscal surveillance should be prioritised over enforcement of sanctions for excessive deficits; b) it is inconsistent to allow for exceptional circumstances, while not recognising up-front the role of surveillance; c) there is scope to decide that slow growth at member state level and EU levels acts as a constraint on fiscal consolidation: it should be done ex ante in a way that allows governments to use the Commission’s forecasts in their Stability Programmes, and must be decided by the Commission and not by the Council.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{sustainability}} of public debt in Italy during the last 150 years (1861 - 2010) by employing a database containing several statistical novelties: new time series estimates of public debt and GDP (respectively Bank of Italy and Baffigi, 2011) and an original reconstruction of the revenues of the State. The key economic indicators analyzed include public debt, primary and total <b>deficits,</b> <b>nominal</b> and real GDP rates of growth. Long-term analysis of new homogeneous statistical series has led to a different perspective, in particular when compared with the existing Italian literature on the debt-to-GDP ratio. Two main issues are addressed. First, we examine the size and dynamics of public finance aggregates in a long-term perspective. In particular, we carry out a detailed historical analysis, aiming to identify the determinants of public debt and its ratio to GDP.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} suggests that the large fiscal deficits that Pakistan has experienced {{over most of the}} period since 1970 led to some crowding out of private investment, resulting in slower output growth than would otherwise have been observed. Past fiscal deficits have also resulted in a substantial accumulation of domestic and external debt. In addition, the possibilities for currency substitution that have been created by the removal of restrictions on capital flows from Pakistan, as well as on foreign currency holdings of domestic residents, may have limited the potential for collecting the inflation tax. Accordingly, continued effort is likely to be needed to attain a fiscal position that is sustainable over the medium term.

40|$|This paper uses three {{methods to}} assess {{movements}} of real exchange {{rates in the}} ECCU over time. First, the purchasing power parity hypothesis is tested and then used to provide a benchmark for equilibrium real exchange rates in the region. Second, a fundamentals-based equilibrium real exchange rate approach is used to explore sources of real exchange rate fluctuations in ECCU countries. And third, a macroeconomic balance approach is used to estimate equilibrium current account or current account "norms". The main finding of these analyses {{is that there is}} little evidence of overvaluation of the EC dollar. Furthermore, this paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the distinctive impact of tourism in determining real exchange rates through the wealth effect induced by tourism-driven increases in terms of trade and productivity.

40|$|The recent sharp {{increase}} in fiscal deficits and government debt in many countries raises questions regarding their impact on long-term sovereign bond yields. While economic theory suggests that this impact {{is likely to be}} adverse, empirical results have been less clear cut, have generally ignored nonlinear effects of deficits and debt through some other key determinants of yields, and have been mostly confined to advanced economies. This paper reexamines the impact of fiscal deficits and public debt on long-term interest rates during 1980 - 2008, taking into account a wide range of country-specific factors, for a panel of 31 advanced and emerging market economies. It finds that higher deficits and public debt lead to a significant increase in long-term interest rates, with the precise magnitude dependent on initial fiscal, institutional and other structural conditions, as well as spillovers from global financial markets. Taking into account these factors suggests that large fiscal deficits and public debts are likely to put substantial upward pressures on sovereign bond yields in many advanced economies over the medium term.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} why surges {{in capital}} flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) occur, and what determines {{the allocation of}} capital across countries during such surge episodes. We use two different methodologies to identify surges in EMEs over 1980 - 2009, differentiating between those mainly caused by changes in the country''s external liabilities (reflecting the investment decisions of foreigners), and those caused by changes in its assets (reflecting the decisions of residents). Global factors-including US interest rates and risk aversionÂ¡-are key to determining whether a surge will occur, but domestic {{factors such as the}} country''s external financing needs (as implied by an intertemporal optimizing model of the current account) and structural characteristics also matter, which explains why not all EMEs experience surges. Conditional on a surge occurring, moreover, the magnitude of the capital inflow depends largely on domestic factors including the country''s external financing needs, and the exchange rate regime. Finally, while similar factors explain asset- and liability-driven surges, the latter are more sensitive to global factors and contagion.

40|$|Electrosprays of the pure-ion variety embody {{a unique}} {{collection}} of attributes that have compelled interest in derivative technologies across {{a spectrum of}} applications ranging from Focused Ion Beams (FIB) to microrocketry. Unlike conventional colloid sources (i. e., so-called cone-jets or others sources from which droplets typically emanate), pure ion sprays are commonly characterized by narrow distributions of high specific charge and <b>nominal</b> energy <b>deficits</b> {{as a result of}} their evaporative mechanisms. Among other properties of the spray, these are known to enable well-behaved optics (e. g. for nanometric patterning with FIB) and low power overhead (e. g. for efficient electrical-to-kinetic energy transduction in microrocketry) while also providing for innate simplicity and spatial compactness. In spite of their potential for paradigm-shifting impact, the practicality of contemporary pure-ion sources has been tempered by issues relating to reliability and predictability. In contrast to droplet emission, for example, empirical studies strongly suggest that pure-ion modes are only permissible under special sets of circumstances and that important beam qualities (namely the stability but also the current) are sensitive functions of the meniscus configuration. The difficulty in controlling these modes is somewhat abated through the use of fluids like ionic liquids (IL), particularly in connection with several heuristics that have emerged, but the process remains substantially fickle. This is believed to owe most directly to an undeveloped physical understanding. While the physics that govern conventional colloid sources are at least functionally understood at this point, an analogous grasp of their ion relatives has proven elusive. The purpose of this thesis is to begin addressing this issue by way of rigorous theoretical investigations, with the ultimate aim of offering deeper fundamental insight and additional recourse to future design initiatives beyond the existing set of over-simplified heuristics. In this thesis we first conduct a survey of potential contributors to the very multi-physical phenomenon of charge evaporation and identify key influences through basic order-of-magnitude analyses. These are used to inform the formulation of a detailed mathematical framework that is subsequently leveraged in the exploration of evaporation behaviors for a prototypical ionic liquid meniscus across a range of field, media, and hydraulic conditions. The results uncover a previously uncharted family of highly-stressed but ostensibly stable solutions for the problem of a volumetrically-unconstrained source. These appear to be confined to a particular subregion of the global parameter space that emphasizes thoughtful sizing of the meniscus and architecting of the feeding system. The impedance aspect of the latter, in particular, is believed to play a critical role in steady emission when large scale disparities, which are common in practical settings, exist across the parent meniscus. Additional influences that are often neglected in the literature, such as that of the liquid permittivity, are also elucidated and shown to play meaningful roles in evaporation. We conclude by outlining a reasonably comprehensive set of conditions that should be met for steady emission and substantiate these with tangible evidence from our studies. by Chase Coffman.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2001. The study aims to {{research}} the performance {{of past and present}} motor industry policy in South Africa - with special reference to Phase VI of the local content programme and the Motor Industry Development programme (MIDP) - {{in the light of the}} domestic macroeconomic environment and global developments in the world automotive industry. The overall objective of this dissertation is to contribute to the debate on motor industry policy which concerns what future policy would be appropriate for the development of a viable and competitive motor vehicle industry. Thus this study is primarily policy-oriented, and the empirical analysis produced deals with important developments in the local motor and component industries and attempts to examine key variables to establish the likely impact of industry-specific policy changes - both past and future. The method of investigation involves the study of relevant theoretical literature regarding domestic automotive policy, and considers policies of low-volume automobile producing economies, especially Australia, Philippines, India and Malaysia. Also, empirical data of various sub-sectors of manufacturing in South Africa were examined and compared to the motor vehicle sector in order to determine the extent to which the macroeconomic state of the domestic economy as distinct from automotive policy might explain the performance of the South African motor industry. The dissertation presents a review of the local content programme of motor industry policy in South Africa since the early 1960 s. It examines the claim that import-substituting policy in the motor industry actually had a negative impact on the country's balance of payments. The study finds questionable whether local content policy contributed significantly to the large net foreign exchange usage by the motor industry in real terms. There is evidence that increases in the <b>nominal</b> industry trade <b>deficit</b> can largely be explained by the weakening of the Rand, especially during the mid- 1980 s. Also, empirical data was used to make an examination of the performance of automotive exports under Phase VI and the MIDP in the context of economy-wide trade liberalization. It was found that exports of automotive products grew significantly under both Phase VI and the MIDP in real Rand terms. Thus, it seems probable that industry-specific policy played a major role in the strong export performance of the sector since the late 1980 s through to the 1990 s. The study then reviews the revised version of the impact of the MIDP and considers the future of the industry. The state of the domestic macroeconomic environment and globalization of the international automobile industry, including the influence of Transnational Corporations' (TNCs') strategies, will undoubtedly determine the future direction of South Africa's automotive sector. In the short to medium term, we might expect an increase in imported vehicles and some rationalization of the industry. Over the longer term, the possibility of fewer OEMs and component suppliers, and automotive exports are likely to rise as trade and the inflow of foreign investment accelerates due to foreign collaboration and global competition. A simple theoretical model applicable to the South African automotive industry attempts to show the welfare implications of a protective automotive regime (similar to Phase VI) and compares it with that of a more liberal (tariffs-only) automotive regime that may be considered as a likely policy-option for South Africa post-MIDP. The theoretical analysis indicates that the tariffs-only policy is superior to that of a more protective regime in that static efficiency losses are lower. However, the dynamic effects of such policy changes and of possible TNC responses to them, which are referred to in the previous paragraph, are not included in this simple model...|$|R
