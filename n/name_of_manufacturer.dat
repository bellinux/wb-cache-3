2500|$|The {{inclusion}} of {{place of origin}} on manufactured goods has an ancient history. In antiquity, informal branding which included details such as the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and place of origin were used by consumers as important clues as to product quality. David Wengrow has found archaeological evidence of brands, which often included origin of manufacture, dating to around 4,000 years ago. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus providing information about the product and its quality. For instance, an object found in a royal burial tomb in Abydos (southern Egypt) and dating to around 3,000 B.C.E., carries brand elements {{that would be very}} familiar to modern consumers. Inscriptions on the [...] surface denote a specific place of manufacture, [...] "finest oil of Tjehenu," [...] a region in modern-day Libya.|$|E

Thus the labelling scheme proposes four different colour labels: viz red, yellow, blue, and green.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the sundials {{made by the}} Kang Family of Jinju in the later period of the Joseon dynasty {{in terms of their}} characteristics, functions and the manufacturing technique. One of the characteristics of these sundials is that the value of polar height (i. e., the latitude of Seoul), the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> 24 seasonal subdivisions and so forth are written on the surface. In particular, polar height is expressed as ‘ 37 ˚ 39 ′ 15 ′′ ’ in all 12 sundials examined in this study. To investigate the manufacturing technology in terms of astronomy, we analyze the positions of gnomon and of the lines corresponding to 24 seasonal subdivisions (season lines) and to each hour (hour lines). To verify the accuracy of the positions, we use a planar projection method. That is, we obtain 2 D images of the sundials using a camera or scan-ner, and compare these with astronomical calculations for the positions of gnomon and season/hour lines. We believe that this method will be very useful for the study of sundials preserved elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to identify whether nonprescription drug promotion in mass-media print publications in Indonesia complied with the regulations of “Keputusan Menteri Kesehatan No. 386 /Men. Kes/SK/IV/ 1994 ” on drug promotion and WHO Ethical Criteria for Medicinal Drug Promotion, as well as to identify the type of information given to consumers. The study was conducted by random sampling of 110 advertisements from mass-media print publications from the year 2000 until 2004. The results of the study showed that only 1. 8 % of nonprescription drug advertisements complied with the regulations. The type of information advertised to consumers was the active ingredient(s) (80. 9 %), major indications for use (98. 2 %), major precautions (9. 1 %), contra-indications (5. 4 %), side effects (20. 9 %), the name of the product or the brand name (100 %), <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer</b> or distributor (93. 6 %), address of manufacturer/distributor (45. 5 %), dosage (80. 9 %), and registration number (82. 7 %). Our findings showed that 27. 3 % advertisements did not list the active ingredient(s) completely or used no International Nonproprietary Name (INN), and 44. 5 % advertisements contained claims of product effectiveness that were unsupported by clinical or other scientific evidence...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of undeclared or illicitly added sugar content in honey samples evaluated using the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography or HPLC with refractive index detection. Labelling of samples was also evaluated in accordance with current legislation. In a total of 21 samples of honey purchased {{in the fall of}} 2013, 13 samples were obtained from the regular shopping network, 2 samples were purchase in Health Food stores and 6 samples came directly from local beekeepers and were purchased at the Christmas Markets in Brno. We have determined the contents of fructose, glucose, sucrose, and oligosaccharides using the HPLC method. We have calculated the basic statistics such as the mean and standard deviation for each sample. Samples have been evaluated according to the Council Directive 2001 / 110 /EC, which lays down limit values for the parameters of honey. Only four out of 21 honey samples complied with the requirements of Council Directive 2001 / 110 /EC. These were three samples obtained from the regular shopping network and one obtained directly from the local beekeeper. Six samples did not meet the requirements for the sum of fructose and glucose, two samples could not be determined due to the failure to specify the honey type, and fourteen samples failed the requirement of sucrose content. We have further assessed whether honey samples comply with legislative requirements relating to this product or consumer misleading practices take place. Our analysed samples often lacked indication whether it is a floral honey or honeydew honey; this information was missing in eight out of 21 samples. Samples 5 and 9 did not mention the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> Sample 10 did not mention the country of origin...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Food {{labels are}} {{imperative}} in consumers‟ decision-making process of packaged food products as they communicate important {{information such as}} expiry dates, nutrition information and information about allergies to the consumer. Especially during a first-time purchase, consumers rely on food labels {{to assist them in}} making their product choice easier. In the heterogeneous context of South Africa, consumers‟ product needs vary and one may assume that consumer needs in terms of food label information differ. Although food labelling is regulated in South Africa, it is still important that consumers are satisfied with labels due to their significant communicative function. However, to the knowledge of the author, little previous research exists on South African consumers‟ satisfaction with food labels. Therefore, this study aimed to explore and describe consumers‟ satisfaction with food labels based on a typical in-store encounter. The confirmation/disconfirmation paradigm had been used as theoretical foundation in this study and consumers‟ expectations and performance judgement of food labels were therefore explored and compared within the confirmation/disconfirmation paradigm. This study furthermore aimed to explore the influence of food labels on consumers‟ product choice as well as to determine the influence of demographic characteristics on consumers‟ expectations and performance judgement of food labels. Lastly, this study aimed to make recommendations to food regulators and manufacturers on how existing food labels could be improved in order to enhance consumer satisfaction. Based on the literature, satisfaction with food labels might be influenced by the information on food labels such as ingredient lists, expiry dates and nutrition information as well as attributes of food labels such as the readability, understandability, credibility and adequacy. Exploratory factor analysis {{used in the present study}} indicated that the information on food labels can be classified as either primary (ingredient list, expiry date, health and nutrition information, information about allergies and quality guarantee) or secondary (<b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> well-known logos or symbols, country of origin or geographical region, usage instructions and number of servings). A quantitative research method by means of a survey approach was used in this study over a period of three weeks. A total of 400 self-administered questionnaires were distributed at office buildings and business premises in the urban Gauteng Province in September 2010 by means of a non-probability sampling method. A total of 279 useful questionnaires were retrieved and data analysis was performed by Statistical Consultations Services of the North-West University using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). Results show that respondents were only partially satisfied with food labels as they were satisfied with secondary information, but dissatisfied with primary information as well as with label attributes. The results furthermore show that primary information tended to be more likely to influence respondents‟ product choice than secondary information. In addition, results show that demographics had little influence on respondents‟ expectations and performance judgement of food labels. Based on the findings of this study, recommendations can be made to regulators and manufacturers on how consumer satisfaction with existing food labels can be improved. Recommendations include the improvement of the overall readability, understandability, credibility as well as adequacy of food labels. Especially primary information and the way it gets portrayed should be considered for improvement to increase consumer satisfaction. Master...|$|E
