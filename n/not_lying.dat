5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those <b>not</b> <b>lying</b> directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E

500|$|There are Five Great vows {{prescribed}} to followers of Jainism; Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (<b>not</b> <b>lying),</b> Asteya (not stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). A further seven supplementary vows are also prescribed, which include three Gunavratas (merit vows) and four Shiksha vratas (disciplinary vows). The three Gunavratas are: [...] Digvrata (limited movements, limiting one's area of activity), Bhogopabhogaparimana (limiting use of consumable and non-consumable things), and Anartha-dandaviramana (abstain from purposeless sins). The Shikshavratas include: Samayika (vow to meditate and concentrate for limited periods), Desavrata (limiting movement and space of activity for limited periods), Prosadhopavāsa (fasting for limited periods), and Atithi-samvibhag (offering {{food to the}} ascetic).|$|E

Afterward, the entire WWE roster came out {{to say thank you}} to Flair (Including Undertaker, who came out after Raw went off the air and hugged Flair and did his kneeling stance). Shawn Michaels, who was clearly upset about retiring Flair, was forgiven by Flair. Despite Flair's forgiveness, his former protégé Batista later started a feud with Michaels, citing Michaels' [...] "selfishness" [...] at WrestleMania for <b>not</b> <b>lying</b> down for Flair. The two had a match booked at Backlash, WWE's next scheduled pay-per-view event, and after a confrontation between Michaels and Chris Jericho, Jericho was later added into the match as a Special Guest Referee. Michaels won with a superkick.|$|E

500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC radio studio. The {{first year of the}} television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is <b>not</b> <b>lying</b> on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E

2500|$|This is the {{argument}} that all true atheists are at heart lying {{so that they may}} live {{in a way that is}} contrary to God's commands (as seen in particular interpretations of Romans 1:18-25). Critics note that there are atheists who are <b>not</b> <b>lying</b> and are not using their atheism as an escape to sin. Proponents note, however, that they could just as easily still be lying, perhaps not to others anymore but themselves (i.e. loving the wrong woman argument). Some have claimed this argument, however, fails to account for Stephen Maitzen's point on the demographics of theism. If all atheists are liars, why are people in some societies so much more likely to lie than in others? ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{published}} {{under the}} pseudonym [...] "Tex Burns". Louis L'Amour was commissioned to write four Hopalong Cassidy {{books in the}} spring and summer of 1950 by Doubleday's Double D Western imprint. They were the first novels he ever had published and he denied writing them until the day he died, refusing to sign any of them that fans would occasionally bring to his autograph sessions. His reason to his young son for doing this was, [...] "I wrote some books. I just did it for the money, and my name didn't go on them. So now, when people ask me if they were mine, I say no." [...] When his son asked if this was <b>not</b> <b>lying</b> he said, [...] "I just wrote them for hire. They weren't my books." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several North Carolina {{cities were}} sited on the sounds, among them New Bern (usually written New Berne {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century), Beaufort, Edenton, and Elizabeth City. [...] Others, <b>not</b> <b>lying</b> {{directly}} on the sounds, were accessible to the rivers that emptied into them. As much as {{a third of the}} state is in their watershed. Through most of {{the first year of the}} Civil War, the Confederate forces retained control of the sounds, so that coastwise water-borne commerce of the eastern part of the state was unimpeded. The sounds were linked to Norfolk, Virginia by the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal and the Dismal Swamp Canal. The blockade of Norfolk could not be complete so long as cargoes could reach the city through its back door. Communications were not affected appreciably when Federal forces captured the forts on the Outer Banks at Hatteras Inlet in August 1861, as the Union Navy could not bring its deep-water vessels into the sounds through the shallow inlets.|$|E
2500|$|A pillar {{which is}} {{translated}} as “fasting.” Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims fast by abstaining from food, drink {{from dawn to}} sunset as well purifying the soul by avoiding sinful acts and doing good deeds, e.g., <b>not</b> <b>lying,</b> being honest in daily life, not backbiting, etc., for 30 days during the holy month of Ramadan (9th month of the Islamic calendar). In contrast, the Nizari and Musta'ali sects believe in a metaphorical {{as well as a}} literal meaning of fasting. The literal meaning is that one must fast as an obligation, such as during Ramadan, and the metaphorical meaning is seeking to attain the Divine Truth and striving to avoid worldly activities which may detract from this goal. In particular, Ismāʿīlīs believe that the esoteric meaning of fasting involves a [...] "fasting of the soul," [...] whereby they attempt to purify the soul simply by avoiding sinful acts and doing good deeds. Still, many Nizari Ismailis around the world fast during the month of Ramadan every year. In addition, the Nizari also fast on [...] "Shukravari Beej" [...] which falls on a Friday that coincides with the New Moon.|$|E
