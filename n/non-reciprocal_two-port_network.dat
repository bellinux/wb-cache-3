50|$|To {{check if}} two <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> can be {{connected}} in a parallel-parallel configuration, {{first of all}} just the input ports are connected in parallel, a voltage {{is applied to the}} input and the open-circuit voltage is measured/calculated between the outputs that are short-circuited each. If there is a voltage drop, the <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> cannot be combined in parallel. The same test is repeated from the output side of the <b>two-port</b> <b>networks</b> (parallel connection of the output ports, application of a voltage to the output, measurement/calculation of the open-circuit voltage between the inputs that are short-circuited each). Only if there is no voltage drop in both cases, a combination of the <b>two-ports</b> <b>networks</b> is permissible.|$|R
