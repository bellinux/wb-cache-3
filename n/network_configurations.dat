40|$|NetFS is a unified, platform-independent {{interface}} for <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> {{using the}} file {{system and its}} operations. It introduces a novel approach where the system’s <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> components are mapped to a virtual file system.

NetFS exploits existing file system to offer fine-grained access control in which different permissions and policies can be granted to different users or groups. NetFS also uses remotely mounts to enable remote network management. By providing user-based virtual views of the system’s network, NetFS can support network virtualization. Finally, integrating NetFS in configuration systems such as the X-Bone simplifies the configuration and control of overlays and VPNs. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the complex and}} evolutionary nature of supply <b>network</b> <b>configuration.</b> Taking a bottom-up approach, we examine how supply <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> at the macro-level evolves {{as a result of}} individual retailers' dynamic choice of procurement strategies at the micro-level. Employing agent-based modeling, we focus on the effects of switch cost and distributors' ordering policy on the evolution of supply <b>network</b> <b>configuration.</b> Our results show that (1) supply networks tend to evolve into a set of separate supply chains when switch cost is high and into an integrated network when switch cost is low, (2) a responsive ordering policy adopted by distributors is more conducive to the integrated <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> than a non-responsive policy, and (3) lack of coordination among retailers in their dynamic choice of procurement strategies hurts not only the overall system performance, but also retailers themselves. More importantly, our study demonstrates the capabilities of agent-based modeling as a methodology for researching complex supply network issues.

40|$|Security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can be {{achieved}} by establishing shared keys among the neighbor sensor nodes to create secure communication links. The protocol to be used for such a pairwise key establishment is a key factor determining the energy to be consumed by each sensor node during the secure <b>network</b> <b>configuration.</b> On the other hand, to achieve the optimum <b>network</b> <b>configuration,</b> nodes may not need to establish pairwise keys with all of their neighbors. Because, links to be established are defined by the <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> protocol {{and as long as the}} network connectivity requirements are satisfied, number of links to be secured can be limited accordingly. In this sense, key establishment and <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> performances are related to each other and this cross relation should be taken into consideration while implementing security for WSN. In this paper, we have investigated the cross layer relations and performance figures of the selected randomized pre-distribution and public key based key establishment protocols with the configuration protocol we proposed in a separate publication. Simulation results indicate that total <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> energy cost can be reduced by reducing the number of links to be secured without affecting the global network connectivity performance. Results also show that the energy and resilience performances of the public key establishment can be better than the key pre-distribution for a given set of <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> parameters.
