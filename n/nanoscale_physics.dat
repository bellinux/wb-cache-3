The high-index resonant dielectric nanostructures form building blocks for novel photonic metadevices with low losses and advanced functionalities.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that a nanoliter chamber {{separated}} by a wall of asymmetric obstacles can lead to an inhomogeneous distribution of self-propelled microorganisms. Although it is well established that this rectification effect arises from the interaction between the swimmers and the noncentrosymmetric pillars, here we demonstrate numerically that its efficiency is strongly dependent on the detailed dynamics of the individual microorganism. In particular, for the case of run-and-tumble dynamics, the distribution of run lengths, the rotational diffusion, and the partial preservation of run orientation memory through a tumble are important factors when computing the rectification efficiency. In addition, we optimize the geometrical dimensions of the asymmetric pillars in order to maximize the swimmer concentration and we illustrate how it can be used for sorting by swimming strategy in a long array of parallel obstacles.

This effect shows itself as the narrowing of the plasmon emission band in the spaser (surface plasmon amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation) experiment [Nature, 2009, 460, 1110], where a gold nanoparticle interacts with the surrounding molecules. Enhancement of the plasmonic excitation lifetime enables stimulated emission to overcome the spontaneous one.
