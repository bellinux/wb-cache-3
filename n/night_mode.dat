5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms act out theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking for clues to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a crime is solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the <b>Night</b> <b>mode,</b> where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E

25|$|A Roomette, in the {{historically}} correct {{sense of the}} word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a folding bed, a toilet (not in a private cubicle of its own), and a washbasin. When a traditional Roomette is in <b>night</b> <b>mode,</b> the bed blocks access to the toilet. Like open sections, Roomettes {{are placed on both}} sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the car's floor level, in order to make slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly Spartan form of Roomette.|$|E

Neighbors initially wave to him, but later become concerned and hide as his outward appearance worsens.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{analyzes}} the inflexibility of video data collection for current 3 G video phones. A solution for adaptive video data collection is proposed. The solution proposed {{in this work}} mainly consists of software components, according to which hardware needs to be selected. It also gives the video phone terminal structure, block diagram for H. 324 M video phone terminal, the main software functional blocks and the implementation flow chart of each module. The image clarity of mobile video phone can be ensured by adding camera mode setting sub-module, camera data collection management sub-module and camera mode switch sub-module, {{as well as by}} the use of software to set mobile video phone, making it automatically switch between the day and <b>night</b> <b>modes,</b> making camera acquisition data more rational and clearer...|$|R
5000|$|Natural {{light or}} <b>night</b> {{snapshot}} <b>modes</b> attempt {{to raise the}} ISO and use a very wide aperture {{in order to take}} a photograph using the limited natural light, rather than a flash.

5000|$|B300: An ultra-rugged {{notebook}} with {{a bright}} 13.3-inch LED screen, running Windows, released in October 2010. The screen is readable in extremely bright conditions because of its 1400 nit display. The computer also has a <b>night</b> vision <b>mode,</b> allowing the user to operate it while wearing night vision goggles. It is wind, dust and rain resistant.|$|R
5000|$|Thermal imaging goggles {{are used}} by various {{military}} and police organizations. They are intended for night use, but the longer wavelength of infrared light allows the user to see images through some materials that are impervious to visible light. Some video cameras have a <b>night</b> <b>mode</b> that gives an IR image under the right conditions. Digital cameras can also be used.|$|E
50|$|Both phones's camera offers {{built-in}} filters, include {{car light}} trails, light graffiti, silky water, and star track. They also offer some modes, include super <b>night</b> <b>mode,</b> slow-motion mode, All-focus mode {{and the full}} manual mode (professional mode). The Nova and the Nova Plus also include Beauty Makeup 2.0 and Beautiful Skin 3.0, which apply cosmetic effects and skin smoothing filters to create more flattering images.|$|E
50|$|The {{digital camera}} is a 1.3-megapixel camera. It {{does not have}} an LED flash, but does include black and white, negative, and sepia color tones as well as various frames. It is very similar to the {{original}} Rumor camera. There is a self-timer, <b>night</b> <b>mode</b> functions/ brightness, and white balance controls. The Rumor 2 is Bluetooth-compatible and supports MP3 music formats and Sprint Navigation (Sprintâ€™s map service).|$|E
50|$|A day {{and night}} camera is a {{security}} camera that can see the picture during the day hours, when there is enough sunlight, and during the night in total darkness or minimum illumination. A {{day and night}} camera has special lenses that allow infrared emission produced by infrared LEDs and reflected from objects to go through and reach a CCD or CMOS chip inside the camera. As a result, the end user can see picture in total darkness at the distance of infrared emission produced by LEDs. A day and night camera can have infrared LEDs mounted on its housing or can accept the emission, produced by an infrared turret. Day and night cameras often have modifications in their digital signal processor (DSP) that compensates for the difference in illumination between day and <b>night</b> <b>modes.</b> HDR technology may also be used in more expensive models {{to compensate for the}} difference in illumination between shaded and lighted areas of surveillance.|$|R
