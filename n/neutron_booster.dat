40|$|The {{time-of-flight}} spectra for -ray multiplicities from 1 to 15 {{were measured}} on the 122 m flight {{path of the}} IBR- 30 pulsed <b>neutron</b> <b>booster</b> using the 16 -section liquid scintillation detector with the 80 l total volume [1] for thin metallic 235 U radiator-sample (0. 25 mm) at the presence of 235 U filter-sample with one thickness 0. 5 mm by two temperatures (100 ° and 293 °) in the neutron beam and without them. Multiplicity spectra and alpha values =/f were obtained from time-of-flight spectra after subtracting background components for the energy group over the range of 2. 15 - 2150 eV with and without filter samples of 235 U. From the time-of-flight spectra of 3 -rd and sum of the 6 - 9 th multiplicities were determined the self-indication functions in capture and fission cross-sections for foregoing temperatures and the Doppler-coefficient in the alpha values...|$|E
