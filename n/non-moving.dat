5|$|The {{electron}} of the hydrogen-like ununennium atom—oxidized so it {{has only}} one electron, Uue118+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.99 times that of a <b>non-moving</b> electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like francium is 1.29 and the figure for hydrogen-like caesium is 1.091. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 240pm, very close to that of rubidium (247pm); the metallic radius is also correspondingly lowered to 260pm. The ionic radius of Uue+ {{is expected to be}} 180pm.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a <b>non-moving</b> boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electrons, unbinilium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The electron of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a <b>non-moving</b> electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like radium is 1.30 and the figure for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very close to that of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in electron affinity is also expected to reverse direction similarly at radium and unbinilium.|$|E

25|$|The third law of {{thermodynamics}} {{states that}} the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero, or 0 kelvin is zero. This means that in a perfect crystal, at 0 kelvin, nearly all molecular motion should cease {{in order to achieve}} ΔS=0. A perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure is the same at all times; in other words, it is fixed and <b>non-moving,</b> and does not have rotational or vibrational energy. This means {{that there is only one}} way in which this order can be attained: when every particle of the structure is in its proper place.|$|E
25|$|The Lorentz {{transformation}} of the electric field of a moving charge into a <b>non-moving</b> observer's reference frame results in {{the appearance of a}} mathematical term commonly called the magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely electrostatic field in a comoving frame of reference. Maxwell's equations are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the Universe. As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined, one speaks of electromagnetic fields. Special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of an}} {{infrared}} sensor to detect position can cause some detection problems when other infrared sources are around, such as incandescent light bulbs or candles. This can be easily alleviated by using fluorescent lights around the Wii, which emit little to no infrared light. Innovative users have used other sources of IR light as Sensor Bar substitutes such {{as a pair of}} flashlights and a pair of candles. The Wii Remote picks up traces of heat from the sensor, then transmits it to the Wii console to control the pointer on your screen. Such substitutes for the Sensor Bar illustrate the fact that a pair of <b>non-moving</b> lights provide continuous calibration of the direction that the Wii Remote is pointing and its physical location relative to the light sources. There is no way to calibrate the position of the cursor relative to where the user is pointing the controller without the two stable reference sources of light provided by the Sensor Bar or substitutes. Third-party wireless sensor bars have also been released, which have been popular with users of Wii emulators since the official Sensor Bar utilizes a proprietary connector to connect to the Wii console.|$|E

500|$|Tennessine's first {{ionization}} energy—the energy {{required to}} remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 7.7eV, {{lower than those}} of the halogens, again following the trend. [...] Like its neighbors in the periodic table, tennessine is expected to have the lowest electron affinity—energy released when an electron is added to the atom—in its group; 2.6 or 1.8eV. The electron of the hypothetical hydrogen-like tennessine atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ts116+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.9 times that of a <b>non-moving</b> electron, a feature attributable to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like astatine is 1.27 and the figure for hydrogen-like iodine is 1.08. Simple extrapolations of relativity laws indicate a contraction of atomic radius. Advanced calculations show that the radius of an tennessine atom that has formed one covalent bond would be 165pm, while that of astatine would be 147pm. With the seven outermost electrons removed, tennessine is finally smaller; 57pm for tennessine and 61pm for astatine.|$|E

500|$|Isaac Cline was {{the first}} to {{investigate}} rainfall distribution around tropical cyclones in the early 1900s. [...] He found that a larger proportion of rainfall falls in advance of the center (or eye) than after the center's passage, with the highest percentage falling in the right front quadrant. [...] Father Viñes of Cuba found that some tropical cyclones have their highest rainfall rates in the rear quadrant within a training (<b>non-moving)</b> inflow band. [...] Normally, as a tropical cyclone intensifies, its heavier rainfall rates become more concentrated around its center. [...] Rainfall is found to be heaviest in tropical cyclone's inner core, whether it be the eyewall or central dense overcast, within a degree latitude of the center, with lesser amounts farther away from the center. Most of the rainfall in tropical cyclones is concentrated within its radius of gale-force (34knots/39mph/63km/h) winds. [...] Rainfall is more common near the center of tropical cyclones overnight. [...] Over land, outer bands are more active during the heating of the day, which can act to restrict inflow {{into the center of the}} cyclone. [...] Recent studies have shown that half of the rainfall within a tropical cyclone is stratiform in nature. [...] The chart to the right was developed by Riehl in 1954 using meteorological equations that assume a gale radius of about , a fairly symmetric cyclone, and does not consider topographic effects or vertical wind shear. [...] Local amounts can exceed this chart by a factor of two due to topography. [...] Wind shear tends to lessen the amounts below what is shown on the table.|$|E

2500|$|When the Uhlan gear was {{incorporated}} in the Mark 14 design, the pressure sensing port for the depth mechanism was moved from its position on the cylindrical body to the cone-shaped tail section; the designers {{did not realize that}} move would affect the pressure readings. This repositioning meant that when the torpedo was moving, a hydrodynamic flow effect created a substantially lower pressure at the port than hydrostatic depth pressure. [...] The torpedo's depth control engine therefore thought the torpedo was too shallow depth and responded by trimming the torpedo to run deeper. A laboratory test (such as immersing a <b>non-moving</b> torpedo in a pool of water) would not be subject to the flow-induced pressure change and would show the torpedo trimmed at the desired depth. Dynamic tests using exercise heads with depth and roll recorders would have shown the depth problem, but the depth measuring port suffered from the same placement problem and gave consistent (though incorrect) measurements. The problem was also exacerbated by higher speeds. The depth problem was finally addressed in the last half of 1943 by relocating the sensor point to the midbody of the torpedo where hydrodynamic effects were minimized.|$|E
