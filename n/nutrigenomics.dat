50|$|<b>Nutrigenomics</b> is {{a branch}} of {{nutritional}} genomics and {{is the study of}} the effects of foods and food constituents on gene expression. This means that <b>nutrigenomics</b> is research focusing on identifying and understanding molecular-level interaction between nutrients and other dietary bioactives with the genome. <b>Nutrigenomics</b> has also been described by the influence of genetic variation on nutrition, by correlating gene expression or SNPs with a nutrient's absorption, metabolism, elimination or biological effects. By doing so, <b>nutrigenomics</b> aims to develop rational means to optimise nutrition with respect to the subject's genotype.|$|E

50|$|By {{determining}} {{the mechanism of}} the effects of nutrients or the effects of a nutritional regime, <b>nutrigenomics</b> tries to define the causality or relationship between these specific nutrients and specific nutrient regimes (diets) on human health. <b>Nutrigenomics</b> has been associated with the idea of personalized nutrition based on genotype. While there is hope that <b>nutrigenomics</b> will ultimately enable such personalised dietary advice, it is a science still in its infancy and its contribution to public health over the next decade is thought to be major. Whilst <b>nutrigenomics</b> is aimed at developing an understanding of how the whole body responds to a food via systems biology, research into the effect of a single gene/single food compound relationships is known as nutrigenetics.|$|E
50|$|Obesity {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely studied topics in <b>nutrigenomics.</b> Due to genetic {{variations}} among individuals, each person could respond to diet differently. By exploring the interaction between dietary pattern and genetic factors, <b>nutrigenomics</b> aim to suggest prevention measures and/ or treatment to obesity via personal nutrition.|$|E
50|$|To put <b>nutrigenomics</b> into practice, {{genetic testing}} is {{required}} as {{the test results}} act as the reference for diagnosis. Genetic testing has been met with many concerns surrounding ethics and regulations. These concerns inherently become a part of, if not augmented by <b>Nutrigenomics,</b> a field that looks to provide highly personalized information.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Nutrigenomics</b> {{emerged as}} a {{possible}} way to fix gaps in the current field of nutritional science. The development of technology to analyze the genome such as different types of sequencing and different microarrays suggest {{a new way to}} reinforce current theories or hypotheses. Existing information from genetic research directs emerging research in <b>nutrigenomics.</b> Individuals within the same population or even the same family have genetic variability. There is a lack of consistent relationships between certain foods and nutrients and increased disease risk, most likely due to this type of variation. [...] <b>Nutrigenomics</b> is highly personalized because it looks at biomarkers within each individual. One group of researchers suggest that current technology can be used to build an ideal diet/intake of certain nutrients, or a 'nutriome.' A 'nutriome' would ensure proper function of all pathways involved in genome maintenance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nutrigenomics</b> {{can be used}} {{to develop}} new, {{alternative}} treatments that target the altered cancer cell metabolism. The alternative way of energy production in cancer cell metabolism, the Warburg effect, in which glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation are the main means of energy production opposed to oxidative reduction. Certain nutrients may provide ways to starve or inhibit this type of metabolism. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which affect gene expression related to inflammation and other nutrients that have displayed potential in repressing cancer cell metabolism. Another practical application of <b>nutrigenomics</b> to cancer may be identifying nutrient that is a cofactor of a compromised pathway where consuming a surplus of could potentially reduce the compromised pathway’s negative consequences. A <b>nutrigenomics</b> approach could provide a safe, holistic model to mitigate tumor growth in place of existing cancer treatments that often have harsh side effects and are not always effective.|$|E

5000|$|Cell {{signaling}} is {{an important}} component of regulation of gene expression and metabolism, relying on both internal and external signals to ensure the body is maintaining homeostasis. Individual nutrients can each be considered signals, with the summation of their effects being the diet. The effort of <b>nutrigenomics</b> is to identify this [...] "dietary signature", or pattern of effects ranging from effects at the cellular level to entire body systems. However it is often hard to monitor the diet of an individual, and current protocols should be improved. The desired outcome from this type of research is to identify genetic factors for chronic diseases and conditions, whether it be a certain gene itself or an epigenetic marker, and how foods influence it. <b>Nutrigenomics</b> looks mainly to be a way of identifying individuals predisposed for conditions and preventing onset.

The information they received was varied and not medically verified, and two companies tried to market general supplements as 'individualized'. The GAO study was also rudimentary, without taking into concern that differing environmental factors may affect results.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nutrigenomics</b> is a {{generalised}} term which links genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics {{to human}} nutrition.

The large bowel microflora are also a very significant potential confounder of metabolic profiles and {{could be classified as}} either an endogenous or exogenous factor. The main exogenous factors are diet and drugs. Diet can then be broken down to nutrients and non- nutrients. Metabolomics is one means to determine a biological endpoint, or metabolic fingerprint, which reflects the balance of all these forces on an individual's metabolism.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Nutrigenomics</b> {{may be able}} to {{supplement}} current oncology. There is a wealth of information about processes that occur within genome maintenance that prevent cell abnormalities linked to cancer and certain nutrients that play a role as cofactors. Genome damage caused by micronutrient deficiency may be just as severe as damage owed to exposure to certain environmental carcinogens. If these micronutrients can be identified, with concrete evidence, the risk for cancer in some individuals could be significantly reduced. One such micronutrient may be folate. In one experiment, folate was given to cells in different concentrations and those with less folate exhibited as much damage to their chromosomes as they would have exhibited with a heavy amount of radiation.|$|E

Proteomics and metabolomics have no standardized procedures yet, but usually, proteome analysis is done by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, while metabolome analysis is conducted through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-nuclear magnetic resonance. Usually, these technologies are applied in a “differential display” mode, i.e. by comparing two situations (e.g. diseased versus healthy) {{in order to reduce}} the complexity in data by examining only differences.|$|E

5000|$|There are studies {{suggesting}} genetic factors {{account for}} a fair proportion of inter-individual BMI (Body Mass Index). Among different types of genetic variation between humans, SNPs are suggested {{to be the most}} important marker for the study of <b>nutrigenomics.</b> [...] Multiple studies have found association between SNPs and obesity. One of the most well known obesity associating gene is the FTO gene. Among studied individuals, it was found that those with AA genotype showed a higher BMI compared those with TT genotype when having high fat or low carbohydrate dietary intake. [...] The APO B SNP rs512535 is another obesity related variation. It was found that the A/G heterozygous genotype was found to have association with obesity (in terms of BMI and waist circumference). The same study also found that for individuals with habitual high fat diet (>35% of energy intaken), individuals with GG homozygotes genotype showed higher BMI compared to AA allele carriers. However, this difference is not found in low fat consuming group (<35% of energy intaken). Besides the FTO genes and APO B, SNPs in various genes such as MC4R, SH2B1, MTCH2, SEC16B etc. have been found to be associated with obesity. Although many of these genetic variations are found in populations all over the world, there are also variations unique to certain races or populations.|$|E
