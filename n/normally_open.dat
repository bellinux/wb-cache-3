5|$|A {{rectangular}} swimming area on {{the southern}} bank was opened in 1930. Known as Lansbury's Lido, it is partitioned {{off from the rest}} of the lake by a perimeter of buoys. There is a fee for entering the lido, and changing rooms are available. It is <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> only in the summer, typically between 10:00 and 17:30, although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 06:00 to 09:30. The Peter Pan Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants in the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter.|$|E
5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. <b>Normally</b> <b>open</b> to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E

25|$|The square is <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> to the public, {{but remains}} under heavy security. Before entry, {{visitors}} and their belongings are searched, {{a common practice}} at many Chinese tourist sites, although the square is somewhat unusual in that domestic visitors often have their identification documents checked {{and the purpose of}} their visit questioned. Both plain-clothes and uniformed police officers patrol the area. There are numerous fire extinguishers placed in the area to put out flames should a protester attempt self-immolation.|$|E
25|$|A kitten, {{also known}} as a kitty or kitty cat, is a {{juvenile}} cat. After being born, kittens are totally dependent on their mother for survival and they do not <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> their eyes until after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and enjoy human companionship.|$|E

The Cathedral is now also known as the National Shrine of the Apostle Paul.|$|E
25|$|In {{countries}} where Christianity {{is a state}} religion, or where the country has large Christian population, Easter is often a public holiday. As Easter is always a Sunday, many {{countries in the world}} also have Easter Monday as a public holiday. Some retail stores, shopping malls, and restaurants are closed on Easter Sunday. Good Friday, which occurs two days before Easter Sunday, is also a public holiday in many countries, as well as in 12 U.S. states. Even in states where Good Friday is not a holiday, many financial institutions, stock markets, and public schools are closed. Few banks that are <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> on regular Sundays are closed on Easter.|$|E
25|$|The main {{locomotive}} {{works are}} located at Bridgnorth. It is not <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> {{to the public}} but conducted tours and open days are arranged from time to time. Major features of the locomotive works include the boiler shop equipped with overhead crane, Noble and Lund wheel lathe, ex-LT lifting jacks and a Wheeldrop recovered from Leicestershire, installed in 2010. Works to enclose {{the southern end of}} Bridgnorth locomotive shed with roller shutter doors, improve natural illumination and waterproof the building more effectively were completed in early 2009. This forms the first of a number of phases to improve the Bridgnorth site both for staff and for visitors.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{according}} to Greil Marcus, Laughton {{was the main}} act of Sullivan's show. [...] "Presley was the headliner, and a Sullivan headliner <b>normally</b> <b>opened</b> the show, but Sullivan was burying him. Laughton {{had to make the}} moment invisible: to act as if nobody was actually waiting for anything. He did it instantly, with complete command, with the sort of television presence that some have and some—Steve Allen, or Ed Sullivan himself—don't." ...|$|R

25|$|Although {{carriage}} {{repair and}} restoration {{is carried out}} {{at a number of}} locations on the railway, the main carriage works is located in the former goods shed at Kidderminster. This building, lying adjacent to the main national railway line, is known as the North Star Carriage Works thus perpetuating a typical GWR name. As well as having a machine shop and fabrication equipment to carry out a full range of body and bogie repairs the carriage works boasts equipment recovered from former BR works to calibrate and adjust dynamo voltage regulators and to thoroughly overhaul and test vacuum brake equipment, a facility that is almost extinct elsewhere. In common with the locomotive works it is not <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> to the public due to health and safety legislation.|$|E
25|$|Giant sequoias are in {{many ways}} adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> {{immediately}} after a fire. The giant sequoias are having difficulty reproducing in their original habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only being able to grow successfully in full sun and in mineral-rich soils, free from competing vegetation. Although the seeds can germinate in moist needle humus in the spring, these seedlings will die as the duff dries in the summer. They therefore require periodic wildfire to clear competing vegetation and soil humus before successful regeneration can occur. Without fire, shade-loving species will crowd out young sequoia seedlings, and sequoia seeds will not germinate. When fully grown, these trees typically require large amounts of water and are therefore often concentrated near streams.|$|E
25|$|There are depletion-mode MOSFET devices, {{which are}} less {{commonly}} used {{than the standard}} enhancement-mode devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source. To control the channel, a negative voltage {{is applied to the}} gate (for an n-channel device), depleting the channel, which reduces the current flow through the device. In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a normally closed (on) switch, while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a <b>normally</b> <b>open</b> (off) switch. Due to their low noise figure in the RF region, and better gain, these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front-ends such as in TV sets. Depletion-mode MOSFET families include BF960 by Siemens and Telefunken, and the BF980 in the 1980s by Philips (later to become NXP Semiconductors), whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front-ends.|$|E
40|$|The {{coronary}} sinus <b>normally</b> <b>opens</b> {{into the}} right atrium through a single orifice. Past research studies have described various anomalies of the coronary sinus but there are fewer reports on multiple orifices of the coronary sinus. The present study reports two additional orifices of the coronary sinus opening {{into the right}} atrium and associated anomalous vessels. The presence of multiple orifices may be clinically important during any catheterization and cardiac surgeries and for proper interpretation of angiographic studies...|$|R

The temple is <b>normally</b> <b>opened</b> between 5 in the morning till 10 at night, but open 24 hours during the main festival days like Mahashivratri, Ram Navami etc. Khare added [...] "Three other small temples are here one is Sheeatla Mata, Kalika Mata and Zari Mari Mata." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{location}} was originally a hofje called Hof van Zessen. In 1815 plans {{were made to}} build a museum there (the first building called a [...] "museum" [...] in Leiden). It opened in 1820, and until 1913, the museum <b>normally</b> <b>opened</b> to the public on Sundays. In 1913, the museum {{moved to a new}} building, with very little room available for exhibits, and in 1950, this room was also closed. After that, there were a few opportunities for guided tours, attending lectures, and temporary exhibitions.|$|R
