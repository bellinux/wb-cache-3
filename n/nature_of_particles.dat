50|$|Ranger 1 was a {{prototype}} spacecraft launched {{as part of}} the Ranger program of unmanned space missions. Its primary mission was to test the performance of those functions and parts necessary for carrying out subsequent lunar and planetary missions; a secondary objective was to study the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> and fields in the space environment. Due to a launch vehicle malfunction, the spacecraft could only reach Low Earth orbit, rather than the high Earth orbit that had been planned, and was only able to complete part of its mission.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} wave <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles,</b> diffraction effects have alsobeen observed with atoms—effects which {{are similar to}} those in the case of light.Chapman et al. carried out an experiment in which a collimated beam of sodium atoms was passed through two diffraction gratings (the second used as a mask) to observe the Talbot effect and measure the Talbot length. The beam had a mean velocity of 1000 m/s corresponding to a de Broglie wavelength of [...] = 0.017 nm. Their experiment was performed with 200 and 300 nm gratings which yielded Talbot lengths of 4.7 and 10.6 mm respectively. This showed that for an atomic beam of constant velocity, by using , the atomic Talbot length {{can be found in the}} same manner.|$|E
50|$|Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information is {{a popular}} science book by Vlatko Vedral {{published}} by Oxford University Press in 2010. Vedral examines information theory and proposes information as the most fundamental building block of reality. He argues what a useful framework this is for viewing all natural and physical phenomena. In building out this framework the books touches upon the origin of information, the idea of entropy, the roots of this thinking in thermodynamics, the replication of DNA, development of social networks, quantum behaviour at the micro and macro level, and the very role of indeterminism in the universe. The book finishes by considering {{the answer to the}} ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The ideas address concepts related to the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles,</b> time, determinism, and of reality itself.|$|E

Apart from a broad size determination very few {{attempts have been made}} at devising means of describing profile textures <b>of</b> <b>particles.</b> An approach is presented for describing the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> shape and surface texture, as detected on the particle profile. Careful processing and analysis of the digitised image enabled both the sizes of micro-projections and their relative numbers to be determined. Such processing of images of a large number <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> generated a considerable amount of data. An artificial neural network was used to categorise the data and to compare the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> fretting <b>particles</b> generated by titanium, titanium-molybdenum and stainless steel.

50|$|The book {{explains}} {{the world as}} being made up of information. The Universe and its workings are {{the ebb and flow}} of information. We are all transient patterns of information, passing on the recipe for our basic forms to future generations using a four-letter digital code called DNA. In this engaging and mind-stretching account, Vlatko Vedral considers some of the deepest questions about the Universe and considers the implications of interpreting it in terms of information. He {{explains the}} nature of information, the idea of entropy, and the roots of this thinking in thermodynamics. He describes the bizarre effects of quantum behaviour - effects such as 'entanglement', which Einstein called 'spooky action at a distance' and explores cutting edge work on the harnessing quantum effects in hyperfast quantum computers, and how recent evidence suggests that the weirdness of the quantum world, once thought limited to the tiniest scales, may reach into the macro world. Vedral finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The answers he considers are exhilarating, drawing upon the work of distinguished physicist John Wheeler and his concept of “it from bit”. The ideas challenge our concept of the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles,</b> of time, of determinism, and of reality itself.|$|E

Laboratory and field observations show that high relative humidity enhances the cementation of particles to underlying surfaces.

The cements, which can form {{in a matter of}} hours at high humidity, appear to be microcrystalline calcites.

Using the result of SIM images after cross-cutting of the sample by FIB, it is concluded that diamond does not grow on the substrate and running process is not CVD.

40|$|We {{show how}} {{to define a}} {{consistent}} braneworld cosmology in a model in which the brane is constructed as a field-theoretic domain wall of finite thickness. The Friedmann, Robertson-Walker metric is recovered {{in the region of}} the brane, but, remarkably, with scale factor that depends on particle energy and on particle species, constituting a breakdown of the weak equivalence principle on sufficiently small scales. This unusual effect comes from the extended <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> confined to a domain-wall brane, {{and the fact that they}} feel an "average" of the bulk spacetime. We demonstrate how to recover the standard results of brane cosmology in the infinitely-thin brane limit, and comment on how our results have the potential to place bounds on parameters such as the thickness of domain-wall braneworlds.

40|$|Hot wire anemometry {{was used}} to {{identify}} the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> reportedly observed during free stream velocity measurements in the Langley 0. 3 -meter transonic cryogenic tunnel using a Laser Doppler Velocimeter. Since the heat-transfer process from the hot wire depends on the thermal conductivity and sticking capability of the particles, it was anticipated that the hot wire anemometer response would be affected differently upon impaction by liquid droplets and solid aerosols in the test gas stream. Based on the measured time response of the hot-wire anemometer in the cryogenic tunnel operated in the 0. 3 - 0. 8 Mach number range, it is concluded that the particles impacting the hot wire are liquid in nature rather than solid aerosols. It is further surmised that the liquid aerosols are unevaporated liquid nitrogen droplets used for cooling the tunnel test gas...|$|E
