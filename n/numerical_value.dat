Some Rebbes requested from the Hasid a sum of money equal to twice the <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> of the Hebrew word Chai (life), which equals 18. Others took an amount of money equal to the <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> of the letters of the Hebrew names of the Hasid or his wife.|$|E

The update also addressed several issues with matchmaking, including adding bots in place of players who have quit or lost connection to the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E
