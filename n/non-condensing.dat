25|$|Metal liners may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and <b>non-condensing</b> oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with <b>non-condensing</b> gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall stainless steel pipe or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent <b>non-condensing</b> gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer. Condensing boilers do not need a chimney.|$|E
25|$|Until about 1800 {{the most}} common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine, built as an {{integral}} part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the table engine. Around the start of the 19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick and the American Oliver Evans began to construct higher-pressure <b>non-condensing</b> steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere.

40|$|This study aims at {{comparing}} non-linear modal {{interactions in}} shallow horizontal cables with kinematically <b>non-condensed</b> vs. condensed modeling, under simultaneous primary {{external and internal}} resonances. Planar 1 : 1 or 2 : 1 internal resonance is considered. The governing partial-differential equations of motion of <b>non-condensed</b> model account for spatio-temporal modification of dynamic tension, and explicitly capture non-linear coupling of longitudinal/ vertical displacements. On the contrary, in the condensed model, a single integro-differential equation is obtained by eliminating the longitudinal inertia according to a quasi-static cable stretching assumption, which entails spatially uniform dynamic tension. This model is largely considered in the literature. Based on a multi-modal discretization and a second-order multiple scales solution accounting for higher-order quadratic effects of a infinite number of modes, coupled/uncoupled dynamic responses and the associated stability are evaluated by means of frequency- and force-response diagrams. Direct numerical integrations confirm the occurrence of amplitude-steady or -modulated responses. Non-linear dynamic configurations and tensions are also examined. Depending on internal resonance condition, system elasto-geometric and control parameters, the condensed model may lead to significant quantitative and/or qualitative discrepancies, against the <b>non-condensed</b> model, {{in the evaluation of}} resonant dynamic responses, bifurcations and maximal/minimal stresses. Results of even shallow cables reveal meaningful drawbacks of the kinematic condensation and allow us to detect cases where the more accurate <b>non-condensed</b> model has to be used...|$|R
25|$|The puffers {{developed}} from the , small single masted sailing barges which took most of the coasting trade. The original puffer was the Thomas, an iron canal boat of 1856, less than 66ft (20 m) long to fit in the Forth and Clyde Canal locks, powered by a simple steam engine without a condenser, since as it drew fresh water from the canal {{there was no need}} to economise on water use. Once steam had been used by the engine, it was simply exhausted up the funnel in a series of puffs as the piston stroked. As well as the visual sight of a series of steam puffs following the boat, the simple engines made a characteristic puffing sound. By the 1870s similar boats were being adapted for use beyond the canal and fitted with condensers so that they no longer puffed, but the name stuck. Some <b>non-condensing</b> puffers (included those with compound engines) were built until the 1920s when purely canal traffic decreased and the vast majority of coasters had to operate in sea water. A derrick was added to the single mast to lift cargo.|$|E

2500|$|The usual {{arrangement}} on {{a compound}} engine {{is that the}} steam is first expanded {{in one or two}} high-pressure (HP) cylinder(s), then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts into a larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinder, (or two, - or more), thus extending the cycle. Thus the cylinders can be said to work in [...] "series" [...] as opposed to the normal arrangement of a simple-expansion locomotive where they work in [...] "parallel", the steam being expanded just once in any one cylinder. In order to balance piston thrusts of a compound, the HP:LP cylinder volume ratio has to be carefully determined, usually by increasing the LP cylinder diameter and/or by lengthening the stroke. [...] In <b>non-condensing</b> engines, the HP:LP volume ratio is usually 1:2¼. [...] On geared locomotives, cylinder volumes can be kept more or less identical by increasing LP piston speed. [...] Strictly speaking compound only stands for double-expansion, but the term is loosely applied to any multiple-expansion engine. The instances where railway locomotives have employed triple-expansion with steam going from high-pressure (HP) cylinder, to medium-pressure (MP) cylinder and finally to a low-pressure (LP) one are rare, but triple-expansion engines were very common in steamships in the late 19th/early 20th centuries.|$|E

Moreover, fork dislocations in the density fringes provide direct experimental evidence for the formation of pinned half quantum vortices in the magnon condensate.
