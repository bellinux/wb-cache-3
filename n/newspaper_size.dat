6000|$|He couldn't {{quite yet}} force it upon Woollett {{that such a}} career, such a perverted young life, showed after all a certain {{plausible}} side, DID in the case before them flaunt something like an impunity for the social man; but he could at least treat himself to the statement that would prepare him for the sharpest echo. This echo--as distinct {{over there in the}} dry thin air as some shrill [...] "heading" [...] above a column of print--seemed to reach him even as he wrote. [...] "He says there's no woman," [...] he could hear Mrs. Newsome report, in capitals almost of <b>newspaper</b> <b>size,</b> to Mrs. Pocock; and he could focus in Mrs. Pocock the response of the reader of the journal. He could see in the younger lady's face the earnestness of her attention and catch the full scepticism of her but slightly delayed [...] "What is there then?" [...] Just so he could again as little miss the mother's clear decision: [...] "There's plenty of disposition, no doubt, to pretend there isn't." [...] Strether had, after posting his letter, the whole scene out; and it was a scene during which, coming and going, as befell, he kept his eye not least upon the daughter. He had his fine sense of the conviction Mrs. Pocock would take occasion to reaffirm--a conviction bearing, as he had from the first deeply divined it to bear, on Mr. Strether's essential inaptitude. She had looked him in his conscious eyes even before he sailed, and that she didn't believe HE would find the woman had been written in her book. Hadn't she at the best but a scant faith in his ability to find women? It wasn't even as if he had found her mother--so much more, to her discrimination, had her mother performed the finding. Her mother had, in a case her private judgement of which remained educative of Mrs. Pocock's critical sense, found the man. The man owed his unchallenged state, in general, to the fact that Mrs. Newsome's discoveries were accepted at Woollett; but he knew in his bones, our friend did, how almost irresistibly Mrs. Pocock would now be moved to show what she thought of his own. Give HER a free hand, would be the moral, and the woman would soon be found.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study shows}} that Nordic daily newspapers—like their American peers—will have to change their content to conform more to the tastes of readers or—at the very least—find a more reader-friendly way to present the news. The authors compare {{national}} surveys of Nordic and U. S. editors charged with the practical aspects of choosing, justifying, editing, and publishing the news. In a search for values that underlie decision-making styles, the study uncovers five style predictors: gender, <b>newspaper</b> <b>size,</b> and journalistic values. Audience-related values, although not significant predictors, do find a home among Nordic editors, in contrast to U. S. editors. The findings, while suggesting managerial tools that newspaper editors can use, also indicates no global, overarching management style would be appropriate in tackling industry ills...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{relationships}} among newspaper circulation size, type, and marketing and circulation costs. The paper uses {{data from a}} sample of newspapers to acquire clearer evidence {{about the nature of}} the relationships. The results challenge assertions about the relationships in a number of media texts that are based on anecdotal and experiential evidence. The paper then provides improved models of the relationships for use in teaching and improving professional understanding and practice. Despite the growth of scholarship in media economics and management in the past two decades, much knowledge remains based on untested conventional wisdom or assertions based on anecdotal industry observations. Although research is increasingly focusing on a broader array of questions, many fundamental relationships and interactions remain unexplored. Despite its significance to the economics of newspapers and to managerial decision-making, one area that has been relatively unexplored is the relationships between <b>newspaper</b> <b>size,</b> single copy sales, marketing costs, and distribution costs. As the size of newspapers increase— evidenced by higher circulation—expenses for acquiring, maintaining, and servicing customers obviously increase as well...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} study of the U. S. political process {{from the perspective of}} media, voters and candidates. In the first chapter, I analyze the sources of media bias. In the second chapter, I focus on economically self-interested voting. The third chapter studies the effectiveness of negative campaigning. In the next three paragraphs, I summarize these three chapters With the advent of internet, many U. S. metropolitan areas have seen newspaper closures due to declining revenues. This provides the researcher with an opportunity to analyze the microeconomic sources of media bias. This paper uses a large panel data set of newspaper archives for 102 newspapers over 238 months (1990 - 2009). I find that, after controlling for the unemployment rate and the change in unemployment rate, conservative newspapers report 19 % more unemployment news when the President is a Democrat rather than a Republican, before the closure of a rival newspaper in the same media market. This effect is 12 % for liberal newspapers. After the closure, these numbers are 3. 5 % and 1 %, respectively. This moderation of media bias after closure of a rival newspaper stands as <b>newspaper</b> <b>size,</b> newspaper fixed-effects or metropolitan area fixed-effects are included. I also find that newspapers in smaller metropolitan areas have a larger moderation in their bias. My findings provide support for theories in which media-bias is demand-driven, as surviving newspapers aim to increase their sales by gaining the former readers of a closed newspaper in the same media market. 	 A long literature investigates the influence of income on voting behavior, but it focuses primarily on presidential elections. We ask whether economically self-interested voting is unique to the presidential elections, or if it also extends to House, Senate and gubernatorial elections. In addition, for each office, we look for the presence of absolute income effects and relative income effects. Voters do indeed appear to vote in an economically self-interested manner for each office, but we show that in all elections but presidential elections, this effect is largely generated by the correlation of income with political issue stances. Controlling for voter stances on a number of social and economic issues, there is little evidence of partisan differences in voting according to income outside of presidential elections. Our findings at once support previous studies, but illustrate that presidential elections are very much a special case in US socio-political behavior. 	 Political candidates commonly use negative TV ads to attack their opponents. In very limited research on effectiveness of negative campaigning, endogeneity problem has not been addressed and trait ads were not separated from issue ads. In this project, I use instrumental variables estimates of the effectiveness of negative campaigning and distinguish between issue ads and trait ads. Using 162 U. S. Senate Elections between 1998 and 2008, I find that negative issue campaigning is effective for challengers in significantly reducing the incumbent???s vote, although this effect is not large enough to change the election outcome in lopsided elections. In competitive elections, I find that challenger???s negative issue ads can change the election outcome. I do not find any significant effects of negative issue ads by an incumbent, except for competitive elections. Both incumbents and challengers hurt themselves if they resort to negative trait ads (personal attacks) ...|$|E

40|$|Presidents {{have turned}} {{increasingly}} to local media {{to build support}} for their policy initiatives, as evidenced by President George W. Bush’s recent and unprecedented efforts to reform Social Security. In this article, we examine local newspaper coverage of the president’s reform tour and the success he had “going local. ” We find that local newspapers tended to be positive, but mostly descriptive, in their coverage of the president’s reform tour. Local news stories not only differ from national coverage but also from each other: a <b>newspaper’s</b> <b>size</b> and location affect the content of local news coverage of the presidency. We conclude with an assessment of the usefulness of a “going local ” governing strategy in light of these findings. Leading the media, public, and Congress through speeches {{is at the core of}} presi-dential governance. But just as the modern political environment requires presidents to appeal for support through speeches, presidents are increasingly unable to cultivate it.
