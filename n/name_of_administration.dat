40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of History, Washington State UniversityAmerican Protestants adopted {{organizational}} efficiency as {{a spiritual}} virtue {{in the first three}} decades of the twentieth century. Driven by a devotional impulse to manage and systematize the practice of their faith, they hardened the boundaries of membership in their religious communities around formal administrative attachments. However, the resulting church organizations proved inhospitable to many Protestants who sought to express their spiritual identity through other ways than administration. Thus the organizational revolution precipitated religious friction and permanently realigned the Protestant landscape in the United States. Inspired by practices in the business world around them, Protestants began reorganizing their churches {{around the turn of the}} twentieth century. They consolidated their missionary, educational and benevolence agencies; they integrated local, regional and national expressions of church life; and they organized these diverse activities under centrally-administered systems of management and control. This organizational revolution produced important consequences. First, the expanding domain of church administration opened new opportunities for women to pursue valued religious work, for Protestants did not view administration as inherently masculine work. They eventually removed longstanding barriers against women's ordination. Yet the same administrative impulse downgraded the meaning of ordination, stripping it of the sacral significance it had previously held. Thus, traditional notions of women's subordination persisted even as women began occupying ecclesiastical positions that were previously open only to men. Second, many Protestants placed doctrine above formal organizational attachment as the basis for religious communion. They became disenchanted when efficiency-minded church leaders cast aside their theological concerns in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b> Schism ensued, which marked the beginning of permanent realignments in American Protestantism. Historians typically frame the religious controversies of the 1920 s and ` 30 s within a narrative of two warring camps [...] the so-called fundamentalists and modernists. They also position women within a largely separate historical narrative. This dissertation resituates these developments within the broader story of the contentious organizational revolution, which shifted gendered understandings of religious work. Ardent Protestants driven by their differing theological views [...] men and women alike [...] were not the polar opposites they are often portrayed to be. They became casualties of the gospel of efficiency. Department of History, Washington State Universit...|$|E

5000|$|When {{the library}} {{district}} administration board {{was created in}} 1994 with the merger of the Ludington City Library and the County Library in Scottville - the promise was made to maintain {{as much as possible}} 2 fully functioning libraries - that neither would be considered a 'branch' of the other. The Mason County District Library is the formal <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>administration</b> for both libraries. Under the Mason County District Library system umbrella these libraries are referred to as the Ludington 'branch' or the Scottville 'branch.' The Mason County District Library administration system itself is not any independent building. These libraries are each fully independent libraries maintaining the same open hours. [...] The Mason County District Library is the formal <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>administration</b> for both libraries but each library continues to be known as either the Ludington Public Library or the Scottville Public Library. The reason the board was established was to pool the resources of the city library (Ludington) with the county library (Scottville) and to eliminate duplication of services. The process was to develop a board of combining the resources of the city and county under one district library administration called the [...] "Mason County District Library". It is designed to offer [...] "enhanced service" [...] over the separate city and county library operations. There would be a [...]5 mill tax on property owners of Mason County and then no need for funding from the city or county. It would save the residents of the city and county over $100,000 per year starting in 1996.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{frequency}} of drug prescription errors is high. Excluding errors in decision making, the remaining are mainly due to order ambiguity, non standard nomenclature and writing illegibility. The {{aim of this}} study is to analyse, as a part of a continuous quality improvement program, the quality of prescriptions writing for antibiotics, in an Italian University Hospital as a risk factor for prescription errors. Methods The point prevalence survey, carried out in May 26 – 30 2008, involved 41 inpatient Units. Every parenteral or oral antibiotic prescription was analysed for legibility (generic or brand drug <b>name,</b> dose, frequency <b>of</b> <b>administration)</b> and completeness (generic or brand <b>name,</b> dose, frequency <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> route <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> date <b>of</b> prescription and signature of the prescriber). Eight doctors (residents in Hygiene and Preventive Medicine) and two pharmacists performed the survey by reviewing the clinical records of medical, surgical or intensive care section inpatients. The antibiotics drug category was chosen because its use is widespread in the setting considered. Results Out of 756 inpatients included in the study, 408 antibiotic prescriptions were found in 298 patients (mean prescriptions per patient 1. 4; SD ± 0. 6). Overall 92. 7 % (38 / 41) of the Units had at least one patient with antibiotic prescription. Legibility was in compliance with 78. 9 % of generic or brand names, 69. 4 % of doses, 80. 1 % <b>of</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> whereas completeness was fulfilled for 95. 6 % of generic or brand names, 76. 7 % of doses, 83. 6 % <b>of</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> 87 % <b>of</b> routes <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> 43. 9 % of dates of prescription and 33. 3 % of physician's signature. Overall 23. 9 % of prescriptions were illegible and 29. 9 % of prescriptions were incomplete. Legibility and completeness are higher in unusual drugs prescriptions. Conclusion The Intensive Care Section performed best as far as quality of prescription writing was concerned when compared with the Medical and Surgical Sections. Nevertheless the overall illegibility and incompleteness (above 20 %) are unacceptably high. Values need to be improved by enhancing the safety culture and in particular the awareness of the professionals on the consequences that a bad prescription writing can produce. </p...|$|R
