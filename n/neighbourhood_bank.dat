By looking at the post-war planning policy of two specific urban <b>neighbourhoods,</b> the South <b>Bank</b> in London and the Leopold Quarter in Brussels, it seeks to demonstrate and clarify: 1) the growing political impotence of urban strategies, plans, policies and research projects that attempt to tacke deprivation; 2) the dystopianisation of the contemporary city in general and inner-city neighbourhoods in particular {{and the absence of}} comprehensive visions for solving urban problems; 3) the transformation of inner-city misery into a 'spectacle' that serves the well-defined interests of elitist groups in urban societies; 4) the tactics of rescaling poverty and prosperity which are embedded in processes of empowerment and disempowerment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the {{persistence}} of inner-city deprivation in spite of sustained regeneration efforts, through demonstrating how urban regeneration policies are embedded in peculiar political-institutional power dynamics that actually contribute to the further disempowerment of the already disempowered groups in inner cities. The reconstruction of the post-war planning history of one specific urban <b>neighbourhood,</b> the South <b>Bank</b> in central London, will allow to demonstrate how the constantly reworked urban regeneration models comprise specific power relations that have important repercussions for the success and failure of regeneration programmes. The focus here will particularly be on how {{the fall of the}} South Bank's prominent era of community-based development in the 1970 s is firmly embedded in changing political-institutional frameworks that, after a spell of `community power', were soon to restore the power of the local cultural, political and business elites over the local regeneration agenda...|$|R
40|$|Rather than viewing {{neighbourhood}} {{decline as}} a natural process resulting from the in-flow of low-income households, this study uses a socio-spatial approach that looks at the structuration of neighbourhood decline by emphasising the power of agents/actors, linking {{the structure of the}} real estate industry {{to the development of the}} <b>neighbourhood.</b> Landlords and <b>banks</b> are not merely automata of the price mechanism that steer the natural operation of the market, but should be seen as intentionally and unintentionally restructuring the local real estate market and thus possibly producing, or contributing to, processes of neighbourhood decline. This paper presents the Tarwewijk (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) as a case study of neighbourhood decline. Attention is paid to the social and physical decline of the neighbourhood, drug dealing, undocumented immigrants and processes impacting the housing market such as speculation, blockbusting, milking and redlining. It is argued that the retreat of ‘formal’ actors, such as banks and bona fide landlords, stimulates the rise of the underworld in both the housing and drugs markets. status: publishe...|$|R

Segmenting images into regions of constant texture is used in many applications. This work surveys {{a wide range of}} texture descriptors and segmentation methods to determine {{the state of the art}} in texture segmentation. Two types of texture descriptors are investigated: filter bank based methods and local descriptors. Filter banks deconstruct an image into several bands, each of which emphasises areas of the image with different properties. Textons are an adaptive histogram method which describes the distribution of typical feature vectors. Local descriptors calculate features from smaller <b>neighbourhoods</b> than filter <b>banks.</b> Some local descriptors calculate a scale for their local neighbourhood to achieve scale invariance. Both local and global segmentation methods are investigated. Local segmentation methods consider each pixel in isolation. Global segmentation methods penalise jagged borders or fragmented regions in the segmentation. Pixel labelling and border detection methods are investigated. Methods for measuring the accuracy of segmentation are discussed. Two data sets are used to test the texture segmentation algorithms. The Brodatz Album mosaics are composed of grayscale texture images from the Brodatz Album. The Berkeley Natural Images data set has 300 colour images of natural scenes. The tests show that, of the descriptors tested, filter bank based textons are the best texture descriptors for grayscale images. Local image patch textons are best for colour images. Graph cut segmentation is best for pixel labelling problems and edge detection with regular borders. Non-maxima suppression is best for edge detection with irregular borders. Factors affecting the performance of the algorithms are investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{historical}} {{geography of the}} West Scheldt region, in particular the southeastern part of it bas been studied both by historians and geographers, {{but there is no}} consensus between them about the genesis of the landscape which bas been influenced by the presence of the river Scheldt. In this article we try to bring together the different points of view as well as their argumentation, to which new interpretation is added in order to come to an integration of the sources and -in our opinion -to provide an acceptable explanation of the {{historical geography}} of that region. There can be made a crude distinction between three regions in the area under consideration, which run more or less parallel to the West Scheldt river. First there is the most southerly area {{on both sides of the}} frontier between Belgium and the Netherlands. There is historical evidence that this region was largely covered with peat during the Middle Ages (fig. 1). De moeren, as this area was called in Dutch, were systematically drained from the 12 th century on- wards and parceled out by important entrepreneurs from the cities as well as by religious institutions (such as the abbey of St. Baafs in Ghent), to dig out the valuable fuel and to make arable land after- wards. In this part of the region all the peat has been excavated. This was easy to do because of the thinness of the peat layer caused by a higher positition of the underlying pleistocene deposits. To this day this pleistocene sandy soil preserves its typicallinear settlement with an organisation of the land in small strips (Marsch- hufenfluren) (see figs. 2 and 3). Some Belgian geographers in- correctly considered this field pattern as typical of the Flemish sandy soils"(!), denying or neglecting the nearness of the West Scheldt in the formation of the landscape. The second region we studied is the area at present covered with a layer of clay. Contrary to what has sometimes been pointed out, this clay is of rather recent genesis. The Dunkerque transgressions had little influence on these deposits, but the artificial inundations of the later sixteenth century are for the greater part responsible for this important sedimentation. Historical sources prove a very intensive activity of peat digging here during the later Middle Ages. Some misunderstandings of this matter, resulting from palynological research, are probably caused by the fact that the top of the peat layer is mostly missing by peat exploitation or by erosion. Nevertheless, we could calculate that in the parishes Kieldrecht, Verrebroek and Kallo a minimum of 100, 000 m J of peat was digged out in the year 1400. If the activity went on with the same intensity every year, about I meter would have been excavated in one century in an area with a surface of about 250 acres. Some geographers, believing in early clay sedimentation, consider peat digging in this region most unlikely. Finally, the last region under consideration is the rather narrow territory near the West Scheldt. Of course the history of the deposits within this region is closely tied to the history of the origin of the West Scheldt itself. Written sources are insufficient to resolve the problem. Pollenanalytical observations on useful samples, in combination with radiocarbon datings led to the conclusion that this branch of the Scheldt has a post-Roman genesis, at the earliest dating from the Dunkerque II transgression (fig. 5 Waarde and Oorderen). In the beginning the tides will have had little influence, as can be shown by the peat which continued to grow in the <b>neighbourhood</b> of the <b>banks</b> of the West and the Lower Scheldt probably until the year 1000. Evidence for this conclusion is provided in the pollenanalyses of Saaftinge and Zandvliet where, after the second Subatlantic fagus maximum -in Zandvliet C 14 dated 940 A. D. - the peat kept growing for a certain time (see fig. 5) ...|$|R
