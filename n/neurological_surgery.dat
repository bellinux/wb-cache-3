Identifying the long-term adverse effects of treatment has become increasingly important as patients try to resume previous activities and an independent lifestyle.

In a small pilot study of four women with female sexual arousal disorder, Maravilla reported {{there was less}} brain activation seen in this group, including very little activation in the amygdala. These women also showed increased activation in the temporal areas, in contrast to women without sexual difficulties, who showed deactivation in similar areas. This may suggest an increased level of inhibition with an arousal stimulus in this small group of women with FSAD.|$|E

40|$|Introduction {{into the}} topic: This {{bachelor}} thesis {{is focused on}} nursing care of children with headaches. The nursing care itself is usually done at children GP <b>surgeries</b> and paediatric <b>neurological</b> ambulances. Theoretical part: The theoretical part of the thesis {{is divided into two}} larger chapters headaches among children and headaches among adults. In the first chapter, headaches among children, the original mechanism which commences the headache, types of headaches, evaluation and the treatment of headaches is described. In this chapter, there is also presented the distribution of headaches, the diagnosis, treatment and the nursing care. Objectives: In respect with the research, there were stated four objectives. The first was to map the nursing care at children GP <b>surgeries</b> and paediatric <b>neurological</b> <b>surgeries,</b> the second one describes the cause of headaches among children, the third objective describes the frequency of headaches among children and the fourth objective describes the intensity of headaches among children. Methodology: The empirical part was worked out through qualitative and quantitative research investigation. In the qualitative part the method of in-depth interview was used. The research group consisted of six nurses, three of them were working at GP surgeries, three of them at paediatric <b>neurological</b> <b>surgeries.</b> When processing the interview, the methods of open coding and paper- pencil were used. In the quantitative part the non-standardized questionnaire method was used. The research group of the quantitative research consisted of 108 respondents aged from 6 to Hypothesis, research question and results: Due to the quantitative research, there were stated three hypothesis: H 1 : The frequency of headaches depends on the sex. H 2 : The intensity of headaches depends on the sex. H 3 : The most common cause of headaches among children is an excessive psychological stress. Accordingly to the statistical research H 1 we can confirm that the frequency depends on the sex. The chi-square was used to confirm the hypothesis. The hypothesis H 2, the relation of the intensity and the sex, was not confirmed by the test. The hypothesis H 3, which says that {{the most common cause of}} headaches among children is an excessive psychological stress was also not confirmed, the chi-square was used. In respect to the qualitative research, there were three research questions stated. RQ 1 : What is the nursing care of children with headaches at the children GP surgeries? RQ 2 : What is the nursing care of children with headaches at the paediatric <b>neurological</b> <b>surgeries?</b> RQ 3 : What are the causes of headache? The results of the research showed different causes of headaches which we put into the psychological group, the inner influence group, the outer influence group and injuries. The research also showed that the specifics of treatment between the children GP <b>surgeries</b> and paediatric <b>neurological</b> ambulances do not differ much. Into the group of specifics of nursing care of children with headaches we placed: education, informing children and parents about the non-pharmacological methods of treatment or the methods itself, administration of medicaments by different GPs, evaluation of the headaches, kind and friendly attitude to diseased people. The use in praxis: This bachelor thesis may be used for the study of medical programs, or it can serve as a material used for education of already educated medical staff or patients with headaches themselves. It can be also used as a base for a research paper into a magazine focused on paediatrics or neurology. The conclusion: There are many children with headaches as we found out through the research. We cannot certainly eliminate this huge number of patients, but with the help of the result we have learned, we can make their lives, which are very frequently controlled by the pain which decreases the life quality itself, better...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-sharp {{instruments}} are necessary in many surgical {{applications such as}} corneal, retinal, and <b>neurological</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Conventional diamond blades are always reused, and the metal blades are often reused because of their high cost. This reuse can result in significant performance and bio-safety concerns. Hence, there is considerable research interest in developing affordable, single-use surgical instruments that perform closer to or better than the existing gold standard blades. The aim of this thesis is to describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of ultra-sharp micromachined silicon blades that can construct reproducible surgical incisions. The research {{is focused on the}} formation of a Laser In-situ Keratoileusis (LASIK) silicon blade. LASIK is a surgical procedure that corrects nearsightedness 2 ̆ 6 farsightedness. Novel approaches to fabricate microsurgical blades using through-wafer bulk micromachining techniques of off-axis wafers are introduced. Two different approaches are taken: a simplified single-mask layer approach yielding a testable silicon blade and a more complicated dual-mask approach yielding an ideal structure close to that of a conventional metal blade. The surgical blades are successfully fabricated and have been characterized by our partners at USC 2 ̆ 7 s Doheny Retina Institute. Promising results have been observed, i. e., the silicon surgical blades have outperformed the gold standard metal blades...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{review the}} history, development, and reality of neuronavigation surgery in China {{and to discuss}} the future of neuronavigation surgery. Data sources PubMed, the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, and the VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals were searched for papers {{published}} from 1995 to the present with the key words “neuronavigation,” “functional navigation, ” “image-guided, ” and “stereotaxy. ” Articles were reviewed for additional citations, and some information was gathered from Web searches. Study selection Articles related to neuronavigation surgery in China were selected, with special attention to application to brain tumors. Results Since the introduction of neurosurgical navigation to China in 1997, this core technique in minimally invasive neurosurgery has seen rapid development. This development has ranged from brain structural localization to functional brain mapping, from static digital models of the brain to dynamic brain-shift compensation models, and from preoperative image-guided surgery to intraoperative real-time image-guided surgery, and from application of imported equipment and technology to use of equipment and technology that possess Chinese independent intellectual property rights. Conclusions The development and application of neuronavigation techniques have made <b>neurological</b> <b>surgeries</b> in China more safe, precise and effective, and less invasive, and promoted the quality of Chinese neurosurgical practice {{to the rank of}} the most advance and excellence in the world.

40|$|Neurocysticercosis, {{involvement}} of {{the central nervous system}} by taenia solium, {{is one of the most}} common parasitic diseases of the CNS. However, spinal involvement by neurocysticercosis is uncommon. Here, we reported a 40 -year-old woman with intramedullary cysticercosis in the thoracic spinal cord. MRI revealed two well-defined round intramedullary lesions at T 4 and T 5 vertebral levels, which were homogeneously hypointense on T 1 WI and hyperintense on T 2 WI with peripheral edema. Since the patient had progressive <b>neurological</b> deficits, <b>surgery</b> was performed to decompress the spinal cord.
