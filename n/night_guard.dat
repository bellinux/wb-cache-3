5|$|On {{the train}} Sameer meets Suraj Prakash (Satish Shah), who makes him {{think that he}} is a thief by asking him where he keeps {{important}} things (like money) in his luggage. Sameer stays awake all night to avoid being robbed, while Suraj sleeps after conning Sameer into guarding his luggage. Suraj admits this to Sameer the next morning at the station. Sameer learns that Suraj is a security guard at his resort, and puts him on <b>night</b> <b>guard</b> duty for three months. This puts a crimp in Suraj's marriage and, although he apologises, Sameer is adamant.|$|E
5|$|As the war began, William Stacy {{served as}} major in Colonel Benjamin Woodbridge's {{regiment}} of Minutemen, which was organized into Woodbridge's (25th) Regiment. During the Siege of Boston, Woodbridge's regiment was based at Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Boston, {{and participated in}} the Battle of Bunker Hill, the first large-scale battle of the war. An orderly book shows that on June 13, 1775, several days before the battle, Major Stacy was officer of the <b>night</b> <b>guard,</b> while Colonel William Prescott, {{who would be the}} primary leader of patriot forces during the battle, was officer of the day. Stacy was recommended for commission on June 16, the day before the battle. On June 17, 1775, Woodbridge's regiment of 300 soldiers arrived at Bunker Hill and took up positions immediately prior to the battle, and parts of the regiment engaged. A portion of Woodbridge's regiment joined Colonel Prescott's regiment at the redoubt and breastwork on the hill, and a company from Woodbridge's regiment deployed on the right flank.|$|E

5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and <b>night</b> <b>guard</b> at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
25|$|The other {{highly visible}} public {{duty of the}} Ceremonial Guard is sentry duty at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial and Rideau Hall.

In 1732, the citizens of Ommen rose up against the city council.

The council refused and severe riots ensued, but eventually order was restored. In 1762, a <b>night</b> <b>guard</b> was installed to maintain public order, but the unrest would remain until the Batavian Revolution of 1795.|$|E

Yelena Shram, a 28‑year-old <b>night</b> <b>guard,</b> was then murdered around the corner on Kosiora Street. According to Sayenko's taped confession, as Shram walked towards them, Suprunyuk struck her with the hammer he had been hiding under his shirt and struck her several more times after she fell down. She had been carrying a bag filled with clothes. The men picked up the bag, used the clothes to clean the hammer, and threw the bag out. Later the same night, the men murdered a woman named Valentina Hanzha (no apparent relation to co-defendant Alexander Hanzha), a mother of three with a disabled husband.|$|E

The fairies arrive and tease the peers about the success of MP Strephon, who is advancing a bill to open the peerage to competitive examination ("Strephon's a member of Parliament"). The peers ask the fairies to stop Strephon's mischief, stating that the House of Peers is not susceptible of any improvement ("When Britain really ruled the waves"). Although the fairies say that they cannot stop Strephon, they have become strongly attracted to the peers ("In vain to us you plead"). The fairy Queen is dismayed by this.

25|$|Genghis Khan {{introduced}} many {{innovative ways}} of organizing his army, dividing it into decimal subsections of arbans (10 people), zuuns (100), Mingghans (1000), and tumens (10,000). The Kheshig, or the imperial guard, was founded and divided into day (khorchin torghuds) and <b>night</b> <b>guards</b> (khevtuul). Genghis rewarded {{those who had}} been loyal to him and placed them in high positions, placing them as heads of army units and households, even though many of his allies had been from very low-rank clans.|$|R
25|$|In April 1847, Young {{consulted}} {{with members of}} the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who had recently returned from the British mission. John Taylor, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Hyde brought money contributed by the English Saints, a map based on John C. Fremont’s recent western expedition, and instruments for calculating latitude, elevation, temperature and barometric pressure. Chosen members of the vanguard group were gathered together, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into military companies. The group consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, one cannon, 93 horses, 52 mules, 66 oxen, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens, and carried enough supplies to fully provision the group for one year.

500|$|In January 1997, Christoph Meili, a <b>night</b> <b>guard</b> at the Union Bank of Switzerland (precursor of UBS) in Zürich, Switzerland, {{discovered}} that bank [...] officials were destroying documents about orphaned assets, {{believed to be}} the credit balances of deceased Jewish clients whose heirs' whereabouts were unknown, as well as books from the Nazi German Reichsbank. The books listed real-estate records for Berlin property that had been seized by the Nazis, placed in Swiss accounts, and then claimed to be owned by UBS. The destruction of such documents is illegal under Swiss law. This edict was the legal basis and foundation of the Bergier commission, constituted on 19 December 1996. Articles 4, 5, and 7 made the destruction or withholding of documents relating to orphaned assets illegal.|$|E
500|$|The {{series is}} {{centered}} {{on the story of}} a fictional restaurant named Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a pastiche of restaurants like Chuck E. Cheese's and ShowBiz Pizza Place. The first three games involve the player working as a nighttime security guard, in which they must utilize several tools, most notably checking security cameras, to survive against animatronic characters, which become mobile and homicidal after-hours. The fourth game, which uses different gameplay mechanics from its predecessors, takes place in the house of a child who must defend against nightmarish versions of the animatronics by closing doors and fleeing on foot. The fifth game takes place in a maintenance facility owned by a sister company of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. [...] In this game, the player character is a technician instead of a <b>night</b> <b>guard,</b> who must do different tasks each night as told by an AI voice heard in the game.|$|E

500|$|Most of the crowd, however, {{remained}} unpacified. They milled {{around the}} palace grounds with rumors abounding that the women's deputation had been duped – the queen would inevitably force the king to break any promises {{that had been}} made. Well aware of the surrounding dangers, Louis discussed the situation with his advisors. At about six o'clock in the evening, the king made a belated effort to quell {{the rising tide of}} insurrection: he announced that he would accept the August decrees and the Declaration of the Rights of Man without qualification. Adequate preparations to defend the palace were not made, however: the bulk of the royal guards, who had been deployed under arms in the main square for several hours facing a hostile crowd, was withdrawn {{to the far end of}} the park of Versailles. In the words of one of the officers: [...] "Everyone was overwhelmed with sleep and lethargy, we thought it was all over." [...] This left only the usual <b>night</b> <b>guard</b> of sixty-one Gardes du Corps posted throughout the palace.|$|E

When morning broke, Beric gave up the work to a fresh party and returned with his companions to the school. They found it deserted, save by the slaves, the others having, as they learned, gone to the fire an hour before with Scopus.|$|E
6000|$|It has {{recently}} been most amusingly varied by a visit from Lady Jersey.

My wife's chapter, and my description of myself, should, I think, amuse you. But there were finer touches still; as when Belle and Lady Jersey came out to brush their teeth {{in front of the}} rebel King's palace, and the <b>night</b> <b>guard</b> squatted opposite on the grass and watched the process; or when I and my interpreter, and the King with his secretary, mysteriously disappeared to conspire.--Ever yours sincerely, ...|$|E
