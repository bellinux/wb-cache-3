5000|$|Completed grant {{documents}} are {{recorded in the}} register and the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the grant is published in the Canada Gazette. The register is divided up in volumes, with each volume being reserved for each serving Governor General since 1988. Volume I, from 1988 to 1990, is for arms granted during the term of Jeanne Sauvé, Volume II, from 1990 to 1995, is reserved for Ramon Hnatyshyn, Volume III is reserved for Roméo LeBlanc, who served from 1995 to 1999, Volume IV for Adrienne Clarkson, 1999-2005, and Volume V for Michaëlle Jean, 2005-2010. The current Governor General, David Johnston, has his grants entered into Volume VI. Requests for <b>registrations</b> <b>of</b> existing arms also {{take the form of}} a [...] "petition", as described above. The CHA will normally only register existing arms if the petitioner was unable to petition for a Canadian grant at the time the existing arms were granted, i.e., the arms of immigrants or arms granted to Canadians before the creation of the CHA in 1988. In addition, the existing arms must normally come from a source recognized by the Chief Herald (e.g. the Chief Herald of Ireland, College of Arms, Lord Lyon, the South African Bureau <b>of</b> Heraldry, etc.). <b>Registration</b> {{documents are}} recorded in the Public Register, and the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> is published in the Gazette. If the petitioner so desires, their design can be published in the Trade Marks Journal. That can be arranged through the offices of the Authority, but a separate fee is required which is paid to the Registrar of Trade Marks.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to prove}} that the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> marriages is one of the {{requirements}} of marriage, which means unregistered marriagesare illegal. The basic reasonsfor this conclusion is two-fold. First, the Prophet Muhammad had commanded public <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> marriage (walimahan, iklan). The purpose <b>of</b> this public <b>notice</b> is to secure the rights of spouses so that couples can achieve the purpose of marriage: a harmonious family. In fact, public notices are means to achieve this. Thus a contextual change is possible to changes the legal form as a mean to achieve the objectives <b>of</b> the marriage. <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> marriage (marriage certificate) is a kind of contextualization of the command for the public <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> marriage. This contextualization is necessary because it is more effective and efficient to guarantee the achievement of a harmonious family as the ultimate goal of marriage. Second, Indonesian citizens must obey the rules <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> marriage as set out and defined in the Act no. 1 of 1974 on Marriage [Marriage Act], as it is an implication of the obligation to obey the government (uli al-amr). Therefore, Indonesian citizens who do not comply with the contents of Marriage Act is disobeying the government. Furthermore, the Indonesian government has the right to make rules for creating welfare for the community (mashlah), being Indonesian citizens. Consequently, citizens are required to obey rules set by the Indonesian government for the whole welfare of community, and {{it is clear that the}} purpose <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> marriage is for welfare of Indonesian citizen...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{principal}} goals of the 1909 Copyright Act was to simplify and streamline the formalities required to obtain copyright protection. Before the 1909 Copyright Act, authors had to register their works before publication {{in order to be}} eligible for copyright protection; and <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> had to be included on all copies published in the United States. If a work was published anywhere in the world before registration, or if the notice was omitted when the work was published domestically, the work went into the public domain. Under the 1909 Act, however, authors only had to publish their works with proper copyright notice in order to be eligible for copyright protection. This change introduced an ambiguity with regard to works first published outside the Untied States. If a work had to be published with proper notice to receive copyright protection, but notice was required only on copies published in the United States, what was the effect if a work was first published outside the United States without proper notice? Some courts held that mere publication in a country with whom the u. s. had copyright relations was sufficient to invest a work with a federal statutory copyright; while others held that such a work neither received a federal statutory copyright nor was it placed in the public domain by foreign publication without notice. This uncertainty can result in copyright terms that differ by as much as one hundred years, depending on how the ambiguity is resolved. In this article, the author concludes that Congress most likely intended that works first published outside the United States withoutproper notice were not eligible for copyright protection and became part of the public domain. This result means that such works were eligible for the copyright restoration for works of foreign origin that became effective in 1996, and that parties utilizing such works should be treated as reliance parties under the restoration statute, rather than as ordinary infringers...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. According {{to section}} 4 of The 1998 –Act all {{customary}} marriages must be registered. Prior to 2000 (date of incorporation of 1998 –Act) the only marriages which {{were required to}} be registered were customary marriages in KwaZulu– Natal and Transkei. Over the years, the courts had interpreted the requirement <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> customary marriages differently. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the effect of the non–registration of customary marriage on estate planning. It is recommended that an estate planner takes <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the requirements of a customary marriage as well as the courts’ interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>registration</b> requirement. An estate planner must establish whether a marriage is valid when planning an estate for a client. It is further recommended the 1998 –Act be amended to clarify the registration requirement and that this amendment be communicated effectively...|$|R
