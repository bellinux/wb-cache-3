25|$|Thanks to a {{grant from}} the Commonwealth of Virginia, tuition became free for all Virginians in 1875. During this period the University of Virginia {{remained}} unique in that it had <b>no</b> <b>president</b> and mandated no core curriculum from its students, who often studied in and took degrees from more than one school. However, the university was also experiencing growing pains.

25|$|A {{resolution}} to impeach the President {{has to be}} passed by a two-third majority {{of the total number}} of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the President has the right to defend oneself through an authorised counsel. If the second house also approves the charges made by special majority again, the President stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date when such a resolution stands passed. <b>No</b> <b>president</b> has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.|$|E

25|$|Despite the variability, all {{but four}} presidents {{have been able}} to appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office, though his {{successor}} (John Tyler) made an appointment during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction {{in the size of the}} Court. Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Somewhat similarly, presidents James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W.

500|$|The {{vice presidential}} {{nomination}} was considered <b>no</b> <b>president</b> {{had failed to}} complete his elected term. [...] Not much attention {{was given to the}} choice, and the specifics of how Tyler came to gain it are unclear. [...] Chitwood pointed out that Tyler was a logical candidate: as a Southern slaveowner, he balanced the ticket and also assuaged the fears of Southerners who felt Harrison might have abolitionist leanings. Tyler had been a vice-presidential candidate in 1836, and having him on the ticket might win Virginia, the most populous state in the South. One of the convention managers, New York publisher Thurlow Weed, alleged that [...] "Tyler was finally taken because we could get nobody else to accept"—though he did not say this until after the subsequent break between President Tyler and the Whig Party. Other Tyler foes claimed that he had wept himself into the White House, after crying at Clay's defeat; this was unlikely, as the Kentuckian had backed Tyler’s opponent Rives in the Senate election. Tyler's name was submitted in the balloting, and though Virginia abstained, he received the necessary majority. Tyler, as president, was accused of having gained the nomination by concealing his views, and responded that he had not been asked about them. His biographer, Robert Seager II, held that Tyler was selected because of a dearth of alternative candidates. Seager concluded, [...] "He was put on the ticket to draw the South to Harrison. [...] No more, no less." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the period}} under the Regents, many {{efforts were made}} to put the University on respectable footing, resolving to {{organize}} the college into the four faculties of Arts, Divinity, Medicine, and Law.

The staff of the entire university -which included numerous aforementioned professors, a president, a secretary, and a librarian – operated under the yearly budget of £1,200.

The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton.

2500|$|Impeachment in the United States is an {{enumerated}} {{power of}} the legislature that allows formal charges to be brought against a civil officer of government for crimes alleged to have been committed. Most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office, though {{there have been a}} few cases in which Congress has impeached and convicted officials partly for prior crimes. The actual trial on such charges, and subsequent removal of an official upon conviction, is separate from the act of impeachment itself. [...] Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives, and both were later acquitted by the Senate. The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed, as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment, but such a vote was widely expected to pass, and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon's departure. To date, <b>no</b> <b>president</b> has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction. The impeached official continues in office until conviction.|$|E
