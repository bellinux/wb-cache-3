One of the most noticeable design elements of the fifth generation Thunderbird was the gaping, fighter jet-inspired grille opening that incorporated hidden headlights.|$|E

This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the unsprung weight to 11 tons.|$|E

In this research the experimental work is carried out to study the effect of planet phasing on <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> subsequent resulting <b>vibrations</b> of Nylon- 6 planetary gear drive. For this purpose experimental set-up was built and trials were conducted for two different arrangements (i. e., with phasing and without phasing) and it is observed that the <b>noise</b> level <b>and</b> resulting <b>vibrations</b> were reduced by planet phasing arrangement.

25|$|The AW119 {{employs a}} {{four-bladed}} fully articulated main rotor; the composite rotor blades {{are designed to}} produce maximum lift with minimum noise, and feature tip caps to reduce noise and elastomeric bearings with no lubrication requirements. Aluminium honeycomb structural panels are used throughout the airframe, which absorb both <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibration,</b> thus requiring no additional vibration absorption systems to be employed. The PT6B-37A powerplant of the AW119, located {{in the same area}} as the AW109 is capable of providing high power margins along with generous speeds and endurance. According to AgustaWestland, the AW119 retains the system redundancy of dual engine helicopters, such as the hydraulics and the dual independent stability augmentation systems; the gearbox has a 30-minute dry run capability.|$|E
25|$|Brick, cobblestone, sett, wood plank, {{and wood}} block {{pavements}} such as Nicolson pavement, were once common {{in urban areas}} throughout the world, but fell out of fashion in most countries, due to {{the high cost of}} labor required to lay and maintain them, and are typically only kept for historical or aesthetic reasons. In some countries, however, they are still common in local streets. In the Netherlands, brick paving has made somewhat of a comeback since the adoption of a major nationwide traffic safety program in 1997. From 1998 through 2007, more than 41,000km of city streets were converted to local access roads with a speed limit of 30km/h, for the purpose of traffic calming. One popular measure is to use brick paving - the <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibration</b> slows motorists down. At the same time, {{it is not uncommon for}} cycle paths alongside a road to have a smoother surface than the road itself.|$|E
40|$|Methods for {{determination}} of indoor <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations</b> from urban rail bound transport {{are presented in}} this work. Both measurement methods and empirical prediction methods are described. The data and results are taken from field measurements of <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations</b> from the trams and metro trains of Oslo. The methods applied should be universally adaptable. The general approach is to use empirical modelling based on large measurement series and statisticalanalysis. A complete model consists of a description of outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations</b> as well as transmission through buildings and a correct {{determination of}} the physical and perceived immision. The introduction, chapter 1, gives a description {{of this type of}} model. This is followed in chapter 2 by an expansion of the similarities and differences between trams and metro trains {{on the one hand and}} ordinary railways on the other hand. Article 1 gives a description of measurements and building of an empirical model for outdoor noise from trams The difference in groundborne <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations</b> from two types ofmetro trains is described in article 2. The general principles of empirical modelling as applied to indoor <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations</b> from trams <b>and</b> metros are described in chapter 3. Articles 3, 4 and 5 deal with different technical aspects of the measurement of transmission of airborne sound through buildingfacades. The concepts behind these measurements are discussed in chapter 4. Chapter 5 and article 6 discuss transmission of vibrations into residential buildings. Chapter 5 describes weighted physical vibration levels from several metro trains and includes preliminary results from investigations of perceivedannoyance from vibrations. Article 6 includes considerations of spectrum shapes and variation between individual train passages. Chapter 6 and article 7 are about field measurement of the <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations</b> inside residences.

500|$|On 13 December 1914, B11, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Norman Douglas Holbrook, entered the Dardanelles during {{in the early}} morning.

Two and a half hours later B11 came to periscope depth and Holbrook spotted the elderly Turkish ironclad Mesudiye. He fired one torpedo that struck the ship, which settled by the stern and then capsized. Before sinking, Mesudiye spotted B11 and fired on her periscope which revealed her position to the shore batteries. Attempting to leave the area, B11 briefly grounded herself, breaking the surface, but was able to get herself off. B11s compass became fogged and prevented the submarine from navigating at depth; instead Holbrook had to [...] the boat at periscope depth which meant he had to go through the minefields, not below them. Nevertheless, the boat made it back safely; Holbrook was awarded the Victoria Cross, his First Lieutenant, the Distinguished Service Order and every enlisted man the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

500|$|A {{provision}} of the original Civil Aviation Act allows designated airports to be required to provide facilities for consultation with affected parties, where local environmental concerns can be raised, and some 51 airports have been so designated. A 2000 consultation by the government re-iterated its policy that generally, local issues arising from airport operations are best addressed locally. To support this the Civil Aviation Act was extended in 2006 to give all airports the authority to mandate measures to address noise and air quality issues beyond their boundaries, and to impose financial penalties on aircraft which fail or are unable to adhere to such measures. The Civil Aviation Act 2006 also extends the provisions of section 78 of the original act, augmenting {{the powers of the}} Secretary of State to intervene directly in operations at designated airports; currently Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, [...] "…for the purpose of avoiding, limiting or mitigating the effect of <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibration</b> connected with aircraft landing or taking off." [...] The largest airports also implement voluntary schemes to assist local communities in coping with the local impacts of airport operations. Birmingham International Airport, for example, has been operating a sound insulation scheme since 1978, in which 7,600 properties are eligible for sound proof glazing paid for by the airport. Schemes are also available to residents most affected by noise around Heathrow, designed to protect property prices ahead of any development of a third runway, assist with relocation costs for people who wish to move, and provide sound insulation for private and communal property currently affected by noise. In both cases local residents have also set up campaign groups; Birmingham Airport anti-Noise Group, and HACAN Clearskies at Heathrow, to represent themselves over local environmental issues arising from airport operations. Even the smallest of airports engaged in air transport operations; Gloucestershire Airport, has attracted organised opposition to its plans to extend the main runway there, and the umbrella group AirportWatch lists over 20 local airport campaign groups.|$|E
