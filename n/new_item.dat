5|$|Mega Man 2 {{features}} a few gameplay changes {{from the original}} Mega Man. A <b>new</b> <b>item,</b> the Energy Tank, allows a player to refill Mega Man’s health at any time. Also introduced is a password system. After defeating each Robot Master a password is displayed, allowing the player to return to that particular point in the game after restarting the system. The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, {{as well as the}} number of accumulated Energy Tanks. Unlike the first game, Mega Man 2 does not feature a score counter, and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed.|$|E
5|$|Icewind Dale II was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} an incomplete conversion to the D Third Edition ruleset, with many rules omitted. The kit system (class specialization) introduced in Baldur's Gate 2 was to be used, but this idea was later abandoned. Sawyer and several {{other members of the}} team pushed for the game's conversion to Third Edition. The development team was eventually granted an extension, which allowed them to complete the change to Third Edition rules. The Infinity Engine required extensive modification to comply with Third Edition rules, as it had originally been designed for Second Edition rules; certain elements of the rules were removed due to interface and engine issues. The game's interface was redesigned, and all-new art was created. It features <b>new</b> <b>item</b> icons, with new spell icons by Brian Menze; Menze had previously created Planescape: Torments spell icons. Jason Manley, the portrait artist for the previous Icewind Dale games, left Black Isle Studios in late 2001; several new works he painted before his departure were later used in Icewind Dale II. Black Isle Studios artist Justin Sweet was asked to substitute. The game's resolution was increased to a minimum resolution of 800x600, with an unofficially supported maximum resolution of 2048x1536.|$|E
5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a <b>new</b> <b>item</b> that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E

40|$|As one {{of major}} challenges, cold-start problem plagues nearly all {{recommender}} systems. In particular, <b>new</b> <b>items</b> will be overlooked, impeding {{the development of}} new products online. Given limited resources, how to utilize the knowledge of recommender systems and design efficient marketing strategy for <b>new</b> <b>items</b> is extremely important. In this paper, we convert this ticklish issue into a clear mathematical problem based on a bipartite network representation. Under the most widely used algorithm in real e-commerce recommender systems, so-called the item-based collaborative filtering, we show that to simply push <b>new</b> <b>items</b> to active users is not a good strategy. To our surprise, experiments on real recommender systems indicate that to connect <b>new</b> <b>items</b> with some less active users will statistically yield better performance, namely these <b>new</b> <b>items</b> will have more chance to appear in other users' recommendation lists. Further analysis suggests that the disassortative nature of recommender systems contributes to such observation. In a word, getting in-depth understanding on recommender systems could pave the way for the owners to popularize their cold-start products with low costs. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5|$|Rethinking the {{conventions}} of a Zelda game became an important theme as development progressed. In previous Zelda games, the player would go into a dungeon, obtain a <b>new</b> <b>item,</b> and then move onto the next dungeon in a specific order. The development team felt that this formula was flawed as a player could get stuck on a dungeon and {{would be unable to}} progress further in the game. They wanted to give the player more freedom in the ways they could advance through the game, allowing them to tackle dungeons in any order and clear multiple dungeons in parallel, but this meant that the method for acquiring items had to be changed. They opted for a system where players could rent or purchase items using the game's currency, rupees. In the final game, rented items are returned to the merchant when the player is defeated, however the team had considered other ideas for returning rented items, such as setting a timer on the rental period and imposing fees if they were returned late. The development team found out about the existence of the Nintendo 2DS console during the game's production. As the Nintendo 2DS lacked 3D capabilities, the team decided to revise some of the game's dungeon designs to be certain that they could be completed without the 3D effect enabled.|$|E

The second DLC, titled Hostage Negotiation, was originally slated to launch in September, but was pushed back to October 30. Hostage Negotiation adds four new multiplayer maps – Club Moderno, Estádio Do Galatians, Favelas of O Palácio Strip Club and Favela Heights – plus two new rifles, a new Explosive Burst booby trap, additional cosmetic options, {{and a new}} avatar faction.|$|E

Frustrated with her progress, she started playing a common computer version of the card game solitaire. After a time she started using the computer more for playing the card game than actual work. From her previous experience, she recognized that she was demonstrating addictive behaviors. Orzack listed several symptoms of computer addiction, including using the computer for pleasure and relief from stress, feeling out of control and depressed when not using it, neglecting real life responsibilities and failure in attempts to cut down usage.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn an inefficient visual search task, {{when some}} {{distractors}} (old items) temporally precede some others (<b>new</b> <b>items),</b> the old items {{are excluded from}} the search, a phenomenon termed visual marking. This effect is said to occur because {{the locations of the}} old items are inhibited before the <b>new</b> <b>items</b> appear. The present study used a probe-detection task to examine whether this inhibition occurs only at the precise locations of old items or at and around the locations of old items. We also investigated the effect of inhibition overreaching boundaries to encompass neighboring regions. Participants searched for a target or detected a probe that appeared after the <b>new</b> <b>items</b> appeared. The results revealed that the probe reaction times at locations inside grouped regions were longer than those at a blank region where no items had been presented and were comparable to those at a location occupied by old items. Probe detection was not delayed when the probe was presented near but external to the external boundary of the grouped regions. The overreaching effect was obtained before and after the <b>new</b> <b>items</b> appeared. We conclude that the inhibitory template for visual marking represents clusters of old items for at least 200 ms before the onset of <b>new</b> <b>items,</b> and that this spatial schema is preserved until at least 200 ms after the onset of <b>new</b> <b>items...</b>|$|R

25|$|These {{cells were}} first {{discovered}} in the brain, and specifically in the hippocampus, by O'Keefe and Dostrovsky (1971). Though the hippocampus {{plays a role in}} learning and memory, the existence of place cells within the hippocampus demonstrates the role it plays with spatial adaptation and awareness. There have been recorded increases in firing patterns of rats in open environments and recorded spatial learning and awareness impairments after damage to the hippocampus and the place cells within. Studies with rats have shown that place cells are very responsive to spatial surroundings. For example a study by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel found that place cells would fire more rapidly when rats ran past places in the environment, when a <b>new</b> <b>item</b> was added to the environment, or when an item that is usually there is not present.|$|E
25|$|The {{entirety}} {{of a given}} corps organizes itself as a ship's company, employing the naval divisional system. Under this system, cadets become members of a division under a cadet petty officer (Divisional Petty Officer or DPO) and, ideally, a commissioned officer of the CIC (Divisional Officer or DivO), although the officer position is sometimes filled by a civilian. Cadets parade by divisions, {{and are expected to}} route grievances and requests through the chain of command, running either directly from the DPO to DivO to the Executive Officer (XO) to the Commanding Officer (CO) or from the DPO to the cadet Regulating Petty Officer (RPO, the second senior cadet in the unit), to the cadet Coxswain (Cox'n, the senior cadet in a unit). The chain stops at the level able to deal with a concern - for example, a cadet's request for a <b>new</b> <b>item</b> of uniform might result in the DivO giving approval, and directing the cadet to visit Stores.|$|E

Apart from Yellow, this mechanic {{was also used}} in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum in a limited fashion: when the player is in Amity Park with a cute Pokémon. The player may talk to the Pokémon to see or check on how that Pokémon is feeling, and occasionally it may pick up items. A new minigame called the Pokéathlon (called Pokéthlon in Japan) uses the Nintendo DS touchscreen and allows Pokémon to compete in events such as hurdling. The Japanese versions retain slot machines found in previous games, while the international releases of the titles replace the slot machines with a new game called [...] "Voltorb Flip", described as a cross between Minesweeper and Picross. Another <b>new</b> <b>item,</b> the GB Sounds, changes the background music to the original 8-bit music from Pokémon Gold and Silver.|$|E
500|$|God of War III is an action-adventure {{game with}} hack and slash elements. It is a third-person, single-player video game. As with {{previous}} installments, the player controls the character Kratos from a fixed-camera perspective in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle games. The enemies are {{an assortment of}} creatures drawn from Greek mythology, including centaurs, harpies, chimeras, cyclopes, satyrs, minotaurs, Sirens, cerberuses, and Gorgons. The player must also climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and swing on ropes to proceed through the game. The puzzles included vary in difficulty: some self-contained puzzles only require objects {{to be placed in}} a specific position, while some require timing and precision, such as a puzzle with mechanics similar to Guitar Hero. In addition to finding Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers of the previous games, Minotaur Horns are a <b>new</b> <b>item</b> to be found. Where the eyes and feathers increase the player's health and magic meters, the horns increase the items meter, which allows further use of secondary weapons, called [...] "Items".|$|E
500|$|An {{expansion}} to the game, entitled [...] "Wrath of the Lamb", {{was released}} through Steam on May 28, 2012. McMillen {{was inspired to}} create the expansion not only due {{to the success of}} the base game, but because his wife Danielle had fully completed the base game, the first game he had written in which she had shown significant interest. The expansion adds 70% more content to the original, and contains more than 10 bosses, over 100 items, over 40 unlocks, two additional endings, and two additional optional levels. This expansion added new [...] "alternate" [...] floors, which can replace the normal floors, creating an alternate route through the game. These floors contain harder enemies, and a different set of bosses. [...] Other features include a <b>new</b> <b>item</b> type, Trinkets, which have a variety of passive or triggered effects when carried, as well as new room types.

The game retains some of the gameplay features of its predecessors while having major gameplay additions, such as a more substantial single-player mode and online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Taking advantage of the Wii's variety of controller options, the game allows the use of the Wii Remote, Nunchuk, GameCube controller, and the Classic Controller. Like Melee, the game makes references to games and franchises, including those that debuted after the release of Melee; for example, Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf's character designs are taken from [...] and a Nintendogs puppy is present as an Assist Trophy (a <b>new</b> <b>item</b> that summons computer-controlled characters from different games to briefly participate in the fight).

A new type of item able to be held was the berry, which comes in varieties and can restore health or cure status effects. Other held items can give boosts to the Pokémon during battle. More specialized Poké Balls were introduced, which make Pokémon catching easier in certain situations. A <b>new</b> <b>item</b> called the [...] was introduced, functioning as a watch, map, radio, and phone, allowing the player to call other characters who offer their phone number.
