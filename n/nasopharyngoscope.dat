40|$|Assessment {{of human}} airway lumen opening is {{important}} in diagnosing and understanding the mechanisms of airway dysfunctions such as the excessive airway narrowing in asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Although there are indirect methods to evaluate the airway calibre, direct in vivo measurement of the airway calibre has not been commonly available. With recent advent of the flexible fiber optical <b>nasopharyngoscope</b> with video recording it has become possible to directly visualize the passages of upper and lower airways. However, quantitative analysis of the recorded video images has been technically challenging. Here, we describe an automatic image processing and analysis method that allows for batch analysis of the images recorded during the endoscopic procedure, thus facilitates image-based quantification of the airway opening. Video images of the airway lumen of volunteer subject were acquired using a fiber optical <b>nasopharyngoscope,</b> and subsequently processed using Gaussian smoothing filter, threshold segmentation, differentiation, and Canny image edge detection, respectively. Thus the area of the open airway lumen was identified and computed using a predetermined converter of the image scale to true dimension of the imaged object. With this method we measured the opening/narrowing of the glottis during tidal breathing with or without making "Hee" sound or cough. We also used this method to measure the opening/narrowing of the primary bronchus of either healthy or asthmatic subjects in response to histamine and/or albuterol treatment, which also provided an indicator of the airway contractility. Our results demonstrate that the image-based method accurately quantified the area change waveform of either the glottis or the bronchus as observed by using the optical nasopharygoscope. Importantly, the opening/narrowing of the airway lumen generally correlated with the airflow and resistance of the airways, and could differentiate the level of airway contractility between the healthy and asthmatic subjects. Thus, this quantitative assessment of airway opening may provide a useful tool to assist clinical diagnosis of airway dysfunctions and understanding the mechanisms of associated pathophysiologies...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{guideline}} for rating the physical impairment of otolaryngologic fields. Assessment of hearing disturbance and tinnitus required physical examination, pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, impedance audiometry, brainstem evoked response audiometry, Bekesy audiometry, otoacoustic emission test, and imaging examination. History taking, physical examination, and radiological examination for the vestibular organ and brain, righting reflex test, electronystagmography, and caloric test are taken {{for evaluation of}} balance disorder. Olfactory function tests include University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification test, Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center test, T and T olfactometry and Korean Version of Sniffin’s Sticks test. Medical history and physical examination is mandatory to evaluatezseverity of respiration difficulty. Examinations include flexible fiberoptic <b>nasopharyngoscope,</b> bronchoscopy, simple soft-tissue radiography films of upper airway and high resolution computed tomography.

40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. Examination of the postnasal {{space with}} a nasopharyngeal mirror {{has been described as}} one of the most difficult skills to acquire in clinical practice. Even experienced clinicians may find difficulty in deciding whether the postnasal space is normal, and examination: under anesthesia may therefore be necessary. Some of the difficulties which may be encountered are an exaggerated palatal reflex, an elongated soft palate, and increased muscle tension making adequate depression of the tongue difficult. Various methods of examination have been developed to overcome some of these difficulties. The nasopharyngeal speculum permits a direct examination of the postnasal space, but insertion is unpleasant and anterosuperior structures are difficult to visualize. The <b>nasopharyngoscope</b> is introduced through the nostrils, has a limited field of vision, and interpretation of the view obtained requires a lot of experience.

40|$|Glial choristoma is {{considered}} to be a type of brain heterotopia consisting of ectopic central nervous tissue. We herein report a neonate with glial choristoma of the tongue who developed respiratory distress due to airway obstruction. A male neonate presented with respiratory distress due to a soft mass on the midline region of the dorsal tongue base at birth. He was intubated using a flexible fiberoptic <b>nasopharyngoscope.</b> MRI showed a well-circumscribed mass measuring 25 × 23 × 27 [*]mm in size in the same region. A histologic examination confirmed a pathological diagnosis of glial choristoma. He underwent tracheotomy at 22 days of age, and a subtotal resection of the tumor was performed at five months of age. The clinical behavior of oral glial choristoma varies depending on the age at onset as well as the location and size of the mass. The small size of the organ and the narrow operating field hamper the surgical approach in neonates. The optimal therapeutic strategy for neonatal cases of glial choristoma should thus be determined based on the condition of each individual patient...|$|E
40|$|It is {{understandable}} that lips of the Eustachian-tube orifice in children show the various shapes, {{as they are in}} the course of growing of the tubal cartilage, and their lymphatic tissue are so susceptible to the inflammation due to their physiologically excessive development; and therefore, it is thought abnormal forms of these lips are found more often in children than in adults. In order to explore this point still further, the author examined the lips of the Estachian-tube orifice in 550 sides of the third year in elementary school with the <b>nasopharyngoscope,</b> and classified them into six groups according to the shapes of the lips: group Ⅰ, standard form (basic form); group Ⅱ, swollen form; group Ⅲ, overlapped form; group Ⅳ. intermediate form; group Ⅴ, unobservable form (obstructed from view by adenoid hypertrophy); and group Ⅵ. underdeveloped form. Of these, groups Ⅱ, Ⅲ and Ⅳ are caused by one of the three factors; namely, (A) edema, (B) granule, and (C) node. There is a very little relationship among the so-called adenoid hypertrophy, groups Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅴ, and the factors A, B, C. The incidence of hard of hearing is more frequent starting with group Ⅲ, followed by groups Ⅳ, Ⅱ, Ⅴ, Ⅵ, and Ⅰ in that order, while it likewise increases in the order of the factors A, B, and C. Looking the degree of hard of hearing from the standpoint of adenoid hypertrophy, deafness due to the changes of the Eustachian-tube orifice in form and factor tends to increase with complication with the adenoid hypertrophy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesChronic cough, {{defined as}} a cough {{persisting}} for more than 8 weeks, is a common chief complaint in the outpatient department. The role of laryngeal lesions in these patients is discussed in this paper. Materials and MethodsSeventy-seven patients (29 men, 48 women) were enrolled retrospectively at my clinics in one regional hospital and two local hospitals located in Taoyuan county and in Hsinchu county, from January to June, 2006. Their ages ranged from 19 to 83 years (mean, 52. 7 years). The duration of symptoms was from 8 weeks to over 2 decades (70. 1 % of the patients: = 3 years). Before examination with a flexible fiberoptic <b>nasopharyngoscope,</b> obvious bronchopulmonary disease had been ruled out using chest radiography and chest auscultation. ResultsOf the patients examined, 61. 0 % had laryngeal lesions, including vocal fold atrophy (61. 7 %), vocal fold sulcus (19. 1 %), vocal nodules (14. 9 %), vocal polyps (8. 5 %), vocal corditis (4. 3 %), unilateral vocal cord palsy (2. 1 %), and laryngeal neoplasm (2. 1 %). Of the patients with laryngeal lesions, 48. 9 % complained of hoarseness. Among patients with hoarseness, 88. 5 % had laryngeal lesions. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} in the presence of hoarseness between patients with and without laryngeal lesions (p < 0. 05, χ 2 test). Patients without laryngeal lesions had a higher cure rate for chronic cough than patients with these lesions (p < 0. 05, χ 2 test) after 10 patients who were lost to follow-up were excluded. ConclusionBoth the larynx and its dynamics should be evaluated together when a patient presents with chronic cough because laryngeal lesions are comitant. In addition, laryngeal malignancy needs early diagnosis and early treatment...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{findings}} on the relationship between tubal muscles and the Eustachian tube as described in the previous report, the actions of various tubal muscles on the Eustachian tube are discussed, and the observations carried out by the methods described below on the movements in vivo of the naso-haryngeal orifice at the time of phonation and of swallowing reveaied the following results. 1. Observations were carried out {{with the use of a}} <b>nasopharyngoscope.</b> 2. Observations were done on the patients who underwent the radical operation for the cancer of maxillar sinus. As the inferior nasal concha was already removed at the time of the operation, it was possible to insert a small nasal mirror into the posterior nasal cavity of the operated side to catch the whole view around the tubal orifice of healty side. 3. For the children over 5 - 6 years old with cleft palate, observations were carried out directly on the pharyngeal orifice through the mouth cavity (motion pictures were taken in this instance). At a result it has been found that the nasopharyngeal orifice of the tube is widened because the posterior lip and the mucous membrane of the base of the Eustachian tube move slightly outward at the time of swallowing. In anatomically summarizing these observations the author arrived at the following conclusions. At the time of swallowing the tensor muscle of the palate dilates the Eustachian tube at the points near the middle part and the anterior part of the tube. The levator palatini muscle assists the opening action of the tensor muscle by fixing or by drawing the base of the tube slightly toward the inferior-interior side. The salpingopharyngeus muscle or the salpingopharyngeal fold, being drawn inward by the cephalopharyngeal muscle and pahryngopalatine muscle and widening the nasopharygeal orified, assists the dilatating action of the tensor muscles. When the muscles are relaxed, the Eustachian tube is closed probably by the elasticity of the lateral cartilaginous lamina and by the pressure of the tissues surrounding the tube...|$|E
40|$|Goals for {{participants}} 1. The participant should understand {{the signs and}} symptoms of the child with pre- and intraoperative laryngeal obstruction and be able to describe a coherent plan for managing airway obstruction. 2. The participant will understand the etiology, epidemiology and natural course of this disease including current medical and surgical treatments and anesthetic implications. 3. The participant will be able to discuss the specific anesthetic concerns of carbon dioxide laser airway management including specific anesthetic techniques, waste gas and pollution issues, and airway fire. STEM CASE and KEY QUESTIONS A four year old child with a three month history of worsening stridor was started on an albuterol inhaler by her family physician, without improvement. She now has a hoarse, whispery, “hot potato ” voice. An otolaryngologist tried to evaluate her airway with a fiberoptic <b>nasopharyngoscope,</b> but she was not cooperative. His working diagnosis is vocal cord papillomas. ROS: She was a full term infant, previously healthy, although she was treated for gastroesophageal reflux from age 3 months to six months. Physical exam: 20 kg child, BP 80 sys, p 100, RR 22, SpO 2 97 %, T 37 oC Hoarse voice, barely speaks above a whisper, being held on her mother’s lap HEENT: baby teeth, normal jaw, mild retractions above the sternal notch with inspiration Pulm: inspiratory and expiratory stridor audible over the suprasternal notch Cor: RSR; normal S 1 and S 2; no S 3 or S 4; no murmurs. Extremities: Nailbeds pink, no clubbing. Superficial veins easily seen on dorsum and volar aspects of hands. 1. Is this a typical presentation for vocal cord papillomas? Why? What other entities might present this way? What makes you put these lower on your list of differential diagnosis? 2. What will you look for on physical exam to help assess her degree of airway compromise? How reliable is the degree of stridor? The respiratory rate? Should you obtain an arterial blood gas before you start? How about a venous blood gas? Why or why not? Does she need any preoperative laboratory work at all? How about a chest x-ray...|$|E
40|$|By {{conducting}} hearing {{tests on}} 618 pupils {{of the third}} year {{in the elementary school}} in a sound proof room with the use of an 8 -pure tone audiometer along with observations of adenoid hypertrophy by aid of <b>nasopharyngoscope</b> the author carried out detailed examinations of the nose, ear and throat. As for the criterion of deafness, ones that can not hear 2 tones at 20 db or one at 25 db were considered deaf. Deaf ears and doubtful cases for deaf determined by the method just mentioned, were re-examined on two other occasions and the changes in their hearing were investigated. Regarding subjective symptoms as to the hardness of hearing, careful attention were paid on the records previously prepared at individual's home and as the results the following data obtained. 1. The number of those who had been considered to be deaf at the first test gradually decreased significantly at each of of two subsequent tests. 2. The percentage of deaf pupils proved to be 14. 8 per cent, while that of deaf ears 11. 9 per cent of the total examined. 3. The majority of those who had been considered deaf on the first hearing test but adjudged to be of normal hearing on the following tests, showed the fall in the threshold at 8124 cps [...] 4. Therefore, {{in order to determine the}} hardness of hearing in young persons it is necessary to pay a special attention to a higher tone and to conduct hearing tests at least three times on different days. 5. Those who were unconsciously deaf amounted to 67. 0 per cent of the total deaf pupils, and the same among those whose deafness proved to be slight, namely, witihn average 25 db at speech range in both ears, amounted to 80. 8 per cent. 6. Most of unconscious deafness had their origin in the Eustachian tube: and cases with unconscious deafness in both ears having the origin at the tube amounted to 90. 2 per cent and the same in one ear amounted to 75. 0 per cent. 7. Deafness with its origin at the Eustachian tube occupied the major portion (86. 8 %) of those slightly hard of hearing within average 25 db at speeeh range. 8. The lesions of the nasal cavity and the pharynx that had been associated with deafness were simple chronic rhinitis, hypertrophic rhinitis, sinusitis and deviation of the nasal septum. Comparing the incidence of deafness in the ears with these lesions to those without lesions, deafness proved to be more predominant in the ears with the lesions. 9. Deafness in both ears were found quite many among the pupils of poor scholastic standing...|$|E
