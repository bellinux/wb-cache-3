Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting canned food containing 200mg/kg of tin. A 2002 study showed that 99.5% of 1200 tested cans contained below the UK regulatory limit of 200mg/kg of tin, an improvement over most previous studies largely attributed to {{the increased use of}} fully lacquered cans for acidic foods, and concluded that the results do not raise any long term food safety concerns for consumers.

50|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the requirement to demonstrate conformity is the requirement to know the exemption use of each component, otherwise {{it is not possible to}} know compliance when the product is placed on the market, the only point in time the product must be 'compliant'. Many do not understand that 'compliance' varies depending on what exemptions are in force and it is quite possible to make a <b>non-compliant</b> <b>product</b> with 'compliant' components. Compliance must be calculated on the day of placing on the market. In reality this means knowing the exemption status of all components and using up stock of old status parts before the expire date of the exemptions (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 7.b referring to Decision 768/2008/EC Module A Internal production control). Not having a system to manage this could be seen as a lack of diligence and a criminal prosecution could occur (UK Instrument 2012 N. 3032 section 39 Penalties).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970's Bob Gallien {{teamed up with}} fellow HP {{engineer}} Rich Krueger and the company was renamed from GMT (Gallien-Martin-Taylor) to Gallien-Krueger. Although Rich Krueger is no longer involved in the company it has retained his name. In 1983 Gallien-Krueger launched the bass amplifier that would define {{the future of the}} company, namely the 800RB. The GK sound is defined by a dry [...] "growl" [...] and a quick reaction from the class H power amplifier. The company stopped producing electric guitar amplifiers in the early 1990s but continues to make bass amplifiers and bass cabinets.

5000|$|LED {{tubes are}} among the first LED lamp types for which an {{international}} harmonized standard has been established (IEC/EN 62776). The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) completed the standardisation process on 11 December 2014. The standardisation process created the preconditions for the manufacture of LED tubes compatible with traditional T8 fluorescent lamps. The standard also defines the properties of LED tubes, {{in order to ensure}} mutual compatibility and user safety. However, <b>non-compliant</b> LED tube <b>products</b> are still available on the market, in the case of which insufficient {{attention has been paid to}} safety. For example, the installation-related electric shock hazard addressed earlier by TUKES (The Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency) still exists in case of some products on the market. The CE marking does not guarantee safety.|$|R

40|$|Wageningen Academic Publishers. The Netherlands, 2013. All rights reserved. This paper {{rests on}} the simple premise that agri-businesses exists to make money. Like any other {{commercial}} sector, agri-businesses make money by maximising {{their share of the}} market whilst minimising their outlay. Minimising outlay can, and often does, mean ensuring that animal welfare standards are applied at the most minimal level allowed under the laws of the State in which the 'products' are 'produced'. 7 Hence if the agri-sector of State 'A' has very few regulatory requirements of animal welfare then this will place State 'A' at a competitive advantage in terms of its exports to State 'B' (which might adopt and implement higher animal welfare standards for its own agri-sector). This is clearly a problem for State B (from a financial and ethical point of view), and to correct this imbalance State B might wish to invoke trade restrictive measures ('TRMs') against imports from State A. By closing off the markets of State B to a business entity based in State A, this clearly has an impact on that entity's ability to maximise their share of the market and, consequently, might compel them to consider modifying their practices. Unfortunately whilst this logic is simple to understand, in practice it becomes very difficult to apply due to the historic reluctance of courts to allow such fetters on trade. This paper will demonstrate how, in the sphere of the international trade in fisheries it is lawful for States to implement TRMs against those States whose vessels do not abide by certain conditions (concerning {{the manner in which the}} fish were harvested) and effectively prohibit the import of <b>non-compliant</b> fisheries <b>products</b> into their territory. Following this analysis the paper will posit the simple question of what the real differences between constraints on trade for the protection of the marine environment and constraints on trade for the protection of animals actually are...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. Many {{people are}} {{choosing}} vegetarian options, however, the USDA database has limited data on meat-alternative options {{making it difficult}} to accurately estimate nutrient intake. To evaluate the nutrient composition accuracy presented on plant-based, meatalternative food labels, 40 different meat-alternative products were purchased for chemical analysis of protein, lipid, fiber, minerals and moisture using AOAC methods. These products were selected from a survey of 245 meat-alternative products identified in Honolulu markets, and were chosen based on their protein content, food form, and manufacturer. Results showed discrepancies between analytical data and product label values identifying more than 75 % (n= 31) of analyzed <b>products</b> <b>non-compliant</b> with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act 80 %- 120 % tolerance limits for 1 to 4 label values. Energy and protein label values were relatively consistent with analyzed values for all forty products (correlation coefficient of 0. 95 and 0. 96 respectively). Energy and protein label values were also most frequently within NLEA regulations (36 and 39 products respectively). In contrast, about 45 % (n = 18) of total fat label values were out of compliance (understated by 0. 7 g to 9. 1 g). Analyzed values for mineral content found both under and over stated label values. Iron content in products ranged from 5. 8 mg (32 % DV) less than label, to 3. 8 mg (21 % DV) more than label; calcium 158 mg (16 % DV) less than label to 153 mg (15 % DV) more than label; and sodium 310 mg less than label to 180 mg more than stated on label. Values for iron, calcium, and sodium were out of compliance for 25 %, 30 % and 7. 5 % of labels respectively. Many of these meatalternative convenience foods provide more calories from fat than the labels indicate and contain unpredictable amounts of iron and calcium. With the recognition of nutrition's importance to health, unreliable nutrient label information creates challenges for food purchasing decisions and for professionals assessing nutrient intake...|$|R

This was for example the case of incandescent lamps, for which a gradual phaseout started in the EU in 2009 under this Directive.

[...] A 2014 Vermont law went into effect on July 1, 2016, and some food manufacturers (including General Mills, Mars, Kellogg's, the Campbell Soup Company, PepsiCo, ConAgra, Frito-Lay, and Bimbo Bakeries USA) began distributing products either locally or nationwide with labels such as [...] "Partially produced with Genetic Engineering". [...] Other manufacturers removed about 3,000 <b>non-compliant</b> <b>products</b> from sale in Vermont. [...] The federal government of the United States passed a law {{at the end of that}} month pre-empting all state laws, including Vermont's.

40|$|Enhanced {{global trade}} forces {{companies}} {{to comply with}} a variety of environmental legislations each being subject to continuous modifications. During the past years the number of environmental legislations increased dramatically while law enforcement agencies expanded their active analysis of companies and their products. The number of companies being accused to sell <b>non-compliant</b> <b>products</b> by both enforcement authorities and competitors increases ever since. The compliance of companies and products is greatly dependent on their internal processes and their ability to adjust to changes. In this paper we introduce a highly applicable process aiming to ensure compliance with various hazardous substances regulations that has been tested successfully in over 70 companies of different industries in Germany. Thereby, we define essential steps, present a standardized approach for material, substance and risk assessment for articles based on existing standards (ISO 31000, 14040, 14044 and EN 50581) and discuss its applicability to different business types related to size, number of employees, suppliers and materials. While the process is found to be appropriate for all business types, the time span required for realization varies significantly. Especially large companies tend to suffer from bureaucratic structures, while small and micro sized companies rather lack of knowledge and availability of resources...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of seven {{bi-monthly}} articles on ‘do-it-yourself ’ electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing techniques. This series will cover the whole range of test methods – from simple tests for development and fault-finding purposes, through lowest-cost EMC checks; ‘pre-compliance ’ testing with various degrees of accuracy, on-site testing for large systems and installations; to full-specification compliance testing capable of meeting the requirements of national test accreditation bodies. Of course, what is low-cost to an organisation of 5000 people could be thought fairly expensive by a company of 50, and might be too expensive for a one-person outfit, but we will cover the complete range of possible costs here so that no-one is left out. Remember though, that the more you want to save money on EMC testing, or reduce the likelihood of being found selling <b>non-compliant</b> <b>products,</b> the cleverer and more skilled you need to be. Low cost, low risk, and low EMC skills do not go together. This series does not cover management and legal issues (e. g. how much testing should one do to ensure compliance with the EMC Directive). Neither does it describe how to actually perform EMC tests in sufficient detail. Much more information is available from the test standards themselves and from the references provided at the end of these articles.

40|$|The {{deadline}} {{for the implementation of}} the RoHS (Restriction of certain Hazardous Substances) Directive, which went into effect July 1, 2006, has already been expired. It is still the question whether all concerned products have already been successfully converted from non-compliance to compliance and what economical and environmental effects result from the RoHS transition. Within the EU project "GreenRoSE", a cooperation of industrial associations, research institutions and industry, a survey has been conducted in 40 electronic enterprises in Poland in October 2006. Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) make 85 % of the responders. The survey covered different sectors ranging from end producers, suppliers to producers of soldering equipment, and addressed the pre-RoHS situation, transition process and the post-RoHS status in view of management (logistics), environmental and economical issues. This paper gives an overview about the compliance status, identifies the critical issues in the RoHS transition process and evaluates the environmental and economical impact. Detailed data on costs of the transition process will be given. An analysis will be provided, how the SMEs deal with non-compliant parts they still have on stock and what are the technical problems not solved yet adequately. The ban of the six hazardous substances of the RoHS directive is still not transposed into practice fully by many, especially for lead. A longer transition phase is expected, resulting in a significant amount of <b>non-compliant</b> <b>products</b> entering the market. Nevertheless, the result of this paper is a step to obtain profound information in order to ensure RoHS compliance, and to maintain the experience of the enterprises from the implementation for future regulations. The GreenRoSE project undertook numerous efforts and activities to support SMEs in transition management - and the enterprises appreciated the various resources for information and assistance -, however, this could not solve the transition problems fully...|$|E
