5000|$|After the {{break-up}} of the FSLN-Convergence alliance in 2005, the FSLN formed the United Nicaragua Triumphs alliance.

5000|$|Prior {{to working}} with the United Nations, Gonzalez participated in the first peace-building {{operation}} {{under the umbrella of}} the Organization of American States in Nicaragua, the International Support and Verification Commission (CIAV-OEA, Spanish acronym), {{within the framework of the}} Tela Agreement [...] (1989).

After that, he was the Head of the Social Reintegration Programme, targeting more than 12,000 demobilized soldiers from the NR, the Sandinist Popular Army (EPS, Spanish acronym) as well as other rebel groups known as “recontras". In this context, Gonzalez developed the innovative approach of reintegration “as a family affair”, launching a nationwide self-construction housing programme, developing new resettlement areas to tackle the problem of land tenure in Nicaragua, allowing the reinsertion of more than 12,000 ex combatants and family members after almost nine years of conflict.|$|E
