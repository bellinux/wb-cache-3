IGN thought that the lack of fast travel was an impediment. Reviewers also noted technical issues with moving Marston's character, especially when climbing ladders and outrunning zombies.|$|E

25|$|Although symphonic {{music was}} <b>never</b> <b>too</b> {{important}} in Spain, chamber, solo instrumental (mainly guitar and piano) vocal and opera (both traditional opera, and the Spanish {{version of the}} singspiel) music was written by local composers. Zarzuela, a native form of opera that includes spoken dialogue, is a secular musical genre which developed in the mid-17th century, flourishing most importantly in the century after 1850. Francisco Asenjo Barbieri was {{a key figure in}} the development of the romantic zarzuela; whilst later composers such as Ruperto Chapí, Federico Chueca and Tomás Bretón brought the genre to its late 19th-century apogee. Leading 20th-century zarzuela composers included Pablo Sorozábal and Federico Moreno Torroba.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become the person that he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan {{fell in love with the}} sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's <b>never</b> <b>too</b> late to change, to become a better man.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{sought to}} reflect the Rhino's simplistic {{thinking}} style in his voice. He believes [...] "the quintessential 'thug' was played by William Bendix in The Glass Key.

He's mad or happy or angry or sad or hungry or whatever. And it never gets beyond his appetites or ego."

He concluded his review by saying, [...] "Overall, Aparichit is a slickly made, well-paced actioner that works quite well, despite the dub.

500|$|For io9 Animation, Jason Krell {{called it}} [...] "pretty solid", albeit lacking in {{relation}} to the season's story arc. In his [...] "additional musings" [...] section, he hoped that the war elephant will make a [...] "more meaningful" [...] return, while questioning why nobody in the episode commented on the return of Finn's arm from [...] "Breezy". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave it a B+, referring it as a [...] to early episodes of the show where specific lessons were taught without dealing with the serial elements of surrounding episodes. He wrote that, while [...] "not quite as substantial as recent installments, it's still very entertaining". Ryley Trahan of the online Entertainment Weekly praised the use of Ward's [...] "best, most subversive humor", calling it a [...] "great one-shot look" [...] into the main duo's mischief; in the print publication, Ray Rahman summarized, [...] "it's <b>never</b> <b>too</b> early to start saving, kids".|$|E
500|$|Before the album's release, M.I.A. {{said that}} audiences {{found it hard}} to dance to {{political}} songs.

[...] "Sunshowers", with its lyrical references to snipers, murder and the PLO, was written in response to the Tamil Tigers being considered terrorists in some quarters. She said, [...] "you can't separate the world into two parts like that, good and evil. America has successfully tied all these pockets of independence struggles, revolutions and extremists into one big notion of terrorism." [...] The lyrics caused controversy; MTV censored the sounds of gunshots in the song and MTV US refused to broadcast the video unless a disclaimer that disavowed the lyrics was added. The BBC described the lyrics as [...] "always fluid and <b>never</b> <b>too</b> rhetorical" [...] and sounding like [...] "snatches of overheard conversation". The songs deal with topics ranging from sex to drug dealing.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the review}} for Illmatic was {{handled by the}} magazine's {{columnist}} Miss Info (then writing under the nom de plume, [...] "shortie"), who shared Schecter's enthusiasm for Nas' album.

No cliched metaphors, no gimmicks. <b>Never</b> <b>too</b> abstract, never superficial." [...] She also commented on the impact of Nas's [...] "poetic realism" [...] writing: “Nas’ images remind me of the personal memories and people, both passed and present… All this may sound like melodrama but it not just me. I've been hearing similar responses all over. While 'Memory Lane' is my shit, my homies claim 'The World Is Yours,' and if you've got peoples doing time, then 'One Love' may hit you the hardest.". With the backing of Schecter and the other editors on the staff, Minya awarded Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating.|$|E

500|$|Schyman {{continued}} to work in television music composition {{for the next two}} decades, working on shows such as The A-Team and Land's End. Beginning in 1986 he also began to compose music for movies such as <b>Never</b> <b>Too</b> Young to Die. Schyman moved into video game composition with Voyeur, released in 1993, after being asked to by his friend Robert Weaver, an executive at Philips, which was creating and publishing the game for its CD-i system. He used a live orchestra to score the game, one of the first video games to do so. The soundtrack won the Cybermania Award for best soundtrack. He scored the sequel, released in 1996, and 1995's Off-World Interceptor, but afterward Weaver left the company and the games division of Phillips was shut down. Rather than move to a new video game company Schyman left the industry and did not return for almost a decade, later stating that he felt that it was [...] "not a very interesting place for composers at that time" [...] as the budgets were low and the technical music quality poor.|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written {{from the perspective of}} one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, [...] "Desiring a Love Story", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, [...] "Preparing for a Love Story", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, [...] "Waiting for a Love Story", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, [...] "Sweetening a Love Story", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, [...] "Discovering a God-written Love Story", argues that it is <b>never</b> <b>too</b> late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.|$|E

[...] High responds that this is indeed true, that a huge amount are already in Valhalla, but yet this amount will seem to be too few when [...] "the wolf comes." [...] High describes that there are <b>never</b> <b>too</b> many to feed in Valhalla, for they feast from Sæhrímnir (here described as a boar), and that this beast is cooked every day and is again whole every night. Grímnismál stanza 18 is then recounted. Gangleri asks if Odin himself eats the same food as the Einherjar, and High responds that Odin needs nothing to eat—Odin only consumes wine—and he gives his food to his wolves Geri and Freki. Grímnismál stanza 19 is then recounted. High additionally states that at sunrise, Odin sends his ravens Huginn and Muninn from Valhalla to fly throughout the entire world, and they return in time for the first meal there.|$|E
