5|$|Joseph {{was born}} on April 29, 1967 to {{unmarried}} teenage parents. Five days after his birth, his mother, Wendy Munro, placed him for adoption with Jeanne Joseph, a nurse who had befriended her during her hospital stay, and her husband Harold Joseph. Jeanne and her husband decided to name the baby Curtis after his birth father Curtis Nickle. Curtis grew up with an older stepbrother Grant and a stepbrother Victor; he also has three older stepsisters and a step brother from a previous marriage. The family was of mixed race with Harold and Victor being black. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> signed with the St. Louis Blues that Joseph legally changed his name from Curtis Shayne Munro to Curtis Shayne Joseph.|$|E
5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> got a synthesizer, however, that he began to feel his potential as a composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books and listening {{to a wide variety of}} musical genres.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{had been}} an {{alternate}} member of the Central Committee since 1934, a full member since 1938, {{and a member of}} the Politburo since 1945, but it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> became the leader of the PLA and moved permanently to Beijing, in November 1953, that Peng was able to attend regular political meetings and became active in domestic politics. Peng had been loyal to Mao's leadership since the 1935 Zunyi Conference, and continued to support Mao for several years after moving to Beijing. Peng (like Lin Biao) was implicated in passively supporting Gao Gang's effort to replace Liu Shaoqi as the second most powerful person in China in 1953, but then opposed Gao in 1954, once Mao made his own opposition clear. Mao did not take any action against Peng (or Lin), but Peng's involvement alienated Peng from Liu and Liu's supporters. In 1955 Peng supported Mao's efforts to collectivize agriculture. Along with Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Lin Boqu, and Luo Ronghuan, Peng opposed Mao's attempt to liberalize China's culture and politics in the first stages of the 1957 Hundred Flowers Campaign, but then supported Mao's efforts to arrest and persecute Chinese citizens who had criticized the CCP later that year.|$|E

25|$|Christie's early track {{career was}} not promising. He {{failed to make}} the Great Britain team for the 1984 Summer Olympics, not even being {{included}} in the sprint relay squad.

25|$|Emerson {{is often}} {{known as one}} of the most liberal {{democratic}} thinkers of his time who believed that through the democratic process, slavery should be abolished. While being an avid abolitionist who was known for his criticism of the legality of slavery, Emerson struggled with the implications of race. His usual liberal leanings did not clearly translate when it came to believing that all races had equal capability or function, which was a common conception for the period in which he lived. Many critics believe that it was his views on race that inhibited him from becoming an abolitionist earlier in his life and also inhibited him from being more active in the antislavery movement. Much of his early life, he was silent on the topic of race and slavery. <b>Not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> was well into his 30s did Emerson begin to publish writings on race and slavery, and <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> was in his late 40s and 50s did he became known as an antislavery activist.|$|E

As Haig pointed out later, while Company B's move was necessary, the lack of accurate control of artillery and air support complicated the problem. As a result, B Company had entered the battle without sufficient preparation and found itself heavily engaged along with the reconnaissance platoon.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even with}} the new street railway {{connecting}} with the FEC, while wealthy people came to vacation, only a few were buying land or building homes. The U.S. public was apparently slow to catch on to the vacation land and homes Fisher envisioned for Florida.

25|$|Even in {{the earlier}} years of his marriage, La Fontaine {{seems to have been}} much in Paris, {{but it was not until}} about 1656 that he became a regular visitor to the capital. The duties of his office, which were only occasional, were {{compatible}} with this non-residence. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> was past thirty that his literary career began. The reading of Malherbe, it is said, first awoke poetical fancies in him, but for some time he attempted nothing but trifles in the fashion of the time — epigrams, ballades, rondeaux, etc.|$|E
25|$|His {{scientific}} writings {{are all in}} {{the form}} of commentaries. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> was seventy that (with the exception of a brief tract on the De insomniis of Hippocrates) he felt that any of them were ready for publication. In 1556 he printed his Dialogue on the De plantis attributed to Aristotle, and in 1557 his Exercitationes on Jerome Cardan's, De subtilitate. His other scientific works, commentaries on Theophrastus' De causis plantarum and Aristotle's History of Animals, he left in a more or less unfinished state, and they were not printed until after his death.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 he and {{his wife}} left their two {{children}} (Diana aged 11 and Daniel aged 10) with Piazzolla's parents and travelled to Paris. Piazzolla was tired of tango and tried to hide his tanguero past and his bandoneon compositions from Boulanger, thinking that his destiny lay in classical music. Introducing his work, Piazzolla played her a number of his classically inspired compositions, but it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> played his tango Triunfal that she congratulated him and encouraged him to pursue his career in tango, recognising that this was where his talent lay. This was to prove a historic encounter and a cross-road in Piazzolla's career.|$|E

25|$|On 12 June 1944,'B' Company was {{attempting}} to stem the enemy's advance when it came under heavy machine-gun and tank machine-gun fire. Rifleman Ganju Lama, with complete disregard for his own safety, took his PIAT gun and, crawling forward, succeeded in bringing the gun into action within 30 yards of the enemy tanks, knocking out two of them. Despite a broken wrist and two other serious wounds to his right and left hands he then moved forward and engaged the tank crew {{who were trying to}} escape. <b>Not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> had accounted for all of them did he consent to have his wounds dressed.|$|E
25|$|Lowe {{began his}} working life {{shortly before the}} Second World War (1939–1945) and he {{featured}} in many theatrical performances. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> landed the part of Leonard Swindley in the British television soap Coronation Street that he became a household name. He played the character until 1966, while continuing film work. In 1968 he took up his most famous role, in Dad's Army, written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. His success as this character led to considerable television and theatrical work, which put pressure on his health. Lowe's final years were dominated by alcoholism and illness and he died from a stroke on 15 April 1982, aged 66.|$|E
25|$|Dallas had {{the eighth}} {{pick in the}} 1985 NBA draft—again due to a trade with the Cavaliers—and drafted German-born forward Detlef Schrempf out of Washington. He would show flashes of {{brilliance}} in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> {{was traded to the}} Indiana Pacers that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center Kurt Nimphius to the Los Angeles Clippers for center James Donaldson, who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the 1991–92 season. This allowed the Mavericks to have the steady hand at center that had been lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson was the only All-Star center in Dallas Maverick history.|$|E

25|$|After his motorscooter accident, Kitano took up painting. His {{paintings}} {{have been published}} in books, featured in gallery exhibitions, and adorn the covers of many of the soundtrack albums for his films. His paintings were featured prominently in his most critically acclaimed film, 1997's Hana-bi. Although for years already Kitano's largest audience had been the foreign arthouse crowd, Hana-bi cemented his status internationally as one of Japan's foremost modern filmmakers. Although it was not a big success financially, it won the Golden Lion award at the 1997 Venice Film Festival. Kitano himself said it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> won this award that he was accepted as a serious director in Japan; prior his films were looked at as just the hobby of a famous comedian.|$|E
25|$|Granger was in New York when he {{was summoned}} to return to Hollywood and discuss Rope with Hitchcock. The night before their initial meeting, Granger coincidentally met Arthur Laurents, who had written the film's screenplay, {{which was based on}} the play Rope's End, a fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb murder case. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> began reading the script that he {{connected}} its author with the man he had met the previous night. Granger and Laurents met again, and Laurents invited the actor to spend the night. He declined, but when the offer was extended again several days later, he accepted. It proved to be the start of a romantic relationship that lasted {{about a year and a}} frequently tempestuous friendship that extended for decades beyond their breakup.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Travolta starred with Kirstie Alley in Look Who's Talking, which grossed $297,000,000, {{making it}} his most {{successful}} film since Grease.

But it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> played Vincent Vega in Quentin Tarantino's hit Pulp Fiction (1994), for which he received an Academy Award nomination, that his career revived. The movie shifted him back onto the A-list, and he was inundated with offers. Notable roles following Pulp Fiction include a movie-buff loan shark in Get Shorty (1995), an FBI agent and terrorist in Face/Off (1997), a desperate attorney in A Civil Action (1998), a Bill Clinton-esque presidential candidate in Primary Colors (1998), and a military investigator in The General's Daughter (1999).|$|E
