40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{the choice of a}} numeraire for the {{calculation}} of the sales <b>volume</b> <b>variance.</b> The sales <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> seeks to report the effect of the actual sales volume being different from the budgeted sales volume. If different numeraires are possible, then different values for the sales <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> will exist for a given deviation between planned and actual sales levels. We observe from the explicit or implicit materials in various common cost accounting textbooks that at least three numeraires are in evidence of use. These are: sales revenue; contribution margin and full-cost margin. The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare the effects of using the different numeraires. We also discuss the interrelationship between sales <b>volume</b> <b>variances</b> and production <b>volume</b> <b>variances</b> as two of the numeraires lead to the reporting of the production <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> while the use of the contribution margin as a numeraire leads to a situation where the production <b>volume</b> <b>variance</b> cannot exist. In order to illustrate these concepts in an accessible form we present a case study. The case study demonstrates the results that are obtained when three different managers, each using a different numeraire, report on the results of a company where sales volume has missed the budget by a substantial amount. Given the strategic importance of making realistic sales forecasts and achieving sales targets, then this issue of reporting the effect of deviations from targets is of major importance...|$|R

One original aspect of these measurements by particle image velocimetry is the high acquisition rate for a PIV system (20 kHz). By using these highly- resolved flow measurements, the fluid flow velocity is used to estimate the spatial and temporal evolution of the EHD volume force. A reduced order model of this force has been constructed by proper orthogonal decomposition. Based on the analy sis of the time-resolved expansion coefficients and their associated spatial modes, it is shown that the volume force can be reconstructed by using {{a limited number of}} POD mode s (6 modes). This spatial and temporal filtering of the force fields remains faithful to t he original data and it will help in view of an implementation of such a source term in a numerical solver. The resulting dynamic model shows an alternation of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>volume</b> forc es.

This architecture significantly improved performance for hard-to-distinguish classes, like approval ("You're a clever robot") versus attention ("Hey Kismet, over here").|$|R
