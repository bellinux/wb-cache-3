"Sit down, my dear, I 'm {{glad to see}} you, but {{excuse me}} if I go on with my work, as I 'm in a driving hurry to get these things done to-night," [...] said the brisk little lady, {{with a smile and}} a nod, as she took a new <b>needleful</b> of thread, and ran up a seam as if for a wager.|$|E
6000|$|A thin chill like a <b>needleful</b> {{of frozen}} thread ran down Asaph's back. [...] "Mr. Himes's clothes!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What {{in the world}} are you talkin' about, Thomas Rooper? 'Tain't likely he had many, 'cept what he was buried in; and what's left, if there is any, Marietta would no more think of givin' away than she would of hangin' up his funeral wreath for the canary-bird to perch on. There's a room up in the garret where she keeps his special things--for she's awful particular--and if there is any of his clothes up there I expect she's got 'em framed." ...|$|E
6000|$|William {{was often}} called on by his uncle {{to be the}} talker. His {{recitals}} were amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas, but the chief object in seeking them {{was to understand the}} reciter, to know the young man by his histories; and he listened to his clear, simple, spirited details with full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles, professional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness, everything that could deserve or promise well. Young as he was, William had already seen a great deal. He had been in the Mediterranean; in the West Indies; in the Mediterranean again; had been often taken on shore by the favour of his captain, {{and in the course of}} seven years had known every variety of danger which sea and war together could offer. With such means in his power he had a right to be listened to; and though Mrs. Norris could fidget about the room, and disturb everybody in quest of two <b>needlefuls</b> of thread or a second-hand shirt button, in the midst of her nephew's account of a shipwreck or an engagement, everybody else was attentive; and even Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved, or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say, [...] "Dear me! how disagreeable! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea." ...|$|R

He pulled out the drawer of this table, and found there a palm and needle and some sail-twine. We were making awnings for your brig, as you had asked me last voyage before you left. He knew, of course, {{where to look for}} what he wanted. By his orders they laid me out on the floor, wrapped me in my hammock, and he started to stitch me in, as if I had been a corpse, beginning at the feet. While he worked he laughed wickedly. I called him all the names I could think of. He told them to put their dirty paws over my mouth and nose. I was nearly choked. Whenever I moved they punched me in the ribs. He went on taking fresh <b>needlefuls</b> as he wanted them, and working steadily. Sewed me up to my throat. Then he rose, saying, 'That will do; let go.' That woman had been standing by; they must have been reconciled. She clapped her hands. I lay on the floor like a bale of goods while he stared at me, and the woman shrieked with delight. Like a bale of goods! There was a grin on every face, and the verandah was full of them. I wished myself dead--'pon my word, Captain Lingard, I did! I do now whenever I think of it!" ...|$|R
60|$|I am glad I was {{not really}} much afraid of him--that, indeed, close in his presence, I felt no terror at all; for upon his {{demanding}} cord and gibbet to execute the sentence recently pronounced, I was able to furnish him with a <b>needleful</b> of embroidering thread with such accommodating civility as could not but allay some portion at least of his surplus irritation. Of course I did not parade this courtesy before public view: I merely handed the thread round {{the angle of the}} desk, and attached it, ready noosed, to the barred back of the Professor's chair.|$|E
6000|$|As {{daylight}} goes {{she follows}} {{it with her}} sewing to the window, and gets another <b>needleful</b> out of it, as one may run after a departed visitor for a last word, but now the gas is lit, and no longer is it shameful to sit down to literature. If the book be a story by George Eliot or Mrs. Oliphant, her favourites (and mine) among women novelists, or if it be a Carlyle, and we move softly, she will read, entranced, for hours. Her delight in Carlyle was so well known that various good people would send her books that contained a page about him; she could place her finger on any passage wanted in the biography as promptly {{as though she were}} looking for some article in her own drawer, and given a date she was often able to tell you what they were doing in Cheyne Row that day. Carlyle, she decided, was not so much an ill man to live with as one who needed a deal of managing, but when I asked if she thought she could have managed him she only replied with a modest smile that meant ‘Oh no!’ but had the face of ‘Sal, I would have liked to try.’ ...|$|E
60|$|But {{what was}} still more surprising, {{and tended to}} impart a new and strange insight into the {{character}} of sailors, and overthrow some long-established ideas concerning them as a class, was this: numbers of men who, during the cruise, had passed for exceedingly prudent, nay, parsimonious persons, who would even refuse you a patch, or a <b>needleful</b> of thread, and, from their stinginess, procured the name of Ravelings--no sooner were these men fairly adrift in harbour, and {{under the influence of}} frequent quaffings, than their three-years'-earned wages flew right and left; they summoned whole boarding-houses of sailors to the bar, and treated them over and over again. Fine fellows! generous-hearted tars! Seeing this sight, I thought to myself, Well, these generous-hearted tars on shore were the greatest curmudgeons afloat! it's the bottle that's generous, not they! Yet the popular conceit concerning a sailor is derived from his behaviour ashore; whereas, ashore he is no longer a sailor, but a landsman for the time. A man-of-war's-man is only a man-of-war's-man at sea; and the sea is the place to learn what he is. But we have seen that a man-of-war is but this old-fashioned world of ours afloat, full of all manner of characters--full of strange contradictions; and though boasting some fine fellows here and there, yet, upon the whole, charged to the combings of her hatchways with the spirit of Belial and all unrighteousness.|$|E
