Although they came from different backgrounds and political interests, these organizers and leaders were intent on the peacefulness of the march, which had its own marshal to ensure that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law. The success of the march is still being debated, but one aspect which has been raised was the misrepresentation of women.

40|$|Research {{reports as}} PISA and PIRLS show that reading {{comprehension}} among Swedish students have deteriorated {{in recent years}} and that girls have better reading comprehension than boys. The basis for this study is Maj-Gun Johansson's reading comprehension test done during the four years between the years 2005 - 2008 in the seventh grade in a municipality in Sweden. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine reading literacy in terms of the influence of content and form of texts viewed from a gender perspective. The study is divided into two parts. The first part is a survey on local reading comprehension compared with results from a similar <b>national</b> <b>text.</b> The second part examines the texts where the students had the lowest result, and the texts with highest differences in comparison between girls and boys. The results show that the most difficult text for both girls and boys was a factual text in which the content had no links to students' everyday lives and containing mathematical symbols. The form of the text made it more difficult to read when it contained difficult words, long sentences and was written in the passive form. The text had neither narration nor causal words. A literary text with two female characters showed the highest difference between girls' and boys' reading comprehension. The result indicates advantage to the girls. The result also indicates that although the form of the text was relatively simple, the text content and the identification factor plays a greater role for the boys in reading comprehension.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers Thai cinema as a <b>national</b> <b>text.</b> It portrays {{and analyses}} Thai film from {{the introduction of}} cinema to Thailand {{during the reign of}} King Chulalongkorn (1868 - 1910) up until the present day (2004). At its core, this thesis adopts the ideas of Higson, O'Regan and Dissanayake in considering the cultural negotiation of cinema and the construction of nation. In this study of Thai National Cinema two principal methods are employed - economic and text-based. In terms of political economy Thai National Cinema is explored through the historical development of the local film industry, the impact of imported cinema, taxation, censorship and government policy, and the interplay between vertically and horizontally integrated media businesses. Special attention is paid to the evolving and dynamic role of the ruling class in the local film industry. The dissertation's text-based analyses concern the social and ideological contexts of these national productions in order to consider extant characteristics of Thai nationhood and how these are either reflected or problematised in Thai Cinema. Of particular relevance is this dissertation's emphasis on three resilient and potent signifiers of Thai identity- nation, religion,and monarchy - and their interrelationship and influence in the development of Thai National Cinema. These three 'pillars' of Thai society form the basis for organising an understanding of the development of Thai cinematic tradition, now over a century old. This thesis argues that any discussion of the historical, or current, development of Thai National Cinema must accommodate the pervasive role that these three principal forms of national identity play in formulating Thai society, culture, and politics. The recent challenges of globalisation and postmodernism, as well as the rise of an educated middle-class, provide opportunity for reconceptualizing the relevance of these three pillars. In this way Thai National Cinema can be considered a useful barometer in both reflecting and promoting the construction of Thai identity and thought...|$|E

Analisa-se a imaginação de raça na obra de Elizabeth Bishop, uma poetisa importante da literatura estadunidense. O assunto ‘raça’ cruza com o problema da identidade nacional, também negligenciado na obra de Bishop, embora de modo diferente. A presente discussão alinha o texto racial ao texto nacional. Como pode-se compreender o seu interesse constante sobre ‘raça’ e quais são os efeitos em sua poesia como resultado de sua exposição às construções raciais no Brasil, as quais são tão diferentes daquelas nos Estados Unidos? Este efeito manifesta-se também em seu artigo numa revista de 1965 referente ao quatrocentenário do Rio de Janeiro. Esta controvérsia parece mostrar que a experiência nacional sobre ‘raça’ é mutuamente exclusiva. Na prosa não se pode ser brasileiro ou estadunidense ao mesmo tempo. Na poesia, parece que os parâmetros são diferentes. O problema deve ser abordado em sua totalidade e, na obra de Bishop, tem sido conduzido de acordo com uma lógica desligada da construção nacional...|$|E
40|$|Shiroi Boushi" (the white hat) by Aman Kimiko is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} pioneer works among fantasy novels. However, because it also appears in the Japanese language <b>national</b> <b>text</b> books list for primary schools, it has been subject to educational rather than literary debate. However, because of ambiguities in interpretation that are characteristic to fantasy novels, "Shiroi Boushi" leaves the impression that it is a difficult text to teach for teachers. My opinion is that a fantasy novel requires a teaching method that maximizes the quality of fantasy, and in order to develop such a method, it is firstly necessary to identify the basic structure of a fantasy novel. In this paper, I reexamine the concept of fantasy, paying particular attention to the differences between a fantasy and a fairy tale. As a result of such reexamination, I have come to the conclusion that "Shiroi Boushi" can be located somewhere in between a fantasy and a fairy tale. To be more precise, I argue that "Shiroi Boushi" is built on a structure of a fantasy, but topped with elements of a fairy tale. I pay particular attention to the channel that links the reality-fantasy-reality i. e. the core structure of a fantasy, and attempted to analyze the structure of "Shiroi Boushi" accordingly. This link in fact highlights the double fantasy structure of "Shiroi Boushi" and the binomial formula that the author utlizes in order to broaden the limits of interpretation. I argue that this is a reflection of the author's wish and attempt to emphasize the multiplicity of perspectives that exist in our society. This of course is in line with the definition of a fantasy. Perhaps the first impression that the reader may receive after reading the novel is of ambiguity. However, such ambiguity is a result of a complex and the mature structure on which "Shiroi Boushi" is built. The structure is in fact very logical and original, and is a reflection of the multifaceted ness of the novel...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{differences}} between the Italian translations of European Union (EU) directives and the Italian used in national laws. It focuses on the lexical features of comparable and parallel corpora and their mutual influence. Differences emerge in terms of both lexical richness (greater in national laws) and register (also higher in <b>national</b> <b>texts).</b> Moreover, the specific text-structure of EU directives is signalled by a greater number of connectors. Lexical differences also involve repeated segments: national laws show greater variation, whereas the segments used in EU directives are more specific. In terms of style, features used at national level impact on the Italian translations of EU texts. For example, in parallel corpora, the style of Italian texts is more formal than the style of their English counterparts. This shows that Italian translators of EU directives are heavily influenced by the stylistic choices made when drafting national laws. So it is Italian law-makers who need to relinquish stylistically marked features when drafting legal texts. Then, translators can follow suit. The opposite would be – of course – unimaginable...|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses {{institutional}} ethnography {{to explore}} the text-based regulatory framework of the Australian Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector. Training Packages are national competency standards used to assess local workplace practice. The Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF) is a national compliance framework used to audit local learning and assessment practice. These texts operate in a ‘symbiotic relationship’ to achieve a policy goal of national consistency. The researcher explicates the social relations of VET starting from her disquiet as a practitioner. The thesis argues that Training Packages and the AQTF socially organise the content and delivery of local learning and assessment activities. VET practitioners struggle to use these texts to support good practice, and their hidden work maintains an unstable VET system. Yet the extralocal mode of ruling offers no room to challenge VET policy. The thesis explicates three themes. Interview data is used {{to explore the}} contrast between the institutional language of Training Packages and the vernacular of workplaces in which these texts are activated. Many practitioners and participants simply do not understand Training Package competency standards. Using these texts to judge employee performance shifts the policing of workplace practice from local sites to external VET authorities. A second theme emerges as the analysis explores why VET practitioners use this excluding language in their work with participants. Interview data reveals that local training organisations achieve different readings as they engage with ruling VET texts. Some organisations use the <b>national</b> <b>texts</b> as broad frameworks, allowing practitioners to create spaces for meaningful learning. Other organisations adopt a narrow and rule-bound reading of <b>national</b> <b>texts,</b> displacing practitioners’ authority over their own practice. A third theme is explored through examination of a sequence of VET texts. The review and redevelopment of the mandatory qualifications for VET practitioners identified the language of the competency standards as a significant accessibility issue. These concerns were reshaped and subsumed in an official response that established the use of this language as a compulsory assessable requirement and a language and literacy benchmark. The thesis presents a new understanding of VET as a regulatory framework established through multiple levels of ruling texts that connect local sites to national government agendas. While some individual practitioners are able to navigate through this system, there is an urgent need for practitioners as a profession to challenge national hegemony...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} to the Quinnipiac Law Review’s annual symposium edition, this year devoted {{to the work of}} Mark Tushnet, I read his antijuridification scholarship “against the grain,” concluding both that Tushnet’s later scholarship is neo-Realist rather than critical in its orientation, and that both his early scholarship on slavery and his post- 9 / 11 constitutional work reveal an ambivalence about the claim that we learn from history to circumscribe our excesses, which anchors his popular constitutionalist rhetoric. The likeness of Tushnet’s scholarship to the work of the Realists lies in this: while the Realists’ search for a science that would satisfy their paradoxical and unacknowledged yearning for truth led them, after they “proved” legal science fallible, to social science, Tushnet’s always already failed search is for reason, or at least rationality, and for a type of modesty, {{at least as much as}} to justice claims as truth claims, in legal institutions, subjects, and discourses. Seeking to make visible the equally characteristic but less assertive orientation to “Others” that runs through Tushnet’s work, I use the native title and Chapter III judicial power jurisprudence of the Australian High Court to argue that Tushnet’s antijuridification scholarship might be read as a rhetorical gambit to shock left legalism out of what Judith Resnik describes as its “McCleskey problem,” its blindness to the local and particular evidence of legal institutions’ complicity in structural subordination. I conclude that a close reading of both Tushnet’s contributions to The Constitution in Wartime and his antijuridification jeremiad, Taking the Constitution Away from the Courts suggest his awareness of the need to confront the judges and the courts with their practical responsibility for maintaining constitutionalism. Engaging with Michael Seidman’s {{contribution to}} the symposium, I close the essay in suggesting that when, as in Mark Tushnet’s suggestive orientation to “the Other” just before the end of the essay “Defending Korematsu?,” he sees the Other face to face, he extends an invitation to read in his most recent constitutional law scholarship a resurgence of the orientation to Others that was the ground of his scholarly work, and thus to conclude that one does not have to move from the realm of hermeneutics to that of metaphor, as Seidman suggests is necessary, to identify his commitment to what is paradoxically a certain kind of “thick” constitutionalism, which conceives of it as something more than a bare practice for allocating political power in the nation-state, necessarily implying some ethical engagement between subjects who govern and those who are governed. That commitment is premised on a “thin constitution” that promises two things. First, that it might shield us and Others from at least the worst excesses of the violence of state tyranny. Second, it encodes what may be cynical rhetoric, aspirational constitutive <b>national</b> <b>text,</b> denial that is admission of the originary national pathology that eats out the nation’s core, or all of these things. That is, a commitment to equality in a nation with a government which Thurgood Marshall called “defective from the start,” founded on chattel slavery and persistently unwilling to address that inheritance from the Founders, a pervasive structural subordination of Others that imbricates its fiber yet...|$|E
