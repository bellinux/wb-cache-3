2500|$|Poaceae or Gramineae is a {{large and}} nearly {{ubiquitous}} family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses. [...] Poaceae includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and cultivated lawns and pasture. Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species, Poaceae are the fifth-largest , following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.|$|E
2500|$|The Center-West has [...] {{and covers}} 18.9% of the {{national}} territory. Its main biome is the cerrado, the tropical savanna in which <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> is partly covered with twisted shrubs and small trees. The cerrado was used for low-density cattle-raising {{in the past but}} is now also used for soybean production. There are gallery forests along the rivers and streams and some larger areas of forest, most of which have been cleared for farming and livestock. In the north, the cerrado blends into tropical forest. It also includes the Pantanal wetlands in the west, known for their wildlife, especially aquatic birds and caimans. In the early 1980s, 33.6% of the region had been altered by anthropic activities, with a low of 9.3% in Mato Grosso and a high of 72.9% in Goiás (not including Tocantins). In 1996 the Center-West region had 10.2 million inhabitants, or 6% of Brazil's total population. The average density is low, with concentrations in and around the cities of Brasília, Goiânia, Campo Grande, and Cuiabá. Living standards are below the national average. In 1994 they were highest in the Federal District, with per capita income of US$7,089 (the highest in the nation), and lowest in Mato Grosso, with US$2,268.|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} {{of land use}} for agriculture is among {{the main reasons for}} the reduction of <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands</b> around the world, and {{little is known about the}} recovery potential of original native grassland vegetation from seed banks. The aim of this study was to assess the seed bank potential of grassland areas with or without history of cultivation in southern Brazil. Specifically, we aimed at evaluating if agricultural use allowed for the persistence of species typical of <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands</b> in soil seed banks. We analyzed seed banks in two areas with a history of cultivation and in two <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Samples were collected in spring and autumn in order to assess transient and persistent components, and were characterized by density, richness, presence of exotic species and relationship between seed bank and established vegetation. Both richness and density were high; we found a total of 114 species and a mean density of 61, 796 seedlings/m 2 for all four areas in the spring sampling. In the <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands,</b> the dominant species of established vegetation were mostly absent from the soil seed bank.

Moreover, we examined whether bird's communities were different {{depending on the}} biome grasslands were inserted. We carried out bird surveys in six private farms in the Upland grasslands (Atlantic Forest biome) and the Pampas grasslands (Pampa biome). Land use included: (1) <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands</b> – paddocks with cattle stocking around 0. 8 animal units/ha, without improvement/crop plantation {{in the last four}} years; (2) improved grasslands – grasslands with usage of fertilizers and forage improvement with exotic species, and (3) cultivated fields – forage/crop plantations. Threatened and restricted grassland birds were found in <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands</b> areas while more common species occurred in improved grasslands and cultivated fields. Bird community was different in the biomes with some species more related to the Upland grasslands and others to the Pampas. We highlighted the importance of <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands</b> and its management in private farms to maintain grassland bird species richness and their abundance in south Brazil...|$|R

40|$|Grasslands harbour {{significant}} {{biodiversity and}} their restoration {{is a common}} intervention in biodiversity conservation. However, we know very little on how grassland restoration influences arthropod groups. Here we compared orthopteran assemblages in croplands, <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands</b> and one to four-year-old grasslands restored in a large-scale restoration on former croplands in Hortobágy National Park (E-Hungary). Sampling was done by standardized sweep-netting both in a repeated measures design and space-for-time substitution (chronosequence) design. General linear models with repeated measures from five years showed that species richness, abundance and Shannon diversity of orthopterans decreased in the year following restoration but increased afterwards. By the fourth year, species richness almost doubled and abundance increased almost ten-fold in restored grasslands compared to croplands. Multivariate analyses showed that species composition {{in the first two}} years did not progress much but by the third and fourth year there was partial overlap with <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Local restoration conditions (last crop, seed mixture) and landscape configuration (proportion of <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands</b> < 1 km away) did not influence the above patterns in either the repeated measures or the chronosequence design, whereas time since restoration affected almost all community variables. Our results suggest that generalist ubiquitous species appeared in restored grasslands first and the more sensitive species colonized the restored fields gradually in later years. The qualitative and quantitative properties of the orthopteran assemblages in restored fields did not yet reach those of <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands,</b> therefore, our study suggests that the full regeneration of the orthopteran assemblages takes more than four years...|$|R
