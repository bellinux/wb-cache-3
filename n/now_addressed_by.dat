Many languages encode these linguistic forms directly into their grammar; however, in English these politeness distinctions are expressed lexically through word choice as speakers must select amongst various forms of a name (e. g., first/last name) and/or title (e. g., Mr., Mrs., Dr.) when addressing a communicative partner.

40|$|Azole-bridged diplatinum {{compounds}} {{are promising}} new anticancer drugs designed to induce small distortions upon DNA alkylation, able to circumvent resistance problems of existing platinum drugs. Hybrid quantum classical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of different azole-bridged platinum drugs have recently revealed {{the nature of}} the local deformations at the DNA binding site. However, the description of global slow con- verging rearrangements cannot be addressed by QM/MM MD due to the short time scale accessible. Extensive clas- sical MD simulations are therefore mandatory to describe accurately the structural distortions in the DNA double helix. This issue is <b>now</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> developing a new set of accurate force field parameters of the platinated moiety via a recently proposed force matching procedure of the classical forces to ab initio forces obtained from QM/MM trajectories. The accuracy of our force field parameters is validated by comparison of structural properties from clas- sical MD and hybrid QM/MM simulations. The structural characteristics of the Pt-lesion are well reproduced during classical MD compared with QM/MM simulations and available experimental data. The global distortions in the DNA duplex upon binding of dinuclear Pt-compounds are very small and rather opposite to those induced by cispla- tin. Thus, the force match approach significantly extends the potentialities of molecular simulations in the study of anticancer drugs and of the interactions with their biological targets...|$|E
40|$|Helium {{diffusion}} from apatite is {{a sensitive}} {{function of the}} volume fraction of radiation damage to the crystal, a quantity that varies over the lifetime of the apatite. Using recently published laboratory data we develop and investigate a new kinetic model, the radiation damage accumulation and annealing model (RDAAM), that adopts the effective fission-track density {{as a proxy for}} accumulated radiation damage. This proxy incorporates creation of crystal damage proportional to α-production from U and Th decay, and the elimination of that damage governed by the kinetics of fission-track annealing. The RDAAM is a version of the helium trapping model (HeTM; Shuster D. L., Flowers R. M. and Farley K. A. (2006) The influence of natural radiation damage on helium diffusion kinetics in apatite. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 249, 148 – 161), calibrated by helium diffusion data in natural and partially annealed apatites. The chief limitation of the HeTM, <b>now</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> RDAAM, is its use of He concentration as the radiation damage proxy for circumstances in which radiation damage and He are not accumulated and lost proportionately from the crystal. By incorporating the RDAAM into the HeFTy computer program, we explore its implications for apatite (U–Th) /He thermochronometry. We show how (U–Th) /He dates predicted from the model are sensitive to both effective U concentration (eU) and details of the temperature history. The RDAAM predicts an effective He closure temperature of 62 °C for a 28 ppm eU apatite of 60 μm radius that experienced a 10 °C/Ma monotonic cooling rate; this is 8 °C lower than the 70 °C effective closure temperature predicted using commonly assumed Durango diffusion kinetics. Use of the RDAAM is most important for accurate interpretation of (U–Th) /He data for apatite suites that experienced moderate to slow monotonic cooling (1 – 0. 1 °C/Ma), prolonged residence in the helium partial retention zone, or a duration at temperatures appropriate for radiation damage accumulation followed by reheating and partial helium loss. Under common circumstances the RDAAM predicts (U–Th) /He dates that are older, sometimes much older, than corresponding fission-track dates. Nonlinear positive correlations between apatite (U–Th) /He date and eU in apatites subjected to the same temperature history are a diagnostic signature of the RDAAM for many but not all thermal histories. Observed date-eU correlations in four different localities can be explained with the RDAAM using geologically reasonable thermal histories consistent with independent fission-track datasets. The existence of date-eU correlations not only supports a radiation damage based kinetic model, but can significantly limit the range of acceptable time-temperature paths that account for the data. In contrast, these datasets are inexplicable using the Durango diffusion model. The RDAAM helps reconcile enigmatic data in which apatite (U–Th) /He dates are older than expected using the Durango model when compared with thermal histories based on apatite fission-track data or other geological constraints. It also has the potential to explain at least some cases in which (U–Th) /He dates are actually older than the corresponding fission-track dates...|$|E
