60|$|Early in '94 {{they brought}} out a lovely edition of Main Traveled Roads and a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>called</b> Prairie Songs. Neither of these volumes sold--the firm had no special {{facilities}} for selling books, but their print and binding delighted me, and {{in the autumn of}} the same year I gladly let them publish a collection of essays called Crumbling Idols, a small screed which aroused an astonishing tumult of comment, mostly antagonistic. Walter Page, editor of the Forum, in which one of the key-note chapters appeared, told me that over a thousand editorials were written upon my main thesis.|$|E

George told him all about the affairs at school, and related many amusing {{incidents}} that happened among his comrades, and informed him what sports were now in fashion, and whose kite soared the highest, and whose little ship sailed fleetest on the Frog Pond. As for Emily, she repeated stories which she had learned from a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>called</b> THE FLOWER PEOPLE, in which the snowdrops, the violets, the columbines, the roses, and all that lovely tribe are represented as telling their secrets to a little girl. The flowers talked sweetly, as flowers should; and Edward almost fancied that he could behold their bloom and smell their fragrant breath.|$|E

40|$|Two Dallas Theological Seminary professors have edited a major <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>calling</b> into {{question}} previous formulations of dispensationalism, {{while at the}} same time attempting to develop a new kind of dispensationalism. This new approach has been labeled by its advocates “Progressive Dispensationalism” (PD) in 1991. PD is often critical of older dispensationalism while incorporating elements from theological systems which in the past have been in opposition to traditional dispensational understandings of the Bible. Dr. Craig Blaising teaches Systematic Theology at Dallas and Dr. Darrell Bock is in the New Testament Greek Department. Their <b>new</b> <b>book</b> is Dispensationalism, Israel and The Church: The Search For Definition, (DIC) (Zondervan, 1992), which was released in late September 1992. It will not take those attempting to read this <b>new</b> <b>book</b> long to find that this book is difficult to read because of it’s erudite and technical style. This is a marked change from a previous generation of dispensationalists, often typified by Dr. Charles Ryrie, who were known for their clear, direct, and concise brand of scholarship. In DIC it is sometimes hard to get a grip on what is being said, even after reading a passage several times...|$|R
