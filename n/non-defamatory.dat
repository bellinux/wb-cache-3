25|$|In 1998, Pagones {{was awarded}} $345,000 (he sought $395 million) through a lawsuit for {{defamation}} of character {{that he had}} brought against Sharpton, Maddox and Mason. The jury found Sharpton liable for making seven defamatory statements about Pagones, Maddox for two and Mason for one. The jury deadlocked on four of the 22 statements over which Pagones had sued, and it found eight statements to be <b>non-defamatory.</b> In a later interview, Pagones said the turmoil caused by the accusations of Brawley and her advisers had cost him his first marriage and much personal grief.|$|E

5000|$|Google {{argued that}} under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as an [...] "interactive service provider", it has {{immunity}} from the plaintiff's complaint. Under the statute, if Google satisfies {{the requirements for}} being an interactive computer service, then it has immunity for acting as a publisher of information provided by a third-party. O'Kroley argued {{that the act of}} summarizing a <b>non-defamatory</b> article into a defamatory summary created new content and turned Google into an information content provider and thus losing its protected status. However, courts have found the immunities provided under the statute as [...] "quite robust." [...] The magistrate judge reviewing the case found that Google's automated editing and summarization process falls under the role of a publisher and thus Google has immunity from liability. Based on this conclusion, the district judge upheld the magistrate's recommendation and granted Google's motion to dismiss the complaint.|$|E
5000|$|After Simpson was acquitted, {{the cover}} of an issue of the tabloid {{newspaper}} National Examiner featured a photo of Kaelin shirtless with the headline [...] "Cops think Kato did it!" [...] The article within the issue alleged that police suspected Kaelin of perjury. Kaelin sued the publisher, Globe Communications, for libel, alleging that the cover headline implied he was suspected of the murders. The federal District Court for Central California dismissed the case, saying the story was not libelous or malicious. This was reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled: [...] "We hold that reasonable jurors could find that clear and convincing evidence established: (1) the front page headline falsely insinuated that the police believed that Kaelin committed the murders; and (2) the false insinuation was not necessarily cured by ... subheading or by the <b>non-defamatory</b> story about Kaelin that appeared 17 pages away. We also hold that Kaelin produced sufficiently clear and convincing evidence of the newspaper's knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth of its headline to defeat a motion for summary judgment." [...] The decision was a landmark case in libel law, finding that a headline could be considered libel. Kaelin later settled with Globe Communications out of court.|$|E
5000|$|Ostrer {{received}} {{criticism from}} Johns Hopkins University post-doc Eran Elhaik, who challenged {{the validity of}} Ostrer's past work {{on the topic of}} the origin of European Jews. Elhaik has criticized Ostrer's explanations for Jewish demographic history and Ostrer being unwilling to share his data with other researchers, [...] "unless research includes novelty and strength of the proposal, non-overlap with current or planned activities, and <b>non-defamatory</b> nature toward the Jewish people."Pediatrician Catherine DeAngelis said that 'allowing scientists access to data only if their research will not defame Jews is [...] "peculiar"', and added [...] "what he does is set himself up for criticism: Wait a minute. What’s this guy trying to hide?"Thirty researchers from nine countries—including the researchers who provided the data Elhaik analyzed—pooled their data to create [...] "the largest data set available to date for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins" [...] to formulate a response to Elhaik's hypothesis. They contradicted Elhaik's hypothesis and called Elhaik's procedural assumption that the Armenians and Georgians of the South Caucasus region could serve as appropriate proxies for Khazar descendants [...] "problematic" [...] and [...] "particularly poor," [...] concluding their analysis as follows:We confirm the notion that the Ashkenazi, North African, and Sephardi Jews share substantial genetic ancestry and that they derive it from Middle Eastern and European populations, with no indication of a detectable Khazar contribution to their genetic origins.|$|E
40|$|For many years, {{courts have}} {{divided on the}} {{constitutionality}} of laws regulating false campaign speech, with some courts upholding some false campaign speech laws and other courts striking them down. This past June, however, the Supreme Court issued an opinion in U. S. v. Alvarez, a case which no doubt will cause courts to reconsider the constitutionality of such laws. Although Alvarez did not involve campaign speech, the Supreme Court discussed the general question whether the Constitution protects knowing lies {{in the context of}} a federal law barring false statements about military honors. The Court issued no majority opinion, but all of the opinions had something to say about laws regulating false speech generally, and Justice Breyer’s opinion (for himself and Justice Kagan) cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of many laws regulating false campaign (and possibly false election) speech. The upshot of Alvarez is that laws regulating false campaign speech are in even more constitutional trouble than they were before, and that any attempts to regulate such speech will have to be narrow, targeted, and careful in its choice of remedies. Part I of this article briefly describes the pre-Alvarez split in the lower courts on the regulation of false campaign and election speech, and the arguments which had been advanced for and against the constitutionality of regulating false campaign speech. Part II describes the Supreme Court’s fractured opinion in U. S. v. Alvarez. Part III discusses how Alvarez may affect the constitutional calculus in the false campaign speech arena and argues that, in light of Alvarez courts should hold unconstitutional most broad state laws barring false speech in campaigns. But courts should reject challenges to narrower laws which, under an actual malice/clear and convincing evidence standard, (1) bar false (though not misleading) election speech about the mechanics of voting, such as false statements about the date and time of voting; (2) give a government election authority the power to reject false campaign speech submitted for official ballot materials; and (3) allow a jury to punish defamatory speech about candidates made with actual malice. Each of these proposed laws is consistent with the plurality’s and Justice Breyer’s opinions in Alvarez, although the defamation issue is somewhat in question. The hardest case is whether the government has authority to enjoin or punish <b>non-defamatory</b> false campaign speech made with knowledge of falsity (actual malice) which has the potential to trick or defraud voters into changing their votes. Consider, for example, the false statement of a judicial candidate on a campaign poster that she is an incumbent judge, or a statement that the president has endorsed her for office. While the case is close, I argue that following Alvarez, courts are likely to conclude that the risks of allowing the government to punish or enjoin false campaign speech process outweigh the benefits of providing voters with truthful information. Further, the narrower solution to the problem of this type of false campaign speech is counterspeech from opposing candidates and the media, as well as the use of a government “truth commission” with the power to declare, before the election but subject to judicial review, that campaign speech is false...|$|E
