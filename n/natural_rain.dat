500|$|Wakefield {{revealed}} that it rained constantly during filming, often soaking {{the cast and}} crew. However, the bad weather led to Davies writing in a scene featuring Edward in a wet shirt chopping logs in the rain, which rivalled the famous lake scene in Pride and Prejudice. Cooper told The Birmingham Post's Georgina Rodgers that the bad weather affected his first scene, in which Willoughby carries an injured Marianne home. He explained that the scene was shot on a vertical slope with a rain machine, as the <b>natural</b> <b>rain</b> does not show up on camera. His cloak also kept getting caught under his foot, which made picking up Wakefield even harder. Cooper added, [...] "I couldn't move and I just kept falling head over heels." [...] Wrotham Park served as the exterior to Norland, the Dashwood family's home. Ham House in Richmond was used for Norland's interior shots, while the grounds were used for exterior scenes. The National Trust was asked not to cut the grass for several weeks before filming began. Ham House also doubled for Cleveland. Loseley Park was chosen for the exterior shots of Sir John Middleton's home, Barton Park. The library doubled for Colonel Brandon's own, while the entrance was used for scenes featuring a gathering of guests for a day out. The Oak Room was also used for the scenes involving Marianne, after she falls sick. Other filming locations included Dorney Court, Hall Barn, Lincoln's Inn and Clovelly Pier.|$|E

40|$|Exotic annual grasses are invading native plant {{communities}} {{in many areas}} including the western United States, and pose a significant challenge to habitat restoration. Observations in California grasslands suggest that exotic species may become active earlier in the growing season than native species, and that this distinct phenology may contribute to invasion success. We hypothesized that flexible germination cues may allow exotic annual grasses to start annual growth early each growing season and preempt resources prior to native seedling establishment, a kind of seasonal priority effect. Flexible germination cues could incur a cost, however, if they cause seeds to germinate {{before the onset of}} favorable growing conditions. To evaluate these predictions, we compared native and exotic species performance in a coastal sage scrub community under both early (off-season) and ambient (natural) rainfall timings. Exotic annual grasses germinated substantially with off- season watering, but none of the early seedlings survived until the onset of the <b>natural</b> <b>rains.</b> Exotic annual grasses that experienced off-season watering had a depleted seedbank and lower germination following the <b>natural</b> <b>rains.</b> In contrast, native species did not germinate following the off-season watering pulse, and instead emerged with the beginning of the cold <b>natural</b> <b>rains.</b> Our results suggest that phenology is an important factor influencing invasion success and invader impact. Under some conditions, pre-growing season watering could be an important restoration strategy for native plant {{communities in}} early stages of invasion by depleting the exotic seedbank and allowing for native species to establish with reduced competitio...|$|R

50|$|In 2008, archaeologists led by Saburo Sugiyama found a tomb {{containing}} important {{evidence that}} may help define and examine an active period in Teotihuacán history. Teotihuacán was the largest city in Mesoamerica with over 100,000 residents. It is here that the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon were built. The Pyramid of the Sun was built for Tlaloc and the Pyramid of the Moon built for Chalchiuhtlicue. The tomb that Saburo Sugiyama found was dedicated to Chalchiuhtlicue. It housed a single human male sacrifice along with a wolf, jaguar, puma, serpent, bird, skeletons, and over 400 other artifacts. Among some of these artifacts were large greenstone and obsidian figurines, ceremonial knives, and spear points. The archaeologists also found frescos of former religions painted in red and green, some referred to agricultural and <b>natural</b> <b>rain</b> cycles. When looking underneath the Pyramid of the Moon, a Chalchiuhtlicue statue was found and has since been moved to El Museo Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico City.

40|$|Ring waves {{generated}} by <b>natural</b> <b>rains</b> from 1 to 100 mm/hr were measured {{in a small}} tank located in a field. Time series were obtained: (a) from a wire capacitance probe that measured surface elevation, (b) from an optical gauge that measured rain rates R, (c) from an anemometer that measured wind speeds and (d) from a 13. 5 GHz scatterometer (w polarization, and 30 degree incidence angle). Ring wave frequency spectra are computed from the surface elevation data for each minute of rain. All the spectra have a similar shape, with a maximum near 5 Hz, and with a more rapid decay towards higher frequencies than towards lower frequencies. A log-Gaussian spectral model provides a useful representation of these data {{and analysis of the}} model coefficients shows that the peak frequency and bandwidth are approximately constant, but the magnitude increases as R increases, Additionally, the normalized radar cross section from the scatterometer varies approximately linearly with the spectral line corresponding to the Bragg-wavelength, so together the log-Gaussian ring wave model and the Bragg scattering theory should be useful for a broad range of applications. These findings can be used to help interpret remote sensing data during rain events and to guide model development for radar scattering from rain roughened seas...|$|R

50|$|Native {{and adapted}} plants are {{recommended}} for rain gardens {{because they are}} more tolerant of the local climate, soil, and water conditions; have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance; habitat value and diversity for local ecological communities; and overall sustainability once established. There can be trade-offs associated with using native plants, including lack of availability for some species, late spring emergence, short blooming season, and relatively slow establishment. The plants — a selection of wetland edge vegetation, such as wildflowers, sedges, rushes, ferns, shrubs and small trees — take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Root systems enhance infiltration, maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in biofiltration. Also, through the process of transpiration, rain garden plants return water vapor to the atmosphere. A more wide-ranging definition covers all the possible elements {{that can be used to}} capture, channel, divert, and make the most of the <b>natural</b> <b>rain</b> and snow that falls on a property.

5000|$|As {{an early}} 20th-century French composer, Erik Satie used such Dadaist-inspired explorations {{to create an}} early form of ambient / {{background}} music that he labeled [...] "furniture music" [...] (Musique d'ameublement). This he described as being the sort of music that could be played during a dinner to create a background atmosphere for that activity, rather than serving {{as the focus of}} attention. In his own words, he sought to create [...] "a music...which {{will be part of the}} noises of the environment, will take them into consideration. I think of it as melodious, softening the noises of the knives and forks at dinner, not dominating them, not imposing itself. It would fill up those heavy silences that sometime fall between friends dining together. It would spare them the trouble of paying attention to their own banal remarks. And at the same time it would neutralize the street noises which so indiscreetly enter into the play of conversation. To make such music would be to respond to a need." [...] Like Satie describes, Brian Eno notes a time when he was too sick to put on music and got a friend to come over and do it for him. Listening to harp music on an old stereo, he was unable to hear it amidst the loud sounds of the rain outside his window. Initially this frustrated him, but eventually he found it interesting the way the music blended with the <b>natural</b> <b>rain</b> sounds in a way that made it not distinctly apparent, and he set out to create compositions that worked in a comparable way. Eno went on to record 1975's Discreet Music with this in mind, suggesting that it be listened to at [...] "comparatively low levels, even to the extent that it frequently falls below the threshold of audibility", referring to Satie's quote about his musique d'ameublement.|$|E
