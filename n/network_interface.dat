40|$|Nodes in the Grid can be {{connected}} through a multi-gigabit network. However, the <b>network</b> <b>interfaces</b> in the nodes {{can become a}} bottleneck for the maximum achievable bandwidth among nodes. This paper proposes an extensible communication architecture to avoid {{the limitations of the}} <b>network</b> <b>interfaces</b> by integrating multiple <b>network</b> <b>interfaces</b> in each node. The proposed solution deploys a technique to balance the network traffic load among multiple <b>network</b> <b>interfaces</b> in a single node. While this technique enhances communication bandwidth among the nodes, it is distributed and does not require any coordination or reservation mechanisms. It achieves the maximum possible bandwidth between any pair of Grid nodes with multiple <b>network</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The experimental evaluation provided good results and demonstrated the benefits of the proposed architecture. 1...|$|R

25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} {{electronic}} control unit (ECU). The various control techniques are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, Traction control system, climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering wheel angle, its gradient and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area <b>Network</b> <b>interface</b> the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Simultaneous {{operation}} of multiple <b>network</b> <b>interfaces</b> can benefit mobile devices with diverse <b>network</b> <b>interfaces.</b> This paper outlines an IP-level network activation strategy that aims at optimum {{use of the}} complementary features of the underlying networks. A key design issue in such strategies is the energy cost of different <b>network</b> <b>interfaces.</b> As a step towards validating and fine-tuning our strategy, we devised an experimental setting to measure the relative energy consumption of WiFi and GPRS interfaces in two modern mobile devices. The paper reports the experimental method and results. Our study indicates that the proposed strategy –in this case, reaching devices from the GPRS interface and, whenever appropriate, handing over some sessions to the WiFi interface – is plausible from energy consumption viewpoint {{and in some cases}} it outperforms the existing methods. The energy consumption model obtained will be used to make the network activation strategy energy aware.

2500|$|... “Distributed” or “grid” {{computing}} {{in general}} is a special type of parallel computing that relies on complete computers (with onboard CPUs, storage, power supplies, network interfaces, etc.) connected to a network (private, public or the Internet) by a conventional <b>network</b> <b>interface</b> producing commodity hardware, compared to the lower efficiency of designing and constructing {{a small number of}} custom supercomputers. The primary performance disadvantage is that the various processors and local storage areas do not have high-speed connections. This arrangement is thus well-suited to applications in which multiple parallel computations can take place independently, without the need to communicate intermediate results between processors. The high-end scalability of geographically dispersed grids is generally favorable, due to the low need for connectivity between nodes relative to the capacity of the public Internet.|$|E
2500|$|The machine {{included}} {{a number of}} extra input/output interfaces: serial and parallel printer ports; an 8-bit general purpose digital I/O port; a port offering four analogue inputs, a light pen input, and switch inputs; and an expansion connector (the [...] "1 MHz bus") that enabled other hardware to be connected. [...] Extra ROMs could be fitted (four on the PCB or sixteen with expansion hardware) and accessed via [...] An Econet <b>network</b> <b>interface</b> and a disk drive interface were available as options. All motherboards had space for the electronic components, but Econet was rarely fitted. Additionally, an Acorn proprietary interface named the [...] "Tube" [...] allowed a second processor to be added. Three models of second processor were offered by Acorn, based on the 6502, Z80 and 32016 CPUs. The Tube was later used in third-party add-ons, including a Zilog Z80 board and hard disk drive from Torch that allowed the BBC machine to run CP/M programs.|$|E
