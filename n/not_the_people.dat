25|$|Neo-fundamentalists {{believe that}} the supreme leader is holy and infallible {{and the role of}} people and {{elections}} are merely to discover the leader. However, the legitimacy of the leader comes from God and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> In January 2007, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani who won the 2006 election for Assembly of Experts, clearly rejected this idea and emphasized {{on the fact that the}} leader and the cleric members of the Assembly of Experts may make wrong decisions and the legitimacy of the leader comes from the people not the God.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Alaska enacted {{legislation}} {{and a separate}} ballot referendum that took effect on the same day, but that conflicted with each other. The effect of the ballot-approved law is to withhold from the governor authority to appoint a senator. Because the 17th Amendment vests the power to grant that authority to the legislature– <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> or the state generally– {{it is unclear whether}} the ballot measure supplants the legislature's statute granting that authority. As a result, it is uncertain whether an Alaska governor may appoint an interim senator to serve until a special election is held to fill the vacancy.|$|E
25|$|In the event, the {{industrial}} web theory {{failed to achieve}} its goals. Various targets were chosen and attacked serially, without evaluating the results {{in light of their}} interdependence. American bombing leaders maintained that precision attacks were being carried out, but in early 1944 poor weather over Europe prevented visual sighting, and bombs were dropped indiscriminately by inaccurate radar methods through cloud cover, resulting in general population destruction. By September 1944, all pretense to precision was abandoned when General Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the area bombing of Berlin. By that time, bombing had become as much tactical as strategic, to soften Germany for invasion by ground troops. Thousand-bomber raids were not able to diminish industrial production of materiel in time to prevent invasion. When arms production in Germany finally faltered {{in the third quarter of}} 1944, only 30% of the total of eventual bomb tonnage had been dropped on the country—this after the French-German border had been reached and the war on the ground had seen its decisive breakthrough. Germany was conquered by invasion; it did not surrender solely because of bombing. The morale of the enemy was not significantly affected—no population that was bombed in World War II lost their will to resist, and it was the Emperor, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> who decided Japan must surrender.|$|E

500|$|Uncharacteristically, Rosas {{remained}} passive {{throughout the}} conflict. The Argentine ruler lost heart once {{he realized that}} he had fallen into a trap. Even if he defeated Urquiza, his forces would probably be weakened enough to prevent him from challenging the Brazilian army that was ready to invade Argentina. With no other alternative, Rosas remarked: [...] "There is no other way; we have to play for the high stakes and go for everything. Here we are, and from here there is no retreat." [...] After an unsuccessful battle against Urquiza on 3 February 1852, Rosas fled to Buenos Aires. Once there, he disguised himself and boarded a ship that took him to Britain to live in exile.

500|$|The {{members of}} the Constitutional Convention of 1787, in {{drafting}} the Constitution, empowered state legislatures, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> to choose United States Senators. Federal law prescribed that the senatorial election was to take place beginning on the second Tuesday after the legislature which would be in place when the senatorial term expired first met and chose officers. On the designated day, balloting for senator would take place {{in each of the}} two chambers of the legislature. [...] If a majority of each house voted for the same candidate, then at the joint convention held the following day at noon, the candidate would be declared elected. Otherwise, there would be a roll-call vote of all legislators, with a majority of those present needed to elect.

[...] He will probably continue a good subject for some time." [...] Hanna, having declined the position of Postmaster General, secured appointment to the Senate when McKinley made Ohio's aging senior senator, John Sherman, his Secretary of State. Until 1913, state legislatures, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> elected senators, and so Hanna had to seek election to a full term when the Ohio General Assembly met in January 1898. [...] Hanna campaigned in the 1897 legislative election, and was elected to the Senate in his own right the following January, in a very close vote. Davenport drew cartoons against Hanna in the senatorial race. [...] Nevertheless, when he attended the legislature's meeting in Columbus, he wore a Hanna button, and seemed happy after Hanna's triumph. [...] When asked why, he replied, [...] "that insures me six more years at him, and he's a good subject".|$|E
500|$|One of the film's key contentions is {{that the}} private media aired footage {{selectively}} {{to make it look}} like the violence of 11April was caused by Chávez's supporters, portraying them as an [...] "irrational and uncivilized mob". Private television repeatedly showed Chávez's supporters on [...] as they shot at Baralt Avenue below, an area purportedly full of opposition marchers. The film says this footage was edited to show the gunmen but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> near them who were ducking to avoid being shot. It follows with images taken from above the bridge showing an empty Baralt Avenue, claiming that [...] "the opposition march had never taken that route" [...] and that Chávez's supporters were only returning fire. Gunson charges that this edit is itself a misrepresentation, stating that the film does not mention that both sets of marchers were fired upon, and taking issue with the implication that [...] "coup plotters" [...] were the shooters. In response, the filmmakers say, [...] "Nowhere in the film did we say that only [...] were shot... Nobody can say with certainty who orchestrated the shootings." [...] Gunson also asserts that the footage of the empty street was taken earlier that day, citing an [...] "analysis of the shadows" [...] by Schalk, who created a counter-documentary, X-Ray of a Lie, to examine The Revolution Will Not Be Televised [...] "scene by scene to uncover [...] narrative strategies and use of artifice". Brian A. Nelson agreed with the analysis, claiming that Baralt Avenue was not as empty as the film portrays and that the filmmakers [...] "put a black bar at the top of the frame to hide the Metropolitan Police trucks that were still there". Bartley and ÓBriain reaffirmed their claim that the opposition did not pass below the Puente Llaguno bridge, citing eyewitness statements—including one from Le Monde Diplomatiques deputy editor—and an Australian documentary, Anatomy of a Coup, that [...] "came to conclusions similar to our own". A Venezuelan documentary, , also supported Bartley and ÓBriain's view.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to studies}} from Princeton University, adoptees (especially those coming from closed adoptions) may {{suffer from a}} wide range of mental effects at all stages of life.

Especially in adolescence, many adopted children begin to question where certain personality traits, likes or dislike, and physical characteristics come from. What characteristics come from the biological family and which come from the adoptive family?

For many, this uncertainty can be unsettling and uncomfortable. They may begin to question everything about themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{returned}} to the House of Delegates, where he successfully defeated Madison's effort to become federal senator from Virginia, for under the original Constitution, senators were elected by legislators, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> Although Henry {{made it clear he}} would not serve in office outside Virginia, he received a number of votes in the election. Madison gained election to the House of Representatives in a district where he was opposed by James Monroe, though Madison's supporters complained that Henry's supporters in the legislature had [...] unfairly placed Madison's county, Orange, in a district leaning anti-Federalist. Henry also saw to it that the requested amendments were incorporated in petitions from the legislature to the federal Congress. Despite his qualms, Henry served as one of Virginia's presidential electors, voting for Washington (elected President) and John Adams (elected Vice President).
