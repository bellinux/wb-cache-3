40|$|Soon after death, {{the decay}} process of {{mammalian}} soft tissues begins {{and leads to}} the release of cadaveric volatile compounds in the surrounding environment. The study of postmortem decomposition products is an emerging field of study in forensic science. However, a better knowledge of the smell of death and its volatile constituents may have many applications in forensic sciences. Domestic pigs are the most widely used human body analogues in forensic experiments, mainly due to ethical restrictions. Indeed, decomposition trials on human corpses are restricted in many countries worldwide. This article reports on the use of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-offlight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS) for thanatochemistry applications. A total of 832 VOCs released by a decaying pig carcass in terrestrial ecosystem, i. e. a forest biotope, were identified by GCxGC-TOFMS. These postmortem compounds belong to many kinds of chemical class, mainly oxygen compounds (alcohols, acids, ketones, aldehydes, esters), sulfur and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> such as phenolic molecules and hydrocarbons.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  3 after {{removing}} the basic nitrogen compounds, the yield of LPG did not change sensibly but the yield of gasoline increased dramatically. And when both the basic nitrogen and non-basic <b>nitrogen,</b> condensed <b>aromatics</b> were removed, the yields of LPG and gasoline increased from 14.38 and 28.90 to 20.21 and 36.97  %, respectively. In addition, the yield of diesel kept constant and even decreased after extraction treatment. This may because the competitive adsorption effect between <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds,</b> crackable components and themselves. Acid centers on catalysts must be provided for cracking during FCC process. Nitrogen compounds in shale oil are a key factor in competitive adsorption effect since they can strongly adsorb on the acid centers and hardly crack. Condensed aromatics have the ability of strong adsorption and dehydrogenation, which may form coke and therefore block the pore openings. Thus, the acid centers for crackable compounds are less since the existence of competitive adsorption effect. Once the strong adsorptive compounds are removed, the reactions of cracking compounds are no longer restricted. The oil sample using both furfural and HCl extracted contains the least amount of strong adsorptive compounds. So it has more acid sites for diesel further crack into gasoline. And the yield of coke decreased from 8.90 to 7.12  % after HCl extraction and then decreased to 5.55  % after furfural and HCl extraction. This is due to the different content of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and condensed <b>aromatics,</b> which adsorb on acid centers and evolve toward coke in each oil sample.|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} a methodology for predicting basic <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>aromatics</b> contents in crude oil, using positive ion mode laser desorption ionization coupled to Fourier transform {{ion cyclotron resonance}} mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and partial least squares (PLS) regression with variable selection based on competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), in a procedure called CARSPLS regression. The basic <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>aromatics</b> contents were determined using UOP Method 269 - 10 and ASTM D 5443 - 14, respectively, for 70 samples of Brazilian crude oil. The basic nitrogen values ranged from 0. 016 % to 0. 151 % and the aromatics values from 8. 4 % to 35. 1 %. The LDI(+) -FT-ICR mass spectra of crude oil samples have profiles that ranged from m/z 200 to 1000, with an average molar mass distribution (M-w) centered between 554 and 636 Da. Most of the identified organic species are analogues of pyridine and polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds that belong in the N-x, N-x[H], HC, and HC[H] classes. Additionally, the number of detected N-x species increases systematically with increasing basic <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>aromatics</b> content. The CARS method was used to select the most informative variables for the PLS calibration model, thereby {{reducing the number of}} variables from 47, 873 to 48 and 10 for basic <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds,</b> respectively. The prediction model based on CARSPLS presented RMSEP of 0. 012 and 3. 73 wt% for basic <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>aromatics</b> contents, respectively. In addition, it was possible to verify that the accuracy of CARSPLS is ever better than only using PLS regression (with all variables). The application of CARSPLS algorithm is therefore justified by easier interpretation of the FT-ICR MS data after variables reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

From the double-bond equivalents calculated for the nitrogen-containing ions from a petroleum sample, we can infer the aromatic core structure (pyridinic versus pyrrolic nitrogen heterocycle) based on the presence of M+· (odd-electron) versus [M+H]+ (even-electron) ions. Specifically, nitrogen speciation can be determined from either a single positive-ion APPI spectrum or two ESI (positive- and negative-ion) spectra.

In this study, the possibility of using a low-cost medium based on the water soluble fraction of RM for laccase production by the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus has been evaluated and compared with the use of synthetic complex media.

40|$|Several {{different}} mechanisms {{leading to}} the formation of (substituted) naphthalene and azanaphthalenes were examined using theoretical quantum chemical calculations. As a result, a series of novel synthetic routes to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and <b>Nitrogen</b> Containing Polycyclic <b>Aromatic</b> <b>Compounds</b> (N-PACs) have been proposed. On Earth, these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> originate from incomplete combustion and are released into our environment, where they are known to be major pollutants, often with carcinogenic properties. In the atmosphere of a Saturn 2 ̆ 7 s moon Titan, these PAH and N-PACs are believed to {{play a critical role in}} organic haze formation, as well as acting as chemical precursors to biologically relevant molecules. The theoretical calculations were performed by employing the ab initio G 3 (MP 2,CC) /B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G** method to effectively probe the Potential Energy Surfaces (PES) relevant to the PAH and N-PAC formation. Following the construction of the PES, Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Markus (RRKM) theory was used to evaluate all unimolecular rate constants as a function of collision energy under single-collision conditions. Branching ratios were then evaluated by solving phenomenological rate expressions for the various product concentrations. The most viable pathways to PAH and N-PAC formation were found to be those where the initial attack by the ethynyl (C 2 H) or cyano (CN) radical toward a unsaturated hydrocarbon molecule led {{to the formation of}} an intermediate which could not effectively lose a hydrogen atom. It is not until ring cyclization has occurred, that hydrogen elimination leads to a closed shell product. By quenching the possibility of the initial hydrogen atom elimination, one of the most competitive processes preventing the PAH or N-PAC formation was avoided, and the PAH or N-PAC formation was allowed to proceed. It is concluded that these considerations should be taken into account when attempting to explore any other potential routes towards <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> in cold environments, such as on Titan or in the interstellar medium. ...|$|R
