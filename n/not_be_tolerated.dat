5|$|Two {{groups were}} excluded. Roman Catholics who {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} Pope would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> They were, in fact, regarded as traitors, because the Pope had refused to accept Elizabeth as Queen of England. Roman Catholics were given the hard choice of being loyal either to their church or their country. For some priests it meant life on the run, in some cases death for treason.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870 election, {{the first}} state in which blacks were allowed to vote, Stevenson warned that {{violence}} against them would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> Although he relied on local authorities to suppress any incidents, he offered rewards for the apprehension of perpetrators of election-related violence. Stevenson also recommended that the carrying of concealed weapons be outlawed. The General Assembly passed the requested legislation on March 22, 1871. The law imposed small fines for the first offense, but the amount rapidly increased for subsequent infractions in order to deter repeat offenders.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated</b> and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E

The Jewish Daily Forward {{noted that}} because only two camps {{signed up for}} the program, Seewald created a video to warning all camp staff members that his organization will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerating</b> abuse.

5|$|In 2007, nearly 20,000 people {{attended}} the third annual Hempstalk Festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park in Portland, Oregon. While organizers insisted smoking would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated,</b> {{the smell of}} marijuana lingered {{in the air and}} some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in Seattle, Washington also attended by Oregonians, known as the world's largest annual gathering advocating decriminalization of marijuana for uses including but not limited to medicinal, industrial, and recreational. The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 1617, set a new record with around 150,000 people in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Minogue was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer at age 36 on 17 May 2005, leading to the postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl– The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival. Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of support. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{sentence}} aroused strong {{reactions in}} Italy {{and in the}} United States. In Palermo {{a group of students}} went to the Teatro Bellini and asked the orchestra to perform the hymn of Garibaldi. And the theatre applauded. In March 1896, after Crispi had to resign due to the humiliating defeat of the Italian army at Battle of Adwa in Ethiopia during First Italo-Ethiopian War, the new government under Prime minister Antonio Di Rudinì recognized the excessive brutality of the repression. Many Fasci members were pardoned and released from jail. Di Rudinì made it clear though that a reorganization of the Fasci would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> After their release, De Felice, Barbato and Bosco were met by a large crowd of supporters in Rome, who released the horses form their carriage and dragged them to the hotel, cheering for socialism and denouncing Crispi.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, the {{specific}} reason that exercise <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerated</b> <b>is</b> of considerable significance {{when trying to}} isolate the cause down to a specific disease. Dysfunctions involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular or neuromuscular systems have been frequently {{found to be associated}} with exercise intolerance, with behavioural causes also playing a part.|$|R

50|$|The {{commission}} {{remarked that}} the conditions children worked under caused stress and anxiety and would <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>tolerated</b> in factories.

5|$|The {{removal of}} the eastern threat {{and the rise of}} the Byzantines' {{confidence}} also opened up opportunities in the west, where the Bulgarian ruler Boris (r. 852–889) had been negotiating with the Pope and Louis the German (r. 817–876) for a possible conversion of himself and his pagan people to Christianity. This expansion of Rome's ecclesiastic influence up to Constantinople's very doorstep could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated</b> by the Byzantine government. In 864, the victorious eastern armies were transferred to Europe and invaded Bulgaria, in a demonstration of military might that convinced Boris to accept Byzantine missionaries instead. Boris was baptized, taking the name Michael in honor of the Byzantine emperor, thus beginning the Christianization of Bulgaria and initiating the nation's absorption into the Byzantine-influenced, Eastern Orthodox world.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, in {{reaction}} to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle – that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.|$|E
25|$|On 3 December, Paisley {{claimed that}} the Third Force had 15,000–20,000 members. James Prior, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, replied that private armies would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Amiodarone is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of refractory VT or VF, particularly in the setting of acute ischemia. Amiodarone is also safe to use in individuals with cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, to maintain normal sinus rhythm. Amiodarone prolongation of the action potential is uniform over a wide range of heart rates, so this drug does not have reverse use-dependent action. Amiodarone was the first agent described in this class. [...] Amiodarone should only be used to treat adults with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when other treatments are ineffective or have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>tolerated.</b>|$|R

25|$|The new government's {{spokesman}} in the United States {{said that while}} religious minorities would retain their religious rights emphasized that the Bahá'ís would not receive the same treatment, since {{they believed that the}} Bahá'ís were a political rather than religious movement.

25|$|Ban {{has told}} senior {{managers}} that homophobia will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> He pointed to {{countries such as}} Ukraine which has proposed criminalizing public discussion about homosexuality as threatening basic human rights. He further stated that government {{has a duty to}} defend vulnerable minorities. In April 2013, he described LGBT rights {{as one of the great}} neglected human rights of our time. He also said that religion, culture or tradition can never justify denial of basic rights.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{emphasized}} that the sense of honor was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners. The idea of being treated like a second-class citizen was anathema and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated</b> by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.|$|E

25|$|Some naturist environments can induce sexual feelings.

25|$|The {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated against innocent civilians by {{individuals and groups}} under the guise to liberate Oromia were abominable crimes and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms.

I am of the view that a democratic unity on the basis of justice and equality would be of much benefit to the people of Oromia.|$|E
25|$|In 1692, Gerakaris spearheaded an Ottoman {{invasion}} of the Peloponnese. He took Corinth, and unsuccessfully besieged the Acrocorinth and Argos, before being forced to withdraw {{by the arrival of}} Venetian reinforcements. However, after renewed invasions into the Peloponnese in 1694 and 1695, Gerakaris went over to the Venetian camp. However, his brutal and savage treatment of the civilian population and his intriguing for the position of Bey of Mani could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated</b> for long by Venice, and after the brutal sack of Arta in August 1696, Gerakaris was arrested and imprisoned at Brescia.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{this system}} is not viable in a {{capitalist}} society, since once the owners automate their factories, they just sack all their workers without pay and let them starve while the machines do all the work, filling their own pockets with gold from the profit. This is unjust and should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>tolerated.</b> The boss who builds a machine that replaces one hundred workers should continue to pay these workers who now have nothing to do.
