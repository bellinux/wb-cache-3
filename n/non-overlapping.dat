5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a <b>non-overlapping</b> tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling {{can be obtained by}} inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E
40|$|A {{similarity}} {{measure is}} a measure evaluating the degree of similarity between two fuzzy data sets and has become an essential tool in many applications including data mining, pattern recognition, and clustering. In this paper, we propose a similarity measure capable of handling <b>non-overlapped</b> data as well as overlapped data and analyze its characteristics on data distributions. We first design the similarity measure based on a distance measure {{and apply it to}} overlapped data distributions. From the calculations for example data distributions, we find that, though the similarity calculation is effective, the designed similarity measure cannot distinguish two <b>non-overlapped</b> data distributions, thus resulting in the same value for both data sets. To obtain discriminative similarity values for <b>non-overlapped</b> data, we consider two approaches. The first one is to use a conventional similarity measure after preprocessing <b>non-overlapped</b> data. The second one is to take into account neighbor data information in designing the similarity measure, where we consider the relation to specific data and residual data information. Two artificial patterns of <b>non-overlapped</b> data are analyzed in an illustrative example. The calculation results demonstrate that the proposed similarity measures can discriminate <b>non-overlapped</b> data...|$|R

Portions of the Walla Walla Valley AVA, an area primarily in Washington (along with the Columbia Valley AVA, which contains it), descend into Oregon in the Milton-Freewater area. The Southern Oregon AVA was recently created as the union of two Southern Oregon winegrowing regions long considered distinct, the Rogue Valley and the Umpqua Valley. Several other smaller AVAs are found within some of these larger regions.

However, some religious beliefs have not been in line with views of the scientific community, for instance Young Earth creationism. Though some who criticize religions subscribe to the conflict thesis, others do not. For example, Stephen Jay Gould agrees with C. S.

Other scientists, such as Richard Dawkins, reject the <b>non-overlapping</b> magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts {{as a source of}} truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the scientific consensus is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Constraint-based {{placement}} {{tools and}} their use in diagramming tools has been investigated for decades. One {{of the most important}} and natural placement constraints in diagrams is that their graphic elements do not overlap. However, <b>non-overlap</b> of objects, especially nonconvex objects, is extremely difficult to solve, especially to solve sufficiently rapidly for direct manipulation. Here we present the first practical approach for solving <b>non-overlap</b> of possibly non-convex objects in conjunction with other placement constraints such as alignment and distribution. Our methods are based on approximating the <b>non-overlap</b> constraint by a smoothly changing linear approximation. We have found that this in combination with techniques for lazy addition of constraints, is rapid enough to support direct manipulation in reasonably sized diagrams. ...|$|R

5000|$|When a MOSFET is {{used for}} the lower switch, {{additional}} losses may occur during the time between the turn-off of the high-side switch and the turn-on of the low-side switch, when the body diode of the low-side MOSFET conducts the output current.

The onset of shootthrough generates severe power loss and heat. Proper selection of <b>non-overlap</b> time must balance the risk of shootthrough with the increased power loss caused by conduction of the body diode. Many MOSFET based buck converters also include a diode to aid the lower MOSFET body diode with conduction during the <b>non-overlap</b> time.
