Historians say that Cuttack was the seat of the Freedom Movement in Odisha and the Swaraj Ashram played a pivotal role in paving the way for Swaraj Movement.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{system and}} {{delivery}} of health care tend to suffer from fragmentation, resulting in discontinuous and costly care. Local cooperation between caregivers is essential to achieve appropriate, timely, continuous and efficient care. The article develops a general comprehensive patient-centered model of quality of care related to local cooperation between caregivers. The model {{can be used in}} quality improvement and research. The proposed model: Within the framework of Donabedian's triad (structure -> process -> outcome), cooperation between caregivers is divided into two parts. Firstly, client related cooperation (multiple caregivers to one patient) {{is a part of the}} process of health care and relevant for important quality aspects: appropriateness, timeliness, continuity of care, effectiveness and efficiency. Secondly, local cooperation between caregivers, which is not restricted to one patient, is called <b>non</b> client related <b>cooperation.</b> Such <b>non</b> client related <b>cooperation</b> creates conditions for optimal patient care. <b>Non</b> client related <b>cooperation</b> has different degrees, dependent on the existence of agreements between the caregivers (such as protocols) and evaluation of these agreements. The highest degree of <b>non</b> client related <b>cooperation</b> is continuous quality improvement. To achieve a certain degree of <b>non</b> client related <b>cooperation,</b> conditions must be fulfilled in several fields (organization, information, financing and participants).

40|$|What causes 'gas wars' between Russia and Ukraine? In {{this paper}} I argue that {{contract}} disputes {{in the eastern}} European gas sector are specific instances of a broader set of phenomena: bargains over strategically important resource issues outside of any international framework to facilitate <b>cooperation.</b> <b>Non</b> cooperative game theory helps {{to shed light on}} the reasons we see crises emerge despite the fact that both parties would be better off reaching an agreement short of conflict. I develop a framework for crisis bargaining that departs from canonical games in one important dimension: it explicitly considers impact of bargaining practices and strategies on the negotiation process and the probability of failure. While bargaining practices are endogenous to both the preferences of the players and the structure of the game, they intervene in the causal process in substantively important ways by modifying the effect of both preferences and structure. Critically, practices embedded in earlier rounds affect practices and outcomes later on independent of the preferences of each player or the structure of the game. I use this practice-theoretic bargaining framework to develop an in-depth case study of 2008 negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. This framework helps produce a nuanced understanding of bargaining breakdown that led to the most damaging of the ���gas wars��; the resulting explanation outperforms the standard bargaining model {{as well as a number}} of competing arguments...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of {{cooperation}} in criminal matters among European Union Member States. It analyses the emerging European Criminal Area, a form for cooperation aiming at establishing a single judicial area in criminal justice. The author describes the instruments and mechanisms of the ECA, which are unprecedented. However, this analysis is conducted from a unique perspective. Namely, the main issue explored in the paper is the principle of mutual trust. This principle, while recognised as a condicio sine qua <b>non</b> of deep <b>cooperation,</b> has not yet been fully implemented. The article presents explanations of both the theory and practice of mutual trust. It uses the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice and the practice of the Member States to demonstrate the legal character of mutual trust within the emerging European Criminal Area. The paper emphasize the problematic issue of loopholes in EU primary and secondary law regarding mutual trust as the foundation of criminal cooperation. The author invokes many significant judgments of the Court of Justice, as well as declarations of EU institutions and Member States which highlight the importance of the respective principles. Thus, the law and jurisprudence, together with other non-binding documents, are compared and contrasted, revealing a certain paradox. In her conclusion the author shows the consequences of the determination of the normative character of mutual trust, threats facing it and future prospects for the realisation of the unique idea of a single area in criminal justice...|$|R
