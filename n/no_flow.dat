5|$|The {{watershed}} of Keyser Creek was historically {{affected by}} coal mining {{and has been}} channelized. It has <b>no</b> <b>flow</b> in dry conditions, although it does have some during and after storms. As of 1991, the watershed is mostly forested. The first white settlers in Lackawanna County settled near the creek in 1769. Keyser Creek is a major second-order tributary of the Lackawanna River. Since 2013, a trailhead of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail has been situated near the creek. A number of bridges have also been built across the creek.|$|E

A succeeding operation start immediately after the preceding operation complete means <b>no</b> wait <b>flow</b> shop scheduling.

In <b>no</b> wait <b>flow</b> shop scheduling problem, a set of n independent jobs have to be processed on a set of m machines. Every job requires a given fixed, non-negative processing time on every machine. Traditional flow shop scheduling problems has primarily been focused on completion time of jobs, and in current manufacturing tradition has been adopted criteria like on time delivery to stay in the rapidly growing markets. So industries focus has gone beyond the single objective scheduling system. The primary objective of <b>no</b> wait <b>flow</b> sho...|$|R

The regional deposits are significantly less cratered {{than those of}} other plains units, although they typically display crater densities comparable to older lunar maria (Murray and others, 1974).

These include whisky grass (Andropogon virginicus), African love grass (Eragrostis curvula) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana). The populations of foxes, feral dogs and cats, and deer, which are all introduced fauna, are annually controlled. Using coal wash waste has been banned within the park. Fire management includes reducing fuel within the park, ensuring that fences are well maintained so as to prevent arson, as well as prescribed burning. Soil erosion and sediment movement is being repaired, especially in the upland swamp region and the Hawkesbury and Maddens Plains Soil Landscape Units. Water quality in the catchment is being monitored and there is some action towards limiting water pumping from streams, when there is little or <b>no</b> <b>flow</b> available.|$|E

60|$|When Indian file was duly formed, we {{descended the}} Nánwá hillock, which takes {{its name from}} the stream. Here the little rivulet, deeply encased, bore a fine growth of snowy water-lilies. It had been newly bridged with corduroy. The next passage boasted tree-trunks, and after that all was leaping. The Nánwá must rise near the trial-shaft, which we are about to visit, and it snakes through the {{property}} in all directions with a general rhumb from west-north-west to east-south-east. At this season there is little or <b>no</b> <b>flow,</b> and the bed is mostly a string of detached pools, where gold has been washed and will be washed again.

60|$|The {{subject of}} {{bleeding}} {{is involved in}} great obscurity, and the systematic examination of the motions in the juices of tropical climbers by resident observers, offers a fertile field to the naturalist.

This {{is the case with}} all the Indian watery-juiced climbers, at whatever season they may be cut. When, however, the circulation in the plant is feeble, neither end of a simple cut will bleed much, but if a truncheon be taken from it, both the extremities will.|$|E

In the second place, while I had <b>no</b> <b>flow,</b> only a hesitating trickle of language, in ordinary circumstances, yet--under stimulus such as was now rife through the mutinous mass--I could, in English, have rolled out readily phrases stigmatizing their proceedings as such proceedings deserved to be stigmatized; and then with some sarcasm, flavoured with contemptuous bitterness for the ringleaders, and relieved with easy banter for the weaker but less knavish followers, {{it seemed to me that}} one might possibly get command over this wild herd, and bring them into training, at least. All I could now do was to walk up to Blanche--Mademoiselle de Melcy, a young baronne--the eldest, tallest, handsomest, and most vicious--stand before her desk, take from under her hand her exercise-book, remount the estrade, deliberately read the composition, which I found very stupid, and, as deliberately, and in the face of the whole school, tear the blotted page in two.|$|E
6000|$|We may, however, {{take the}} above eleven cases, which are {{accurate}} {{as far as}} they go, and calculate the weight of the ejected earth which annually flows down a slope having a mean inclination of 9 degrees 26 seconds. This was done by my son George. It has been shown that almost exactly two-thirds of the ejected earth is found below the mouth of the burrow and one-third above it. Now if the two- thirds which is below the hole be divided into two equal parts, the upper half of this two-thirds exactly counterbalances the one-third which is above the hole, so that as far as regards the one-third above and the upper half of the two-thirds below, there is <b>no</b> <b>flow</b> of earth down the hill-side. The earth constituting {{the lower half of the}} two-thirds is, however, displaced through distances which are different for every part of it, but which may be represented by the distance between the middle point of the lower half of the two- thirds and the hole. So that the average distance of displacement is a half of the whole length of the worm-casting. Now the average length of ten out of the above eleven castings was 2.03 inches, and half of this we may take as being 1 inch. It may therefore be concluded that one-third of the whole earth brought to the surface was in these cases carried down the slope through 1 inch. {77} ...|$|E
60|$|Enough {{has been}} said {{in these days of}} the charm of fluent writing. We hear it complained of some works of genius, that they have fine thoughts, but are {{irregular}} and have <b>no</b> <b>flow.</b> But even the mountain peaks in the horizon are, to the eye of science, parts of one range. We should consider that the flow of thought is more like a tidal wave than a prone river, and {{is the result of a}} celestial influence, not of any declivity in its channel. The river flows because it runs down hill, and flows the faster the faster it descends. The reader who expects to float down stream for the whole voyage, may well complain of nauseating swells and choppings of the sea when his frail shore-craft gets amidst the billows of the ocean stream, which flows as much to sun and moon as lesser streams to it. But if we would appreciate the flow that is in these books, we must expect to feel it rise from the page like an exhalation, and wash away our critical brains like burr millstones, flowing to higher levels above and behind ourselves. There is many a book which ripples on like a freshet, and flows as glibly as a mill-stream sucking under a causeway; and when their authors are in the full tide of their discourse, Pythagoras and Plato and Jamblichus halt beside them. Their long, stringy, slimy sentences are of that consistency that they naturally flow and run together. They read as if written for military men, for men of business, there is such a despatch in them. Compared with these, the grave thinkers and philosophers seem not to have got their swaddling-clothes off; they are slower than a Roman army in its march, the rear camping to-night where the van camped last night. The wise Jamblichus eddies and gleams like a watery slough.|$|E
