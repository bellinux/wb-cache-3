5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed that there is <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial. Many marine organisms, particularly those on coral reefs, are brightly coloured or patterned, including sponges, corals, molluscs and fishes, {{with little or}} no connection to chemical or physical defenses. Caribbean reef sponges are brightly coloured, {{and many of them are}} chemically defended, but there is <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the two factors.|$|E
5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

30|$|The {{previous}} research on e-learning in developing countries contended that students’ familiarity with computer and technology {{has an impact on}} the acceptance of e-learning. This study, however, shows <b>no</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> the familiarity with technology and the acceptance of e-learning or any of its constructs. It also reveals <b>no</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> the familiarity with technology and age, school year, self-regulation, or the number of online courses taken. As a result, we conclude that the students’ decision to adopt e-learning is not contingent upon how familiar they are with related technology. In other words, students who are highly familiar with various types of technology {{may or may not have}} positive perception toward e-learning.|$|R

Other studies have shown a clear correlation between dioxin formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both dioxin and PCB in incinerators.|$|E

25|$|When a Polistes instabilis nest is attacked, the wasps {{defend their}} nests by {{responding}} {{in two different}} ways: First they perform a threat response by wagging their gaster and vibrating their wings, and second, some wasps may attack by leaving the nest and physically touching the attacker. There seems to be <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the amount of investment the wasps have put into their nest and the defense response. This {{suggests that there are}} a fixed number of wasps that are semi specialized for nest defense, and such defensive tasks may be assigned {{in the same way as}} other tasks such as foraging.|$|E
25|$|A small genetic study {{looked at}} fifteen MS {{patients}} {{who also had}} CCSVI. It found 234 specific copy number variations in the human leukocyte antigen focus. Of these, GRB2, HSPA1L and HSPA1A {{were found to be}} specifically connected to both MS and angiogenesis, TAF11 was connected to both MS and artery passage, and HLA-DQA2 was suggestive of having an implication for angiogenesis as it interacts with CD4. A study in 268 MS patients and 155 controls reported more a frequency of CCSVI in the MS group that was more than twice as high as in the controls group and was also higher in the progressive MS group than in the non-progressive MS group. This study found <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> CCSVI and HLA DRB1*1501, a genetic variation that has been consistently linked to MS.|$|E

25|$|High {{levels of}} {{multiple}} paternity have widely been seen and reported in snakes, marine turtles, and lizards. However, Lee and Hayes (2004) {{have evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} no set data in green turtles that significantly shows that there are potential fitness gains through polyandry. Instead, it is suggested that the multiple mating is a result of male aggression. Both Wright and Lee and Hayes studies exhibit similar results that show a lack of support of the indirect benefits of polyandry. In addition, they pose that there is <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> multiple paternity and reproductive success. Multiple male paternity is present in green turtles, but no significant fitness benefits have been found. Observations done on clutches showed that there was no correlation of reproductive success when mating with multiple males.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of Pahawh, Pahawh Pa (Pajhawj Paj), common called the source version, had {{distinct}} glyphs for all 60 onsets and 91 rimes of both Hmong Daw and Hmong Njua. Although there were diacritics, there was <b>no</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> them and the sound values of the letters, {{and many of the}} diacritics are unique to a single letter. Among the rimes, there was a strong tendency for letters which differed only in diacritic to share the same vowel and differ in tone. However, this was not absolute. For example, a letter shaped like Ü stood for the rime iaj, while U, differing only in its diacritic, stood for the rime us. Plain U without a diacritic did not occur. Similarly, the letter that, without a diacritic, represents the rime ag, when combined with a diacritic dot represents the onset rh. Thus {{it can be seen that}} at this stage the diacritics were integral parts of their letters, with only the beginnings of an independent existence.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the scales}} {{reviewed}} by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as obesity (for example, Saltzer's (1982) Weight Locus of Control Scale or Stotland and Zuroff's (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak's (1982) Mental Health Locus of Control Scale or the Depression Locus of Control Scale of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer Locus of Control Scale of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley's work, linking locus of control to the management of diabetes mellitus. Empirical data on health locus of control {{in a number of}} fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health locus of control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health locus of control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or <b>no)</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> exercise behaviors (such as jogging) and internal health locus of control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health locus of control and other health-related behaviors (such as breast self-examination, weight control and preventative-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health locus of control and alcohol consumption.|$|E
30|$|This section {{discusses}} the interpretations and presentations {{of the findings}} based on the research objective which was to establish the effect of FDI on economic growth in Kenya focusing on the energy sector between 2001 and 2011.
