5|$|Alfred rescued about 100 men; Rattler, about 40; and Culloden, 127, {{including}} Captain Renaudin, who {{abandoned his}} ship {{and left in}} the very first British boat. He was taken to Culloden and served a meal in the officers' mess; as he dined with his son and other French and British officers, a commotion was heard; racing to the gallery of Culloden, the party witnessed Vengeur sink with the remaining wounded aboard. Figures of the casualties on Vengeur are <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> known, but amount to approximately 250 killed during the battle, 106 drowned in the sinking, and 367 rescued by the British.|$|E
5|$|Later, but <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> dated, eruptions {{from the}} Lassen {{volcanic}} area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E

5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} planetary rings is <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> known, they {{are believed to be}} the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Beagle was {{not allowed}} to land at Tenerife through fears that those aboard would bring cholera, but the ship {{proceeded}} to Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha and Rio de Janeiro. She then spent some time surveying the coast of South America south from Rio de Janeiro, around Tierra del Fuego, the coast of Chile and as far north as Peru. Fitz-Roy finally detached Beagle from South America in August 1835. The Admiralty had <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> specified his itinerary across the Pacific since they could not be sure how far north {{he would be able to}} survey in the time available, and hence precisely where he would be leaving from. But they did specify that he should stop at Tahiti, a point of previously well-determined longitude. The Admiralty also required that, like the journey across the Atlantic, it should be done in small stages to frequently rate the chronometers. Fitz-Roy chose to go via the Galápagos Islands. Subsequently Beagle visited Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Mauritius.|$|E

5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|As the {{composition}} is <b>not</b> <b>precisely</b> defined, some states {{which have a}} considerable division of executive power can {{find it difficult to}} decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that {{there was no need for}} the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.|$|E
