His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make a scene. He's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

5|$|An early {{plan for}} STS-8, {{released}} in April 1982, had scheduled it for July 1983. It {{was expected to}} be a three-day mission with four crew members, and would launch INSAT-1-B, an Indian satellite, and TDRS-B, a NASA communications relay satellite. However, following problems with the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) used to deploy TDRS-A on the STS-6 mission, it was announced in May 1983 that the TDRS was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be flown. It was replaced in the manifest by the Payload Flight Test Article. After re-development of the IUS, TDRS-B was eventually re-manifested for the STS-51-L mission, and was lost along with the Space Shuttle Challenger and its crew when the launch failed in January 1986.|$|E
5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time but it was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to}} be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Cooper {{made her}} Paralympic debut at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. She {{was in danger of}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to the 1992 Paralympics because of funding issues for the Australian Paralympic Federation. The Federation made an {{emergency}} appeal for funding from the public in order {{to cover the cost of}} transporting the Australian team to Barcelona. A variety of small donations allowed Cooper and other Australian athletes to compete. She won three gold and two silver medals, and broke two world records and three Paralympic records. She was offered a non-residential Australian Institute of Sport Athletes with a Disability swimming scholarship in 1993 and was supported until 2000.|$|E

5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Confessions on a Dance Floor is {{the tenth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It {{was released on}} November 9, 2005 by Warner Bros. Records. A complete departure from her previous studio album American Life (2003), the album includes influences of 1970s and 1980s disco, as well as modern-day club music. Initially, she began working with Mirwais Ahmadzaï for the album, but later felt that their collaboration was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> in the direction she desired. Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. The album was mainly recorded at Price's home-studio where Madonna {{spent most of her}} time during the recordings.|$|E
5|$|Coronel was {{replaced}} by session musician Ron Leejack, and the group continued their efforts to finish the album. Some songs were completely re-recorded to accommodate Leejack's different playing style. The entire recording process, which followed a haphazard schedule, took nearly a year to complete. When the completed album was presented to Don Ellis, Epic's A director, he stated that he hated the album and was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to release it. The next day, Wicked Lester manager Lew Linet requested and received the group's release from Epic Records.|$|E

5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and <b>not</b> <b>going</b> through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E
5|$|He and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 {{to discuss}} Musharraf's removal and the {{constitutional}} amendments, which the PML-N viewed as <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{far enough to}} fulfill the Murree declaration. He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the coalition {{did not have the}} two-thirds majority in both legislative bodies—National Assembly and Senate. He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in the coalition grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif. The coalition criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by-elections. Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, the coalition could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation, which was the highest in 30 years.|$|E
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E
