This book of the creatures, it is so excellent, and so full, so easy, and so suiting the capacity of all, that there is not one man in the world but is catched, convicted, and cast by it. This is the book, that he who knows no letters may read in; yea, and that he who neither saw New Testament, nor Old, may know both much of God, and himself by. 'Tis this book, out of which generally, both Job and his friends did so profoundly discourse of the judgments of God; and that out of which God himself did so convincingly answer Job. Job was as perfect in this book, as we are, many of us in the scriptures; yea, and could see further by it, than many <b>now</b> <b>adays</b> do see by the New Testament and Old. This is the book out of which, both Christ, the prophets, and apostles, do so frequently discourse by their similitudes, proverbs, and parables, as being the most easy way to convince the world, though by reason of their ignorance, nothing will work with them, but what is set on their heart by the Holy Ghost.|$|E
60|$|I {{should say}} the first effect of {{the triumph of the}} {{capitalist}} (if we allow him to triumph) will be that that line of demarcation will entirely disappear. There will be no art that might not just as well be advertisement. I do not necessarily mean {{that there will be no}} good art; much of it might be, much of it already is, very good art. You may put it, if you please, in the form that there has been a vast improvement in advertisements. Certainly there would be nothing surprising if the head of a negro advertising Somebody's Blacking <b>now</b> <b>adays</b> were finished with as careful and subtle colours as one of the old and superstitious painters would have wasted on the negro king who brought gifts to Christ. But the improvement of advertisements is the degradation of artists. It is their degradation for this clear and vital reason: that the artist will work, not only to please the rich, but only to increase their riches; which is a considerable step lower. After all, it was as a human being that a pope took pleasure in a cartoon of Raphael or a prince took pleasure in a statuette of Cellini. The prince paid for the statuette; but he did not expect the statuette to pay him. It is my impression that no cake of soap can be found anywhere in the cartoons which the Pope ordered of Raphael. And no one who knows the small-minded cynicism of our plutocracy, its secrecy, its gambling spirit, its contempt of conscience, can doubt that the artist-advertiser will often be assisting enterprises over which he will have no moral control, and of which he could feel no moral approval. He will be working to spread quack medicines, queer investments; and will work for Marconi instead of Medici. And to this base ingenuity he will have to bend the proudest and purest of the virtues of the intellect, the power to attract his brethren, and the noble duty of praise. For that picture by Millais is a very allegorical picture. It is almost a prophecy of what uses are awaiting the beauty of the child unborn. The praise will be of a kind that may correctly be called soap; and the enterprises of a kind that may truly be described as Bubbles.|$|E

It condences and evaporates at temperature and pressure closed to atmospheric condition the refrigerant used for the purpose are ammonia, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Refrigerator consist five major parts-compressor, condenser, receiver, expansion valve, evaporator. The refrigerant used, does not leave the system but it circulated through the system alternately condensing and evaporating. In evaporation the refrigerant absorbs its latent heat from the brine(salt water) which is used for circulating it around the cold chamber, while condensing it give out its latent heat to the circulating water of the cooler. The vapour compression refrigeration system is a latent heat pump as it pump its latent heat from brine deliver to cooler.

40|$|Abstract- Gyroscopes are {{state of}} art device to measure angular {{rotation}} {{of a system}} about some specific axes with respect to inertial frame of reference. Earlier they were mostly used for navigation purposes, however, the application area of the gyroscopes have increased over the years. <b>Now</b> <b>adays,</b> automobile control system, human body motion monitoring system and amusement equipments tend to use a gyro sensor. Although traditional rotating wheel, fiber optic and ring laser gyroscopes have dominated the market, but they are too huge and expensive. Moreover, they {{do not meet the}} sensitivity requirement of modern industry making them inadequate for emerging applications. This led to the advent of vibratory structure which has got several advantages over conventional counterpart like low power requirements, short start up time and very low inherent noise. This paper proposes a Coriolis based Piezoelectric Vibrating Disc Gyroscope. The detailed working principle, construction as well as the physical structure of the proposed vibrating disc gyro has been discussed throughout the length of the paper. Validation of the developed gyroscope has been carried out by providing input rotation via a stepper motor assembly causing the transfer of energy from drive mode to the sense mode and this transfer of energy provides a measure of the applied rotation rate...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The research went on in KAVUMU Rural Commune and aims at designing a duty reference of self-entrepreneur in a small agri-company as a strategy to reduce the unemployment rate in this area. Through this study we show how {{the unemployment rate is}} high for the schooled young aged of 15 and 35.

The young run the risk of being recruited in different army group that can promise them a well being in future. Trying to find an intermediate solution to fight against un employment of the young in KAVUMU Commune, we mention the following result: more than 50 % of population chose the self entrepreneur but they face the problem of skills (needed skills) for resulting to a lasting management (the capacity to manage a firm) is the most important so there is the need of a professional training to clarify and the strengthen the self entrepreneurship in a perfect development.

40|$|Abstract — FSO uses {{modulated}} optical focused beams {{to provide}} atmospheric data transmission. This emerging technology combined the high data rates around 2. 5 Gbps in commercial implementations. This characteristics, {{along with the}} high network reconfigurability (provided in short deployment time) and license-free operation with low sensitivity to electromagnetic interference {{and the problem of}} jamming, made FSO systems more interesting for defense applications. OOK modulation, used by most FSO systems, is <b>now</b> <b>adays</b> not adequate for logically hiding the information, if the beam is intercepted. This should be considered, in case of long-haul military mobile system having large divergence angles. One more disadvantage is that these system is vulnerable to atmospheric phenomenas, such as attenuations and scintillations. All of these factors must be considered during the design of new FSO system for the military purposes. In the proposed system, encoding of data is done at each relay path to protect the transmitted data from all kind of security attacks. Data security in this system came from the physical signal decoding and encoding processes, because a corresponding process is needed to decode the code pattern to successfully receive the transmitted data. When the coding the information is kept secret, the data security is fully ensured. Physical encoding provides complex encoding to the physicaly transmitted signals. After the physical encoding, the signal carrying encoded data is transformed to an unpredictable form which is then modulated using PPM modulation Index Terms — Atmospheric turbulence; Amplified spontaneous emission; free-space optical communications; Wavelength division multiplexing.

40|$|It {{should be}} {{questioned}} especially by {{scholars in the}} field of planning that until now planning documents in Indonesia (development or spatial plan) produced with public money, is it already reflecting or relevant to the need of the community? This provocative question got enough attention, <b>now</b> <b>adays.</b> As the evidence, the government has been introducing and applying various participatory planning approaches to ensure greater opportunities for people to take part in decisions making process. One of these is the Community-Based Neighborhood Development Planning Program or in Bahasa Penataan Lingkungan Permukiman Berbasis Komunitas (PLP-BK). This paper try to describe a research result aimed to examine the extent of participatory concepts are applied in the program and then identify obstacles and challenges will be found. Research is conducted by qualitative approach; the case study method was used to take the case of implementation program in PLP-BK in Pringapus Village Semarang District, which is one of 18 pilot projects in Indonesia. From the research conducted, it can be concluded that the participatory approach applied in PLP-BK implementation in the study area had given a great authority for the community in making planning decision, but it still in the spatial rules. Further, this research grouped 2 major issues which still get attention to improve program performance in the future. First, the clarity of the scope of PLP-BK problem program which should be more pointed at the scale of environmental problems, second the full participatory planning contains conflict between the need for Participatory Planning Expert (TAPP) who has competence not only in spatial planning but also on the method of participatory planning becomes urgent...|$|E

However, the initial approaches were perverted throughout the management process. It was set a very low densities (31. 08 dwellings per hectare on average for all cases), it was liberalized a percentage of all built housing much h igher than the originally planned and it was created land assessment procedures that promoted the speculation and the artificial rise of prices.
