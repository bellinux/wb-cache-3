As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across {{the spine of the}} book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs <b>need</b> <b>this</b> many spine crossings.|$|E

5|$|Spain forbade its American colonies {{to trade}} with other nations or foreign colonies, and imposed itself as the only buyer and vendor for their {{international}} trade. This situation damaged the viceroyalty, as Spain's economy was not powerful enough to produce the huge supply of goods that the numerous colonies would <b>need.</b> <b>This</b> caused economic shortages and recession. The Spanish trade routes favored the ports of Mexico and Lima, {{to the detriment of}} Buenos Aires. As a result, Buenos Aires smuggled those products that could not be obtained legitimately. Most local authorities allowed this smuggling as a lesser evil, even though it was illegal, and it occasionally equalled in volume the legal commerce with Spain. Two antagonistic factions emerged: the landowners wanted free trade so they could sell their products abroad, while the merchants, who benefited from the high prices of smuggled imports, opposed free trade because prices would come down.|$|E

These events prompted his resignation on May 7, 2009. Although Friedman's purchases of Goldman stock did not violate any Fed rule, statute, or policy, he said that the Fed did not <b>need</b> <b>this</b> distraction.

25|$|In zoology {{the term}} {{polygyny}} {{is used for}} to a pattern of mating in which a male animal {{has more than one}} female mate in a breeding season. Males get their mates by defending the females directly or holding resources that the females want and <b>need.</b> <b>This</b> is known as resource defense polygyny and males of the bee species Anthidium manicatum (also known as the European wool carder bee) exhibit this behavior. Males claim patches of floral plants, ward off conspecific males and other resource competitors, and mate with the multiple females who forage in their territories. Males of many species attract females to their territory by either gathering in a lek or going out in search of dispersed females. In polygyny relationships in animals, the female is the one who provides most of the parental care for the offspring.|$|E

25|$|Handicap International {{estimates}} {{that up to}} 50 percent of people injured during the attacks have sustained severe injuries that will require rehabilitation to prevent permanent disability. Of the 1.5 million {{people living in the}} Gaza Strip, international and national agencies working in disability and rehabilitation estimate that, even before the military operation, over 10 percent had moderate or severe impairments. They estimate that as many as half of the 5,380 men, women and children injured over the past three weeks of conflict may suffer lifelong impairment, exacerbated by the inability of rehabilitation workers to provide early intervention. These agencies has highlighted the importance of providing early intervention for those newly injured, especially those discharged prematurely from health facilities; re-establishing and strengthening the capacity of rehabilitation services and disabled peoples organizations to respond to the increased <b>need.</b> <b>This</b> is especially critical given that the main provider of specialist rehabilitation services in Gaza sustained severe damage and is not yet fully operational.
