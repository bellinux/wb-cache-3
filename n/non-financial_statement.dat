40|$|This study investigates {{differences}} in expert valuations of private versus public firms conducted for transactions outside the exchange. First, we {{provide evidence for}} extreme reliance of the experts on private firms' reported earnings, despite a possible manipulation of these earnings. In contrast, experts valuing public firms seem to rely on other, <b>non-financial</b> <b>statement</b> information sources, even if the quality of pre-acquisition earnings is higher in these firms. Second, we present evidence that the contribution of experts to investors in private firms is questionable at best. Our findings indicate that a private firm valuation performed by a potential investor based on available information provides results {{similar to those of}} the expert. Third, we show that inconclusive results regarding the existence of a discount in private firm valuations may be explained by experts' compliance with the interests of the commissioner of the valuation. This finding provides at least a partial explanation for the private company discount, one that adds to prior standard explanations (e. g., liquidity) offered in the finance literature. Financial experts Firm valuation Private company discount Valuation multiples Value-relevance...|$|E
40|$|With the European Directive {{coming into}} force in 2016 {{concerning}} disclosure of non-financial information by large European companies and groups, {{it is important to}} explore one of European corporations ‘best practices’ non-financial disclosures in its public statements. This paper analyses the world’s largest chemical company’s sustainability disclosures in its annual report and via other corporate media. The paper synthesises insights from accounting and sustainability reporting research and provides an analytical frame to explore how one organisation constructs and reports its economic, environmental and social performance. The research asks: 1) How does the organisation determine what to report? 2) What does the organisation report? The research questions are examined by reviewing and studying the organisation’s report at one period of time and corresponding sections on the corporate website of the company, which are both publicly available. The paper finds that the company uses the GRI Guidelines to construct its report and the disclosure contents. Even though the phrase ‘Integrated Report’ is used, the company does not follow the Integrated Reporting framework for determining the frame and content of its economic, environmental and social performance report and other public disclosures. The paper provides academics, regulators and reporting organisations with insights into issues and aspects of the construction of European corporations ‘best practices’ disclosure in <b>non-financial</b> <b>statements.</b> 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|As {{spending}} on green initiatives has increased, {{the push to}} include metrics of sustainability in <b>non-financial</b> <b>statements</b> has also increased. However, the preparation of sustainability reports varies and external assurance is not currently mandatory for reports. Thus, there is an overall confusion on what information is necessary within a sustainability reporting, {{the purpose is to}} (1) evaluate current sustainability practices and (2) recommend ways sustainability reporting should continue to develop. This study investigates current sustainability reporting usage, frameworks, and external assurance. The study also seeks to define sustainability and terms related to sustainability. Reporting frameworks such as the IFAC Sustainability Framework 2. 0 and the GRI G 3 are currently being used by large companies issuing sustainability reports. These frameworks are considered to be the most prevalent guidelines used by large international companies in this study. As most companies have already spent to increase sustainability initiatives, it is assumed that the cost of preparing a report is marginal. Peer reviewed journals, current business periodicals, and firm white papers were utilized to learn about sustainability reporting and its many subtopics. Along with these sources, the IFAC and GRI websites were extensively utilized for information on current frameworks and upcoming changes. Company sustainability websites were evaluated based on provided sustainability information and the quality of available sustainability reports. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
40|$|In December 2013, the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) {{published}} the International Integrated Reporting Framework. The {{aim of the}} Framework is to provide the guiding principles and the content elements of an integrated report. The integrated report constitutes an evolutionary step in the corporate’s financial and non-financial communication, moving from the social responsibility reporting to the integrated reporting. This practice is at the beginning in Europe and especially in Italy, where only a few listed companies have decided to face the multitude of challenges the integrated report implies. Considering the relevance of such {{a new form of}} communication, the paper examines the main steps carried out by an Italian listed company moving towards the integrated report. The research has been conducted by adopting a qualitative case study approach, by focusing on Sabaf S. p. a, an Italian listed medium sized company belonging to the Star Segment. This company has been selected, because {{it was one of the}} first adopters of the integrated report among the Italian listed companies. The study is built on data gathered through sites visits, structured interviews and company materials. The paper examines Sabaf’s transition from the corporate social responsibility report to the integrated report, aiming at answering the following research question: Why has Sabaf moved to integrated reporting? Which are Sabaf’s main steps towars the integrated report? How is the Sabaf’s integrated reporting process going? The findings should be of interest to a number of parties including standard setters, firms, financial advisors, auditors and users of <b>non-financial</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze the status of {{non-financial}} information disclosure in the European Union in order to evaluate the level of acceptance of social responsibility practices. The research {{is divided into two}} sections and the approach used is mainly theoretical and qualitative. In the first part the UE financial and non-financial information regulations are analyzed; the European Union launched a process of harmonization then subsequently it moved to the standardization process: the Regulation (EC) No. 1606 / 2002 is part of the standardization process (It must be applied in its entirety across the EU) while the Directive 2014 / 95 /EU is part of the harmonization process (it sets out a goal that all EU countries must achieve). The Directive 2014 / 95 /EU states that “large undertakings […] shall include in the management report a <b>non-financial</b> <b>statement</b> […]” thus making mandatory the preparation of non-financial statements. In {{the second part of the}} research, not considering the firm only as a system for the production of financial/economic value but also as an economic social actor which operates in a social environment to which it belongs and with which it interacts, the concept of social entrepreneurship is explained. Social entrepreneurship belongs to the entrepreneurs who draw up the social balance, required or permitted by the UE legislation. For this reason, the introduction of obligations in disclosing non-financial information could lead to the increase of entrepreneurship, with positive consequences in the creation of tangible benefits to both the business community and the global community...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1960 s, {{the value}} {{relevance}} of accounting {{information has been}} an important topic in accounting research. The value relevance research provides evidence as to whether accounting numbers relate to corporate value in a predicted manner (Beaver, 2002). Such research is not only important for investors but also provides useful insights into accounting reporting effectiveness for standard setters and other users. Both the quality of accounting standards used and the effectiveness associated with implementing these standards are fundamental prerequisites for high value relevance (Hellstrom, 2006). However, while the literature comprehensively documents the value relevance of accounting information in developed markets, little attention has been given to emerging markets where the quality of accounting standards and their enforcement are questionable. Moreover, there is currently no known research that explores the association between level of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the value relevance of accounting information. Motivated by the lack of research on the value relevance of accounting information in emerging markets and the unique institutional setting in Kuwait, this study has three objectives. First, it investigates the extent of compliance with IFRS with respect to firms listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE). Second, it examines the value relevance of accounting information produced by KSE-listed firms over the 1995 to 2006 period. The third objective links the first two and explores the association between the level of compliance with IFRS and the value relevance of accounting information to market participants. Since it is among the first countries to adopt IFRS, Kuwait provides an ideal setting in which to explore these objectives. In addition, the Kuwaiti accounting environment provides an interesting regulatory context in which each KSE-listed firm is required to appoint at least two external auditors from separate auditing firms. Based on the research objectives, five research questions (RQs) are addressed. RQ 1 and RQ 2 aim {{to determine the extent to}} which KSE-listed firms comply with IFRS and factors contributing to variations in compliance levels. These factors include firm attributes (firm age, leverage, size, profitability, liquidity), the number of brand name (Big- 4) auditing firms auditing a firm’s financial statements, and industry categorization. RQ 3 and RQ 4 address the value relevance of IFRS-based financial statements to investors. RQ 5 addresses whether the level of compliance with IFRS contributes to the value relevance of accounting information provided to investors. Based on the potential improvement in value relevance from adopting and complying with IFRS, it is predicted that the higher the level of compliance with IFRS, the greater the value relevance of book values and earnings. The research design of the study consists of two parts. First, in accordance with prior disclosure research, the level of compliance with mandatory IFRS is examined using a disclosure index. Second, the value relevance of financial statement information, specifically, earnings and book value, is examined empirically using two valuation models: price and returns models. The combined empirical evidence that results from the application of both models provides comprehensive insights into value relevance of accounting information in an emerging market setting. Consistent with expectations, the results show the average level of compliance with IFRS mandatory disclosures for all KSE-listed firms in 2006 was 72. 6 percent; thus, indicating KSE-listed firms generally did not fully comply with all requirements. Significant variations in the extent of compliance are observed among firms and across accounting standards. As predicted, older, highly leveraged, larger, and profitable KSE-listed firms are more likely to comply with IFRS required disclosures. Interestingly, significant differences in the level of compliance are observed across the three possible auditor combinations of two Big- 4, two non-Big 4, and mixed audit firm types. The results for the price and returns models provide evidence that earnings and book values are significant factors in the valuation of KSE-listed firms during the 1995 to 2006 period. However, the results show that the value relevance of earnings and book values decreased significantly during that period, suggesting that investors rely less on financial statements, possibly due to the increase in the available <b>non-financial</b> <b>statement</b> sources. Notwithstanding this decline, a significant association is observed between the level of compliance with IFRS and the value relevance of earnings and book value to KSE investors. The findings make several important contributions. First, they raise concerns about the effectiveness of the regulatory body that oversees compliance with IFRS in Kuwait. Second, they challenge the effectiveness of the two-auditor requirement in promoting compliance with regulations as well as the associated cost-benefit of this requirement for firms. Third, they provide the first known empirical evidence linking the level of IFRS compliance with the value relevance of financial statement information. Finally, the findings are relevant for standard setters and for their current review of KSE regulations. In particular, they highlight the importance of establishing and maintaining adequate monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with accounting standards. In addition, the finding that stricter compliance with IFRS improves the value relevance of accounting information highlights the importance of full compliance with IFRS and not just mere adoption...|$|E
