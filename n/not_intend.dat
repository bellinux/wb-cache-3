5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real.

5|$|The Abbasid {{invasion}} of Asia Minor in 782 {{was one of}} the largest operations launched by the Abbasid Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire.

5|$|The JNA {{responded by}} {{launching}} a major offensive in eastern Slavonia, {{from where it}} intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb.
