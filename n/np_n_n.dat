40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for learning plausible unification-based natural language grammars. Our framework uses both modelbased and data-driven learning without being committed to any particular configuration of these two learning schemes. We use learning to overcome the problem of undergeneration in natural language grammars. This paper presents work that is still in progress: the model-based learning component has been built but the data-driven learning component has not. Full evaluation of the framework awaits a complete implementation. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Undergeneration An application of learning natural language grammars is the treatment of undergeneration. A grammar undergenerates when it fails to generate some sentence which human informants judge to be grammatical. Undergeneration undermines the successful processing of natural language.

40|$|Abstract Background Avian {{influenza}} viruses, {{belonging to}} the family Orthomyxoviridae, possess distinct combinations of hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (<b>N)</b> surface glycoproteins. Typing of both H and <b>N</b> antigens {{is essential for the}} epidemiological and surveillance studies. Therefore, it is important to find a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for their assay, and ELISA can be useful for this purpose, by using recombinant proteins. Results The nucleoprotein (NP) and truncated neuraminidase subtype 3 and 7 of avian influenza virus (AIV) were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and used to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibody detection. The developed assays were evaluated with a panel of 64 chicken serum samples. The performance of NP-ELISA was compared with the commercially available ProFlok ® AIV ELISA kit. The results showed comparable agreement and sensitivity between the two tests, indicating that NP-ELISA assay can be used for screening the influenza type A antibody in AIV infected birds. The <b>N</b> 3 and <b>N</b> 7 - ELISAs also reacted specifically to their type specific sera and did not exhibit any cross-reaction with heterologous neuraminidase subtype specific sera. Conclusion The study demonstrates the expression of the <b>NP,</b> <b>N</b> 3, and <b>N</b> 7 proteins of AIV in yeast (S. cerevisiae) and their application in developing an indirect ELISA for detecting <b>NP,</b> <b>N</b> 3 and <b>N</b> 7 antibodies from AIV-infected chicken sera.

Quasimonoenergetic neutrons in this energy range were produced via the H- 2 (d,n) He- 3 reaction using a deuterium gas target at the Julich variable energy compact cyclotron. Use {{was made of}} the activation technique in combination with high-resolution HPGe-detector gamma-ray spectroscopy. In a few cases low-level beta(-) counting was also applied. In order to decrease the interfering activities in those cases, either radiochemical separations were performed or isotopically enriched targets were used. For most of the reactions, the present measurements provide the first consistent sets of data near their thresholds. From the available experimental data, isomeric cross-section ratios were determined for the isomeric pair Zn- 69 (m,g) in (n,alpha), (<b>n,p),</b> and (<b>n,</b> 2 <b>n)</b> reactions, and for the pair Zn- 71 (m,g) in (n,alpha) and (n,p) reactions.

Consistent {{description of the}} total, fission and partial inelastic scattering data in 1 - 3 MeV energy range provides an important constraint for the absorption cross section. Important constraints for the measured capture cross section come from the average radiation S 0 and S 1 strength functions. An abrupt change of the inelastic data shape at En ~ 1. 5 MeV is explained by the sharp increase of the level density of the residual odd-even nuclide 237 Np due to the onset of three-quasi-particle excitations.

A combination of a radioactive beam facility, an ion storage ring and a high flux reactor would allow a direct measurement of neutron induced reactions over a wide energy range on isotopes with half lives down to minutes. The idea is to measure neutron-induced reactions on radioactive ions in inverse kinematics. This means, the radioactive ions will pass through a neutron target. In order to efficiently use the rare nuclides as well as to enhance the luminosity, the exotic nuclides can be stored in an ion storage ring. The neutron target can be the core of a research reactor, where one of the central fuel elements is replaced by the evacuated beam pipe of the storage ring.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{number of}} {{spanning}} trees of a graph G is usually denoted by &# 964;(G). A circulant graph with <b>n</b> vertices and k jumps is C <b>n</b> (a 1, [...] ,a k). Approach: In this study the number &# 964;(G) of spanning {{trees of the}} circulant graphs C 6 <b>n</b> with some non-fixed jumps such as C 6 <b>n</b> (1, <b>n),</b> C 6 <b>n</b> (1, <b>n,</b> 2 <b>n),</b> C 6 <b>n</b> (1, <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n),</b> C 6 <b>n</b> (1, 2 <b>n</b> 3 <b>n),</b> C 6 <b>n</b> (1, <b>n,</b> 2 <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n),</b> are evaluated using Chebyshev polynomials. A large number of theorems of number of the spanning trees of circulate graphs C 12 <b>n</b> are obtained. Results: The number &# 964;(G) of spanning trees of the circulant graphs C 6 <b>n</b> (1, <b>n),</b> C 6 <b>n</b> (1, <b>n,</b> 2 <b>n),</b> C 6 <b>n</b> (1, <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n),</b> C 6 <b>n</b> (1, 2 <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n),</b> C 6 <b>n</b> (1, <b>n,</b> 2 <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n),</b> C 12 <b>n</b> (1, 2 <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n),</b> C 12 <b>n</b> (1, 3 <b>n,</b> 6 <b>n),</b> C 12 <b>n</b> (1, 3 <b>n,</b> 4 <b>n),</b> C 12 <b>n</b> (1, 2 <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n,</b> 4 <b>n),</b> C 12 <b>n</b> (1, 2 <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n,</b> 6 <b>n),</b> C 12 <b>n</b> (1, 3 <b>n,</b> 4 <b>n,</b> 6 <b>n)</b> and C 12 <b>n</b> (1, 2 <b>n,</b> 3 <b>n,</b> 4 <b>n,</b> 6 <b>n)</b> are evaluated. Conclusion: The number of spanning trees &# 964;(G) in graphs (networks) is an important invariant. The evaluation of this number and analyzing its behavior is not only interesting from a mathematical (computational) perspective, but also, {{it is an important}} measure of reliability of a network and designing electrical circuits. Some computationally hard problems such as the travelling salesman problem can be solved approximately by using spanning trees. Due to the high dependence of the network design and reliability on the graph theory we introduced the following important theorems and their proofs...|$|R
