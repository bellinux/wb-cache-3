60|$|George {{had indeed}} sacrificed himself to save Nelly Penrose. When {{he saw the}} band catch her dress he had looked round for an instant for {{something}} with which to stop the machinery, {{but there was nothing}} at hand, and without an instant's hesitation he had thrust his foot between the cog-wheels. He had on very heavy, thickly <b>nailed</b> <b>working</b> boots, and the iron-bound sole threw the cogs out of gear and bent the shaft, thereby stopping the machinery. George felt a dull, sickening pain, which seemed to numb and paralyze him all over, and he remembered little more until, on the shafting being removed, his foot was extricated and he was laid gently down on a heap of shavings. The first thing he realized when he was conscious was that someone was pouring some liquid, which half-choked him, down his throat.|$|E
60|$|In {{the garden}} {{back of the}} castle an old man was busy digging a hole. It was a long, narrow hole, and, when it was completed, nearly four feet deep. It looked like a grave. When he had {{finished}} the old man hobbled to a shed that leaned against the south wall. Here were boards, tools, and a bench. It was the castle workshop. The old man selected a number of rough pine boards. These he measured and sawed, fitted and <b>nailed,</b> <b>working</b> all {{the balance of the}} night. By dawn, he had a long, narrow box, just a trifle smaller than the hole he had dug in the garden. The box resembled a crude coffin. When it was quite finished, including a cover, he dragged it out into the garden and set it upon two boards that spanned the hole, so that it rested precisely over the excavation.|$|E

All the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a <b>nail</b> was <b>working</b> through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky.|$|R
40|$|Accuracy {{evaluation}} of the default Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) simplified equation for prediction of maximum soil <b>nail</b> loads under <b>working</b> conditions is presented in this study using the maximum likelihood method and {{a large amount of}} measured lower and upper bound nail load data reported in the literature. Accuracy was quantitatively expressed as model bias where model bias is defined as the ratio of measured to predicted nail load. The maximum likelihood estimation was carried out assuming normal and lognormal distributions of bias. Analysis outcomes showed that, based on the collected data, the default FHWA simplified nail load equation is satisfactorily accurate on average and the spread in prediction accuracy expressed as the coefficient of variation of bias is about 30 %, regardless of the distribution type. Empirical calibrations were proposed to the default FHWA simplified nail load equation for accuracy improvement. The Bayesian Information Criterion was adopted to perform a comparison of suitability between the competing normal and lognormal statistical models that were intended for description of model bias. Example of reliability-based design of soil nail walls against internal pullout limit state of nails is provided in the end to demonstrate the benefit of performing model calibration and using calibrated model for design of soil nails...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{studies the}} {{application}} of the nailing technique to excavations. The first part centers around the analysis of the different aspects of reinforced soils' behaviour, with a particular emphasis on the nailing technique, whose features, field of application and place within soil improvement and reinforced methods are described (Ch. 1). Ch. 2 discusses the behaviour of reinforced soils and the way this is affected by the mechanical and geometrical features of the constituent parts. The main mechanisms of interaction intervenning in a number of reinforcing systems are analysed in detail in Ch. 3. Finally, Ch. 4 reviews the published data on the behaviour of actual works, discusses the problems involved in the design of these structures based on limite state equilibrium considerations and intriduces a method based upon this rationale. The second part analyses in detail the <b>nailing</b> system's <b>working</b> mechanisms with the help of 2 - and 3 - dimensional numerical models developed, using the finite elements method, specifically for the study of reinforcing systems. The models are presented in Chs. 5 and 7 respectively. The 2 -dimensional non-linear model is then applied in the analysis of in turn the general behaviour of nailed excavations (Ch. 6); the influence of the parameters which specify the properties of the materials and of the interfaces, as well as the geometry of the systems (Ch. 8); and the consequences of the construction process on soil blok movements (Ch. 9). This chapter also develops some methodologies aiming at reducing those movements. The 3 -dimensional model, on the other hand, is used in the study of some aspects of the soil-nails interaction which cannot be brought into light through bidimensional analysis (Ch. 7). This model is further applied in the study of corner effects in excavations and in the clarification of the conditions under which bidimensional analysis is not adequate (Ch. 10). The two models are then tested through a comparison of there results with actual data from a big nail-reinforced excavation (Ch. 11). The problem of the rupture of nailed walls is also discusses, albeit in a simple and onesided way (Ch. 12) [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{retirement}} is problematic with three definitions: economic, psychological and sociological. Its beginning is often unclear, emerging between mature adulthood and old age. Research has suggested {{a wide variety}} of changes in everyday contexts: slower rhythm in life; transformation of daily occupations and routines. The personal meaning of occupations also transforms through retirement (Jonsson, 2000). Retirement is a transitional process rather than an event, leading to learning about freedom and new attitudes toward life (Hodkinson, 2008). This is a sub-study, part of a larger in-process qualitative study of the experience of retirement of 12 retirees, collected from unstructured interviews and analyzed with a phenomenological approach. This research has documented the situated nature of everyday occupation in the process of retirement. The retirees experienced their occupational place shifting through the transitional process. Their main occupational place shifts from a work oriented one to a place focused on family occupations, hobby or leisure activities, and local community occupations. One occupational place withdraws to the background and another comes gradually to the foreground. This presentation uses one case as an example: a 66 year-old retired craftsman, Nail. At 15 years-old, <b>Nail</b> started <b>working</b> at a car parts factory. His identity was established through workaholic participation in his job, as he was inspired to become a mature and skilled craftsman, trusted at work. He rarely spent time with his family, spending even his weekends with his coworkers. At the age of 60, he had mandatory retirement, but remained, working as an advisor of young workers. However, he worked less time and felt empty and less confident. He recognized that {{he was out of the}} center of the work circle, but not in the center of his home circle either. As “a new comer” to family participation, he started doing house chores, gained respect for his wife as an experienced homemaker, and enjoyed interactions with his grandchildren. At 65, Nail left the factory and found part time work at a smaller factory. He spent more time with family occupations and came to participate in his local community, acting as a school traffic guard. He is looking forward to continue to develop his new occupational place as a mature home/community participant after life as a mature craftsman. After viewing the poster, the participants will be able to discuss: occupational place, changing of occupation in the transition in old age 2 ̆ 6 life transition in retirement process...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionIntramedullary (IM) nailing is the {{classical}} treatment for diaphyseal fractures of the tibia. Stabilizing fractures of the distal quarter {{is recognized as}} being delicate. We report a continuous, multicenter prospective study of distal tibia-fibula fractures treated with anterograde intramedullary <b>nailing.</b> HypothesisThe <b>working</b> hypothesis was to identify the problems encountered with IM nailing alone of distal leg fractures. Patients and methodsFrom May 2007 to November 2008, 51 fractures in 51 patients (19 females and 32 males; mean age, 46. 2  years [range, 17 – 93  years]) were treated with IM nailing. The fractures were classified according to the association pour l’ostéosynthèse (AO) classification, with most type A 1 (29 / 51). Thirteen fractures presented a distal articular extension treated with screws in five cases. Fixation consisted in intramedullary nailing, reamed in all cases, performed on a standard or orthopaedic surgery table. Nailing was static and distally locked (50 / 51). The patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically, with AP and lateral images of both legs and the Olerud score. ResultsWe report one death and eight patients lost to follow-up, providing 42 cases to reviewing at 1  year. The bone union rate was 97. 6 % in a mean 15. 7  weeks. Immediately after surgery, 14 axial deviations greater than 5 ° were observed, mainly valgus, with only one greater than 10 °. The absence of fibular fixation was the only identifiable risk factor for appearance of an initial axial deviation as well as fracture instability over time. Two infections were observed and at 6  months four secondary displacements, one {{of which can be}} explained by changing the distal locking due to infection. Four dynamizations were performed. No other risk factor was found. The mean Olerud functional score at 12  months was 83. 5 points. DiscussionThe clinical results are comparable to those reported in the literature. From a radiological point of view, the rates and times to bone union were identical. However, the rates of malunion were clearly higher. The risk factors for malunion found in the literature are metaphyseal enlargement, fracture comminution, a too distal location of fracture site, young patient age, patient installation on a standard operating table, and technical errors. The absence of supplementary fibular fixation, the subject of debate in the literature, was the only statistically significant point found in the present study. Nailing distal fractures of the leg provides good clinical results. However, with regard to the malunion rates, the technique must be precise and rigorous. We recommend systematic fibular fixation and use of an orthopaedic table. Level of evidence: Level IV; cohort type prospective study...|$|R

Objectives: The aims of {{this pilot}} study were to {{quantify}} respiratory and potential dermal exposure of nail technicians to acetone, formaldehyde, ethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, toluene and xylene. Fifteen female <b>nail</b> technicians, <b>working</b> in different salons {{participated in this}} study. Products used for nail treatments differed between salons. Most salons used acrylate based nail products whereas others used UV–gel products exclusively. Methods: The participants {{were divided into two}} groups, those who used acrylate– and those who used UV–gel products exclusively. Eight hour personal respiration exposure to acetone, formaldehyde, ethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, toluene and xylene were determined. The concentration of airborne volatile organic compounds in the salons was also determined {{with the use of a}} direct reading instrument (EntryRAE). Potential dermal exposure to the above mentioned solvents (excluding formaldehyde) was determined with the use of charcoal pads (surrogate skin method). During respiratory and dermal sampling, observations were made regarding work practices and control measures used in the salons. Results: It was found that the eight hour time weighed average exposure is well below the recommended occupational exposure limits of the individual chemicals and showed no additive effect. The highest mean respiratory exposures in both groups were acetone (27. 22 mg/m 3 and 28. 36 mg/m 3). EntryRAE results showed peak periods of exposure to volatile organic compounds during the day (322. 16 ppm) that were much higher than the average eight hour exposure (0. 21 ppm). The two groups’ exposure levels were compared to determine if there is a significant difference between the exposures levels but no statistically significant difference was found. The dermal exposures on hand and neck to acetone, ethyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate showed strong significant correlations to the concordant chemical’s respiratory exposures. Correlations between air and dermal exposure was calculated once more after adjusting dermal exposure but the findings indicated only one statistically significant correlation of 0. 42 in the case of ethyl methacrylate. Conclusion: Nail technicians are not at immediate health risk as the exposure in nail salons are well below recommended occupational exposure limits. However the unknown effects of chronic low level exposure to solvents and the large number of previous studies that reported increased health risks in nail technicians must also be considered. The use of methyl methacrylate in nail products sold in South Africa is also worrying as methyl methacrylate is banned by the FDA in the US due to its skin sensitisation potential that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. The methods used to determine potential dermal exposure as well as adjusted dermal exposure remains problematic. This is due to the high percentage of adjusted dermal exposure values that had to be estimated and the fact that the activated charcoal pads have a higher absorption potential than human skin. Both methods must be improved to increase accuracy of results. Observations and EntryRAE results demonstrated the irregular nature of a nail technician’s work shift as well tasks performed from day to day. This complicates gathering data that is representative of a nail technicians eight hour exposure. Therefore to further improve accuracy of results, sampling should in future be task specific.

Conventional ball–bearings in rotational applications can potentially be replaced by active magnetic bearings (AMBs). AMBs levitate the rotor via contact–free, actively controlled, electromagnetic forces. At the North–West University, AMBs are applied to a flywheel unin–terrupted power supply (Fly–UPS) system. Regrettably, AMBs are inherently open–loop un–stable because of the inverse displacement–force relationship, and for this reason requires closed–loop feedback control. Thus, the feasibility of multivariable H control for a Fly–UPS system is investigated. At present, the Fly–UPS system is being controlled by a number of decentralized single–input single–output (SISO), PD controllers. Ultimately, the combination of a multivariable plant, inherent instability, model uncertainties, cross–coupled stiffness, high rotational speed as well as external disturbances, calls for the development of a multivariable robust H controller. The aim of H control is to compute a controller such that the modelling uncertainties, noise and disturbances are minimized according to predefined performance and robustness re–quirements. A state–space model of both the radial AMBs and the axial AMB of the Fly–UPS system is developed and modelled according to the parameters of the physical rotor system. The sen–sors, power amplifiers and anti–aliasing filters are modelled and cascaded onto the rotor model. Finally, the system response is evaluated whereby the developed multivariable model is verified and validated. In the context of robust H control, it is vital in specifying the uncertainty bound (difference weighting function) between the mathematical model and physical system in order to ascer–tain stability robustness. Thus, the additive uncertainties between the nominal simulation model and the physical model at varied rotational speeds are characterised. Furthermore, the mixed sensitivity H control synthesis strategy is described. Different weighting schemes are explained and the six block problem weighting scheme is used for H controller synthesis. A multivariable controller is synthesised with weighting functions relevant to the AMB Fly–UPS system and the controller is reduced to a 19 th order controller for implementation. Master...|$|R
