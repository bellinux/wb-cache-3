5000|$|The Riverland Pipeline System is {{a natural}} gas {{transmission}} pipeline supplying gas to the Riverland region of South Australia. It is owned by Australian Gas Networks (formerly Envestra) and operated by the APA Group. The pipeline was built in 1995 by South Australian Gas Company and transferred to Envestra when it was privatised in 1997. The pipeline is a buried steel pipeline with <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 114.3 mm with 3.0 mm wall thickness.The Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure is [...] Most of the pipe is buried {{to a depth of}} 600-900 mm but it is deeper and has thicker walls in areas of high risk such as under road crossings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The elastic {{and plastic}} strain data of tubular {{specimens}} undergoing rupture under internal pressure tests are presented and analyzed. Six tubular specimens were tested. The specimens were cut from longitudinally welded tubes made of API 5 L X 80 steel with a <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 457. 2 mm (18 in) and a nominal wall thickness of 7. 93 mm (0. 312 in). Each {{of the six}} specimens had one external longitudinal or circumferential corrosion defect that had been machined using spark erosion. Tensile specimens and impact test specimens were tested to determine material properties. Post-yielding electrical resistance strain gages were {{used to measure the}} elastic and plastic strains. The failure pressures measured in the laboratory tests were compared with those predicted by the DNV RP-F 101 method for single defects and by the Kastner equation. The paper also discusses the strength of the pipe segments used in the tests under the assumptions of following the Tresca rupture criterion...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA test facility {{to evaluate the}} effect of condensate inundation on heat transfer within a horizontal tube bundle was designed, constructed and validated. Five 15. 9 mm (5 / 8 in.) <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> <b>diameter,</b> smooth stainless steel tubes were utilized in a vertical row. They were located in an equilateral triangular array with a spacing to diameter ratio of 1. 5. Heat transfer performance was determined for each tube in the bundle. Data was taken by condensing steam at about 21 kPa (3 psia) {{on the outside of}} each tube. Each tube was cooled by water on the inside at velocities of 0. 78 to 7. 0 m/sec (2. 56 to 23 ft/sec). The overall heat transfer coefficient was determined directly from experimental data. The inside and outside heat transfer coefficients were determined using the Wilson plot technique. Observation of condensate flow showed lateral droplet motion along the tube in portions of the condenser as well as side drainage, particularly over the first three tubes. Outside heat transfer coefficients were lower than expected when compared to Nusselt theory, possibly due to the effects of secondary vapor flow and/or non-condensable gases. Recommendations to improve validation are provided. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
5000|$|The terms [...] "pipe" [...] and [...] "tube" [...] {{are almost}} interchangeable, {{although}} minor distinctions exist [...] - [...] generally, a tube has tighter engineering requirements than a pipe. Both {{pipe and tube}} imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a hose is usually portable and flexible. A tube and pipe may be specified by standard pipe size designations, e.g., nominal pipe size, or by <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> or inside <b>diameter</b> and/or wall thickness. The actual dimensions of pipe are usually not the nominal dimensions: A 1-inch pipe will not actually measure 1 inch in either <b>outside</b> or inside <b>diameter,</b> whereas many types of tubing are specified by actual inside <b>diameter,</b> <b>outside</b> <b>diameter,</b> or wall thickness.|$|R
5000|$|To {{convert a}} heeled-bullet {{cartridge}} to a non-heeled design, {{it was necessary}} to either enlarge the case diameter, or shrink the bullet and bore diameter. Examples of both choices can be found, but some of the more evident and confusing examples are cases where the bullet diameter was reduced. Many shooters wonder why a [...]38 caliber firearm actually shoots bullets of diameter [...]357 inches, and a [...]44 caliber firearm shoots [...]429 in bullets. In both of these cases, the name of the caliber derives from older heeled-bullet designs, and the name was kept even when the bullet was shrunk to fit inside the case. The [...]38 S&W cartridge, for example, dates from 1877 and has a <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> case <b>diameter</b> of [...]380 inches, while the inside of the case is [...]357 inches. Older [...]38 caliber cartridges, like the [...]38 Short Colt, did use a heeled bullet, so rather than create a new [...] ".35" [...] or [...] ".36 caliber", Smith & Wesson kept the designation [...] ".38" [...] even though it no longer accurately reflected the groove diameter. The later [...]38 Special continued the trend, and even automatic pistol cartridges like the [...]38 Super and [...]380 ACP retained the [...]38 caliber designation, even though they were [...]357s. This continued until 1935 and the introduction of the [...]38 Special-based [...]357 Magnum cartridge. The newer (1956) [...]44 Magnum, however, retained the designation of its parent [...]44 Special cartridge, even though it fired a [...]429 inch bullet. The legacy of heeled bullets is the cause of confusion among many shooting enthusiasts over the actual physical diameters of the bullets they fire in their guns.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTen 15. 9 mm (5 / 8 in.) <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> <b>diameter</b> geometrically enhanced tubes of different metals were tested {{to determine their}} heat transfer and hydrodynamic performance. Results were compared to smooth copper-nickel tubes. Steam at about 21 kPa (3 psia) was condensed on the outside surface of each enhanced tube, horizontally mounted {{in the center of}} a dummy tube bank. Each tube was cooled on the inside by water at velocities of 2. 7 to 7. 6 m/sec (3 to 25 ft/sec). The overall heat transfer coefficient was determined from experimental data. The inside heat transfer coefficients were determined using the Wilson plot technique. Friction factor in the enhanced section was determined from the cooling water pressure drop. Enhanced geometries (utilizing pitch, helix angle and groove depth) were found to improve the corrected overall heat transfer coefficient by as much as 2 times that for smooth tubes. Use of enhanced tubes in place of smooth tubes will permit a decrease in condenser tube surface area from 17 to 53 percent for constant heat loads and constant pumping power.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of sigma-phase {{precipitation}} in duplex stainless steel (grade 2205) pipe fittings collected from top-side process systems offshore was investigated under realistic loading conditions. This was done by conducting quasi-static and dynamic impact tests on 3 ” fittings with a <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 88. 9 mm, nominal wall thickness of 3. 05 mm and D/t-ratio of nearly 30. The fittings had a sigma-phase level between 0 and 15 vol. %, and were loaded by a massive steel indenter with a hemispherical nose of 25 mm radius. In the quasi-static tests, the loading rate was 2 mm/min, while in the dynamic tests the impact velocity was varied between 5 and 10 m/s. A few dynamic impact tests on 2 ” fittings with an increased wall thickness and low sigma-phase levels were carried out for comparison, while some 3 ” fittings were pre-charged with hydrogen before dynamic testing to examine {{the effect of}} sigma phase on cathodic protected subsea components. When the sigma-phase level was low (i. e. σ ⩽ 5 [*]vol. %), no evidence of fracture was found in any of the pipe fittings, whereas at higher sigma-phase levels (σ > 5 [*]vol. %), fracture occurred in all tests. At the highest sigma-phase level (σ ≈ 15 [*]vol. %), extensive fracture and crack growth took place independent of the loading rate...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedExperiments, under different conditions, {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of condensate inundation on condensation heat transfer in tube bundles of marine condensers. Five 15. 9 mm. (5 / 8 in) <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> <b>diameter,</b> smooth stainless steel tubes were used in a vertical row to simulate an actual condenser. Tubes were located in an equilateral triangular array with a spacing-to-diameter ratio of 1. 5. Heat transfer performance was determined for each tube in a bundle. Data was taken for condensing steam {{on the outside of}} each tube at about 21 KPa (3 psia) and at about 101 PKa (14. 7 psia). Each tube was cooled by water on the inside at velocities of 0. 78 to 6. 22 m/sec (2. 56 ft/sec to 20. 42 ft/sec). The overall heat transfer coefficient was determined directly from experimental data. The inside and outside heat transfer coefficients were determined using the Wilson plot technique. Observation of condensate flow showed lateral droplet motion along the first three tubes in portions of the condenser under all conditions tested. Side drainage occurred only over the third and fourth tubes at a condensation pressure of about 21 KPa. The dominate mode of the flow at 101 KPa condensation pressure was gravitational flow. Outside heat transfer coefficients were higher than expected under all conditions when compared to the Nusselt theory. The reason for this is possibly due to secondary vapor flow.

40|$|ARIES {{consists}} of a 6 -wheeled K 3 A mobile platform, a compact subturret, a sonar imaging system, a laser-based {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) navigation beacon system, and a camera positioning system. It has a sonar imaging system used in navigation and collision avoidance and an automatic docking/charging system. Drum-referencing algorithms and camera-positioning algorithms have been included in the primitive instruction set for the robot. The robot`s navigation is based on Synchro-Drive, a patented design that utilizes concentric shafts to distribute drive and steering power to the six wheels simultaneously. ARIES uses a virtual path concept in which only a limited amount of information needs to be provided to the control computer {{in order to get the}} vehicle moving. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, found several areas of concern including ergonomics, laser hazards, tripping hazards, fall-from-above and struck-by hazards, electrical hazards, and decontamination of the system. BOA is a self-propelled automated mini-enclosure, able to remove insulation from installed pipes, primarily of 4 inch <b>nominal</b> <b>outside</b> <b>diameter.</b> The system is designed for two operators: one oversees the abatement head operation from a distance of 10 or 15 feet using a pendant control and the other bags the debris at a cyclonic bagging station that is attached by a vacuum hose to the cutting head. Since the abatement head is its own enclosure, there may be no need for further enclosures to be built. The system wets and removes asbestos insulation automatically, cutting the debris into consistent chunks and moving the wave under a strong vacuum to a bagging machine. Prior to reaching the bagging operation, the material passes through a water separator which greatly reduces the weight of the debris and allows recirculation of water, after sufficient filtration. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, focused on: noise, dust concentrations, ergonomics, and computer software. Industrial hygiene sampling indicated that worker exposures may be kept low enough during normal operation of BOA to eliminate the need for respiratory or heating protection while working around the cutting head and bagging operation. Airborne particulate measurements showed a slight rise over background levels during the operation of BOA, but the average of all the readings during operation was 1. 6 % of the OSHA respirable dust standard. Air sampling and noise monitoring showed dust to be negligible. Noise was shown to be a potential exposure hazard depending on worker location...|$|E
