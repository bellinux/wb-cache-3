5|$|However, Judge Langlois {{receives}} a letter informing {{him of the}} genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.|$|E

5|$|I {{was just}} numbing, numbing, numbing myself then {{sleeping}} it off, then getting on stage, killing it in pain, then getting off and smoking, smoking, smoking, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> what pain was.

5|$|Pritchard {{learned from}} local {{residents}} {{that about a}} mile and a half to the north there was a military camp. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> whether this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so surprised and overwhelmed that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately.|$|E
5|$|A {{party of}} noblemen seeking {{refreshment}} following {{the rigors of}} the hunt arrive in the village. Albrecht hurries away, knowing he would be recognized by Bathilde, who is in attendance. The villagers welcome the party, offer them drinks, and perform several dances. Bathilde is charmed with Giselle's sweet and demure nature, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> of her relationship with Albrecht. Giselle is honored when the beautiful stranger offers her a necklace as a gift before the group of nobles depart.|$|E

5|$|After the Sejny Uprising, a Polish {{revolt against}} the Lithuanian {{authorities}} {{in one of the}} disputed border regions, Lithuanian intelligence intensified its investigation of the Polish minority and sympathizers in Lithuania, and uncovered the planned coup. The Lithuanians, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> the membership of the PMO, arrested numerous Polish activists and destabilized the PMO network enough to prevent the coup attempt. Later the full membership list was obtained and the PMO in Lithuania was dissolved. The coup further strained Polishâ€“Lithuanian relations.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} {{opens up}} a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave {{near the village of}} Ur on the floating continent. Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in order to bring balance back to the world.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E

5|$|Bridget {{bonds with}} Chris Knight (Luke Mitchell) and she asks {{him to the}} school formal. She joins him in a hotel room, where Chris tries to {{pressure}} her into having sex with him. He turns aggressive and Bridget pushes him away and flees the hotel, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> that Chris hit his head. Chris later dies in hospital and Bridget's father confesses to the police that he attacked Chris to protect Bridget. Steve is charged with murder, but Bridget goes to his trial and tells the court that she pushed Chris in self-defense. Throughout the ordeal, Declan is a big support to Bridget and they begin a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E
5|$|Geetha reconciles with Balu {{after he}} saves {{her from a}} wrestler named Sitting Bull. But by the time Balu confesses his love for her, Geetha's {{engagement}} is already fixed. Luckily, Sekar {{turns out to be}} a school friend of JB, and when he discovers that Balu and Geetha are truly in love, he steps aside, wishing the couple a happy life. When Balu is finally revealed as JB, Geetha, again <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> what to believe, thinks the wedding plans are yet another of Balu's practical jokes and tries to run away. He finds her and clears up all of the misunderstandings between them. The two then get married.|$|E

5|$|Gekko proposes using a $100 million {{trust fund}} account, which he hid in Switzerland for Winnie in the 1980s, {{to fund the}} fusion research. She signs the money over to Jake, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> he would entrust it to Gekko to {{complete}} the investment. When Gekko betrays them by leaving {{the country with the}} money, Winnie breaks up with Jake. Gekko sets up a hugely successful investment company in London, capitalized by the $100 million. Jake visits him to propose a new trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko can participate in his grandchild's life. Gekko refuses.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{sided with}} the Eatons. He and his late wife Rachel Donelson had {{undergone}} similar political attacks stemming from their marriage in 1791. The two had married in 1791 <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, had failed to finalize the expected divorce. Once the divorce was finalized, they married legally in 1794, but the episode caused a major controversy, and was used against him in the 1828 campaign. Jackson saw attacks on Eaton stemming ultimately from the political opposition of Calhoun, who had failed to silence his wife's criticisms. The Calhouns were {{widely regarded as the}} chief instigators.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jamie presents Dylan {{with the}} contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. They {{come to the conclusion that}} sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E

5|$|The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House {{asserted}} that the original intention of the 4th Panzer Army command was to drive northwards, with its two panzer corps driving abreast, toward Oboyan and then Kursk; but that on 9 July, due to heavy Soviet resistance {{along the road to}} Oboyan, Hoth was forced to disastrously, although <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> it at the time, alter his plan by ordering the II SS-Panzer Corps to swing from the northwesterly direction to the northeast toward Prokhorovka. Therefore, according to Glantz and House, the Battle of Prokhorova was not a result of original intention nor planned for, but was rather engendered by tactically flawed, late improvisations to the original German plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> what it is doing.|$|E
5|$|The {{score for}} the film was {{composed}} by Craig Armstrong, who was the arranger for Massive Attack, a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film Unleashed. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's Kiss of the Dragon). At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.|$|E
