40|$|In CAGD {{the design}} of a surface that interpolates an {{arbitrary}} quadrilateral mesh or a curve network is definitely a challenging task. A high-quality surface must satisfy both criteria of analytical nature (regularity of the surface) and aesthetic concepts (shape quality). In particular, with regard to the aesthetic quality, {{it is well known that}} an interpolatory surface may show an excessively oscillating behavior in the intermediate areas in between the locations of the constraints. To fix the problem, a recent trend is exploiting approaches based on a <b>non-uniform</b> <b>parameterization</b> (centripetal or chordal), which has proven to be effective both in the parametric 2 D setting and, for regular meshes, in the context of subdivision schemes. In this talk, we present a construction for analytical surfaces of high quality that interpolate quadrilateral meshes of arbitrary topology, that is meshes possibly containing extraordinary vertices. Two are the key ingredients of the approach: i) an innovative parameterization technique that allows the parameters to smoothly vary between one mesh face and another, and ii) the spline interpolants proposed by the authors in two previous papers, which have local support and <b>non-uniform</b> <b>parameterization.</b> We also show that the proposed approach can be easily applied in order to interpolate a given arbitrary network of curves...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlobal-scale tomographic models should aim at {{satisfying}} the full seismic spectrum. For this purpose, and to better constrain isotropic 3 [...] D variations of shear velocities in the mantle, we tackle a joint inversion of spheroidal normal-mode structure coefficients and multiple-frequency S-wave delay-times. In all previous studies for which normal modes were jointly inverted for, with body and/or surface waves, the mantle was laterally parameterized with uniform basis functions, such as spherical harmonics, equal-area blocks, evenly spaced spherical splines. In particular, spherical harmonics naturally appear {{when considering the}} Earth's free oscillations. However, progress towards higher resolution joint tomography requires a movement away from such uniform parameterization, to overcome its computational inefficiency to adapt to local variations in resolution. The main goal {{of this study is}} to include normal modes into a joint inversion based upon a <b>non-uniform</b> <b>parameterization,</b> that is adapted to the spatially varying smallest resolving-length of the data. Thus, we perform the first joint inversion of normal-mode and body-wave data using an irregular tomographic grid, optimized according to ray density. We show how to compute the projection of 3 [...] D sensitivity kernels for both data sets onto our parameterization made up of spherical layers spanned with irregular Delaunay triangulations. This approach, computationally efficient, allows us to map into the joint model multi-scale structural informations from data including periods in the 10 [...] 51 s range for body waves and 332 [...] 2134 s for normal modes. Tomographic results are focussed on the 400 [...] 2110 km depth range, where our data coverage is the most relevant. We discuss the potential of a better resolution where the grid is fine, compared to spherical harmonics up to degree 40, as the number of model parameters is similar. Our joint model seems to contain coherent structural components beyond degree 40, such as those related to the Farallon subduction. Assessing their robustness is postponed to a future work. A wider application of this tomographic workflow, holding promise to better understand mantle dynamics at various spatial scales, should primarily consist in adding surface-wave data and extending our sets of normal-mode and body-wave data...|$|E
40|$|We define an 2 -disparity measure between curved {{high-order}} meshes and parameterized manifolds {{in terms}} of an 2 norm. The main application of the proposed definition is to measure and improve the distance between a curved high-order mesh and a target parameterized curve or surface.

To compute the disparity measure, the average of the squared point-wise differences is minimized {{in terms of}} the nodal coordinates of an auxiliary parametric high-order mesh.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for texture {{synthesis}} based on the simulation of a process of local nonlinear interaction, called reaction-diffusion, which has been proposed {{as a model of}} biological pattern formation. We extend traditional reaction-diffusion systems by allowing anisotropic and spatially non-uniform diffusion, as well as multiple competing directions of diffusion. We adapt reaction-diffusion systems to the needs of computer graphics by presenting a method to synthesize patterns which compensate for the effects of <b>non-uniform</b> surface <b>parameterization.</b> Finally, we develop efficient algorithms for simulating reactiondiffusion systems and display a collection of resulting textures using standard texture- and displacement-mapping techniques. ...|$|R
