An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the <b>Netherlands,</b> with many people aided by the Dutch underground. Approximately two-thirds of this group survived the war.|$|E
5|$|Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten are {{constituent}} {{countries of}} the Kingdom of the <b>Netherlands,</b> and thus have King Willem-Alexander as their sovereign, {{as well as the}} remaining islands forming the Caribbean <b>Netherlands.</b> Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired by the Dutch in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the Royal Navy of King George III. The former <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered by the Dutch West India Company in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained {{under the control of the}} Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the <b>Netherlands</b> in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom. The former <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles again split as three areas in 2010. The monarch is represented in each region by the Governor of Aruba, Alfonso Boekhoudt, the Governor of Curaçao, Frits Goedgedrag, and the Governor of Sint Maarten, Eugene Holiday.|$|E

5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} revenue-sharing within the <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into the <b>Netherlands.</b> Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of the <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the <b>Netherlands</b> in the <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E

The political power of the Dutch colonies was centered at Willemstad, the capital of both Curaçao and of the <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles. The first Dutch Antillean delegation to compete was an eleven-man team that arrived at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Excluding 1956 and 1980, athletes from the <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles had participated at twelve summer games between 1952 and 2004. It had additionally competed at the Winter Olympics of 1988 and 1992. The first female Dutch Antillean Olympians competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and had only appeared sporadically between then and 2004 with the exception of in 1984, when female athletes comprised the majority of the Dutch Antillean delegation. The <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles experienced its greatest diversity of athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, when athletes participated in six different sports.|$|E

5|$|The {{resilience}} of Indonesian Republican resistance and active international diplomacy set world opinion against the Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony. The second 'police action' was a diplomatic {{disaster for the}} Dutch cause. The newly appointed United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson pushed the <b>Netherlands</b> government into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations but until then defied by the <b>Netherlands.</b> The Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the <b>Netherlands,</b> and the Dutch-created federal states. The <b>Netherlands</b> agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI). It would include all {{the territory of the}} former Dutch East Indies with the exception of <b>Netherlands</b> New Guinea; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the <b>Netherlands</b> until further negotiations with Indonesia. The other issue on which Indonesia gave concessions was <b>Netherlands</b> East Indies debt. Indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of £4.3billion, much of which was directly attributable to Dutch attempts to crush the revolution. Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.|$|E

5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} <b>Netherlands</b> after the central government and the provinces. The <b>Netherlands</b> is a decentralized unitary state, {{which means that the}} central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean <b>Netherlands</b> and are not part of a province.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century the Catholic church in the Indies began {{targeting}} the majority-Muslim indigenous population. They were not alone; Protestant missionaries such as Sierk Coolsma of the <b>Netherlands</b> Missionary Union and Mattheus Teffer of the <b>Netherlands</b> Missionary Society had had some success with the Sundanese in Cianjur and Javanese in Ambarawa, respectively. Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, {{sent a letter to the}} <b>Netherlands</b> asking that men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate the catechism and some prayer books.|$|E
5|$|Belgium won {{the first}} four—unofficial—matches against the <b>Netherlands,</b> but lost their first FIFA-recognised contest. The two {{national}} teams played each other biannually between 1905 and 1964, except during the World Wars. They have met 18 times in major tournament campaigns, and have played at least 35 friendly cup matches: in Belgium for the Coupe Vanden Abeele, and in the <b>Netherlands</b> for the Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad-Beker. The overall balance favours the <b>Netherlands,</b> with 55 wins against 41 Belgian victories.

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{problem was not}} solved: Joseph's foreign policy dictated the expansion of Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories, and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia's growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again sought to make a territorial deal with Charles Theodore, again offering to trade portions of Bavarian territory for portions of the Austrian <b>Netherlands.</b> This time {{it would be a}} straight trade: territory for territory, not a partition. Although the Austrian <b>Netherlands</b> was a wealthy territory, it was a thorn in Joseph's side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources he desperately needed elsewhere in his realm. Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the <b>Netherlands</b> entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the financial benefits of both his <b>Netherlands</b> possessions and the Bavarian territories.|$|E
