5|$|The {{chemical}} and physical properties of ytterbium could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> with any precision until 1953, {{when the first}} nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using ion-exchange processes. The price of ytterbium was relatively stable between 1953 and 1998 at about US $1,000/kg.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{recorded}} {{common stingray}} specimen {{was found in}} 2016 in the Izmir province of Turkey {{in the course of}} a study on trolling. Its fins had a width of , although its length could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> as the tail had been removed earlier.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b was {{difficult}} to confirm because its star experiences high jitter, which disrupted the ability to obtain accurate measurements. As such, {{a greater number of}} radial velocity observations were collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation came about after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed in-flight for reasons that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined.</b> The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled {{to the right and}} crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion {{and concluded that the}} cause of the explosion could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined.</b> The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Shire has an {{enormous}} capacity for pulling weight. In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 45 tons, although an exact number could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer. Working in slippery footing, the same pair of horses pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> with certainty. One {{possibility}} is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of research, the Hrant Dink Foundation {{published}} a book, some 400 pages long, describing the current situation of seized assets and properties of the Armenian community. With the help of government deed and title records, {{the members of the}} Hrant Dink foundation have uncovered the title records of all the properties owned by various foundations and have produced the book replete with photographs, charts, maps, and other illustrations which describe the seized properties and assets and its current status. The Hrant Dink foundation states that 661 properties in Istanbul alone were confiscated by the Turkish government, leaving only 580 of the 1,328 properties owned by the 53 Armenian foundations (schools, churches, hospitals, etc.). The current circumstances of the remaining 87 could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined.</b> Out of the 661 confiscated properties, 143 (21.6%) have been returned to the Armenian foundation.|$|E
5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined.</b>|$|E

5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel strainer chamber of the carburettors. The floats had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} engine manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined,</b> but even if it had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E
5|$|The Mendocino Fault is seismically active with mostly {{small and}} {{moderate}} earthquakes, but the largest event that was unequivocally {{associated with the}} fault was the M6.9 earthquake on September 1, 1994, at 125.8 W longitude. Aftershocks of that event with corresponding dextral strike-slip focal mechanisms occurred farther {{to the east and}} close to the Mendocino Triple Junction. Another large event (7.3–7.6) occurred on January 31, 1922 (with an aftershock of M7+ the next day) but the sources of these shocks could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> with any precision as the first seismographs did not arrive in the area until 1932. Due to their offshore epicenters all of these events caused little damage though were felt across a broad area. Previous Gorda plate events include the July 13 and August 17, 1991, shocks of 6.8 and 7.1 and the M7.3 event on November 10, 1980, west of Arcata.|$|E

5|$|The athletes or teams who place first, second, {{or third}} in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now {{gold-plated}} silver. Every gold medal however must contain {{at least six}} grams of pure gold. The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the 1896 Olympics only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics. From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths. The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics {{as a measure of}} success.|$|E
