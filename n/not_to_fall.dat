He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|In 1190, 150 local Jews {{were killed}} in a pogrom in the castle keep, most of them {{committed}} suicide in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> to the hands of the mob. Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone {{in the middle of the}} 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse. During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338, York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England, as well as an important military base of operations.|$|E
5|$|In 1860–61 the {{legislature}} started formal military {{training at the}} school with a law amending the original 1851 statute. During the Civil War, the seminary became The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute. Enrollment at the school increased to around 250 students with the school establishing itself as perhaps {{the largest and most}} respected educational institution in the state. Cadets from the school defeated Union forces at the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865, leaving Tallahassee as the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> to Union forces. The students were trained by Valentine Mason Johnson, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute, who was a professor of mathematics and the chief administrator of the college. After the fall of the Confederacy, campus buildings were occupied by Union military forces for approximately four months and the West Florida Seminary reverted to its former academic purpose.|$|E

They die on 14 February 1983 at 10:20 AM near a clock tower {{on their way to}} the lawyer's office. Their son, Nageswara Rao, becomes a rich and {{influential}} businessman and happens to come across his parents' lookalikes, Nagarjuna and Priya. After befriending them, Rao decides to re-establish them as a couple but is shocked when Nagarjuna introduces his lover, Prema. Rao manages to dissolve the relationship with the help of his personal adviser, Girish Karnad. Unaware of this, Nagarjuna swears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> in love with anyone. At the same clock tower, Rao meets Dr. Anjali and falls in love with her at first sight. He helps her in admitting an injured old man to a nearby hospital and donates his blood. The injured man, Chaitanya, is shocked upon seeing the pair as they resemble his deceased parents, Seetharamudu and Ramalakshmi.|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} Kammhuber as {{commanding}} officer of night air defences in September 1943 did not prevent further appeals for the reinstatement of intruder operations. His replacement as General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Joseph Schmid, commanding 1. Jagdkorps (1st Fighter Corps). Schmid had long argued for a repeat of intruder operations and first pressed for their resumption in December 1943. His proposals were rejected by Göring {{on the grounds that}} intruder operations were not his business. Schmid did not receive substantive support from other field commanders, most notably Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, who objected to the operation after meeting with Schmid in January and February 1944 on the grounds that Hitler opposed such operations and newer German radar was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> into Allied hands. Four months later, attitudes had not changed. Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz, commanding Angriffsführer England (Bomber Leader England) and IX. Fliegerkorps showed little interest in intruder missions either, since his remaining forces were engaged in night attacks against the Allied beachheads in Normandy. In October 1944, he finally won support from Werner Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd (Inspector of Night Fighters) to press for an operation again. The plan was simple; a large force of 600—700 night fighters were to be gathered and sent out in one simultaneous operation.|$|E

25|$|Rising heat {{within the}} {{containment}} area led to increasing pressure. Electricity {{was needed for}} both the cooling water pumps and ventilation fans used to drive gases through heat exchangers within the containment. Releasing gases from the reactor is necessary if pressure becomes too high and has the benefit of cooling the reactor as water boils off, but this also means cooling water is being lost, and must be replaced if the water level is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> too low.

25|$|A {{practice}} {{similar to}} chilla is also performed by Hindustani classical music practitioners at an advanced level.It is called chilla katna. The musicians lock themselves up in a chilla-khana for forty days and practice their instrument severely.

People try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> asleep at any cost, if necessary they will tie their hair to a noose at the ceiling.

A sailor was killed by débris from a magazine that exploded prematurely and a lighter and a picket boat were lost. Shortly after dawn, the Ottomans retook Helles. In {{the final days of the}} campaign, Ottoman air defences had been increased by a German–Ottoman fighter squadron, which began operations over the peninsula and inflicted the first British flying losses a couple of days after the evacuation of Helles, when three Fokker Eindeckers shot down two RNAS aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Lágrimas Cálidas was {{produced}} by Jose Gaviria and Andres Munera. It was recorded at Crescent Moon Studios and Big Dog Studios in Miami, New World Studios in Bogota and Promix Estudios in Medellin. The genre of the album is defined as Tropipop, because it mixes tropical genres such as vallenato and merengue with pop and Caribbean influences. The album opens with [...] "No Te Pido Flores" [...] ("I'm Not Requesting Flowers"), [...] where the predominant instruments are the accordion, guitar and caja vallenata. Lyrically, the song begins with the absence of her man, but then, in the chorus, transitions into a warning <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> in love with material things. The second track, [...] "Lágrimas Cálidas" [...] ("Warm Tears"), is a vallenato-stylized pop ballad, expressing her suffering due to being abandoned by her lover. [...] "Te Arrepentiras" [...] ("You'll Regret"), is {{about a woman who}} surrendered completely to a man who did not appreciate her.|$|E

Kneale knew Richardson through having previously adapted a Chekhov short story for the BBC, which Richardson had directed. Kneale was nominated for the British Film Award (later known as a BAFTA) for Best Screenplay for both films. Film producer Harry Saltzman, who had produced the two Osborne adaptations, approached Kneale about scripting a project {{he was working on}} to adapt Ian Fleming's James Bond novels for the cinema; Kneale was not a fan of Fleming's work and turned the offer down. Further adaptations Kneale did work on were H.M.S. Defiant (1962, from the novel Mutiny by Frank Tilsley) and First Men in the Moon (1964, from the novel by H. G. Wells).|$|E
