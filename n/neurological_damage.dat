5|$|In biology, manganese(II) ions {{function}} as cofactors {{for a large}} variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause manganism, a condition in mammals leading to <b>neurological</b> <b>damage</b> that is sometimes irreversible.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent <b>neurological</b> <b>damage</b> across all {{high school sports}} in the United States from 1982 to 2011. In football, catastrophic {{injuries are}} rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since {{the introduction of the}} modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher {{at the high school level}} than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent <b>neurological</b> <b>damage,</b> and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-nine percent of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and <b>neurological</b> <b>damage.</b> Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E

5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed <b>neurological</b> <b>damage.</b> Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E

50|$|Like {{many other}} acanthocephalans, {{recent studies have}} shown that the {{presence}} of cystacanth of Profilicollis antarcticus causes behavioral alterations due to changes in the levels of hemolymph dopamine in its intermediate host, the crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus. These changes in the biogenic amino levels can cause behavioral changes such as changes in response to external stimuli resulting from <b>neurological</b> <b>damages</b> (escape behavior), increased conspicuity resulting from modified pigmentation and/ or behavior and castration. Previous studies have also shown that crabs infected with cystacanths exhibit higher metabolic rates and activity levels than non-parasitized crabs.|$|R

40|$|Approximately 3 to 5 % of {{referrals}} to emergency wards of big cities {{are involved in}} diseases causing loss of consciousness (LOC). Since many of these patients encounter death or disabilities, determining a systematic approach for early diagnosis and treatment has a high priority this will be achieved through revealing the etiologies responsible for LOC and hospital outcome in an emergency ward. A total of 392 patient older than 12 years old (54. 8 % male, 45. 2 % female, {{with a mean age}} of 49. 9) presenting with LOC were enrolled in this cross-sectional study in emergency ward of Bushehr University Hospital. LOC was defined as a clinical state manifested by any decrease of consciousness ranging from confusion to deep coma. Etiology of LOC was metabolic in 42. 9 %, structural in 40. 1 % and infective in 6 % of patients. It remained unknown in 11 % despite extensive investigation. The most prevalent causes in subgroups were cerebrovascular accidents (30. 6 %), drug intoxication (22. 35 %) and hypoxic-anoxic conditions (11. 7 %), respectively. Mortality rate caused by infective, structural and metabolic etiologies had a frequency of 33. 3 %, 26. 8 % and 22 % respectively. Structural etiologies had the most severe prognosis and caused <b>neurological</b> <b>damages</b> in 54. 7 % of patients. Metabolic etiologies with 3. 8 % had the lowest rate in <b>neurological</b> <b>damages.</b> In an overall view, metabolic causes were the most common etiology responsible for non- traumatic LOC...|$|R

50|$|Wernicke's {{disease is}} one of the most {{prevalent}} neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases. In autopsy series, features of Wernicke lesions are observed in approximately 2% of general cases. Medical record research shows that about 85% had not been diagnosed, although only 19% would be asymptomatic. In children, only 58% were diagnosed. In alcohol abusers, autopsy series showed <b>neurological</b> <b>damages</b> at rates of 12.5% or more. Mortality caused by Wernicke's disease reaches 17% of diseases, which means 3.4/1000 or about 25 million contemporaries. The number of people with Wernicke's disease may be even higher, considering that early stages may have dysfunctions prior to the production of observable lesions at necropsy. In addition, uncounted numbers of people can experience fetal damage and subsequent diseases.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>neurological</b> <b>damages</b> {{resulted}} by endosulfan poisoning is {{not completely}} elucidated, especially in cellular organelles such as mitochondria. In the present study, the pro-oxidant effect of endosulfan on brain mitochondria was first investigated. Gavages of endosulfan into rats at the dose of 2 mg/kg induced oxidative stress in this organelle since it provokes a significant reduction of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH) level. In addition, {{a significant increase in}} mitochondria swelling and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were observed in neuronal mitochondria, indicating clearly an intense peroxidation within mitochondria. Second, the protective effect of quercetin (QE) (10 mg/kg) against endosulfan-induced oxidative stress in mitochondria was also assessed. Indeed, the pretreatment of rats with QE protects brain mitochondria from oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondria swelling induced by endosulfan. The activities of antioxidant enzymes and the mitochondrial content of GSH and MDA were returned to control values. Thus, although endosulfan can have neurotoxic effects in brain rats, this toxicity can be prevented by quercetin...|$|R
