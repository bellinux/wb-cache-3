40|$|Objective: An {{increasing}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients presenting for urgent coronary surgery {{have been}} exposed to clopidogrel, which constitutes a risk of bleeding and related events. Based on the wide variability in clopidogrel response and platelet function recovery after cessation, we evaluated the role of point-of-care platelet function testing to define the optimal time for off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in a case-control study. Methods: Three equally matched groups (300 patients in total) undergoing isolated off-pump CABG for acute coronary syndrome were compared. Group A were treated with clopidogrel and prospectively underwent a strategy guided by platelet function testing. Outcomes were compared with 2 propensity score matched groups: group B underwent CABG after the currently recommended 5 days without clopidogrel; group C were never exposed to clopidogrel. Results: Patients in group A had reduced postoperative bleeding compared with those in group B (523 ± 202 mL vs 851 ± 605 mL; P <. 001) and a lower <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> <b>packed</b> red blood cells (PRBCs) transfused during the postoperative hospital stay (1. 2 ± 1. 6 units vs 1. 9 ± 1. 8 units; P =. 004). Postoperative bleeding and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> units of PRBCs transfused were similar in group A and group C. There was no difference in blood-derived products and platelet consumption, mortality, or the need for reoperation among the groups. Patients in group A waited 3. 6 ± 1. 7 days for surgery. The strategy used for group A saved 280 days of hospital stay in total. Conclusions: The strategy guided by platelet function testing for off-pump CABG offers improved guidance for optimal timing of CABG in patients treated with clopidogrel. This strategy significantly reduces postoperative bleeding and blood consumption, and has a shorter waiting time for surgery than current clinical practice. © 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To show if blood salvage is {{indicated}} in all patients submitted to cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: We studied 77 consecutive patients submitted to cardiac surgery {{with use of}} blood salvage and cardiopulmonary bypass from November 2010 to June 2012. The sample was divided in three groups, depending {{on the time of}} cardiopulmonary bypass. In group A, the time of cardiopulmonary bypass was smaller than 45, in group B from 45 to 90 and in group C greater than 90 minutes. We analyzed the volume of red cells recovered and infused, the pre, intra and post-operative hemoglobin, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packed</b> red cells <b>units</b> which were transfused and hematocrit and hemoglobin blood infused. Results: The average group age was 60. 44 &# 177; 12. 09 years old, of whom 71. 43 % were males. The group A was formed by 5. 19 % of the patients, B by 81. 82 % and C by 12. 99 %. The volume of erythrocytes recovered and infused was respectively 1, 360. 50 &# 177; 511. 37 ml and 339. 75 &# 177; 87. 71 ml in group A, 1, 436. 63 &# 177; 516. 06 ml and 518. 83 &# 177; 183. 0 ml in B and 2, 137. 00 &# 177; 925. 04 ml and 526. 20 &# 177; 227. 15 ml in C. About packed red cells transfusions, in group A 1, 00 &# 177; 2, 00 packed red cells were transfused, in B 1. 27 &# 177; 1. 85 packed red cells and in C 2. 56 &# 177; 2. 01 packed red cells.

30|$|Following the {{occurrence}} of bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases in cattle, Japan established a traceability system for beef (Food Rink News 2003). Compared with cattle, eels are small and cannot be sold separately, {{making it difficult to}} establish traceability for every individual fish. However, it is possible to attach a traceable RFID chip to every <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> eel. Each <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> eel exported to the Japanese market weighs 20  kg, and every 20  kg package carries a traceable RFID chip. The cost of a piece of RFID chip is 20 NT$. The price of eel is unstable and keeps changing. It can range from 200 NT$ to 600 NT$ per kg. The price <b>of</b> a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> (20  kg) can range from 4, 000 NT$ to 12, 000 NT$. If an RFID chip is attached to every <b>packed</b> <b>unit,</b> the cost will increase by about 0.5 % when the price <b>of</b> a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> is 4, 000 NT$, and the cost will increase by about 0.17 % when the price <b>of</b> a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> is 12, 000 NT$. For eel farmers and exporters, costs will slightly increase, but this extra cost is justified by the ease of traceability. RFID aside, eel farmers should keep records of their production process and the materials they use during production, as these are helpful in setting up a proper traceability system.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} clinical and demographic variables in patients requiring blood transfusion during elective surgery to treat scoliosis {{with the aim of}} identifying markers predictive of the need for blood transfusion. METHODS: Based on the review of medical charts at a public university hospital, this retrospective study evaluated whether the following variables were associated with the need for red blood cell transfusion (measured by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packs</b> used) during scoliosis surgery: scoliotic angle, extent <b>of</b> arthrodesis (<b>number</b> <b>of</b> fused levels), sex of the patient, surgery duration and type of scoliosis (neuromuscular, congenital or idiopathic). RESULTS: Of the 94 patients evaluated in a 55 -month period, none required a massive blood transfusion (most patients needed less than two red blood cell <b>packs).</b> The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packs</b> was not significantly associated with sex or type of scoliosis. The extent of arthrodesis (r =  0. 103), surgery duration (r =  0. 144) and scoliotic angle (r =  0. 004) were weakly correlated with the need for blood transfusion. Linear regression analysis showed an association between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spine levels submitted to arthrodesis and the volume of blood used in transfusions (p =  0. 001).
