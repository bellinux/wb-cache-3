5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, the {{porbeagle}} is on {{the verge}} of extinction, with a population decline of over 99.99% since the mid-20th century. Its range has contracted to the waters around the Italian Peninsula, where there may be a <b>nursery</b> <b>area.</b> Only a few dozen specimens have been recorded in the past few decades, from scientific surveys, swordfish fishery bycatch, and sport fishers. In 1995, it was included in Annex III ("species whose exploitation is regulated") of the Barcelona Convention Protocol on protected areas and biodiversity in the Mediterranean, which has not been ratified. In 1997, it was listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats).

40|$|<b>Nursery</b> <b>areas</b> for {{juvenile}} fishes {{are often}} important for determining recruitment in marine populations by providing habitats that can maximize growth and thereby minimize mortality. Pacific ocean perch (POP, Sebastes alutus) have an extended juvenile period where they inhabit rocky nursery habitats. We examined POP <b>nursery</b> <b>areas</b> to link growth potential to recruitment. Juvenile POP were captured from <b>nursery</b> <b>areas</b> in 2004 and 2008, and estimated growth rates ranged from − 0. 19 to 0. 60 g day− 1 based on differences in size between June and August. Predicted growth rates from a bioenergetics model ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 49 g day− 1 {{and were not}} significantly different than observed. Substrate preferences and the distribution of their preferred habitats were utilized to predict the extent of juvenile POP nursery habitat in the Gulf of Alaska. Based on densities of fish observed on underwater video transects and the spatial extent of <b>nursery</b> <b>areas,</b> we predicted 278 and 290 million juvenile POP were produced in 2004 and 2008. Growth potential for juvenile POP was reconstructed using the bioenergetics model, spring zooplankton bloom timing and duration and bottom water temperature for 1982 – 2008. When a single outlying recruitment year in 1986 was removed, growth potential experienced by juvenile POP in <b>nursery</b> <b>areas</b> was significantly correlated to the recruitment time-series from the stock assessment, explaining ∼ 30 % of the variability. This research highlights the potential to predict recruitment using habitat-based methods and provides a potential mechanism for explaining some of the POP recruitment variability observed for this population...|$|R
5|$|Like other {{mackerel}} sharks, common threshers are aplacental viviparous. They {{give birth}} to litters of two to four (rarely six) pups in the eastern Pacific, and three to seven pups in the eastern Atlantic. They are believed to reproduce throughout their range; one known <b>nursery</b> <b>area</b> is the Southern California Bight. Breeding occurs in the summer, usually July or August, and parturition occurs from March to June following a gestation period of nine months. The developing embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs ovulated by the mother. The teeth of small embryos are peg-like and non-functional, being covered by a sheath of soft tissues. As the embryos mature, their series of teeth become progressively more like those of adults in shape, though they remain depressed and hidden until shortly before birth.|$|E
5|$|The boardwalk {{is within}} the barker inlet aquatic reserve, where the taking of crabs {{shellfish}} and plants is prohibited and pets are not allowed.

The 2005 Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act established a sanctuary for the Bottlenose dolphins that live in the inlet and adjacent Port River. The sanctuary's northern extent is the boat channel and dolphins can sometimes be seen at high tide in the tidal creeks passing under the boardwalk.|$|E
5|$|The blacktip shark is an {{extremely}} fast, energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size. Segregation by sex and age does not occur; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females, and both are separated from juveniles. In Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, a <b>nursery</b> <b>area</b> for this species, juvenile blacktips form aggregations {{during the day and}} disperse at night. They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest, suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators (mostly larger sharks) in numbers. Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay. Adults have no known predators. Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii, and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp., which attach the shark's skin. This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae, which infest the ovaries.|$|E

40|$|Coastal {{zones are}} {{essential}} nursery habitats for most juvenile flatfish species. Fish stocks are {{highly dependent on}} suitable coastal habitat features for obtaining food, shelter, and rapid growth during the vulnerable juvenile life stage. Understanding the ecological habitat requirements for juvenile flatfish is important in determining their abundance and to reliably predict potential impacts of changing coastal ecosystems on fish stocks. The present study assesses the influence of habitat characteristics on the growth and abundance of juvenile dab and plaice in four <b>nursery</b> <b>areas</b> within Galway Bay, Ireland. Field sampling {{was carried out in}} summer 2008 using a beam trawl for the collection of flatfish and a van Veen grab for the collection of sediment. The distribution and abundance of the juvenile flatfish was assessed in relation to biotic (predator–prey abundance) and abiotic (sediment size, organic content, depth, temperature, and salinity) habitat features. The condition and growth of flatfish were compared in different <b>nursery</b> <b>areas</b> and a model of habitat requirements for juvenile plaice and dab was developed. Significant variability of the measured characteristics was observed between <b>nursery</b> <b>areas</b> and high-quality <b>nursery</b> <b>areas</b> for dab and plaice were identified.

5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some to the <b>nursery</b> <b>area,</b> others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source}} of food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|S. japonica {{occurs in}} a variety of habitats, with shallow sandy flats in bays, surf zones of beaches, {{protected}} eelgrass seabeds and occasionally estuaries used by the species. They are a shallow water species, operating in s between 0 and 30 m.

Off Portugal, the young seem to be born in May and December following a gestation period of over a year. As they near giving birth, the females undergo ovarian atresia (regression of the follicles), suggesting that they enter a resting period afterwards. The litter size ranges from 1 to 29 (typically 12), and is not correlated with female size. Parturition may occur in a yet-unknown <b>nursery</b> <b>area,</b> as newborns are rarely ever caught.
