Preimplantation genetic screening was performed in all viable embryos. We observed {{a positive relationship between}} ovarian response and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> euploid <b>embryos.</b> When ovarian response was above the median (≥ 17 oocytes), the mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> euploid <b>embryos</b> per donor was 5. 0 ± 2. 4, while when < 17 oocytes were obtained the mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> euploid <b>embryos</b> was 2. 7 ± 1. 4 (p= 0. 000).

Two studies were conducted to evaluate the use Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) for superovulation in buffalo. First study, fifteen buffaloes were randomly divided into 3 groups of five buffaloes of each group and superovulated using three type of FSH (FSH-P; FSC-China and Folltropin). Hormones were given twice a day for 4 days in decreasing doses methods. First injection initiated on day 10 of estrus cycle, followed by prostaglandin on day 12 than artificially inseminated (AI) two days later. Recovery <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> was conducted un-surgically method by flushing uterus horn on day 6 after AI. Second study, 10 buffaloes were randomly divided into 2 groups of each five buffaloes First group was superovulated with FSH followed methodology in the first study (control group) and second group were given a prime FSH on day 1 of estrus cycle before superovulation (treatment group). After 3 months the superovulation was repeated in the reverse condition where the control become treatment and the treatment become a control group. The type of FSH did not significantly affect the superovulatory response. The mean total corpus luteum (TCL), total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> (TNE) and total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> viable <b>embryo</b> (TVE) were 6. 8, 3. 3 and 2. 2, 6. 2, 3. 0 and 2. 1 and 7. 2, 3. 6 and 2. 4 for FSH-P, FSH China and Folltropin respectively. A single injection of FSH significantly increased (P< 0. 05) the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> collected. The mean TCL, TNE and TVE were 6. 9, 2. 8 and 2. 1 and 8. 2, 3. 3 and 2. 5 for control and treatments respectively.

A small increase in FSH was observed on d 15 after last pFF injection on d 14. Treatment with pFF reduced <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> medium follicles compared to controls on d 13 and 15 but not on d 17. <b>Numbers</b> <b>of</b> large follicles were reduced on d 17 from pFF but ovulation rate at post-treatment estrus was not affected. Experiment 2 characterized differences in FSH, LH, ratio of FSH:LH, E 2, P 4 and inhibin profiles during the estrous cycle in gilts differing in ovulation rate (OR). Concentrations of FSH were elevated throughout the estrous cycle in high ovulating gilts expressing a 20 d estrous cycle compared to low OR gilts. High OR gilts that expressed 25 d estrous cycles had elevated FSH only during the late luteal and early follicular phases. No differences were detected in mean LH, LH pulse characteristics or E 2, but P 4 (luteal phase), inhibin (follicular phase) and ratio of FSH:LH (luteal phase) were elevated in high OR gilts.
