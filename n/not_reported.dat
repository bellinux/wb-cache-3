5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. It is therefore very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, but they were <b>not</b> <b>reported</b> and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E

It was estimated that ITV would stand to make £9million in advertising revenue during the final, rising to £10million if it went to extra time and penalties; this compared with amounts of £2–3million normally received for its Wednesday night schedule and £3–4million for a Champions League final with no British teams involved.
