50|$|The 1981 Act {{ceased to}} {{recognise}} Commonwealth citizens as British subjects. There remain only {{two categories of}} people who are still British subjects: those (formerly known as British subjects without citizenship) who acquired British nationality through a connection with former British India, and those connected with the Republic of Ireland before 1949 who have made a declaration to retain British <b>nationality.</b> <b>British</b> subjects connected with former British India lose British nationality if they acquire any other.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the <b>nationality</b> <b>British</b> National (Overseas) in 1985, most permanent residents of Hong Kong, who were British Dependent Territories Citizens, could either remain as such or immediately register for the new type of nationality, the BN(O). People who chose to remain as BDTCs, however, {{would not be able to}} renew their BDTC passports upon their expiry. Following {{the introduction}} of the BN(O) passports in 1987, renewals of BDTC passports could only take the form of registering as a British National (Overseas).|$|E

None of this affects a person's national status under UK law.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} <b>British</b> <b>nationality</b> law now {{in force}} is the <b>British</b> <b>Nationality</b> Act 1981, which established {{the current system}} of multiple categories of <b>British</b> <b>nationality,</b> viz. <b>British</b> citizens, British Overseas Territories citizens, British Overseas citizens, British Nationals (Overseas), British subjects and British protected persons. Only British citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens have the automatic right of abode in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{in spite}} of the fact that most of this Act has been {{repealed}} by the <b>British</b> <b>Nationality</b> Act 1981, the acquisition of new categories of <b>British</b> <b>Nationality</b> created by the <b>British</b> <b>Nationality</b> Act 1981 is often made dependent on one's nationality status prior to the effective date of the <b>British</b> <b>Nationality</b> Act 1981.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} patient preference for dentists {{as a function}} of the latter's demographics and experience. A sample of 161 British participants completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to rate eight dentists differentiated by <b>nationality</b> (<b>British</b> vs. Eastern European), sex (male vs. female), and experience (great vs. moderate). A mixed-design analysis of variance showed that there were main effects of dentist <b>nationality</b> (<b>British</b> preferred over Eastern European), sex (female over male), and experience (great over moderate). There were also a number of significant two- and three-way interactions, although the effect sizes of these interactions were relatively small. Participant sex generally did not have an impact on preferences. These results are discussed in relation to the extant literature on patient preferences for different types of health care practitioners...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{tested the}} hypothesis that discrimination against immigrants is more strongly endorsed and ideologically justified than discrimation that is directed at many other outgroups. To test this hypothesis, we developed a measure that asked participants to imagine {{that they were being}} asked to choose between two candidates who possessed similar qualifications, except for one distinguishing characteristic. The distinguishing characteristic included <b>nationality</b> (<b>British</b> vs. Immigrant), race (White vs. Black), and height (tall vs. short) among others (e. g., age, sexual preference). As expected, results indicated stronger discrimination against immigrant candidates and that respondents often justified this discrimination by appealing to personal values...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{continuing}} controversy in models of face identification concerning the level of access to names relative to semantic information. In order to determine whether names are accessed sequentially after or in parallel to semantic information, we studied participants' speeded decisions about famous faces that were primed by partial semantic or partial name information. Decisions that required the access to the celebrity's name (one or more forename syllables, Expt 1) were significantly primed by partial name primes (initials or name fragments). However, at variance with sequential stage models, no reliable priming was observed by partial semantic primes (information about nationality, occupation, or whether a person was dead or alive). Moreover, {{there was a clear}} and consistent priming effect by partial semantic primes if the task was a <b>nationality</b> (<b>British</b> or American) decision that required the access to semantic information (Expt 2), demonstrating the effectiveness of these primes. The effects of partial name primes on nationality decisions were less consistent, with a significant effect for name fragments but not initials. However, effects of name primes were generally greater for syllable decisions than nationality decisions, and effects of semantic primes were generally greater for nationality decisions than syllable decisions. Taken together, these results favour a model of parallel rather than sequential access and suggest some degree of independence in the access to personal semantics and names...|$|E
40|$|Architecture has a {{great impact}} on our {{well-being}} by inducing feelings ranging from boredom, depression, and even fear to inspiration and relaxation. This warrants research on the topic of what makes buildings attractive. The results of previous studies are mixed, but they indicate that architectural knowledge and cultural factors effect architectural judgements. The present study therefore concentrates on two variables: <b>Nationality</b> (<b>British</b> and Finnish) and professionality (architects and lay people). The experimental hypotheses were these: Firstly, people prefer familiar building styles to unfamiliar ones. Secondly, lay people like popular, more decorative styles more than so-called “high” styles, whereas architects are expected to prefer more Minimalist, “high” style buildings to decorative, popular style ones. Thirdly, the British and the Finnish participants will differ in their architectural preferences, due to acculturation. The aesthetic preferences for 10 buildings reflecting differing styles were compared in architects and lay people in Finland and the United Kingdom. In addition to examining main effects, the study tested the effects of nationality and profession interaction, and controlled for the main effects of familiarity and liking. The results of the study did not support the first hypothesis, which stated that familiar buildings would be liked more than unfamiliar ones. The second hypothesis, stating that architects prefer “high” style buildings to popular style buildings and that lay people prefer popular styles to “high” styles, was not supported either, although the data pointed in its direction. The third hypothesis, stating that the two nationalities will differ in their architectural judgements, was, however, supported by the results, suggesting that acculturation {{is an important factor in}} architectural judgements...|$|E

40|$|Against a {{background}} of continuing globalization, business leaders have repeatedly called for graduates to have ‘global competencies’, particularly communication skills {{and the ability to}} work in diverse teams [1, 2, 3]. Despite these calls, official learning outcomes for engineering programs in Flanders, Belgium, as elsewhere in Europe, rarely go beyond token phrases like ‘operating in an intercultural environment’ or ‘having insight in working in an international environment’ [4, 5]. While such ‘placeholder’ terminology may be a sign of a more general wish to instill these qualities in engineering students, it offers no direction as to just how engineering educators should go about attaining or assessing these learning outcomes. Therefore, there is a clear need to identify or develop a valid competency framework for operationalizing learning outcomes in connection with working in an intercultural environment in the engineering curriculum. First established in 2009 after two phases of data collection (2003 - 7) and analysis, the Global People Competency Framework [henceforth GPCF] is a comprehensive and concrete set of resources and models for both students and educators for nurturing intercultural competence [6]. It was developed out of the intercultural interaction experiences of staff at British and Chinese universities when they were collaborating on a number of joint teacher training projects. Having emerged from a relatively limited context in terms of <b>nationality</b> (<b>British,</b> Chinese) and sector/discipline (education), its suitability for use in different contexts needs to be investigated. This study is the first to do so systematically. In this paper, the authors present ongoing research on the suitability of GPCF for engineering curricula by investigating student reception of the framework and exploring whether there are areas where adaptation would be beneficial. status: publishe...|$|E

After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, it was considered necessary to devise a <b>British</b> <b>Nationality</b> Selection Scheme to enable some of the population to obtain British citizenship to maintain confidence in Hong Kong and to counteract the effects of the emigration of many of its most talented residents.
