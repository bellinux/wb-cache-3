30|$|As {{a special}} class of {{time-delay}} <b>systems,</b> <b>neutral</b> <b>systems</b> contain time-delay {{both in the}} states and in the derivatives of states, which can reflect the systems’ operation more comprehensively and accurately. It {{has been shown that}} a number of practical systems can be modeled by <b>neutral</b> <b>systems</b> such as heat exchangers, population ecology, and partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) (see [7, 8]).

That is, a candidate whose ratings are {fair, fair} will beat a candidate whose ratings are {good, poor} in both directions, because the more variable rating will be rounded down. However, this failure only happens when a candidate's median is perfectly balanced between two scores, which is unlikely in proportion to the number of voters. The probability of this is negligible; it is only a constant factor higher than that of a perfect tie in a two way race, a situation in which any <b>neutral</b> <b>system</b> can fail to have reversal symmetry.|$|E

30|$|To {{the best}} of the authors’ knowledge, though some {{frequency}} domain methods, such as the spectral decomposition theory and semi-group theory, are applied to investigate the stability of <b>neutral</b> <b>systems,</b> they are not as popular as Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF). Through LKF approach, many stability criteria have been proposed (see [11 – 13]). Recently, LMIs and free weighting matrices have been widely used in LKF for the stability of <b>neutral</b> <b>systems</b> (see [14 – 16]). For example, by constructing a new LKF with free weighting matrices, stability criteria for uncertain <b>neutral</b> <b>systems</b> were investigated in [11]. Moreover, free weighting matrices and model transformations were both employed in [14] for cross terms. Then a less conservative stability criterion based on LMIs was derived for stochastic <b>neutral</b> <b>systems.</b> However, control design based on these stability criteria is usually the state feedback, which is delay-independent or delay-dependent.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} output strictly passive control for uncertain singular <b>neutral</b> <b>systems.</b> It introduces a new effective criterion to study the passivity of singular <b>neutral</b> <b>systems.</b> Compared with the previous approach, this criterion has no equality constraints. And the state feedback controller is designed so that the uncertain singular <b>neutral</b> <b>systems</b> are output strictly passive. In terms of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) and Lyapunov function, the strictly passive criterion is formulated. And the desired passive controller is given. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approach...|$|R
30|$|As {{far as we}} {{know the}} methods of {{controller}} design for <b>neutral</b> <b>systems</b> do not include a derivative feedback because of the complexity of the neutral term in <b>neutral</b> <b>systems.</b> Theorem  3 provides the derivative feedback method which uses the knowledge of complex matrix inequalities [33]. So the gain matrices are all real matrices.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that exponential stabilization of a <b>neutral</b> <b>system</b> with unstable difference operator is only possible by allowing for control laws containing derivative feedback.
