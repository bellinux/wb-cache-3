25|$|The <b>neckband</b> of {{the hood}} usually has a loop of which {{original}} {{function is to}} hook onto the button of a cassock. Since many do not wear cassocks for graduation, the loop is sometimes hooked onto a shirt button instead. However, since the hood is rather heavy this {{has a tendency to}} pull the lightweight shirt upwards. The correct way to wear the hood is to allow the <b>neckband</b> to naturally hook itself onto the collar under the tie which secures the hood in place. Sometimes, the hood is worn too forward and down being hooked onto the jacket button or pinned which causes the hood to sit poorly and be more likely to slip down the shoulders like a shawl.|$|E
25|$|Hoods {{are worn}} {{on the back}} as an {{indicator}} of academic status. These are of the distinctive Cambridge Full shape. The hood consists of a cape (known also as the 'tippet'), cowl and liripipe. The <b>neckband</b> of a hood is of the outer colour, with no edging of the lining material. The corners of tippets are square. The design of hoods as set by University Ordinances Chapter II is below.|$|E

2500|$|Necktie fashions {{included}} the four-in-hand and, {{toward the end}} of the decade, the ascot tie, a tie with wide wings and a narrow <b>neckband,</b> fastened with a jewel or stickpin. [...] Ties knotted in a bow remained a conservative fashion, and a white bowtie was required with formal evening wear.|$|E
2500|$|Necklines on dresses {{became more}} open {{as time went}} on {{allowing}} for greater display of ornamentation of the neck area. A thick band of lace was often sewed onto the neckline of a gown with ribbons, flowers, and/or jewels adorning the lace. Jewelry such as strings of pearls, ribbons, or lace frills were tied high on the neck. Finally, one other large element of 18th century women's dress wear became the addition of the frilled <b>neckband,</b> a separate piece {{from the rest of the}} dress. This ornament was popularized sometime around 1730 [...]|$|E
2500|$|Fashion in {{the period}} 1550–1600 in Western European {{clothing}} was characterized by increased opulence. [...] Contrasting fabrics, slashes, embroidery, applied trims, {{and other forms of}} surface ornamentation remained prominent. The wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders had reached its peak in the 1530s, and by mid-century a tall, narrow line with a V-shaped waist was back in fashion. [...] Sleeves and women's skirts then began to widen again, with emphasis at the shoulder that would continue into the next century. [...] The characteristic garment of the period was the ruff, which began as a modest ruffle attached to the <b>neckband</b> of a shirt or smock and grew into a separate garment of fine linen, trimmed with lace, cutwork or embroidery, and shaped into crisp, precise folds with starch and heated irons.|$|E
40|$|Bird strikes to {{aircraft}} are a serious economic and safety {{problem in the}} United States, annually causing {{millions of dollars in}} damage to civilian and military aircraft and the occasional loss of human life. We observed movements of 1236 <b>neckbanded</b> lesser Canada geese (Branta canadensis parvipes) to determine efficacy of hazing as a means to reduce goose presence at Elmendorf Air Force Base (EAFB), Anchorage, Alaska from August to October 1997. Emphasis was on movements of geese onto EAFB with additional data collected at the other two major airports in the area, Anchorage International Airport (AIA) and Merrill Field Airport (MFA). Daily observations indicated the presence of 208 individual <b>neckbanded</b> geese on EAFB, and 20 % returned more than once after being hazed from EAFB. We identified three staging areas, geese utilized prior to entering EAFB, and three post-hazing dispersal sites. Collared geese began moving onto EAFB 30 - 40 days post-molt with the largest proportions moving onto EAFB 70 - 90 days post-molt. We observed 75 <b>neckbanded</b> geese on AIA from seven molting sites, and 23 % returned more than once after being hazed from AIA. We observed 141 <b>neckbanded</b> geese on MFA from 14 molting sites, and 21 % returned more than once after being hazed from MFA. Our data indicated that as long as local goose populations increase, large numbers of Anchorage area geese are likely to enter one of the airports creating a variety of management problems. Hazed geese returning to airports multiple times present a special hazard to aircraft safety because they appear to have become habituated to non-lethal scare tactics. We recommend an integrated management approach to limit the Anchorage area goose population utilizing various control techniques which are acceptable to Anchorage residents while continuing the hazing program at area airports...|$|R

2500|$|Among {{the mysteries}} {{surrounding}} the timer fragment is how, when, and by whom, it was found. [...] "A lover and his lass" [...] found the fragment while strolling in the forest, {{according to one}} police {{source close to the}} case. A man found the fragment while walking his dog, according to another version. [...] Or, in yet another story from a former investigator, police found it while combing the ground on their hands and knees. The latter became the accepted version when evidence was given at the trial. Testimony indicated that on January 13, 1989, three weeks after the bombing, two Scottish detectives engaged in a line search in woods near Lockerbie came upon a piece of charred material, later identified as the <b>neckband</b> of a grey Slalom-brand shirt. Because of the charring, it was sent for analysis to the DERA forensic explosives laboratory at Fort Halstead in Kent. It was not until May 12, 1989, that Dr Thomas Hayes examined the charred material. He teased out the cloth and found within it fragments of white paper, fragments of black plastic, a fragment of metal and a fragment of wire mesh—all subsequently found to be fragments of a Toshiba RT-SF 16 and its manual. Dr Hayes testified that he also found embedded a half-inch fragment of green circuit board.|$|E
2500|$|The tallit gadol (Yiddish/Ashkenazic Hebrew tallis godoil; {{traditionally}} {{known as}} tallét gedolah among Sephardim), or [...] "large" [...] tallit, is worn over one's clothing {{resting on the}} shoulders. This is the prayer shawl that is worn during the morning services in synagogue by all male participants, and in many communities by {{the leader of the}} afternoon and evening prayers as well. The tallit gadol is usually woven of wool [...] especially among Ashkenazim. Some Spanish and Portuguese Jews use silk tallitot. The Portuguese Jewish community in The Netherlands has the tradition of decorating the corners of the Tallit. Today some tallitot are made of polyester and cotton. Tallitot may be of any colour but are usually white with black, blue or white stripes along the edge. Sizes of tallitot vary, and are a matter of custom and preference. Some are large enough to cover the whole body while others hang around the shoulders, the former being more common among Orthodox Jews, the latter among Conservative, Reform and other denominations. The <b>neckband</b> of the tallit, sometimes woven of silver or gold thread, is called the atarah which literally means crown but {{is often referred to as}} the collar. The tallit gadol is often kept in a dedicated pouch or cloth bag (often of velvet) which can be quite simple or ornately decorated.|$|E

6000|$|Martin {{learned to}} do many things. In {{the course of the}} first week, in one afternoon, he and Joe {{accounted}} for the two hundred white shirts. Joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which furnished the pressure. By this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and <b>neckband,</b> setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom. As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught them up and [...] "backed" [...] them. This task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was never}} an {{interval}} when something was not at hand to be done. Joe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from task to task. They starched two hundred white shirts, with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, <b>neckband,</b> yoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand. At the same moment the left hand held up {{the body of the}} shirt so that it would not enter the starch, and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starch--starch so hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of cold water.

60|$|Meanwhile Madhusadan the third, {{having taken}} a wallet and <b>neckband,</b> became a Jogi, {{and began to}} wander far and wide, living on nothing but chaff, and {{practicing}} his devotions. In order to see Brahma he attended to the following duties; 1. Hearing; 2. Meditation; 3. Fixing the Mind; 4. Absorbing the Mind. He combated the three evils, restlessness, injuriousness, voluptuousness by settling the Deity in his spirit, by subjecting his senses, and by destroying desire. Thus he would {{do away with the}} illusion (Maya) which conceals all true knowledge. He repeated the name of the Deity till it appeared to him {{in the form of a}} Dry Light or glory. Though connected with the affairs of life, that is, with affairs belonging to a body containing blood, bones, and impurities; to organs which are blind, palsied, and full of weakness and error; to a mind filled with thirst, hunger, sorrow, infatuation; to confirmed habits, and to the fruits of former births: still he strove not to view these things as realities. He made a companion of a dog, honouring it with his own food, so as the better to think on spirit. He practiced all the five operations connected with the vital air, or air collected in the body. He attended much to Pranayama, or the gradual suppression of breathing, and he secured fixedness of mind as follows. By placing his sight and thoughts on the tip of his nose he perceived smell; on the tip of his tongue he realized taste, on the root of his tongue he knew sound, and so forth. He practiced the eighty-four Asana or postures, raising his hand to the wonders of the heavens, till he felt no longer the inconveniences of heat or cold, hunger or thirst. He particularly preferred the Padma or lotus-posture, which consists of bringing the feet to the sides, holding the right in the left hand and the left in the right. In the work of suppressing his breath he permitted its respiration to reach at furthest twelve fingers' breadth, and gradually diminished the distance from his nostrils till he could confine it to the length of twelve fingers from his nose, and even after restraining it for some time he would draw it from no greater distance than from his heart. As respects time, he began by retaining inspiration for twenty-six seconds, and he enlarged this period gradually till he became perfect. He sat cross-legged, closing with his fingers all the avenues of inspiration, and he practiced Prityahara, or the power of restraining the members of the body and mind, with meditation and concentration, to which there are four enemies, viz., a sleepy heart, human passions, a confused mind, and attachment to anything but the one Brahma. He also cultivated Yama, that is, inoffensiveness, truth, honesty, the forsaking of all evil in the world, and the refusal of gifts except for sacrifice, and Nihama, i.e., purity relative to the use of water after defilement, pleasure in everything whether in prosperity or adversity, renouncing food when hungry, and keeping down the body. Thus delivered from these four enemies of the flesh, he resembled the unruffled flame of the lamp, and by Brahmagnana, or meditating on the Deity, placing his mind on the sun, moon, fire, or any other luminous body, or within his heart, or at the bottom of his throat, or in the centre of his skull, he was enabled to ascend from gross images of omnipotence to the works and the divine wisdom of the glorious original.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{simulate}} cerebral {{temperature behaviour}} with hypothermia treatment applying different cooling devices {{and to find}} the optimal brain temperature monitoring. Methods: Models based on hourly temperature values recorded in patients with severe aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, taking MRI data, thermal conductive properties, metabolism and blood flow into account were applied to different scenarios of hypothermia. Results: Systemic hypothermia by endovascular cooling leads to an uniform temperature decrease within the brain tissue. Cooling with head caps lead to 33 ◦C only in the superficial brain while the deep brain remains higher than 36 ◦C. Cooling with <b>neckbands</b> lead to 35. 8 ◦C for dry and 32. 8 ◦C for wet skin in the deep brain. Conclusions: With head caps temperatures below 36 ◦C cannot be reached in the deep brain tissue, whereas <b>neckbands,</b> covering the carotid triangles, may lead to hypothermic temperatures in the deep brain tissue. Temperature sensors have to be applied at least 2 cm below the cortical surface to give values representative for deep brain tissue...|$|R

40|$|The Barker model {{provides}} {{researchers with}} an opportunity to use three types of data for mark-recapture analyses - recaptures, recoveries, and resightings. This model structure maximizes use of encounter data and increases the precision of parameter estimates, provided the researcher has large amounts of resighting data. However, to our knowledge, this model has not been used for any published ringing studies. Our objective here is to report our use of the Barker model in covariate-dependent analyses that we conducted in Program MARK. In particular, we wanted to describe our experimental study design and discuss our analytical approach plus some logistical constraints we encountered while conducting a study of the effects of growth and parasites on survival of juvenile Ross's Geese. Birds were marked just before fledging, alternately injected with antiparasite drugs or a control, and then were re-encountered during migration and breeding in following years. Although the Barker model estimates seven parameters, our objectives focused on annual survival only, thus we considered all other parameters as nuisance terms. Therefore, we simplified our model structures by maintaining biological complexity on survival, while retaining a very basic structure on nuisance parameters. These analyses were conducted in a two-step approach where we used the most parsimonious model from nuisance parameter analyses as our starting model for analyses of covariate effects. This analytical approach also allowed us to minimize the long CPU times {{associated with the use of}} covariates in earlier versions of Program MARK. Resightings made up about 80 % of our encounter history data, and simulations demonstrated that precision and bias of parameter estimates were minimally affected by this distribution. Overall, the main source of bias was that smaller goslings were too small to retain <b>neckbands,</b> yet were the birds that we predicted would have the lowest survival probability and highest probability for parasite effects. Consequently, we considered our results conservative. The largest constraint of our study design was the inability to partition survival into biologically meaningful periods to provide insight into the timing and mechanisms of mortality. ...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{inception}} in 2002, Kari Traa AS, created by the Olympic skier Kari Traa, has experienced great success. Starting out with just toques, it now has an extensive product line. It has become the market leader for base layers in Scandinavia, and its products are now sold in 11 countries. Kari Traa AS is in now the planning phase of entering the Canadian market. The aim of this report {{is to examine the}} market potential for Kari Traa AS in Canada; for this, the team has developed the following research question: “Is it possible and attractive for KT to introduce its main products (wool base layers, technical base layers, toques, headbands and <b>neckbands,</b> socks, fleece and outerwear) to the Canadian market, and if so, which are the most suitable entry strategies”. When starting, NorCan Consulting had limited prior knowledge of the Canadian market. To answer the research problem, it was therefore necessary to perform both primary and secondary research. After an introduction and internal scan of Kari Traa AS, the report describes external factors that the company needs to be aware of when entering Canada. Further, the report provides insight into the Canadian market in terms of retailing trends, and the snowsport market. In addition, the results from the team’s survey are presented, and KT’s direct competitors are analysed. Based on this, the team made an estimation of the market size. The internal and external scan are then reviewed in a situation summary. Finally, a strategy is developed for a nationwide entry, and marketing tactics Kari Traa AS can use, are proposed. The team believes Kari Traa AS’ products will be attractive in the Canadian market, since they differentiate themselves from the competitors. The entry strategy the team proposed for Kari Traa AS is to sign a license-agreement. The team sees this as the most suitable option for Kari Traa AS...|$|R
40|$|An {{ecological}} {{study on the}} Morgan Creek and the East Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho, Bighorn Sheep herds was conducted from July 1, 1966 to February 28, 1970. The Morgan Creek population numbered about 100 animals upon termination of the study. The trend of this population was downward. The East Fork population numbered about 50 animals and the trend appeared to be stable or slightly downward. Productivity of both herds was low. Lamb mortality was high and recruitment to the breeding herd low. Low recruitment rates coupled with hunting pressure caused a decl ine in the ram component of both herds. The lungworm-pneumonia complex and scabies mites localized in the ears were common disease-parasite problems for bighorns on the Morgan Creek and East Fork ranges. Poor nutrition was postulated {{as the reason for}} endemic disease and parasite problems. Cougars, coyotes, bobcats and eagles were evaluated as mortaility factors. Evidence did not indicate that any of these were a serious limiting factor. Accidents and poaching also were evaluated as mortal ity factors, but {{it was not possible to}} determine the extent to which they contributed to mortality. Food habits of bighorns and deer were studied on the Morgan Creek winter range. Bighorns were found to use 69 percent grasses, 27 percent browse and 4 percent forbs. The primary grass utilized was Agropyron spicatum 11 anditfie primary browse was Cercocarpus ledifollus. Considerable competition for forage existed between deer and bighorns. Competition did not occur between bighorns and elk or antelope. Domestic livestock use has converted most of the range in the vicinity of Challis to sagebrush, which is not quality bighorn habitat. Deer numbers have greatly increased because of the habitat change. Livestock now compete with bighorns for the limited amount of remaining grass and deer compete by decimating the mountain mahogany (C. ledifolius. Shortage of protein during the winter is a serious problem for bighorns. Winter range rehabilitation, consisting of sagebrush eradication and accompanied by reduction of deer and domestic livestock usage, is suggested to restore ranges for the benefit of bighorns. Transplanting of bighorns to suitable areas historically inhabited by bighorns is suggested to increase bighorn distribution in Idaho and to stabilize current statewide downward trends In bighorn numbers until winter range rehabilitation problems can be solved. Breeding occurred in November and December, and lambing in May and June. Twinning did not occur. Several trapping methods were evaluated and a total of 43 bighorns were trapped, Of these, 7 were transplanted, 7 were instrumented with radio transmitters, 23 were <b>neckbanded</b> and 6 accidently killed. Morgan Creek bighorn sheep migrated an average of 22. 4 airline miles to summer ranges. The shortest migration was 19 miles and the longest 28. 5 miles. East Fork bighorns were found to migrate about 17 airline mi les to summer range. Analysis of winter range indicated a canopy coverage of 34 percent for shrubs, forbs and grasses, 42 percent bare soll and erosion pavement and 24 percent natural rock. Forage production was low at 128 to 669 pounds/acre green weight, Big sagebrush contributed 40 percent of the herbage production. Usage on all sites was moderate to excessive. Erosion was very evident, and range condition trend estimated to be downward. Only about 805 percent of the 16, 676 acres of winter range within the Morgan Creek study area was quality habitat avai lable to bighorns during most winters. Sagebrush, little used by bighorns, dominated 56 percent of the winter range. Grasses, indicative of quality bighorn habitat, dominated only 17 percent of the winter range. Idaho 2 ̆ 7 s statewide bighorn sheep populations have decreased approximately 50 percent since 1960. Ram components have decreased about 85 percent since 1960. Increased numbers of hunters have harvested fewer rams under the two-week open season 3 / 4 -curl regulation and the point of diminishing returns has begun to operate. Depresslng the ram component below an undetermined level may interfere with reproduction. Therefore, a limited harvest by control led permit regulations and controlled distribution of hunters is recommended...|$|R
