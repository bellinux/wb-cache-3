2500|$|Reasons {{for getting}} {{involved}} in swinging are the variety of sexual partners and experiences, pleasure or excitement, meeting new people and voyeurism (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). In order for swinging to work, both partners {{need to have a}} liberal sexual predisposition, and a low degree of jealously. Interestingly enough, extramarital sex, with both partners being aware and consenting, can have positive effects on the relationship (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). Gilmartin (1975) found that 85 percent of his sample of swingers felt that these sexual encounters posed no real threat to their marriage and felt it had improved. [...] Jenks (1998) found {{no reason to believe that}} swinging was detrimental to marriage, with over 91% of males and 82% of females indicating they were happy with swinging (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). [...] However it is important to note that although there is no current research to point that this type of extramarital sex does not affect the majority of marriages in a negative way, there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are marriages that are negatively affected (Jenks, 1998).|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} made known that young {{children}} with behavioral problems show poor verbal ability and executive functions. [...] The exact distinction between parenting style {{and the importance of}} family structure on child development is still somewhat unclear. [...] However, in infancy and early childhood, parenting is among the most critical external influences on child reactivity. [...] In Mahoney’s study of maternal communication, results indicated that the way mothers interacted with their children accounted for almost 25% of variability in children’s rate of development. [...] Every child is unique, making parenting an emotional challenge that should be most closely related to the child’s level of emotional self-regulation (persistence, frustration and compliance). [...] A promising approach that is currently being investigated amid intellectually disabled children and their parents is responsive teaching. [...] Responsive teaching is an early intervention curriculum designed to address the cognitive, language, and social needs of young children with developmental problems. [...] Based on the principle of “active learning”, responsive teaching is a method that is currently being applauded as adaptable for individual caregivers, children and their combined needs [...] The effect of parenting styles on the development of children is an important area of research that seems to be forever ongoing and altering. [...] There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a prominent link between parental interaction and child development but the best child rearing technique continues to vary amongst experts.|$|E
