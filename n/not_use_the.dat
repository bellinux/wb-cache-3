5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E

5|$|As the Doctor is a pacifist and did <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> guns {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic screwdriver, but as this was often used as a skeleton key in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{a popular}} protest flag, {{the leaders of}} the Umbrella Movement {{requested}} that participants of the movement <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> flag, as they intended to protest without intentionally provoking Chinese authorities or the Hong Kong Police Force.

5|$|Governments do <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> terms {{profit and}} loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E

Śvētāmbara text, Sutrakritanga contains references to Vibhagyavāda, which, according to Hermann Jacobi, {{is the same as}} syādvāda and saptibhaṅgī. For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted vibhagyavada as syadvada, the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain canonical text Sutrakritanga. However, the Digambara Jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic.|$|E

5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> usual hunting tactics.
