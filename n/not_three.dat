5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, the molars are pentalophodont (have the mesolophs and mesolophids, {{accessory}} crests, well developed) and bunodont, with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests. The cusps on the upper molars are arranged in two longitudinal series, <b>not</b> <b>three</b> as in the black and brown rats. The front cusps of the first upper and lower molar (anterocone and anteroconid, respectively) are broad and not divided completely by an anteromedian flexus or flexid. Behind the anterocone, the anteroloph (a smaller crest) is complete and separated from the anterocone. On both {{the second and third}} lower molars, the anterolophid (a crest on the inner front corner) is present, a putative synapomorphy of the genus. The first molars have additional small roots in addition to the main ones, so that the upper first molar has four and the lower has three or four roots.|$|E

5|$|Despite Toronto's {{improved}} defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely {{missed in}} the first-round {{series against the}} second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals. Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit. With 10.7 {{seconds left in the}} game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play, instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, <b>not</b> <b>three.</b> The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds. Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.|$|E
5|$|Some {{players who}} participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into the NFL Draft, either because they hoped to finish their {{education}} or because they were <b>not</b> <b>three</b> years removed from their high school graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. Examples of these players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, but who was taken with the first overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars {{have two}} {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps, <b>not</b> <b>three</b> {{as in the}} black and brown rats. The first and second upper molars are oval in form and the flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars. The anterocone, the front cusp of the upper first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (anteromedian flexus), but does display a hollow in the middle, the anteromedian fossette, which divides it into separate cuspules at the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molar. A crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the labial cuspule, but in older animals, the cusps and the crest are united into a single structure by wear. In the third upper molar, the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar usually has another small labial root.|$|E

However they were briefly seen in the N.E.S.T headquarters in their vehicle modes in the film.|$|E
500|$|The Chinese {{had long}} taken an {{interest}} in examining the human body. For example, in 16 AD the Xin Dynasty usurper Wang Mang called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses. Shen also took interest in human anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing, [...] "When liquid and solid are imbibed together, {{how can it be}} that in one's mouth they sort themselves into two throat channels?" [...] Shen maintained that the larynx {{was the beginning of a}} system that distributed vital qi from the air throughout the body, and that the esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach. Following Shen's reasoning and correcting the findings of the dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th-century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen's belief in two throat valves, <b>not</b> <b>three.</b> [...] Also, the later Song Dynasty judge and early forensic expert Song Ci (1186–1249) would promote the use of autopsy in order to solve homicide cases, as written in his Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified.|$|E
500|$|The {{scale of}} the game was much reduced from the earlier concept, {{focusing}} primarily on Dagoth Ur and a smaller area of land. It was decided that the game world would be populated using the methods the team had developed in Redguard; that is, the game objects would be crafted by hand, rather than generated using the random algorithmic methods of Arena and Daggerfall. By 2000, Morrowind was to be unequivocally a single-player game, with no chance of multiplayer extension. In the words of Pete Hines, Bethesda's Director of Marketing and PR: [...] "No. Not on release, <b>not</b> <b>three</b> months after, no no no." [...] The project, despite the reduced scale, became a massive investment. According to the team's reasonings, the endeavor took [...] "close to 100 man-years to create". To accomplish this feat, Bethesda tripled their staff and spent {{their first year of}} development on The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, allowing the game staff to easily balance the game and to modify it in small increments rather than large. According to project leader Todd Howard, the Construction Set came {{as the result of a}} communal yearning to develop a [...] "role-playing operating system", capable of extension and modification, rather than a particular type of game. Despite the additional staff, designer Ken Rolston would later state that, compared to Oblivion, Morrowind had a small design team.|$|E

500|$|Some of Strang's teachings {{differed}} substantially {{from those}} of other Latter Day Saint leaders, including Joseph Smith. [...] For instance, Strang rejected the traditional Christian doctrines of the Trinity and the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ, together with the Mormon doctrine of [...] "plurality of gods." [...] A monotheist, he insisted that there was but one eternal God of all the universe, the Father, and that [...] "progression to godhood" [...] (a doctrine allegedly taught by Joseph Smith {{toward the end of}} his life) was impossible. [...] God had always been God, said Strang, and He was but one Person and <b>not</b> <b>three,</b> as in the traditional Christian Trinity. [...] Jesus Christ was presented as the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph, who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents (rather than being the offspring of the Father or the Holy Spirit) to fulfill his Messianic role. [...] Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence [...] "adopted" [...] as God's son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the Transfiguration. [...] After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his resurrection and ascension.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Joseph Carey Merrick was born, apparently healthy, {{and had no}} outward {{symptoms of}} any disorder {{for the first few}} years of his life. Named after his father, he was given the middle name Carey by his mother, a Baptist, after the preacher William Carey. The Merricks had two more children <b>not</b> <b>three</b> as stated on his mothers grave,John Thomas (born 21 April 1864 did indeed die of smallpox 24 July of the same year) but he was not related to Joseph and Mary Jane [...] Merrick. William Arthur (born January 1866) who died of scarlet fever on 21 December 1870 aged four and was buried on Christmas Day 1870. William is buried with his Mother, aunts and uncles in Welford Road Cemetery in Leicester. Marian Eliza (born 28 September 1867), who was born with physical disabilities and died of myelitis and [...] "seizures" [...] on 19 March 1891 aged 24. Marian is buried with her father in Belgrave Cemetery in Leicester. When writing of in his book The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity, Ashley Montagu states that [...] " [...] Merrick was born on 21 April 1864". Montagu believed Treves's statement in his book The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences that Merrick's first name was John, not Joseph, and confused him with his younger brother, a child which has now been proved was not related to Joseph Merrick.|$|E
