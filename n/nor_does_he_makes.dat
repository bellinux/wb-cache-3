60|$|The {{two boys}} knelt beside their {{unconscious}} chum {{and did what}} they could to revive him. But Songbird did not open his eyes, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any other sound than a low moan.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{he replied}} quietly, and watched Leslie mowing. The latter who was wonderfully ready at everything, was doing fairly well, {{but he had}} not the invincible sweep of the other, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> the same crisp {{crunching}} music.|$|R
6000|$|Chingachgook {{very quietly}} resumed his seat; <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any reply, {{until after he}} had {{examined}} the firebrand which had been struck by the bullet that had nearly proved fatal to himself. After which, he was content to reply, holding a single finger up to view, with the English monosyllable,-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{soon found}} that his manner was more than ordinarily kind to her; and there was {{moreover}} something about him which seemed to make him sparkle with contentment, but he said no word about Frank, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any allusion to the business which had taken him up to town.|$|R
2500|$|King {{did not do}} {{detailed}} preliminary {{drawings for}} his lithographs. <b>Nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> an artist’s print when printing them. Rather, he printed the whole edition in one colour, then added other colours in subsequent print runs until “the print says it is finished ... At some stage, {{the work of art}} takes over and I have to understand it.” ...|$|R
50|$|Silencer has no superhuman abilities. His uniform {{contains}} a device which nullifies all sonic energy within his vicinity. Hence, <b>he</b> cannot speak, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any noise as he moves. He is also {{equipped with a}} semi-automatic German Luger pistol, which in turn does not make any noise either. Silencer's uniform is insulated, making him immune to electronic attacks.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} {{seemed very}} simple and natural," [...] said Mrs. Hale, slightly drawing her pretty lips together. [...] "He did not wear his trousers rolled {{up over his}} boots {{in the company of}} ladies, as you're <b>doing</b> now, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> his first appearance in this house with such a hat as you wore this morning, or I should not have admitted him." ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the album's release, rapper The Game was just placed in G-Unit, {{therefore}} he is not photographed, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> an appearance on the album. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> however <b>make</b> cameos in the videos for singles Wanna Get To Know You & Poppin' Them Thangs. He is also mentioned in Poppin' Them Thangs when Young Buck raps, [...] "You ain't no Crip like Snoop, / You ain't no Blood like Game." ...|$|R
5000|$|A widely {{circulated}} email titled [...] "Think Before You Donate" [...] aims {{to convince}} readers that “Goodwill CEO and Owner Mark Curran profits $2.3 million a year", but fact-checking groups have debunked {{the content of}} the email: the CEO of Goodwill Industries International is not Mark Curran, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> $2.3 million a year. The current President and CEO of Goodwill is Jim Gibbons, who in 2014 received a total reported compensation of $689,418.|$|R
60|$|What {{little power}} of {{fighting}} there {{had ever been}} in Cousin Henry had now been altogether knocked out of him. He attempted no further struggle, uttered no denial, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any answer {{to the words of}} abuse which Mr Apjohn had heaped on his head. He too raised himself from the floor, slowly collecting his limbs together, and seated himself in the chair nearest at hand, hiding his face with his hand.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any {{complaint}} to Lopez {{as to what}} had been done, or even allude to the dinner. But {{when he had been}} back about a week he announced to his son-in-law his final determination as to money. [...] "I had better tell you, Lopez, what I mean to do, so that you may not be left in doubt. I shall not intrust any further sum of money into your hands on behalf of Emily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{rather like}} the letter, {{considering}} who wrote it," [...] observed Mr Crossley, laying it down after a fourth perusal. [...] "You see <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> no whining or discontented reference to the hardness of their luck, which young scapegraces are so fond of doing; <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> effusive professions of regret or repentance, which hypocrites are so prone to do. I think it bears the stamp of being genuine {{on the face of}} it. At least it appears to be straightforward." ...|$|R
50|$|Despite a {{standout}} college career, Harvey was never drafted to the National Basketball Association, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>make</b> a final roster.Harvey has a short passage from Philippos Thessaloniki during 1990-91 season.|$|R
5000|$|In some traditions, {{a bishop}} {{may choose to}} {{celebrate}} the Liturgy [...] "as a priest"; meaning <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not vest in full episcopal vestments, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> use of the dikirion and trikirion (episcopal candlesticks). Instead of the sakkos he wears a priestly phelonion, with only the small omophorion on his shoulders and the epigonation at his side. The bishop will in this instance, as always, wear his Panagia enkolpion, and will stand on the eagle rug. Moreover, certain ceremonial practices are not observed as they would be for a full hierarchal service.|$|R

50|$|Jimerson {{made his}} major league debut on September 14, 2005, {{appearing}} {{as a defensive}} replacement in a 10-2 win against the Florida Marlins; <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not record an out, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> a plate appearance. He was called up again after the roster expansion {{at the end of}} the 2006 season. When he pinch-hit for Roger Clemens in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 4, 2006, he hit a home run in his first major league at-bat. Jimerson was released from the Astros on March 28, 2007, four days after he was outrighted to the Double-A Corpus Christi Hooks.|$|R
50|$|On 31 August 2005, Poom {{was signed}} by Arsenal on loan as {{temporary}} cover for Jens Lehmann and Manuel Almunia. The move was made permanent on 23 January 2006. He was Arsenal's third-choice keeper, and did not play a single match in the 2005-06 season. However, {{he became the first}} Estonian to receive a Champions League runners-up medal after Arsenal lost to Barcelona in the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Poom <b>did</b> not play <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> the substitutes' bench for the final, but was in Arsenal's 25-man European squad, each of whom won a silver medal.|$|R
5000|$|A {{question}} that is important in judging the integrity of this pope is whether he made use of the forged pseudo-Isidorian papal decretals. After exhaustive investigation, Schrörs has decided that the pope was neither acquainted with the pseudo-Isidorian collection in its entire extent, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> use of its individual parts. He perhaps had a general knowledge of the false decretals, but did not base {{his view of the}} law upon them and owed his knowledge of them solely to documents that came to him from the Frankish Empire [...] "Papst Nikolaus I. und Pseudo-Isidor".|$|R
60|$|I {{can easily}} {{believe that a}} girl should be taught to wish to love by reading how Laura Bell loved Pendennis. Pendennis was not in truth a very worthy man, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> a very good husband; but the girl's love was so beautiful, and the wife's love when she became a wife so womanlike, {{and at the same}} time so sweet, so unselfish, so wifely, so worshipful,--in the sense in which wives are told that they ought to worship their husband,--that I cannot believe that any girl can be injured, or even not benefited, by reading of Laura's love.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of the day the old chief had several private {{consultations}} with the guide, and showed evident signs of being occupied with some mysterious matter of mighty import. What it was, Captain Bonneville could not fathom, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> much effort to do so. From some casual sentences that he overheard, he perceived that it was something from which the old man promised himself much satisfaction, and to which he attached a little vainglory but which he wished to keep a secret; so he suffered him to spin out his petty plans unmolested.|$|R
6000|$|... "I would {{well that}} I {{had to carry}} all the sort of you," [...] said the boat- master, for I had offered him my horse, and a great reward in money, part down, and the other part to be paid when I set foot in England. <b>Nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any tarrying, but, taking his nets on board, {{as if he would}} be about his lawful business, set sail, with his two sons for a crew. The east wind served us to a miracle, and, after as fair a passage as might be, they landed me under cloud of night not far from the great port of Winchelsea.|$|R
30|$|In {{the second}} place, and in {{opposition}} to his celebrated contemporaries (Cragg is only three years older than Guyton), this Voodoo Man—who had an academic training—does not work for museums or collectors (either directly or by means of exhibitions of documents and photos, as in land art works). <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not really work for anyone (though he uses his fame of course to get little installations into museums). Maybe for his neighborhood. <b>Nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> works for the street, as in nineteenth century monuments, but <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> them {{in the street and}} with the street: in abandoned houses and with the neighbors’ contributions and the collaboration of children and other spontaneous “artists”.|$|R
3000|$|... “Besides a {{religious}} bigot mistakes the spiritual {{descriptions of the}} size etc {{of the body of}} the Jina and also those of the gorgeous decorations of the assembly halls where the Jina held congregations for the real descriptions of the Jina himself and his intelligence is so much engrossed in these externals that he neither knows the real nature of the Jina <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> sincere effort to comprehend it. A bigot, not knowing the metaphysical meaning of the scriptural descriptions of heaven and hell, take them as revealed knowledge. He also thinks that salvation can only come to him by his staunch adherence to his own religious opinion and adopted dress” Digish (1991).|$|R
5000|$|Margai {{was very}} popular among Sierra Leoneans {{during his time}} in power, most known for his self-effacement. He was neither corrupt <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> a lavish display of his power or status. He based the {{government}} on {{the rule of law}} and the separation of powers, with multiparty political institutions and fairly viable representative structures. Margai used his conservative ideology to lead Sierra Leone without much strife. He appointed government officials to represent various ethnic groups. Margai employed a brokerage style of politics, by sharing political power among political parties and interest groups; and with the powerful paramount chiefs in the provinces, most of whom were key allies of his government [...]|$|R
2500|$|Carter {{was criticized}} {{by his own}} aides for not having a [...] "grand plan" [...] for the {{recovery}} of the economy, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>make</b> any campaign promises; he often criticized Reagan's economic recovery plan, but did not create one of his own in response.|$|R
5000|$|Nixon {{went on to}} {{gain the}} nomination. At the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Romney refused to release his delegates to Nixon. [...] Romney {{finished}} a weak fifth, with only 50 votes on the roll call (44 of Michigan's 48, plus six from Utah). [...] When party moderates and others expressed dismay at Nixon's choice of Spiro Agnew as his vice-presidential running mate, Romney's name was placed into nomination and pushed by several delegations. [...] Romney said <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not initiate the move, but <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> an effort to oppose it. [...] In any case, he lost to Agnew 1,119-186. [...] Romney worked for Nixon's eventually successful campaign in the fall, which did earn him Nixon's gratitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Captain" [...] took scant {{notice of}} his comings and goings. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{not attempt to}} help him off with his coat, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> an effort to add another log to the fire. He sat silent and {{practically}} motionless, save when {{from time to time}} he took a sip out of his mug of ale. But whenever the new-comer came within his immediate circle of vision he shot a glance at the latter's elegant attire--the well-cut coat, the striped waistcoat, the boots of fine leather--the glance was quick and comprehensive and full of scorn, a flash that lasted only an instant and was at once veiled again by the droop of the flaccid lids which hid the pale, keen eyes.|$|R
50|$|While Louis Wu {{was raised}} by Beowulf Shaeffer, in the first Ringworld novel Louis seems not to know who Shaeffer is, <b>nor</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any {{reference}} to his relation to Carlos upon encountering the same autodoc in the later Ringworld novels. As the Known Space universe continued to grow in complexity with each newly published story, Louis' own backstory was increasingly retconned {{to fit in with}} this continuity. This is also probably why Louis never reflected on the obviously-traumatic events in his childhood that took place on Fafnir. This might also be explained as Louis simply being tight-lipped about certain aspects of his personal history, a trait he shared with both his biological father Carlos and his adoptive father Beowulf.|$|R
60|$|The days slipped along, and {{he slept}} eight hours {{regularly}} every night. Though now, {{while waiting for}} more checks, he ate in the Japanese restaurants where meals were served for ten cents, his wasted body filled out, as did the hollows in his cheeks. He no longer abused himself with short sleep, overwork, and overstudy. He wrote nothing, and the books were closed. He walked much, out in the hills, and loafed long hours in the quiet parks. He had no friends <b>nor</b> acquaintances, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any. <b>He</b> had no inclination. He was waiting for some impulse, from he knew not where, to put his stopped life into motion again. In the meantime his life remained run down, planless, and empty and idle.|$|R
60|$|One of Griffith's briefest {{notes in}} his largest hand {{announced}} that he had accepted various invitations to country houses, for cricket matches, archery meetings, and the like; <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> even <b>make</b> it clear where his address would be, except that he would be with a friend in Scotland when grouse-shooting began.|$|R
6000|$|Once {{free from}} the trammelling fascinations of Sophy and the more {{dangerous}} espionage of Madame Eclair, and with {{the object of his}} mission accomplished, Mr. Hamlin recovered his natural spirits, and became so hilarious that Olly, who attributed this exaltation to his interview with Sophy, felt constrained to make some disparaging remarks about that young lady, partly by way of getting even with her for her recent interference, and partly in obedience to some well known but unexplained law of the sex. To her great surprise, however, Mr. Hamlin's spirits were in no way damped, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any attempt to defend his Lalage. Nevertheless, he listened attentively, and when she had concluded he looked suddenly down upon her chip hat and thick yellow tresses, and said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Hawthorne did not {{set himself}} to [...] "compete with life." [...] <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>make</b> the effort--the proverbially tedious effort--to say everything. To his mind, fiction was not a mirror of commonplace persons, {{and he was not}} the analyst of the minutest among their {{ordinary}} emotions. <b>Nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> a moral, or social, or political purpose the end and aim of his art. Moral as many of his pieces naturally are, we cannot call them didactic. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not expect, <b>nor</b> intend, to better people by them. He drew the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale without hoping that his Awful Example would persuade readers to [...] "make a clean breast" [...] of their iniquities and their secrets. It was the moral situation that interested him, not the edifying effect of his picture of that situation upon the minds of novel-readers.|$|R
50|$|The {{controversy}} about who actually directed Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam has {{increased over the}} years. Since the film is characteristic of Guru Dutt's feel and style, {{it is difficult to}} think that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not direct the film. However Guru Dutt never denied Abrar Alvi's role in the film <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any counter claims when Alvi won the Filmfare Award for Best Director for the film. Abrar Alvi has stated that Guru Dutt did direct the songs in the film, but not the film in its entirety. The editor of the film Y.G. Chawan however says that for the film it was Abrar who sat with him. To quote him...Abrar worked so hard on that film but he never got any credit. People say it was produced by Guru Dutt so it had to be Guru Dutt's film.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} and {{they were on the}} bank, and Leonard's {{declaration}} remained unspoken. <b>Nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any attempt to renew it. It seemed to him that Juanna had built a wall between them which he could not climb. From that evening forward her whole attitude towards him changed. She no longer angered him by bitter words; indeed, she was gentleness itself, and nothing could be kindlier or more friendly and open than her manner, but there it began and ended. Once or twice, indeed, he attempted some small advance, with the result that instantly she seemed to freeze--to become cold and hard as marble. He could not understand her, he feared her somewhat, and his pride took alarm. At the least he could keep his feelings to himself, he need not expose them to be trampled upon by this incomprehensible girl.|$|R

50|$|Lane {{had taken}} a land claim of 1 sq mi located just north of Roseburg, Oregon, in 1851. He later {{purchased}} a 2000 acre ranch located about 11 mi east of that town, which he owned {{for a number of}} years before selling to a son. Lane also constructed a home overlooking the South Umpqua River; after his Senate term, he retired there in 1861. Although openly sympathetic to the Southern rebellion in the Civil War, Lane remained home on his ranch and did not participate in the fighting, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> a return to politics after that date. Lane has been accused of keeping a personal slave as late as 1878, an assumption based on the race of the African-Indian orphan he raised from the age of two to seventeen.Lane was baptized as a Roman Catholic in 1867, but renounced that faith before his death.|$|R
