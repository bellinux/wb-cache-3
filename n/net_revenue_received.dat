The study uses a multivariate regression model to investigate how climate change will affect crop revenue in Ethiopia. A total of 425 subsistence farmers from 17 sub-districts in Tigray region were interviewed in six survey rounds from 1997 to 2010 to form a panel. Analysis involved regressing <b>net</b> <b>revenue</b> per unit area on climate (rainfall), soil and household characteristics to assess the significance of their impact on <b>net</b> <b>revenue</b> per unit area. Our results indicated that marginally increasing precipitation in the pre-growth season increased revenue by US$ 0. 04 /ha while marginally increasing main season precipitation increased revenue by US$ 0. 02 /ha. Variation of monthly precipitation from the mean in the production year {{had no effect on}} <b>net</b> <b>revenue</b> and the drought in 2002 reduced <b>net</b> crop <b>revenue</b> by 52 %. The study went ahead to examine the economic implication of climate change by assessing how <b>net</b> <b>revenue</b> changes with five uniform climate change scenarios. The climate scenarios used include reducing precipitation by 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %. The last two scenarios represent drought conditions.
