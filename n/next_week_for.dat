At Las Vegas, Harvick held off Martin Truex, Jr. to win his first race of the season. It was also his first win at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Harvick won again the very <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> his fourth straight win at Phoenix and a record seventh win at the track overall. At Auto Club, Harvick managed to finish second, this time to Brad Keselowski. This brought his streak of Top 2 finishes to eight races overall. It appeared Harvick was on track to tie Richard Petty for most straight Top 2 finishes, but this streak {{came to an end}} with an eighth-place finish at Martinsville.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{struggled}} {{during the}} early portion of the 2012 season, despite a pole at Talladega, failing {{to reach the top}} ten in points. At Pocono, Gordon took advantage of teammate Jimmie Johnson's right-rear tire failure on a late restart just immediately before an expected large thunderstorm rained onto the track, thus giving him his 86th Cup victory and sixth at the track, surpassing Elliott for the most wins at the track. At Richmond, despite troubles early in the race that mired him a lap down, Gordon rallied to finish second to Clint Bowyer, and made his eighth Chase for the Sprint Cup. At the November Phoenix race, Gordon was running near the front until Bowyer again made contact and forced him into the wall. Gordon then cut a tire when trying to retaliate and was penalized with a black-flag for both his attempt at retaliation and failing to come down pit road to fix his tire. In reply to the black-flag Gordon retaliated by intentionally wrecking Bowyer, collecting Joey Logano and Aric Almirola in the process thus ending Bowyer's hopes to win the Cup title. The two crews began brawling while a furious Bowyer climbed out of his car. Bowyer frantically sprinted to Gordon's hauler, but he was restrained by officials just in front of Gordon. Gordon was fined $100,000, docked 25 points, and placed on probation until December 31. He recovered from his penalty by winning the season finale, the Ford EcoBoost 400, the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> the 87th Sprint Cup victory of his career.|$|E

Though he was the only supervisor to vote against Milk's gay rights ordinance earlier that year, he had been quoted as saying, [...] "I respect the rights of all people, including gays". Milk and White at first got along well. One of White's political aides (who was gay) remembered, [...] "Dan had more in common with Harvey than he did with anyone else on the board".

The song, Rihanna's sixth number-two song on the UK Singles Chart, rose to number one the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> two {{consecutive}} weeks. It was Rihanna's fourth UK number-one single, following [...] "Umbrella" [...] (2007), [...] "Take a Bow" [...] (2008) and [...] "Run This Town" [...] (2009).

500|$|A quad {{strain in}} February 2010 curtailed Watts' pre-season, and a {{subsequent}} back injury further slowed down his {{preparation for the}} season. He was placed on a modified program, which meant he was unlikely {{to play in the}} AFL early in the season, instead easing him into VFL matches. He played his first match for the year in a VFL practice match against the Northern Bullants; he gathered nine disposals, playing in just {{the first half of the}} match. Round five in the VFL saw him kick four goals and he was named in the best players in the seventy-five point win against Coburg. His performance in the match saw him called up to the AFL side the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> the round eight match against [...] at the MCG. The match drew attention as it was the first time he would play an AFL match against Nic Naitanui, who was drafted with the pick directly after him in the 2008 draft. In the twenty-nine point loss, he recorded fifteen disposals and five marks.|$|E

500|$|Watts {{retained}} {{his spot}} the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> the round nine match against [...] at TIO Stadium in Darwin, and kicked two early goals {{to help the}} club win by one point. He maintained his spot in the side {{for the remainder of}} the year, even after recording just three disposals against [...] in round eleven, with the club opting to give him game time and reiterate he was a long-term prospect who would get better with time. He played fifteen games in his second season, kicking ten goals, with former Essendon forward and three-time Coleman Medallist, Matthew Lloyd, stating Watts would be [...] "ecstatic" [...] with his season and he [...] "presented across half-forward so well and is building his body and engine to hold down that position for a sustained period for Melbourne". Shane Crawford, the 1999 Brownlow Medallist, noted he had improved that year and showed enough glimpses to predict he would be a top ten player in the competition in the next few years. A club post-season trip to China saw Watts play in an exhibition match against Brisbane known as the Shanghai Showdown; played at Jiangwan Stadium, Melbourne won the match by five points.|$|E
500|$|After {{having an}} [...] "impressive performance" [...] {{playing for the}} Casey Scorpions in the VFL {{the week before the}} first round of the AFL season, Watts was named in the round one team for the match against Brisbane at the MCG. Struggling in the forward-line during {{pre-season}} matches, he instead started the match playing on the wing and finished with seventeen disposals. Playing the first five matches for the season, he struggled for consistency and was subsequently dropped for the round six match against Geelong at Simonds Stadium. With Neeld claiming Watts [...] "had a few things [...] to work on", he played on the wing in the VFL where he kicked four goals and recorded twenty disposals and nine marks in the forty-six point win against [...] in round seven. He stayed in the reserves the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> the fifty-two point win against the [...] and collected twenty-five disposals. His performances in the VFL saw him recalled to the senior side for the 101-point loss against [...] at the Sydney Cricket Ground in round eight; he played the match as the loose man in defence and recorded a career-high thirty-four disposals, in addition to eleven marks, eight rebound-50s and fourteen intercept possessions, the second most by any player that season to that point.|$|E
500|$|Two weeks later, {{he played}} his 100th AFL match in the sixty-eight point loss to Fremantle at the MCG in round five, {{a game in}} which he managed just seven disposals; after his {{milestone}} match he was condemned by Matthew Lloyd on the Nine Network's Footy Classified, saying [...] "he's been gifted 100 games of AFL football". In the thirty-eight point loss against Sydney at the MCG the next week, he started as the substitute with Paul Roos attempting to ease the burden on Watts, although Roos later admitted starting as the substitute probably increased pressure on Watts. The relentless pressure on Watts saw him omitted the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> the round seven match against , although it initially appeared he was dropped by the coaching panel, it was later revealed by Paul Roos that Watts asked to be dropped so he could find form playing in the VFL. Leigh Matthews described Watts' decision to drop himself as a shock because it never happened in his twenty years of coaching and he found it difficult to take seriously. Recording twenty-four disposals, eight marks and a goal in the VFL, his performance was described as [...] "solid" [...] by AFL Media journalist, Peter Ryan and he was recalled to the senior side after the one week in the VFL for the thirty-nine point win against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG.|$|E

500|$|With the Queen's Birthday match {{marketed as}} the club's biggest match during the year, then-senior coach, Dean Bailey, {{promoted}} {{the debut of}} Watts by imploring fans to come along so they [...] "will look back {{at this time in}} three, four or five years to see where it all began {{and to be able to}} say I was there the day Jack Watts made his debut". His first touch saw him gang tackled by three Collingwood players, another contest saw him beaten by Martin Clarke, which led to a Collingwood goal; Collingwood captain, Nick Maxwell, gestured to Watts [...] "that's your goal, mate! Welcome to real footy". The team ultimately lost by sixty-six points with Watts recording just eight disposals, a mark and a behind, playing on the half-forward line. He retained his spot the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> a forty-eight point loss against [...] at Etihad Stadium in which he kicked his first AFL goal. Recording nine disposals in his second match, the excitement surrounding Watts quickly turned to criticism with his school football coach and former AFL footballer, Robert Shaw, stating that he was not ready for AFL football. Premiership player and coach, Leigh Matthews, said he had not seen anything in Watts' first two matches to warrant him being the number one draft pick. He played his third and final AFL match of the year the next week in the fifty-five point loss against [...] at the Gabba, where The Age journalist, Andrew Stafford, noted his confidence looked low. He spent the remainder of the year playing in the VFL.|$|E

[...] It was carefully wrapped in old newspaper, and after it had been divested of the strings and unrolled to be read, it proved to be the parchment or treaty with Government officials, his own name inscribed as head or Grand Chief. [...] Having thus established his old-day tribal office, he carefully refolded the document, wrapped it in the faded news sheet and returned it to the inner folds of his blanket, then nimbly squatted on the office floor, filled his pipe and enjoyed his usual half-hour smoke.” Chief Wa-na-ta’s smoking pipe was his most precious possession. “A titled English ranch-owner who knew of his importance in history offered any price that the old chief would name for the pipe and pouch, but the chief disdained to listen to any offer of money. [...] But when I squatted beside him on the floor, where he was puffing meditatively on his long red-stone pipe, to tell him of leaving <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> a trip west, he arose instantly, untied his belt, laid both pouch and pipe across his left hand and extended it to me as a present and token to be preserved after he had passed to the long sleep.” [...] McCreight forever remembered the kindness and generosity of Chief Wa-na-ta.|$|E
