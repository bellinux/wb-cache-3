30|$|Our main {{conclusion}} {{is that in the}} reported test conditions, traffic with 50 % of cars having <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> results in adequate friction of icy road surfaces. With lower proportions of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres,</b> the friction is substantially lower. If authorities aim to discourage the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> by introducing a tax for their use, as in major cities in Norway [6] for example, the proportion of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> could be influenced {{by the size of the}} tax.|$|R
30|$|The main {{benefit of}} <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> over unstudded ones is their {{stronger}} ice grip at temperatures close to 0  °C [13], which helps drivers control their vehicles on slippery road surfaces. Most researchers appear {{to agree that}} <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> provide some safety benefit, although {{the size of this}} effect is frequently assessed as limited [4, 6 – 8, 10 – 12]. Recent studies have also examined whether increased use of electronic stability control can replace <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> [5, 12]. Elvik [5] concluded that when full penetration of electronic stability has been achieved in major cities in Norway, the number of accidents will not increase if the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> stays at around 15 %.|$|R
30|$|Vaa and Giaever [15] {{compared}} various {{proportions of}} <b>studded</b> and unstudded <b>tyres</b> on icy road surfaces while the ambient temperature varied from − 2  °C to − 10  °C. After 1000 runs per lane clear differences emerged, and after 1500 runs the friction {{in the lane}} involving 80 % of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> was 13 % lower compared to the lane with 100 % of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b> The corresponding reduction for other lanes were as follows (proportions of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> in parentheses): 33 % (60 %), 41 % (40 %) and 43 % (20 %). In addition, {{it seems that the}} effects of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> were rather limited at low temperatures (− 5  °C or colder), whereas when the temperature was higher (from − 2  °C to − 3  °C) the grip was much better for the proportion of 80 – 100 % vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> compared to lower proportions. However, Tuononen and Sainio [14] argued that the main results of Vaa and Giaever are not plausible, as the results by ambient temperature were inconsistent.|$|R
30|$|The {{overall results}} showed {{that there was no}} {{substantial}} difference in friction of the road surface between lanes having 100 %, 75 % or 50 % of cars with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b> However, the friction was much poorer in lanes having fewer cars with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R

30|$|Compared to {{the results}} of Tuononen and Sainio [14], our results suggest a {{somewhat}} higher proportion of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> for adequate friction on wintry road surfaces, although the range suggested by Tuononen and Sainio includes 50 % of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b> It is assumed that differences in test conditions (e.g. temperature) and a higher usage of test lanes in our test might be responsible for this discrepancy. Vaa and Giaever [15] did not provide any specific conclusion in terms of needed proportion of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
40|$|VTI has {{during a}} {{considerable}} time of years monitored the wear from <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> through full-scale tests and control sections. During the winter 2006 - 2007, {{measurements of the}} wear were carried out at several control sections {{in the region of}} Stockholm. The aim of these measurements was to study: - the amount of wear caused by <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> on urban streets in Stockholm, - the amount of wear caused by <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> on express ways outside Stockholm, - the number of private cars using <b>studded</b> <b>tyres,</b> - the relevance of the wear prediction model when used for urban streets. The result of the study shows that the wear of the asphalt wearing courses on the express ways around Stockholm has increased during the last few years even after compensation with respect to the increased amount of traffic. This means that every vehicle equipped with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> wears away more material {{from the surface of the}} asphalt wearing course. One reason for this is that less wearing resistant aggregates have been used in the wearing courses on the express ways around Stockholm the last few years. Together with an increased amount of traffic it results in deeper wearing ruts compared with the winters in the beginning of this century. The rut depth caused by the traffic with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> was 2 - 3 mm in the winter 2006 / 2007...|$|R

40|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2008, the Swedish Road Administration was {{commissioned}} by the Swedish Government to calculate the consequences of different reductions of <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> use. The commission, passed on to VTI, was required to determine: 1. The effects on road safety levels each a reduction would have 2. The changes in winter service standard required to alleviate any reduction in road safety levels 3. The estimated cost of such changes. VTI had just one month to complete the commission. Therefore, as {{there was no time}} for new studies. Existing models and data had to be used. Sales of European and Nordic stud-less winter tyres are distributed equally. Usage in traffic was therefore assumed to be equal as well. The estimated increase of accidents due to restrictions in the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> is quite large, except in the event of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> being banned in April. If everyone that does not use <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> selected the Nordic winter tyre available there would be a lower accident increase if the use of stud-less winter tyres is distributed equally. If restrictions on <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> use were introduced on the national road network, maintaining the accident numbers at existing level would require a completely change of winter service rather than changing up one standard class...|$|R
30|$|The {{main results}} show that the effect on {{friction}} of reducing the number of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> was relatively low when the proportion of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> was 50 % or more. When the corresponding proportion was 25 % or 0 %, the friction was substantially lower, especially {{at the end of the}} test. The friction difference between the outermost test lanes was evident already after 200 – 300 runs.|$|R

30|$|In addition, two similar {{passenger}} cars (Volkswagen Golf) {{were used for}} friction measurements, one with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> and another with (Nordic) unstudded tyres. Two cars equipped with a different tyre type were selected instead of one for three reasons: (1) to ensure improved reliability of results, (2) the friction with unstudded tyres was of primary interest but the national requirements are based on measurements carried out with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres,</b> and (3) to get more balanced wear of the road surfaces by tyre type.|$|R
30|$|These {{results suggest}} that traffic with 50 % of cars having <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> results in {{adequate}} friction of icy road surfaces in the test conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{high costs}} of {{maintenance}} related to pavement wear have caused many countries to prohibit the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b> In Japan and Norway, regulations have also been based upon the health aspects of the road dust. In Japan <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> are prohibited and in Norway, restrictions have {{been placed on the}} use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> in some larger cities. In Sweden, wear particles from pavements, tyres, brakes and winter sanding/salting, have received a lot of attention the last few years. The {{reason for this is that}} measurements have shown that these particles are the main reason that the upcoming environmental quality standard for inhalable particles (PM 10) will not be reached in many cities. The problem mainly occurs during dry episodes in winter and early spring and is mainly a result of <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> use and winter maintenance. A lot of new knowledge about wear particles is needed in order to develop cost-effective measures to deal with them. A great advantage is the possibility to study aerosols from each source both separately and in different combinations in a controlled environment. At VTI (Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute) a road simulator (PVM), previously used for pavement and tyre wear studies, is used as a wear particle generator. The PVM can be equipped with different pavements and tyres and even friction materials such as sand can be applied. The PVM can be used at speeds up to 70 km/h and the pavement can be dry or wet. Also the temperature in the hall can be regulated below zero degrees centigrade. In this paper some results from the WearTox project will be presented. The production of PM 10 from two pavements worn by <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> and friction tyres has been studied as well as the physical and chemical properties of the wear particles produced...|$|R
30|$|The test {{vehicles}} {{drove around}} the test track including sections A and B. The use of each lane in section A was balanced among the test vehicles with <b>studded</b> or unstudded <b>tyres,</b> i.e. each vehicle used the lanes {{as much as}} the others in the same tyre group. After every 10 runs the proportional use of lanes was as designed. For example, after 10 runs the vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> had used the test lanes 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0 times and the vehicles with unstudded tyres had used the respective lanes 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 times. In section B, there was only one lane for vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> and one for vehicles with unstudded tyres.|$|R
30|$|Tuononen and Sainio [14] {{themselves}} {{examined the}} effects of the proportion of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> on the friction of an icy test track. Each lane was driven 144 times by the test vehicles. Based on their results, Tuononen and Sainio suggest that the proportion of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> can be as low as 25 – 50 % with no risk of substantial polishing of the icy road surface. The study has several points to its credit, but it could be asked whether the lanes were used sufficiently compared to the traffic flows on many urban streets or rural roads. Also, the results show that on the acceleration section the friction dropped dramatically if the proportion of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> was 0 – 80 %. Tuononen and Sainio argued that acceleration areas are not as critical for safety as braking sections. However, no particular road section can be assessed as unimportant in terms of road safety, because by contrast with a test track, drivers in real traffic may need to apply emergency braking on any section of road.|$|R
30|$|Aside {{from the}} overall safety {{effects of these}} tyre types, a more {{specific}} and long discussed issue has been whether <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> prevent wintry roads from becoming over-polished, and whether a certain proportion {{of them would be}} needed for the sake of safety. This cannot of course be answered with a single figure, since the degree of slipperiness varies with the weather conditions and is mitigated by several approaches with concurrent effects, such as winter maintenance and tyre properties. Nevertheless, the question is currently relevant, as the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> is discouraged by many cities in the Nordic countries due to their adverse health effects [9].|$|R
30|$|However, {{any single}} study is {{unlikely}} to provide a full picture of the needed proportion of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> for sufficient friction, given that road conditions keep changing {{and there are other}} factors affecting friction as well. For example, winter maintenance aims to keep friction at an acceptable level and there are heavy vehicles in real traffic that may wear snow or ice more quickly than cars but may also polish icy road surfaces. Consequently, the main contribution of these results is to provide one piece of evidence for decision making, if the societal goal is to reduce the adverse effects of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> without hampering road safety.|$|R
50|$|The {{sport is}} divided into classes for full-rubber and <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b> The <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> {{category}} involves competitors riding on bikes with spikes up to 3 centimetres in length screwed into each treadless tyre, each bike has 90 spikes on the front tyre and 200-500 on the rear (regulations on length and types of permissible studs are controlled by the sanctioning body). The use of these spikes in this discipline necessitate the addition of special protective guards (similar to mudguards) over the wheels which extend almost to the ice surface. The spiked tyres produce {{a tremendous amount of}} traction and this means two-speed gearboxes are also required.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the grip of winter tyres on ice and snow deteriorates with age {{to such an extent that}} winter tyres above a certain age e. g. 10 years should be {{forbidden}} to use. Little research data do however exist. This investigation has been carried out by VTI in order to get a better background for legal decisions. The results would also be of use for ordinary consumers as a guidance. This investigation that was carried out on wet smooth ice is the third of three part studies. The first was on smooth ice at - 3 °C and the second on rough ice at - 3 °C. They have been reported in VTI meddelande 923 and VTI notat 34 - 2003. The aim of the investigation is to investigate the correlation between ice grip of winter tyres and their age, tread depth and tread rubber hardness and for <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> also <b>stud</b> protrusion and stud force. The investigation comprises 23 studded and 42 non <b>studded</b> winter <b>tyres</b> and four summer tyres mainly of the in Sweden popular brands Gislaved, Michelin and Good Year, primarily of size 195 / 65 R 15. Most of the tyres had been driven in ordinary traffic and were manufactured from 1981 to 2003. A small number of new winter tyres were also tested. As reference some new summer tyres were tested as well. The steering and braking performance of the tyres has been measured in a special climate controlled indoor high speed flat bed test facility developed by the VTI. Very good correlation has earlier been found between results from the facility and lap time results from ice track circuit tests with cars as well as pure braking and cornering tests with cars on ice tracks. No age related deterioration of the ice grip was found for the fully <b>studded</b> winter <b>tyres</b> with <b>stud</b> protrusion 1 mm and higher. The ice grip deteriorated with increasing age for non <b>studded</b> winter <b>tyres</b> and <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> with <b>stud</b> protrusion less than 0, 9 mm. The results also show that on wet smooth ice <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> with <b>stud</b> protrusion 1 mm and higher are much superior to non <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> including the specialised studless winter tyres often called "friction tyres". The differences in friction within the groups are however quite large...|$|R
40|$|In {{regions where}} <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> and {{traction}} material are used during winter, e. g. the Nordic countries, {{northern part of}} USA, Canada, and Japan, mechanically generated particles from traffic are {{the main reason for}} high particle mass concentrations in busy street and road environments. In many Nordic municipalities the European environmental quality standard for inhalable particles (PM(10)) is exceeded due to these particles. In this study, particles from the wear of studded and studless friction tyres on two pavements and traction sanding were generated using a road simulator. The particles were characterized using particle sizers, Particle Induced X-Ray Emission Analysis and electron microscopy. Cell studies were conducted on particles sampled from the tests with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> and compared with street environment, diesel exhaust and subway PM(10), respectively. The results show that in the road simulator, where resuspension is minimized, <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> produce tens of times more particles than friction tyres. Chemical analysis of the sampled particles shows that the generated wear particles consist almost entirely of minerals from the pavement stone material, but also that Sulfur is enriched for the submicron particles and that Zink is enriched for friction tyres for all particles sizes. The chemical data can be used for source identification and apportionment in urban aerosol studies. A mode of ultra-fine particles was also present and is hypothesised to originate in the tyres. Further, traction material properties affect PM(10) emission. The inflammatory potential of the particles from wear of pavements seems to depend on type of pavement and can be at least as potent as diesel exhaust particles. The results imply {{that there is a need}} and a good potential to reduce particle emission from pavement wear and winter time road and street operation by adjusting both <b>studded</b> <b>tyre</b> use as well as pavement and traction material properties...|$|R

The conditions in 1999 / 20 00 are the same, except for the assumptions that all those using <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> will then be using lightweight studs and that wear resistant pavements will be more common. Everything else, for example winter maintenance will be the same as in 1993 / 1994. The following effects are included: Accidents (direct: at slipperiness. indirect: because of pavement wear) Road wear (pavement and road markings, cleaning signs) Car costs (tyres/rims, fuel consumption, washing) Environment (car washing...|$|R
30|$|There were 10 {{vehicles}} with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> and 10 {{vehicles with}} unstudded tyres for wearing {{of the road}} surfaces.

The tyres were {{less than one year}} old and driven 10, 000 – 20, 000  km, but each tyre was in good condition.|$|R
40|$|In many countries, where <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> are prohibited, {{the traffic}} {{polishing}} of the coarse aggregate in the wearing courses {{is a problem}} to a rather great extent. In those countries there are often regulations on the aggregate polishing value. In Sweden, where the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> is extensive, the micro texture of the aggregate in {{the surface of the}} wearing courses increases during the winter season. Therefore, there have been few problems with low wet friction levels in Sweden. However, the increased use of wear resistant aggregates and stone mastic asphalt together with lightweight studs has led to a reduced amount of wear. During later years, a problem with low friction levels has been noticed in wear resistant surface courses during late summer and fall, especially at high trafficked roads with a complicated geometry. Measurements have shown that the friction level can be reduced rather quickly on surfaces with aggregates that are disposed for polishing and low wet friction related accidents have been reported. This report is a knowledge survey covering polishing, friction and to some extent surface texture and wear caused by <b>studded</b> <b>tyres.</b> Experiences from friction measurements mainly in Stockholm and Gothenburg have been compiled in this report. A review of testing methods and existing requirements is also presented in the report.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that buses are overrepresented at {{accidents}} during winter road conditions compared to other vehicle types. Hence, the traffic safety of buses during the wintertime has been studied in more detail. The study comprised the following parts: - Gripping power studies on ice in VTI's tyre test facility. - Accident study and a survey of the use of tyre. - Focus group to gain knowledge about dangerous situations. - Driving simulator study to test the importance of the tyres during problematic situations. Tests in VTI's tyre test facility on smooth ice did not show any significant difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter <b>tyres,</b> while <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> exhibit a better ice grip than non-studded tyres. Nor did driving simulator tests when driving on ice covered road under the influence of heavy wind from the side show a difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter tyres. Also in these tests the <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> were superior to the non-studded. If <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> are used only on one axle, the driving simulator study showed that during side wind the ability to steer is important. The accident study showed that the buses that have summer tyres on the steering axle and winter tyres on the drivé axle has the lowest estimated accident risk, although it is not statistically significant. The buses equipped with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> on both axles could not be statistically analysed since only 2 accidents occurred on bare roadways, and none on icy/snowy roadways, {{while at the same time}} the buses in this category drive a lot on icy/snowy roadways. This probably makes these buses the safest on winter roadways. From the focus groups it was clear that the time table has a great influence on the creating of stress and the demands on the drivers to keep the speed even during slippery roadways. Many bus drivers experience large problems with bad snow clearance, or other winter maintenance. At the same time there is a large consciousness among the drivers that it is always their own way of handling the vehicle that is the determining factor for traffic safety. The drivers were expressing a lack of further education and practical exercises with buses on slippery roads...|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} tyre type on rut depth {{show that the}} depth {{increased}} much faster on compact snow than on ice during the test. In fact, the snowy surface wore so quickly and inconsistently that {{we were unable to}} accurately measure the increase in ruts. However, on icy surfaces, the more vehicles there were with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres,</b> the deeper the mean depth of ruts {{was at the end of}} the test.|$|R
30|$|Because {{the section}} with compact snow wore inconsistently, the results include more {{variance}} {{than those for}} the icy surface, but we consider them to correspond relatively well with the latter. Specifically, compared to the lane with 100 % of vehicles with <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> {{at the end of}} the test, the largest mean friction reduction was 22 – 23 % on snow-covered surfaces and 20 – 31 % on ice-covered surfaces.|$|R

40|$|In Northern cities respirable street dust {{emission}} levels (PM 10) are especially high during spring.

We studied the formation of respirable abrasion particles in the tyre-road interface due to <b>tyre</b> <b>studs</b> and traction sanding by a mobile laboratory vehicle Sniffer. The measurements were performed on a test track, where the influence of varying stud weight and <b>stud</b> number per <b>tyre</b> on PM 10 emissions was studied. <b>Studded</b> <b>tyres</b> resulted in higher emission levels than studless tyres especially with speeds 50 km/h and higher; however, by using light weight studs, which approximately halves the weight of studs, or by reducing the number of <b>studs</b> per <b>tyre</b> to half, the emission levels decreased by approximately half. Additionally measurements were done with and without traction sand coverage on the pavement of a public road. After traction sanding the emission levels were not affected by tyre type but by formation and suspension of traction sand related dust from the road surface. The emissions after traction sanding decreased as a function of time as passing vehicles' motion shifted the sand grains away from the areas with most tyre-road contact...|$|R
40|$|Buses in Sweden {{have a low}} {{accident}} risk. However, {{statistics from}} 1996 - 2002 indicate {{that the number of}} bus accidents in Sweden with personal injuries have been increasing by 4 % yearly. Buses also have a higher percentage of accidents that occur on ice/snow covered roads than other vehicles. In Sweden passenger cars must be equipped with winter tyres during the winter period. There is no such regulation for heavy vehicles, and many buses are using summer tyres all around the year. The present project had the purpose of looking at the bus-winter problem in more detail, with the main focus on tyres. Four different studies were carried out: tyre tests, focus group discussions, driving simulator tests and an accident study. Here is given a short summary concerning methods and conclusions of each sub project. Tyre tests on smooth ice did not show any significant difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter <b>tyres,</b> while <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> exhibits a better ice grip than non-studded tyres. Nor did driving simulator tests with driving on ice covered road under the influence of heavy wind from the side show a difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter tyres. Also in these tests <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> were superior to non-studded. Accident statistics indicate that buses with summer tyres on the steering axle and winter tyres on the drive axle have the lowest estimated accident risk, which is in accordance with the results in a previous study. The results are however not statistically significant due the low number of accidents. Three focus groups were carried out and the importance of the tyres for traffic safety during winter was discussed. It is however hard from the gathered discussion material to estimate just how important the tyres really are. The results do not warrant a winter tyre regulation for heavy vehicles, and a restriction of the use of <b>studded</b> <b>tyres</b> for buses would probably have negative consequences on traffic safety...|$|R
