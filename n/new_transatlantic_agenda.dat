40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen the}} {{emergence}} of a set of ideas under the broad banner of neo-liberalism that connect international law and international relations. One of the key concepts in this burgeoning intellectual movement, revived from the 1970 s, is the idea of transnational governance, which posits that modern liberal states collectively organize their political life in ways that go beyond simple hierarchical relations between solitary sovereigns and individuals and instead rely on complex international networks linking various branches of government and key non-state actors. Transatlantic Governance in the Global Economy, edited by Mark Pollack and Gregory Shaffer, is an attempt to add empirical weight to this liberal theory.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} make an original contribution to knowledge about transatlantic institutions and transatlantic governance.

The thesis questions whether and to what extent the relationship has been institutionalised into a structure for transatlantic governance, and how the composition of transatlantic institutions impacts the way the transatlantic actors govern. Consideration is given to both 'who' governs in transatlantic relations and 'how', as evidence is sought to prove or disprove the claim that a decentralisation of decision-making powers has resulted in 'policy setting' and 'policy shaping' by lower level civil servants and non-state actors participating in transgovernmental and transnational institutions.

Much of the government-to-government interaction has been dominated by the need to produce "deliverables" on a laundry list of issues.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents an}} attempt {{to find out whether}} and to what extent transatlantic economic cooperation has been institutionalized in the last decade. More broadly, it is also a review of trade relations between the European Union and the United States in the past twenty years. Firstly, my claim is that the institutionalization of practices like trade dialogues and/or fora after the <b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> had a weak impact on how transatlantic actors govern their respective economic ties. Consideration is given to both 'who' governs in transatlantic relations (either state and non-state actors) and 'how', as evidence is sought either in official documents and case-studies to prove or disprove the claim that a “re-centralisation” of decision-making powers has resulted in less 'policy setting' and 'policy shaping' by lower level civil servants and non-state actors. Moreover, another key issue is what drove the overall design and strategy of trade and economic relations forward, {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Extensive use of case studies, process-tracing, and interviews is applied to a wide range of topics, covering the period from the establishment of the <b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> until the re-launch of the partnership with the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) in 2007. A particular attention is devoted to public opinion as an explanatory variable. Trade undisputedly reflects better than any other topic the determinants and features of decision-making, and shows how strongly they are shaped by a variety of factors. Non-tariff barriers to trade are one of the most important limits to transatlantic dialogue, especially in sectors such as food products, health, chemicals or data privacy. The role of private actors in (re) shaping regulatory standards is increased for example during current negotiations in Brussels and in Washington for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Finally, policy-making in the transatlantic sphere is adjusted to the needs and exigencies of the different relevant actors. Therefore, the peculiarity of the topic I am going to present can not be treated as if it was simply a matter of institutions, rational choices and bargaining. Policies are a result of a complex web of interactions, which can be framed by theories and are shaped by ideas and norms, as it will be shown in the theoretical part. I assume that political decisions can be explained by looking both at the different levels to which they are agreed upon and at the different factors they may be influenced by...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Hailed by President Clinton as the "roadmap for the 21 st century", the <b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> (NTA) and the Joint Action Plan (JAP) were {{designed}} to be a watershed in US-EU relations. Rooted in the revolutionary changes of the late 1980 s/early 1990 s, the US and the EU realized that they were entering the uncertainty of a new and unprecedented political era - the post-Cold War world - which called for a fundamental overhaul of transatlantic relations. It quickly became obvious that the political dialogue between the two needed to be reinvigorated and incorporate a wider area of policy objectives. Ergo, it was necessary {{to move away from the}} ad hoc consultations common during the Cold War, and cope with issues which were formerly for the most part unilaterally dealt with by the United States. Only a few years after the first attempt of strengthening transatlantic ties culminated in the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990, policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic realized that further cooperation was called for. At the US-EU summit in Madrid on 3 December 1995, President Bill Clinton, Spanish Prime Minister and President of the EU Council Felipe Gonzalez, and European Commission President Jacques Santer announced a <b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda</b> (NTA) and a Joint Action Plan (JAP) to forge even closer ties between the United States and the European Union by implementing coordinated policies on a range of the most pressing economic, political, security, humanitarian, environmental and cultural issues. The initiative was a concise plan laying out concrete action plans to cope with today's interdependent world in which challenges facing the United States and the European Union could no longer be dealt with satisfactorily by either party acting alone. Transnational in nature, these challenges, such as international crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of communicable diseases, required resources which exceeded those at the disposal of either the US or the EU acting alone. In particular, the two sides promised joined actions to work towards the following four goals: (I) promoting peace and stability and fostering democracy and development around the world (II) responding to new global challenges (III) contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations (IV) building social and cultural bridges across the Atlantic. Based on the Agenda, the Joint Action Plan is a more comprehensive document which contains 150 longer-term specific objectives from which a number are selected for regular updating of the Agenda between subsequent US-EU summit meetings. The following assessment explores the origins of the Agenda in general and the overall state of transatlantic relations during the 1990 's in particular. Furthermore, each policy area is discussed and evaluated from an American and European point of view. Lastly, potential points of friction are examined and a prospect for bringing the Agenda to fruition will be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, {{we attempt}} to provide some answers, {{on the basis of}} the {{empirical}} evidence presented in the preceding chapters, to the two sets of questions posed in the introduction to this volume. In the first section of this chapter, {{we attempt to}} explain the rise of new forms of transatlantic governance during the 1990 s, addressing three core questions: What's new about these transatlantic governance mechanisms? Why are they developing now? And why have the various actors in the new governance networks chosen to organize at the transatlantic level, rather than in some other international forums? In the second section, we examine the evidence of transatlantic governance across a wide range of issue areas, ranging from trade and standard setting to food safety, consumer protection, labor, and the environment, and we assess the relative explanatory power of the intergovernmental, transgovernmental, and transnational models of governance laid out in the introduction. In the third section, we conclude that transatlantic governance is increasingly governance by mixed networks of all three types of actors, albeit with a leading role for the Clinton administration and the European commission, which emerge as the primary architects of the <b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Agenda.</b> Finally, returning to Rhodes's model of governance by mixed networks of public and private actors brought together by resource interdependencies, we examine the relative power of various actors within these transatlantic networks as a function of their respective resource endowments, and we speculate about the development of those networks in the coming years...|$|E

While data protection is often criticized as an excessive obstacle to the implementation of security systems, the paper argues that transatlantic data protection politics proves much more ambiguous. Contrary to many conceptualizations, the eventual “excess” of data protection operates less against internal security than against the protection of privacy. This contribution is based on the analysis of two cases study: the draft EU-US 2011 Passenger Name Record Agreement and the ongoing negotiations over a comprehensive EU-US data protection agreement...|$|R
