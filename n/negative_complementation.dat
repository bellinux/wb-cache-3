40|$|We {{have studied}} the Mos 1 {{transposase}} encoded by the transposable element mariner. This transposase {{is a member of}} the ``D,D(35) E'' superfamily of proteins exhibiting the motif D,D(34) D. It is not known whether this transposase, or other eukaryote transposases manifesting the D,D(35) E domain, functions in a multimeric form. Evidence for oligomerization was found in the <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> of Mos 1 by an EMS-induced transposase mutation in the catalytic domain. The transposase produced by this mutation has a glycine-to-arginine replacement at position 292. The G 292 R mutation strongly interferes with the ability of wild-type transposase to catalyze excision of a target element. <b>Negative</b> <b>complementation</b> was also observed for two other EMS mutations, although the effect was weaker than observed with G 292 R. Results from the yeast two-hybrid system also imply that Mos 1 subunits interact, suggesting the possibility of subunit oligomerization in the transposition reaction. Overproduction of Mos 1 subunits through an hsp 70 promoter also inhibits excision of the target element, possibly through autoregulatory feedback on transcription or through formation of inactive or less active oligomers. The effects of both <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> and overproduction may contribute to the regulation of mariner transposition...|$|E
40|$|Attachment {{between the}} sister chromatids is {{required}} for proper chromosome segregation in meiosis and mitosis, but its molecular basis is not understood. Mutations in the Drosophila ord gene result in premature sister chromatid separation in meiosis, indicating that the product of this gene is necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. We isolated the ord gene {{and found that it}} encodes a novel 55 kDa protein. Some of the ord mutations exhibit unusual complementation properties, termed <b>negative</b> <b>complementation,</b> in which particular alleles poison the activity of another allele. <b>Negative</b> <b>complementation</b> predicts that protein-protein interactions are critical for ORD function. The position and nature of these unusual ord mutations demonstrate that the C-terminal half of ORD is essential for sister chromatid cohesion and suggest that it mediates protein binding...|$|E

40|$|Prolidase {{deficiency}} (MIM 26413), an {{autosomal recessive}} phenotype, {{is caused by}} rare alleles at a locus on chromosome 19 cent. -q 13. 2. The clinical phenotype is pleiotropic (affecting skin, brain, etc.) and of variable expressivity (benign to early death). I established skin fibroblast cultures from 6 homozygous probands and 6 obligate heterozygotes, purified prolidase (E. C. 3. 4. 13. 9, a homodimer) from normal human fibroblasts, raised a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the subunit, and studied its biosynthesis. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the subunit is synthesized in the cytosol as a 58 KDa. polypeptide and not processed further. Homozygous prolidase-deficient cell strains expressed 3 classes of mutant alleles which by complementation analysis mapped to one locus. The alleles were designated CRM$-$ (nul), CRM+ activity/size variant, and CRM+ activity variant. Heterozygotes carrying CRM$-$ alleles have heat stable prolidase (50 $ sp circ$C, 1 hr); heterozygotes carrying CRM+ variant alleles have heat labile enzyme. The finding implies that variant CRM+ allele(s) can confer <b>negative</b> allelic <b>complementation</b> on the dimeric enzyme (dominant relative phenotype). CRM$-$ homozygous cells contain varying amounts of an alternative imidodipeptidase-like activity. The variant prolidase allele (major gene) and amount of alternative "prolidase" activity (modifier gene) are apparently both determinants of the associated clinical phenotype in prolidase deficiency.

40|$|Prolidase (E. C. 3. 4. 13. 9) is a homodimeric enzyme encoded at a locus on {{chromosome}} 19. Prolidase deficiency is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder {{with a highly}} variable clinical phenotype. We purified prolidase to homogeneity from normal human fibroblasts, raised a monospecific rabbit antiserum, and studied biosynthesis of the subunit in normal and prolidase [...] deficient fibroblasts. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the subunit is synthesized and retained in cytosol as a 58 -KDa polypeptide. Three types of mutations were identified in six prolidase-deficient cell strains; half conferred a CRM-negative phenotype, while the CRM-positive mutations were of two types, one mutation encoding an enlarged subunit (60 KDa) and the others associated with subunits of normal size. Complementation analysis indicated that these mutations map to one locus. Normal subjects and obligate heterozygotes expressing CRM-negative mutations had thermostable prolidase activity at 50 degrees C in cell extracts, whereas heterozygotes expressing CRM-positive mutations had thermolabile activity under the same condition, implying <b>negative</b> allelic <b>complementation</b> in the putative heterodimer. The occurrence of prolidase-like activity about 5 % of normal in amount but with a preference for substrate different from normal, in cells homozygous (or compound) for CRM-negative mutations, identified an alternative cleavage activity not encoded at the prolidase locus. Allelic heterogeneity at the major locus {{and the amount of}} alternative peptidase activity encoded elsewhere appear to be determinants of the associated and heterogeneous clinical phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Herpesviruses {{are capable}} of several types of {{infection}} of a host cell. To investigate the early events which ultimately determine {{the nature of the}} virus-host cell interaction, a system was established utilizing temperature-sensitive mutants of herpes simplex virus type 2. Four mutants have been isolated which fail to induce cytopathic effects and do not replicate at 39 C in hamster embryo fibroblast cells. At least one mutant is virus DNA <b>negative.</b> Since intracellular <b>complementation</b> is detectable between pairs of mutants, a virus function is known to be temperature sensitive. However, all four mutants induce cytopathic effects and replicate to parental virus levels in rabbit kidney cells at 39 C. This suggests that a host cell function, lacking or nonfunctional in HEF cells but present in rabbit kidney cells at 39 C, is required for the replication of these mutants in hamster embryo fibroblasts cells at 39 C. Therefore, we conclude that these mutants are both temperature sensitive and exhibit host range properties...|$|R

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of an ompR mutation, a single-base-pair change, that results in an Arg-to-Cys substitution. When present in multiple copies, the mutant allele conferred a dominant OmpC- OmpF+ phenotype. Furthermore, the mutant allele exhibited allele-specific <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> with other ompR mutations. This ability, together with its dominant character, suggested that the OmpR protein is capable of multimerization...|$|E

Analysis {{of this type}} of allelic interaction in gynandromorphs suggests that the lethal focus has a fate-map site in the anterior part of the fly, probably close to {{the central part of the}} thorax. In addition to the lethal effect, negative interaction of the alleles can also be seen in the morphogenesis of wings and chaetae of thorax and head.

40|$|In E. coli, DcuSR {{controls}} {{gene expression}} {{in response to}} C 4 -dicarboxylates, including the C 4 -dicarboxylate carriers DcuB and DctA. The DcuS sensor has a periplasmic PASp domain sensing extracellular C 4 -dicarboxylates, a cytoplasmic PASc domain of unknown function and a His-kinase domain autophosphorylating during the signaling process. To understand {{the role of the}} PASc domain, it was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis and the effects of the mutations on DcuSRdependent regulation determined. 4 site-directed alterations within the PASc domain reduced induction of dcuB and dctA in response to fumarate indicating an essential role in sensing fumarate and/or in transmitting the signal from PASp to the kinase domain. 2 alterations were unable to activate either dcuB or dctA showing an involvement of the PASc domain in the intramolecular signalling pathway of DcuS or preventing protein assembly resulting in inactive DcuS. This was clearly seen when DcuS-E 293 A had a <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> effect on dcuB in a wildtype background. The alterations affected the DcuSR-dependent regulatory response in a manner that was partly reliant on {{the presence or absence of}} oxygen suggesting that the PASc domain may sense redox status and adjust the activity of DcuS in response to fumarate, accordingly. The use of the MalE-DcuS constructs showed no complementation effect on dcuB and dctA in the dcuS strain and a clear <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> effect in the wildtype strain indicating that the periplasmic domain is required for high kinase activity or significant phosphor-transfer to DcuR. The negative complementati the PASc and Kinase domains indicates that these domains associate in vivo. This is suggestive of inactivation of wildtype DcuS through heterocomplex with the s oteins.

40|$|AbstractHybrid {{forms of}} human {{phenylalanine}} hydroxylase (hPAH) mutants {{have been found}} to present catalytic activities lower than predicted from the individual recombinant forms, indicating that interallelic complementation could be a major determinant of the metabolic phenotype of compound heterozygous phenylketonuric (PKU) patients. To provide a molecular explanation for interallelic complementation we have here developed a bicistronic expression system and a purification strategy to obtain isolated hPAH heteromeric forms. On co-expression of WT-hPAH (~ 50 % tetramer; ~ 10 % dimer) and the N- and C-terminally truncated form ΔN 102 /ΔC 24 -hPAH (~ 80 % dimer) no heterodimers were recovered. Moreover, by co-expression of WT-hPAH and the N-terminally truncated form ΔN 102 -hPAH (~ 95 % tetramer), heterotetramers, {{as a result of an}} assembly of two different homodimers, were isolated. The recovered (WT) /(ΔN 102) -hPAH heterotetramers revealed a catalytic activity deviating significantly from that calculated by averaging the respective recombinant homotetrameric forms. The heterotetramer assembly also results in conformational changes in the WT-hPAH protomer, as detected by trypsin limited proteolysis. The finding that the presence of two homodimers with different kinetic parameters influences the properties of the resulting heterotetrameric protein indicates that the dimers exhibit interactions which are transmitted across the assembled tetramer. The bicistronic expression system developed here allowed the isolation of hybrid forms that exhibit <b>negative</b> interallelic <b>complementation,</b> and may represent a model system for studying the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of PAH gene mutations in compound heterozygous PKU patients, providing the rationale to understand the observed inconsistencies both in genotype/phenotype correlations and in the response to BH 4 supplementation...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 28 L-rhamnose-negative mutants in Salmonella typhimurium LT 2 were all linked by P 22 {{transduction}} and were classified into five {{groups on the}} basis of genetic and biochemical experiments. Deletion mapping showed that the gene order was rhaD rhaA rhaB rhaC rhaT. rhaA mutants lacked an inducible L-rhamnose isomerase, rhaB mutants lacked an inducible L- rhamnulokinase, and rhaD mutants were probably defective in L- rhamnulose - 1 -phosphate aldolase. Mutants that were unable to accumulate L-[14 C]rhamnose but could grow on 1 % L-rhamnose were designated rhaT to indicate a defect in L-rhamnose transport. Genetic evidence supports the hypothesis that the rhaC gene is a positive regulator of rha gene expression. (i) Pleiotropically negative mutants in the rhaC gene were isolated at a high frequency. (ii) Mutants containing an insertion or deletion within the rhaC gene had a pleiotropically <b>negative</b> phenotype. (iii) <b>Complementation</b> tests indicated that rhaC + was dominant to rhaC -.

40|$|The {{recently}} described {{vaccinia virus}} entry/fusion complex (EFC) comprises {{at least eight}} polypeptides that are conserved in all poxviruses. Neither {{the structure of the}} complex nor the roles of individual subunits are known. Here we provide evidence for an interaction between the H 2 and A 28 subunits {{in the context of a}} virus infection as well as in uninfected cells transfected with plasmids expressing the corresponding genes. We focused on a highly conserved 21 -amino acid-segment in H 2 that is flanked by cysteine residues. The effect of amino acid substitutions within the 21 -amino-acid segment was determined by an infectivity complementation assay using a conditional H 2 -null mutant of vaccinia virus. Mutations that had no, moderate, or large <b>negative</b> effects on <b>complementation</b> were found. The latter group included glutamic acid substitutions of leucine and individual glycines and alanine substitution of both glycines within a LGYSG sequence. Mutations with the most pronounced effect on infectivity disrupted the interaction of H 2 with A 28 to the greatest extent in both infected and uninfected cells. These data indicate that the LGYSG sequence is important for the interaction of H 2 with A 28 and suggest that this sequence is buried within the EFC complex...|$|R

Plasmids carrying the mutD 5 and mut+ alleles both produce the 28 -kDa species. The product of mutD 5 is dominant when carried by single and multicopy plasmids.

40|$|Chemical {{complementation}} is {{a general}} system for detecting protein-small molecule interactions, and linking that interaction to genetic selection. In this chemical complementation system, the interaction of a nuclear receptor and a ligand is essential for yeast survival. In first generation chemical complementation, a two-component assay was developed where the Gal 4 DNA-binding domain is fused to the ligand binding domains of nuclear receptors, and expressed in the strain S. cerevisiae PJ 69 - 4 A. The Gal 4 DNA binding domain binds to a Gal 4 response element controlling transcription of a selective marker, and the nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain binds its ligand. This system was developed using the retinoid X receptor, the pregnane X receptor, and the liver X receptor and their ligands 9 -cis retinoic acid, paclitaxel, and oxysterols, respectively. Yeast survive on selective plates only {{in the presence of}} both components: a nuclear receptor and the corresponding ligand. Growth was observed at the highest concentration of ligand (10 - 5 M) and, compared to Gal 4 -activated growth, the growth density was less and growth time was more. The second generation chemical complementation system is a three-component system comprising a nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain fused to the Gal 4 DNA binding domain, the ligand, and a nuclear receptor coactivator fused to the yeast Gal 4 activation domain. This system was developed using the retinoid X receptor and has been extended to several other nuclear receptors. The sensitivity of chemical complementation is increased 1000 -fold, and growth time and density are equivalent to Gal 4 -activated growth. An assay was developed to provide a quantitative high-throughput assay for evaluating nuclear receptor- ligand interactions, and measuring EC 50 values for the ligand-receptor pairs. Chemical complementation {{can be used in a}} variety of applications, such as drug discovery for nuclear receptor-based disease, providing a high-throughput assay for the discovery of potential nuclear receptor agonists, and with the use of the <b>negative</b> chemical <b>complementation</b> system, the discovery of nuclear receptor antagonists. Chemical complementation is used for protein engineering, specifically engineering receptors to bind and activate in response to other ligands.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{a series of}} deletion mutations in the p 30 and p 10 domains of the gag gene of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Mutants with deletions in P 30 were completely defective in virion particle production even though an altered gag precursor protein is synthesized. This domain is apparently critical for particle formation. A mutant in P 10 was able to release virion particles into the medium, {{and low levels of}} reverse transcriptase activity could be detected in these virions. To explore the effects of these mutations on the utilization of the gag-pol precursor, we have introduced these mutants into cells already releasing defective particles from an endogenous provirus which directs the synthesis of gag gene products and not pol gene products. The P 10 mutant was capable of providing pol function as judged by the incorporation of high levels of reverse transcriptase into the particles and complete complementation for XC plaque formation. In contrast, the mutants in P 30 were <b>negative</b> in this <b>complementation</b> test. Thus, those gag mutants which were unable on their own to assemble virion particles were also unable to contribute the gag-pol precursor to these particles. These mutations are the first to be mapped to the gag region which affect pol function, suggesting that the gag-pol precursor must be assembled before pol is functionally separated from the gag domain. The concordance of the effects of different mutations on both particle formation and gag-pol utilization suggests that similar domains of gag (namely, domains in the P 30 region) are needed for these two processes...|$|R

The four contiguous loci, el, l(2) br 22, l(2) br 29 and noc, although separable by deletion end points, interact, because certain (or all) alleles of these four loci show partial failure of complementation, or even <b>negative</b> <b>complementation.</b> The simplest hypothesis is that Sco is a small reciprocal transposition, the genes noc, osp, and Adh exchanging places with three genes normally mapping proximal to them: l(2) br 34, l(2) br 35 and rd.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{possible}} {{to interfere with the}} replication of a number of plant RNA viruses by systemic production of viral capsid polypeptides or RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or by production of untranslatable portions of viral plus strands or minus strands. Interference can occur by a number of mechanisms. We have discovered that theSaccharomyces cerevisiaedouble-stranded RNA viruses ScVL 1 and ScVLa, which exist as permanent persistent infections of their host cells, can be cured very efficiently by production of N-terminal fragments of their capsid polypeptides. These totiviruses produce only two polypeptides: a capsid polypeptide (Cap) and a Cap–Pol fusion polypeptide with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Three types of interference can be detected: interference due to overproduction of both Cap and Cap–Pol, interference due to overproduction of Cap (and consequent distortion of the Cap to Cap–Pol ratio), and interference due to <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> by N-terminal fragments of Cap. Some N-terminal fragments of Cap appear to be incorporated into viral particles, but only {{in the presence of a}} complete Cap protein.

We have generated new alleles of Su(z) 2 and analyzed them at the genetic and molecular levels. Some of these alleles display <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> in that they cause lethality when heterozygous with the gain-of-function Su(z) 21 allele but are hemizygous and, in some cases, homozygous viable. Interestingly, alleles of this class identify protein domains within Su(z) 2 that are highly conserved in Psc and the mammalian Bmi- 1 and Mel- 18 proteins.

40|$|Mutants lacking NADP-linked {{glutamate}} dehydrogenase (NADP-GDH) activity have been isolated by several procedures. Complementation tests in diploids {{as well as}} tetrad analysis show that they map within a short chromosome segment, the gdhA locus, which is allelic to the ure 1 locus described previously. That the gdhA locus is a structural gene for NADP-GDH is supported by two kinds of evidence. First, intracistronic complementation, as well as <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> were observed between some of the gdhA- mutants. This is {{in agreement with the}} multimeric structure of the NADP-GDH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shown by Venard and Fourcade (1972). Secondly, some of the mutants at the gdhA locus have a NADP-GDH with modified properties, including: five-fold higher Km for 2 -oxoglutarate, hundred-fold higher Km for NH 4 +, loss of inhibition by excess of substrate (2 -oxoglutarate), and lower thermostability. Mutants with derepressed NAD-GDH activity have been isolated from gdhA- strains {{on the basis of their}} faster growth on ammonia as sole nitrogen source. They define the gdhCR locus, which is allelic to ure 2 and usu described previously.

40|$|The mutator {{phenotype}} {{has been}} linked in several bacterial genera to a defect in the methyl-mismatch repair system, in which the major components are MutS and MutL. This system is involved both in mismatch repair and in prevention of recombination between homeologous fragments in Escherichia coli and {{has been shown to}} play an important role in the adaptation of bacterial populations in changing and stressful environments. In this report we describe the molecular analysis of the mutS and mutL genes of Staphylococcus aureus. A genetic analysis of the mutSL region was performed in S. aureus RN 4220. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments confirmed the operon structure already reported in other gram-positive organisms. Insertional inactivation of mutS and mutL genes and complementation showed the role of both genes in hypermutability in this species. We also designed an in vitro model to study the role of MutS and MutL in homeologous recombination in S. aureus. For this purpose, we constructed a bank of S. aureus RN 4220 and mutS and mutL mutants containing the integrative thermosensitive vector pBT 1 in which fragments with various levels of identity (74 % to 100 %) to the S. aureus sodA gene were cloned. MutS and MutL proteins seemed to have a limited effect on the control of homeologous recombination. Sequence of mutS and mutL genes was analyzed in 11 hypermutable S. aureus clinical isolates.

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of randomly generated, temperature-sensitive vaccinia virus mutants {{led to the}} mapping of DNA synthesis <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> groups to the B 1 R, D 4 R, D 5 R, and E 9 L genes. Evidence from the yeast two-hybrid system that the D 4 R and D 5 R proteins can interact with the A 20 R protein suggested that A 20 R was also involved in DNA replication. We found that the A 20 R gene was transcribed early after infection, consistent with such a role. To investigate {{the function of the}} A 20 R protein, targeted mutations were made by substituting alanines for charged amino acids occurring in 11 different clusters. Four mutants were not isolated, suggesting that they were lethal, two mutants exhibited no temperature sensitivity, two mutants exhibited partial temperature sensitivity, and two mutants formed no plaques or infectious virus at 39 °C. The two mutants with stringent phenotypes were further characterized. Temperature shift-up experiments indicated that the crucial period was between 6 and 12 h after infection, making it unlikely that the defect was in virus entry, early gene expression, or a late stage of virus assembly. Similar patterns of metabolically labeled viral early proteins were detected at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures, but one mutant showed an absence of late proteins under the latter conditions. Moreover, no viral DNA synthesis was detected when cells were infected with either stringent mutant at 39 °C. The previous yeast two-hybrid analysis together with the present characterization of A 20 R temperature-sensitive mutants suggested that the A 20 R, D 4 R, and D 5 R proteins are components of a multiprotein DNA replication complex...|$|E

Extracts from such hisDa 986 and hisDb 1799 mutant cells {{failed to show}} histidinol dehydrogenase activity but complemented to produce active enzyme. Inactive mutant histidinol dehydrogenases were purified {{from each of the}} two mutants by ion-exchange chromatography. Complementation by the purified mutant proteins required the presence of 2 -mercaptoethanol and MnCl 2, and protein-protein titrations indicated that heterodimers were strongly preferred in mixtures of the complementary mutant enzymes. Neither mutant protein showed <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> with wild-type enzyme. The Vmax for hybrid histidinol dehydrogenase was 11 % of that for native enzyme, with only minor changes in Km values for substrate or coenzyme. Both purified mutant proteins failed to catalyze NAD-NADH exchange reactions reflective of the first catalytic step of the two-step reaction. The inactive enzymes bound 54 Mn 2 + weakly or not at all in the presence of 2 -mercaptoethanol, in contrast to wild-type enzyme which bound 54 Mn 2 + to 0. 6 sites per monomer under the same conditions. The mutant proteins, like wild-type histidinol dehydrogenase, behaved as dimers on analytical gel filtration chromatography, but dissociated to form monomers in the presence of 2 -mercaptoethanol. This effect of 2 -mercaptoethanol was prevented by low levels of MnCl 2. It thus appears that mutant histidinol dehydrogenase molecules bind metal ion poorly. The complementation procedure may allow for formation of a functional Mn 2 +-binding site, perhaps at the subunit interface...|$|E
40|$|DNA repair systems able {{to correct}} base pair {{mismatches}} within newly replicated DNA or within heteroduplex molecules produced during recombination are widespread among living organisms. Evidence that such generalized mismatch repair systems {{evolved from a}} common ancestor is particularly strong for two of them, the Hex system of the gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae and the Mut system of the gram-negative Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The homology existing between HexA and MutS and between HexB and MutL prompted us to investigate the effect of expressing hex genes in E. coli. Complementation of mutS or mutL mutations, which confer a mutator phenotype, was assayed by introducing on a multicopy plasmid the hexA and hexB genes, {{under the control of}} an inducible promoter, either individually or together in E. coli strains. No decrease in mutation rate was conferred by either hexA or hexB gene expression. However, a <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> effect was observed in wild-type E. coli cells: expression of hexA resulted in a typical Mut- mutator phenotype. hexB gene expression did not increase the mutation rate either individually or in conjunction with hexA. Since expression of hexA did not affect the mutation rate in mutS mutant cells and the hexA-induced mutator effect was recA independent, it is concluded that this effect results from inhibition of the Mut system. We suggest that HexA, like its homolog MutS, binds to mismatches resulting from replication errors, but in doing so it protects them from repair by the Mut system. In agreement with this hypothesis, an increase in mutS gene copy number abolished the hexA-induced mutator phenotype. HexA protein could prevent repair either by being unable to interact with Mut proteins or by producing nonfunctional repair complexes...|$|E

In most experiments, the infecting phage also had a denA mutation, which abolishes T 4 DNA endonuclease II activity. Mutations in the alc/unf gene (which allow dCMP-containing T 4 late genes to be expressed) further increased complementation efficiency. Most of the alc/unf mutant phage strains used for these experiments were constructed to incorporate a gene 56 mutation, which blocks dCTP breakdown and allows replication to generate dCMP-containing T 4 DNA. Effects of the alc/unf: 56 mutant combination on complementation efficiency varied among the different T 4 late genes. Despite regions of homology, ranging from 2 to 14 kilobase pairs, between cloned T 4 genes and infecting genomes, the rate of formation of recombinants after T 4 den:alc phage infection was generally low (higher for two mutants in gene 23, lower for mutants in gene 7 and 11). More significantly, when gene 23 complementation had to be preceded by recombination, the complementation efficiency was drastically reduced. We conclude that high complementation efficiency of cloned T 4 late genes need not depend on prior complete breakage-reunion events which transpose those genes from the resident plasmid to a late promoter on the infecting T 4 genome. The presence of the intact gene 23 on plasmids reduced the yield of T 4 phage. The magnitude of this <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> effect varied in different plasmids; in the extreme case (plasmid pLA 3), an almost 10 -fold reduction of yield was observed. The cells can thus be said to have been made partly nonpermissive for this lytic virus by incorporating a part of the viral genome...|$|E
40|$|Many {{oligomeric}} enzymes are functional only in {{the assembled}} form, and {{it is often difficult}} to determine unambiguously why monomers are inactive. In some cases individual monomers cannot fold into stable correct ("native") conformations without contributions from interchain interactions. For other oligomers, catalysis requires the contributions of amino acid residues at the interface between adjacent polypeptide chains, and monomers are inactive because they cannot form complete active sites. A test for the presence of shared sites was devised that is based on the formation of active hybrid oligomers from appropriate inactive parental mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis. This approach was applied in a study of the catalytic trimer of aspartate transcarbamoylase (aspartate carbamoyltransferase, EC 2. 1. 3. 2) from Escherichia coli, using three mutants, in which Ser- 52 was replaced by His, Lys- 84 by Gln, or His- 134 by Ala. Hybrid trimers formed from the virtually inactive Ser and Lys mutants were 10 (5) more active than the parental proteins, and the specific activities of each hybrid were about 33 % that of the wild-type trimer, as expected for the scheme based on shared sites. Hybrids from the His and Lys mutants had comparable specific activities. Moreover, one hybrid with approximately 33 % activity had one high-affinity binding site for a bisubstrate analog as compared to about three for wild-type trimer. As a further test, hybrids were also formed from wild-type and double-mutant (Lys- 84 [...] Gln and His- 134 [...] Ala) trimers. The hybrid containing two chains with the double mutation and one wild-type chain had very little activity, and that composed of one double mutant and two wild-type chains had 32 % the specific activity of wild-type trimers. This <b>negative</b> <b>complementation</b> experiment is in quantitative accord with the scheme based on shared sites at or near the interfaces between adjacent chains. The techniques used to demonstrate shared active sites in the catalytic subunits of aspartate transcarbamoylase can be applied generally to various types of oligomers (dimers, tetramers, etc.) to determine whether the participation of amino acid residues from adjoining chains is essential for forming active sites in oligomeric enzymes...|$|E
