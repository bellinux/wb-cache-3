5|$|Hazel: The protagonist, Fiver's brother; {{he leads}} the rabbits from Sandleford and {{eventually}} becomes Chief Rabbit. Though Hazel is not particularly large or powerful, he is loyal, brave, and a quick thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{game that}} is {{isomorphic}} to tic-tac-toe, but on the surface appears completely different. It is called Pick15 or Number Scrabble. Two players in turn say a number between one and nine. A particular number may not be repeated. The game is won by the player who has said three numbers whose sum is 15. If all the numbers are used and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw. Plotting these numbers on a 3×3 magic square shows that the game exactly corresponds with tic-tac-toe, since three numbers will be arranged {{in a straight line}} if and only if they total 15.|$|E
500|$|Randy Miller III, in {{his review}} of the Blu-ray release of the second season for DVD Talk, said that the memory of this season was worse than it {{actually}} was. He criticised the studio's instance at stand-alone episodes but {{said that there was}} a marked improvement about halfway through the season, calling the finale [...] "game-changing". He added {{that at the time of}} the DVD release, he did not feel so positively towards the season and agreed with Holly Ordway's opinion at the time. Ordway had said that the second season sought to be more realistic, but that it feels childish as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> hurt or killed - even in the episode [...] "" [...] which saw a group of colonists defend themselves from renegade Klingons. She called the finale a [...] "giant reset button" [...] on the series, adding that it seemed that the show was about to become a sequel to Voyager but squandering the premise it had been given.|$|E

500|$|Fralic also {{described}} the character as being [...] "quixotic", who is [...] "deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued {{with all the}} failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible {{not only for the}} death of his own heart donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but [...] "like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration". Braeden describes the character as [...] "the villain" [...] and as [...] "defensive and always self-protective", stating that he's [...] "not here to win a popularity contest". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor [...] "more than anything", also describing him as [...] "very complex". Braeden said that [...] "he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago", and that [...] "he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood." [...] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: [...] "Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets out his wallet [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{no obvious}} single origin for {{the plot of}} The Tempest; {{it seems to have}} been created out of an {{amalgamation}} of sources. Since source scholarship began in the 18th century, researchers have suggested passages from Erasmus's Naufragium (1523), (translated into English 1606) and Richard Eden's 1555 translation of Peter Martyr's De orbo novo (1530). In addition, William Strachey's A True Reportory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, an eyewitness report of the real-life shipwreck of the Sea Venture in 1609 on the island of Bermuda while sailing towards Virginia, is considered by most critics to be one of Shakespeare's primary sources because of certain verbal, plot and thematic similarities. Although not published until 1625, Strachey's report, one of several describing the incident, is dated 15 July 1610, and critics say that Shakespeare must have seen it in manuscript sometime during that year. E.K. Chambers identified the True Reportory as Shakespeare's [...] "main authority" [...] for The Tempest, and the modern Arden editors say Shakespeare [...] "surely drew" [...] on Strachey and Montaigne for specific passages in the play. There has been, however, some scepticism about the alleged influence of Strachey in the play. Kenneth Muir argued that although [...] "here is little doubt that Shakespeare had read... William Strachey's True Reportory" [...] and other accounts, [...] "he extent of the verbal echoes of [...] pamphlets has, I think, been exaggerated. There is hardly a shipwreck in history or fiction which does not mention splitting, in which the ship is not lightened of its cargo, in which the passengers do not give themselves up for lost, in which north winds are not sharp, and in which <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> to shore by clinging to wreckage", and {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Strachey's account of the shipwreck is blended with memories of Saint Paul's– in which too not a hair perished– and with Erasmus' colloquy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B. She notes [...] "Sure, there's a price for everything, and in a perfect fairy-tale world, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> away scot-free {{from the consequences of}} their actions. Once Upon A Time is deftly drawing on the show's own history to show how much of a problem that will be for Regina, the only one left who can save the town. She still has enough power to silence both Zelena and Emma this episode, and save Sneezy from his statue state with just a wave of her hand. But even that path isn't as interesting as seeing the town take on one of their own, in a far more intriguing plot development than fighting Cruella De Vil." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stingrays are not {{normally}} visible to swimmers, but divers and snorkelers may {{find them in}} shallow, sandy waters, more so when the water is warm. In the Cayman Islands, several dive sites called Stingray City, Grand Cayman, allow divers and snorkelers to swim with large southern stingrays (D. americana) and feed them by hand. There are many companies that offer these stingray city trips, making it the number one tourist attraction in Grand Cayman. Every year {{hundreds of thousands of}} tourists visit this pristine sandbar, and virtually <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> injured, meaning that these rays are extremely friendly to humans. A [...] "Stingray City" [...] in the sea surrounding the Caribbean island of Antigua consists of a large, shallow reserve where the rays live, and snorkeling is possible, since the rays are used to the presence of humans.|$|E
2500|$|The contestants {{must first}} play a {{preliminary}} round, called [...] "Fastest Finger First" [...] (or, in the U.S. version, simply [...] "Fastest Finger"), {{where they are}} all given a question and four answers from the host and are asked to put those four answers into a particular order; in the first series of the British version and in pre-2003 episodes of the Australian version, the round instead required the contestants to answer one multiple-choice question correctly as quickly as possible. The contestant who does so correctly and in the fastest time goes on to play the main game for the maximum possible prize (often a million units of the local currency). In the event that two or more contestants are tied for the fastest time, those contestants play another question to break the tie. If <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> the question right, that question is discarded and another question is played in the same manner. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music begins.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2007, the Catfish Bend Casino in Burlington, Iowa {{notified}} {{its staff}} that the casino was closing {{and they were}} going to be laid off. David Steward, an employee of seven years, then posted on an office bulletin board the Dilbert strip of October 26, 2007 that compared management decisions to those of [...] "drunken lemurs". The casino called this [...] "very offensive"; they identified him from a surveillance tape, fired him, and tried to prevent him from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. However, an administrative law judge ruled in December 2007 that he would receive benefits, as his action was not intentional misbehavior. Scott Adams said that it might be the first confirmed case of an employee being fired for posting a Dilbert cartoon. On February 20, 2008, the first of a series of Dilbert strips showed Wally being caught posting a comic strip which [...] "compares managers to drunken lemurs". Adams later said that fans should stick to posting Garfield strips, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> fired for that.|$|E

However, in a new work, The New Rules by Dr Catherine Hakim, a British sociologist and author, refers to the United Kingdom arguing that a [...] "sour and rigid English view" [...] of [...] as opposed to the 'wonderful French way' of male infidelity is condemning millions of people to live frustrated [...] "celibate" [...] lives with their spouses.

As to his pass blocking, it noted that he has [...] "the elite agility and nimble feet to protect the quarterback's blindside. Very difficult to turn the corner against because of his lateral movement and solid footwork. Also protects the inside lane well. Delivers a strong hand punch capable of knocking back an opponent .... Uses his length to block his man with one hand and knock an edge blitzer off his path with the other." [...] With regard to his run blocking, it said he is [...] "known as an athletic pass protector, but is a strong blocker". While he exclusively played left tackle in college, he was projected by some as a left tackle and by others as a right tackle.|$|E
