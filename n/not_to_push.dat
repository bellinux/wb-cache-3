5|$|After the First Test, Johnston was {{the leading}} wicket-taker as Australia {{completed}} an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 3/25 in the first innings, before dismissing the home side's top four batsmen in the second innings to reduce them to 4/108; they were eventually bowled out for 169. Johnston ended with 4/49. This {{was followed by a}} drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Johnston scored an unbeaten 15, before bowling almost unchanged in the home side's first innings. Johnston bowled 41.1 out of 90.1 overs and ended with 3/101, including the wickets of Test players Alec Coxon and Watson. The match ended in a draw. Johnston bowled three overs for 15 in the second innings; Bradman chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> for a win and declared late in the second innings so that his bowlers would not have to exert themselves to any significant extent before the next Test.|$|E

Chris meets Nate Kinski and they arrange to go a picnic for their first date. Chris is shocked when Nate attacks a drunk guy for harassing Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), but Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) convinces him to give Nate a second chance. When Chris asks Nate to open up about {{his time in the}} army and Afghanistan, Nate gets {{physical}} with him. Nate promises that it will not happen again and asks Chris <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> him about opening up until he is ready. During Georgia and Kyle's joint hen and bucks night, Chris is punched by an unseen assailant and he hits his head. Kyle and Georgia find him and he is rushed to hospital, and placed in an induced coma. Josh later confesses to punching Chris.

After he is discharged from hospital, Nate becomes Chris's carer. Chris decides to return to work at the garage but is unable to do the work and is sent home. Chris later suffers a seizure and is admitted to hospital. He is forced to quit his job as he can no longer handle the workload due to his injuries. Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), offers Chris a job as a trainee manager at Lassiter's Hotel, which Nate persuades him to accept.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to Protestant Reformation critics, the Council of Trent reaffirmed purgatory as already {{taught by the}} First Council of Lyon, confining itself to the concepts of purification after death and the efficacy of prayers for the dead. It simply affirmed the existence of purgatory and the great value of praying for the deceased, but sternly instructed preachers <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> beyond that and distract, confuse, and mislead the faithful with unnecessary speculations concerning the nature and duration of purgatorial punishments. It thus forbade presentation as Church teaching of the elaborate medieval speculation that had grown up around the concept of purgatory.|$|E

25|$|Construction on the Hubbard House's two-story front {{elevation}} began around 1872 {{at the urging}} of Mrs. Hubbard who felt the family had outgrown the small cottage that occupied the site from 1857 until 1872. Despite her desires and Silas Hubbard's prominent position as the only doctor in Hudson, the family had little money with which to pursue the addition to their home. Hubbard was known <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> his clients for payment. In response, Elbert and his mother pored over Silas' records searching for any one they thought might be able to make payment through labor or construction materials. Elbert, already a considerable salesman by 1872, then rode about McLean County to obtain cash, materials and promises of labor from his father's clientele. Soon the new section of the house was completed.|$|E

President Lincoln and Confederate President Jefferson Davis both maintained hands-off policies when dealing with Kentucky, hoping <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the state into one camp or the other. From the L depot on Ninth and Broadway in Louisville and the steamboats at Louisville wharfs, supporters of the Confederacy sent uniforms, lead, bacon, coffee and war material south. Although Lincoln {{did not want to}} upset Kentucky's neutrality, on July 10, 1861, a federal judge in Louisville ruled that the United States government had the right to stop shipments of goods from going south over the L railroad.|$|E

Houston's rocky decade isn't ignored, but it isn't explored, either: songs allude to Whitney's strength, her willpower as a survivor struggling through some unnamed struggle — enough for listeners to fill in the blanks, either with their own experience or their imaginings of Houston's life.

2500|$|One of the {{farthest}} reaching {{consequences of the}} war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan. The war ended the impressive economic growth Pakistan had experienced since the early 1960s. Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4.82% to 9.86% of GDP, putting a tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy. By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55.66% of government expenditure. According to veterans of the war, the war greatly cost Pakistan economically, politically, and militarily. [...] Nuclear theorist Feroze Khan maintained that the 1965 war was a last conventional attempt to snatch Kashmir by military force, and Pakistan's own position in the international community, especially with the United States, began to deteriorate from the point the war started, while on the other hand, the alliance with China saw improvements. Chairman joint chiefs General Tariq Majid claims in his memoirs that Chou En-Lai had longed advised the government in the classic style of Sun Tzu: [...] "to go slow, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> India hard; and avoid a fight over Kashmir, 'for at least, 20–30 years, until you have developed your economy and consolidated your national power'." [...] General Majid maintained in Eating Grass that the [...] "sane, philosophical and political critical thinking" [...] was missing in Pakistan, and that the country had lost extensive human resources by fighting the war.|$|E

2500|$|Root was {{selected}} for the 2013-14 Ashes series. He {{was selected}} at number 6 for the first Test as Michael Carberry was given the opening batsman role alongside Alastair Cook. Root only managed 2 runs from 7 balls in the first innings before being caught off a Mitchell Johnson delivery. In the second innings he made a steady 26* off 86 balls before running out of partners in England's collapse where Australia took a 1–0 series lead. The second Test in Adelaide saw Root move up the order to third batsman, filling the spot of Jonathan Trott, who had returned home due to stress related illness. [...] He scored only 15 runs, which was the third highest number of runs scored by an England batsman in the first innings, in a disappointing collapse by the English side. However Root's second innings showed some fight as he top scored with 87 and was unlucky <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> on to make a century. England lost this match and went 2–0 down with 3 Tests to play. Root was out controversially for 4 in the first innings of the third Test and made 19 in the second innings, England lost the match {{and as a result}} lost the Ashes. England lost the fourth Test by 8 wickets and went 4–0 down in the series. He was dropped for the fifth Test and fellow Yorkshire teammate Gary Ballance was selected.
