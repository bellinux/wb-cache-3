30|$|In Papatheou <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2015),</b> the {{potential}} of using SCADA data for the condition monitoring of wind turbines was explored. The power curve of each individual wind turbine in a wind farm is produced by a machine learning method using the SCADA data collected from the wind turbine. The constructed power curve of each wind turbine is then used to predict the power curves of other wind turbines. The residual error between the actual and predicted power produced was then used for the condition monitoring of wind turbines. The condition monitoring, fault diagnosis and reliability of major wind turbine components and sub-systems, such as blades (Yang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015),</b> drive trains (Yang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015),</b> power converters (Zhou <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015),</b> gearboxes (Yoon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Du <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015)</b> and bearings (Ming <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Gerber <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015),</b> were well covered by the selected contributions.

While 67 P has a typical red spectral slope, the active areas tend to display bluer spectra (Sierks <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015,</b> Fornasier <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b> We performed a spectral analysis of the active areas and derived spectral characteristics of them, possibly indicating the presence of material enriched in volatiles.

30|$|As {{introduced}} {{earlier in}} this review, a long-term multi-decadal simulation using NICAM with a horizontal 14  km mesh has been achieved (Kodama <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Satoh <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015,</b> 2017; Yamada <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017). The NICAM 14  km AMIP-type simulations were performed for the present climate of 1979 – 2008 and the future climate of 2074 – 2100. The present simulation was analyzed by Kodama <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2015)</b> and Satoh <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2017), while Satoh <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2015)</b> and Yamada <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2017) discussed projection of TCs using {{the present and the}} future simulations. Kodama <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2015)</b> and Satoh <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2015)</b> only used the first 20  years simulation from June 1979 to May 1998, because of the simulation was not finished at the time these papers were published. In this and the next subsections, we review future changes in cloud and precipitation and associated circulation changes, such as TCs and storm tracks, due to global warming using outputs of long-term NICAM simulations.|$|R
30|$|Different topics convey {{different}} sentiment. Sentiment {{analysis can}} be applied to uncover the attitude of different communities toward various issues. We have already applied the sentiment analysis to various domains, such as: (i) to compare the sentiment leaning of different network communities towards various environmental topics (Sluban <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015),</b> (ii) to study the emotional dynamics of Facebook comments on conspiracy theories (Zollo <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015),</b> (iii) to analyze the effects of Twitter sentiment on stock prices (Ranco <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015),</b> (iv) to monitor the sentiment about political parties before and after the elections (Smailović <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015),</b> and (v) to rank the widely used emojis by sentiment (Kralj Novak <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b> In the future we plan to employ sentiment analysis to characterize the sentiment of the EP political groups towards different policy and regulation issues.|$|R
30|$|The aspirates were collected, {{fixed in}} 4 % {{buffered}} formalin, and dehydrated in graded alcohols for paraffin embedding (Frisch <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015</b> a; Rey-Rico <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015</b> a; Venkatesan <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012). Paraffin-embedded sections (5  μm) were stained with hematoxylin eosin (H&E) (cellularity), safranin O (matrix proteoglycans) and alizarin red (matrix mineralization) according to routine protocols (Cucchiarini <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011). Fast green {{was used as}} a counterstain for the evaluations of transduction efficiencies. Expression of type-II and -X collagen was detected by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies (Cucchiarini <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011; Frisch <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015</b> a; Rey-Rico <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015</b> a; Venkatesan <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012). To control for secondary immunoglobulins, samples were processed with omission of the primary antibody. Samples were examined by light microscopy (Olympus BX 45).|$|R
30|$|Azo dyes are a {{group of}} dyes {{with one or more}} azo bonds (‒N=N‒) in their {{structures}} which are estimated around 60 – 70 % of all textile used dyes (Thiam <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Olya <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Dasgupta <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b> Due to their strong stability and high water solubility, treatment of wastewater containing azo dyes is difficult (Dasgupta <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b> Some problems including resistance to aerobic degradation, generation of toxic aromatic amines under anoxic conditions and generation of carcinogenic and mutagenic activities have been reported (Tee <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Wang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015</b> a; Jin <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014; Fan <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b> Therefore, {{in order to protect the}} environment and human health, decolorization of these effluents should be considered.|$|R
30|$|To that end, tissue {{engineering}} strategies including the independent or combinatorial use of cells, scaffolds, and growth factors, have been increasingly investigated {{as a means}} of enhancing the healing response (Moran <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Yu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b> In particular, electrospun nanofibers composed of biodegradable polymers can mimic the topographical and mechanical cues of dense fibrocartilaginous tissues, driving fibrochondrogenic differentiation of seeded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (Baker <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010) and enhancing neotissue formation when placed within a vertical tear in vivo (Baker <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Qu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b> Fisher <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2015)</b> recently fabricated a multilayered cell-seeded nanofibrous scaffold capable of mimicking the anisotropic tensile properties of the meniscus that are derived from the complex organization of circumferential and radial tie fibers (Fox <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b> Similarly, our recent report showed that a cell-seeded electrospun nanofibrous scaffold enhanced the mechanical and histological properties of an in vitro repair model of a radial meniscus tear (Shimomura <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2015).</b>|$|R
