50|$|In the United States, Maine was {{the first}} state to ban the sale of novelty lighters. This ban came about after the son of a Maine fire chief singed his eyebrow on a <b>novelty</b> <b>lighter</b> shaped like a {{baseball}} bat.

The Virginia Legislature recently passed legislation to ban novelty lighters, and is waiting for Virginia Governor Tim Kaine to sign the bill.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States. {{the vast}} {{majority}} of fires caused by children are started with non-novelty lighters and matches (matches are the leading cause of fires started by children). [...] According to the National Association of Fire Marshals, despite attempts to collect statistical evidence concerning the prevalence of <b>novelty</b> <b>lighter</b> fires caused by children, only anecdotal evidence of such fires could be found. Thus, of the 3,168 fires caused by children playing with matches and lighters in 2004 in the United States, no cases were attributed to novelty lighters by the National Association of Fire Marshals. In one such anecdotal case, on September 25, 2007, two toddlers from Russellville, Arkansas, died after setting fire to their apartment with a motorcycle-shaped lighter that was imported illegally. Such tragic cases are often caused by lighters that lack proper child safety mechanisms as mandated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In the United States lighters must be child safe (children under 51 months must be unable to light the lighter with 100 children being used in testing). However, lighters manufactured at a cost higher than $2.50 {{do not have to be}} child safe. The Lighter Association, a lobbying organization pushing for the U.S. Congress to ban novelty lighters, draws its board members from Bic, Scripto, Swedish Match, and Calico Brands (four of the largest non-novelty lighter manufacturers). This constitutes a significant conflict of interest as non-novelty lighter manufacturers have a significant financial incentive to decrease competition from <b>novelty</b> <b>lighter</b> manufacturers despite the lack of statistical evidence that novelty lighters are more dangerous to children than non-novelty lighters.|$|E

5000|$|Bubble {{lights are}} {{a type of}} {{incandescent}} <b>novelty</b> <b>light</b> that acquired some popularity during the 1950s. Their main feature is a sealed glass tube with a colored bubbling liquid inside, created by {{the heat from the}} incandescent light. The fluid within the vial was originally a lightweight oil, but now is methylene chloride for a more consistent bubble effect. While the idea was first demonstrated by Benjamin Franklin, the idea was adapted for use in Christmas lights. They were invented by Carl Otis in 1935, who sold the patents to the NOMA Electric Corporation. There is a long story involving patent fights.

A similar story is told about Ralph E. Morris, who created an electric light set using a telephone switchboard in 1908.

40|$|Abstract Electrolytic lesions {{aimed at}} the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) were made in male Long-Evans rats. Body {{temperature}} (Tb), activity, and drinking were monitored continuously in a 12 -h light: 12 -h dark (12 : 12 LD) cycle at an ambient temperature of 23 &deg;C. Large SCN lesions eliminated activity and drink-ing rhythms and abolished or reduced the circadian rhythm of Tb. The Tb responses of the rats were measured in L after exposure to cold and injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a fever-producing drug, and in both L and D during a 30 -min exposure to a novel cage. Rats with SCN lesions (SCNX) maintained their Tb as well as did controls during 2 -h exposure to 2 &deg;C. They also showed the expected increases in Tb in response to novelty and LPS. Nevertheless, there were differences between SCNX rats and other rats. When measured 9 h after LPS injection, SCNX rats had lower Tb in D than did sham-lesioned or intact rats or rats with lesions that missed the SCN. This is not surprising; the Tb of SCNX rats does not {{go as high as}} that of intact rats in D. However, it was surprising that at night SCNX rats increased their Tb in response to <b>novelty</b> (<b>lights</b> on in the test situation), whereas normal rats did not.
