5|$|Additionally, {{the figures}} from 2012 show that 34.7% of the {{permanent}} resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland (around 2.33 million), had an immigrant background. A third of this population (853,000) held Swiss citizenship. Four fifths of persons with an immigration background were themselves immigrants (first generation foreigners and <b>native-born</b> and naturalised Swiss citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation foreigners and <b>native-born</b> and naturalised Swiss citizens).|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the rising}} Catholic population, Protestants and <b>native-born</b> Americans started {{organizing}} anti-Catholic and nativist groups. The groups, {{many of which}} were established in the early 1840s, distributed anti-Catholic literature or published anti-Catholic newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald (died 731) was {{the ninth}} Archbishop of Canterbury in England. Documentary {{evidence}} names Berhtwald as abbot at Reculver before his election as archbishop. Berhtwald begins the first continuous series of <b>native-born</b> Archbishops of Canterbury, although {{there had been}} previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops, they had not succeeded each other until Berhtwald's reign.|$|E
5|$|Wark {{was born}} in Bathurst, New South Wales, on 27 July 1894, the fourth child of Alexander Wark, a gas {{engineer}} from Scotland, and his <b>native-born</b> wife Blanche Adelaide Maria (née Forde). He was educated at Fairleigh Grammar School, Bathurst, and St. Leonard's Superior Public School before attending Sydney Technical College, where he studied quantity surveying.|$|E
5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and <b>native-born</b> Americans were usually social outcasts who had few other employment options or {{they were trying to}} escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men were recruited by the Navy. It was unlawful for black men to serve in the Navy, but the shortage of men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E
5|$|Even as the {{building}} was under construction, the ethnic makeup of the church's neighborhood was rapidly changing; <b>native-born</b> Baptists were displaced by Irish and German immigrants. As members moved uptown, the congregation decided to follow and sold their building in 1860 to Alanson T. Biggs, a successful local merchant. The departing Baptist congregation founded the Fifth Avenue Baptist church, then founded the Park Avenue Church, and finally built the Riverside Church.|$|E
5|$|James Turner Morehead (May 24, 1797 – December 28, 1854) was a United States Senator and the 12th Governor of Kentucky. He was {{the first}} <b>native-born</b> Kentuckian to hold the {{governorship}} of the state. A member of Henry Clay's National Republican Party, Morehead entered politics just as his party was beginning to challenge the Democratic Party's dominance in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} (2,932 inhabitants in 2012) primarily {{consists of}} <b>native-born</b> Falkland Islanders, {{the majority of}} British descent. Other ethnicities include French, Gibraltarian and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, and Chile has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983, Falkland Islanders are British citizens.|$|E
5|$|Under Evans' leadership, the Klan became {{active in}} Indiana and Illinois, rather than {{focusing}} on the Southeastern U.S. as it had done in the past. It also grew in Michigan, where 40,000 members, more than half its total, lived in Detroit. It became characterized as an organization prominent in urban areas of the Midwest, where it attracted <b>native-born</b> Americans competing for industrial jobs with recent immigrants. It also attracted members in Nebraska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him {{in verse}} survives, {{and may have been}} placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. Little {{evidence}} of extensive cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a St Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of <b>native-born</b> archbishops in England, although there had been two previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury—Deusdedit and Wighard.|$|E
5|$|Deusdedit (died c. 664) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury, the first <b>native-born</b> holder of the see of Canterbury. By birth an Anglo-Saxon, he became {{archbishop}} in 655 {{and held the}} office for more than nine years until his death, probably from plague. Deusdedit's successor as archbishop {{was one of his}} priests at Canterbury. There is some controversy over the exact date of Deusdedit's death, owing to discrepancies in the medieval written work that records his life. Little is known about his episcopate, but he was considered to be a saint after his demise. A saint's life was written after his relics were moved from their original burial place in 1091.|$|E
5|$|In January 1977, Victor diSuvero and {{his firm}} Sapphire-Yogo Mines became the next owner {{to tackle the}} Yogo dike. DiSuvero was a <b>native-born</b> Italian {{who grew up in}} Tientsin, China, and had been {{successful}} with a jade mine in California. DiSuvero's expertise was in marketing: he formed a company called Sapphire Trading to cut and market the Yogos. He had novel marketing ideas but was not knowledgeable about the mining side of the business. Unable to make payments, his venture folded in late 1979.|$|E
5|$|<b>Native-born</b> Puerto Rican (criollos) had {{petitioned the}} Spanish Crown {{to serve in}} the regular Spanish army, {{resulting}} in the 1741 organization of the Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico. The Fijo served in the defense of Puerto Rico and other Spanish overseas possessions, performing in battles in Santo Domingo, other islands in the Caribbean, and South America, most notably in Venezuela. However, Puerto Rican complaints that the Fijo was being used to suppress the revolution in Venezuela caused the Crown to bring the Fijo home and in 1815 it was mustered out of service.|$|E
5|$|Others fled {{and went}} into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm where he was betrayed by a farmer named Francisco Quiñones; he was {{captured}} and executed on the spot. In 1869, fearing another revolt, the Spanish Crown disbanded the Puerto Rican Militia, which had been composed almost entirely of <b>native-born</b> Puerto Ricans, and also the Compañia de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. They then organized the Volunteer Institute, composed entirely of Spaniards and their sons.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{frequent}} moves later spawned {{accusations that}} Chester Arthur {{was not a}} <b>native-born</b> citizen of the United States. When Arthur was nominated for vice president in 1880, a New York attorney and political opponent, Arthur P. Hinman, initially speculated that Arthur was born in Ireland and {{did not come to}} the United States until he was fourteen years old. Had that been true, opponents might have argued that Arthur was constitutionally ineligible for the vice presidency under the United States Constitution's natural-born-citizen clause. When Hinman's original story did not take root, he spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada. This claim, too, failed to gain credence.|$|E
5|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from his ministers {{to resolve this}} issue, Field travelled to England in March 1964 to pursue sovereign statehood, but returned empty-handed a month later. He resigned his position on 13 April; this {{came as no surprise}} to many government insiders, but appeared sudden to most sections of the general public. Smith promptly accepted the cabinet's invitation to take over, though he expressed surprise at the nomination. A farmer and erstwhile British Royal Air Force pilot from the rural town of Selukwe, Smith was Southern Rhodesia's first <b>native-born</b> head of government. He immediately promised to take a harder line on independence than his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to <b>native-born</b> or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A naturalized citizen had the same rights as <b>native-born</b> and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 immigrants in the eight years he had been on the bench.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which <b>native-born</b> workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper published a letter, purportedly from Garfield {{to a group of}} businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that industry could keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.|$|E
5|$|<b>Native-born</b> long jumper Herbert McGregor {{represented}} Jamaica at the Beijing Olympics, and was {{the only}} male long jumper involved in his event. He was 26 {{years old at the}} time of his entrance into the Olympics, having not previously participated at any Olympic games. The qualification round for men's long jump took place on August 16, where McGregor competed in the second heat. The long jumper was given three attempts. During the first, McGregor jumped 7.64meters, setting his highest time of the three attempts; he ranked fifteenth in his heat with that score. His second attempt (7.46meters) and his third attempt (7.36meters) were discounted in favor of his best mark. Overall, McGregor ranked 30 out of the 38 athletes who received a score, falling behind Morocco's Tarik Bouguetaib (7.69meters) and placing ahead of Denmark's Morten Jensen (7.63meters). He did not participate in the final round, which was held on August 18.|$|E
5|$|Pitman was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father {{was white and}} his <b>native-born</b> mother was also part Caucasian from her own mother, who was the {{daughter}} of Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{credible}} {{descriptions of}} smallpox-like {{disease in the}} Americas before the westward exploration by Europeans in the 15th century AD. Smallpox was introduced into the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1509, and into the mainland in 1520, when Spanish settlers from Hispaniola arrived in Mexico bringing smallpox with them. Smallpox devastated the native Amerindian population and was {{an important factor in}} the conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas by the Spaniards. Settlement of the east coast of North America in 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts was also accompanied by devastating outbreaks of smallpox among Native American populations, and subsequently among the <b>native-born</b> colonists. Case fatality rates during outbreaks in Native American populations were as high as 80–90%. Smallpox was introduced into Australia in 1789 and again in 1829. Although the disease was never endemic on the continent, it was the principal cause of death in Aboriginal populations between 1780 and 1870.|$|E
5|$|With its {{connection}} through the Ohio River to the east, the Mississippi {{to the south}} and north, and the Missouri to the west, St. Louis was ideally located to become the main base of interregional trade. In the 1840s, it became a destination for massive immigration by Irish and Germans. Some <b>native-born</b> Americans reacted with fear to the newcomers, adopting nativist sentiments. Missouri was a slave state, but the city's proximity to free states caused it to become a center for the filing of freedom suits. Many slaves gained freedom through such suits in the antebellum years. But, by the 1850s and the Dred Scott case, interpretations had changed and the US Supreme Court ruled against him. It also ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, contributing to the tensions causing the American Civil War. During the War, St. Louis had a small skirmish on its outskirts, but was held under Union control.|$|E
5|$|In January 1821, Iturbide began peace {{negotiations}} with Guerrero, suggesting they unite {{to establish an}} independent New Spain. The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became {{the basis of the}} Plan of Iguala: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its existing privileges; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or <b>native-born.</b> The following month the other important guerrilla leader, Guadalupe Victoria, joined the alliance, and March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief Juan O'Donojú, who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in Veracruz on July 1, 1821; but he found that royalists the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and Acapulco. Since at the time that O'Donojú had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donojú proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting Treaty of Córdoba, which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'Donojú became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of Córdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Itrubide.|$|E

Immigrants to Israel who later left were not counted. Danny Gadot of the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles claimed that although some 600,000-750,000 Israelis were estimated to living in the United States, many were not <b>native-born</b> and in fact the children of Israeli expatriates, as the children of Israelis born abroad are counted as Israeli citizens. That year, it was reported that yerida had hit a 40-year low, while the number of Israelis returning from abroad had increased.|$|E

Chiang Ching-kuo, although a mainlander, pronounced that he was also a Taiwanese and also introduced many <b>native-born</b> Taiwanese people into top echelons of the party. He also named Lee Teng-hui, a <b>native-born</b> Taiwanese, as his vice president and likely successor. In 1986, the permission to form new political parties was granted, and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was inaugurated as the first opposition party.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{possible}} explanations for why newcomers earn less than native Canadians in the same jobs with the same skills. Lower hourly wages might be an indication that the labour productivity of immigrants is lower, and employers thus have reason to pay them less. New workers are also less familiar with the Canadian labour market and will thus not be able to maximize their salaries. Employers will also be less familiar with an immigrant's background and thus less willing to offer the same salary as to a native. Immigrants, especially visible minorities have different values than <b>native-born</b> Canadians as they tend to favour living in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver as opposed to other places much more than <b>native-born</b> Canadians. Due to lower mobility, they do not access better paying jobs, such as in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This has been changing with Calgary already surpassing Montreal in terms of percentage of visible minorities. Visible minorities in Saskatchewan earn higher wages than <b>native-born</b> Canadians.|$|E

25|$|Most Coloradans {{are native}} {{to other states}} (nearly 60% {{according}} to the 2000 census), and this {{is illustrated by the}} fact that the state did not have a <b>native-born</b> governor from 1975 (when John David Vanderhoof left office) until 2007, when Bill Ritter took office; his election the previous year marked the first electoral victory for a <b>native-born</b> Coloradan in a gubernatorial race since 1958 (Vanderhoof had ascended from the Lieutenant Governorship when John Arthur Love was given a position in Richard Nixon's administration in 1973). In the 2016 election, the Democratic party won the Colorado electoral college votes.|$|E
