5|$|The {{earliest}} known botanical {{collection of}} B.verticillata {{was made by}} Scottish surgeon and naturalist Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791.

5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|Another known form {{of solid}} {{tetravalent}} americium chloride is KAmF5. Tetravalent americium {{has also been}} observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum {{which is similar to}} that of AmF4 but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90°C did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|At noon on May 6, 1955, Conant, {{along with}} the high commissioners from Britain and France, signed the {{documents}} ending Allied control of West Germany, admitting it to NATO, and allowing it to rearm. The office of the United States High Commissioner was abolished and Conant became instead the first United States Ambassador to West Germany. His role was now to encourage West Germany to build up its forces, while reassuring the Germans that doing so would <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in a United States withdrawal. Being fluent in German, Conant {{was able to give}} speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.|$|E

5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 has {{a notable}} orbital arrangement. It {{is the first}} {{planetary}} system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination of the planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced {{the value of the}} mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in significant improvements relative to coplanar solutions.|$|E
5|$|In the Treaty of Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} to cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in a reversal of the costly earlier peace. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E

5|$|Instead, he practised a {{different}} style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.|$|E
5|$|Kronprinz saw limited duty {{during the}} Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. Engine {{troubles}} aboard the ship, {{along with the}} two other armored frigates in her squadron, prevented operations against the French blockade. Only two sorties in which Kronprinz participated were conducted, both of which did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in combat. The ship served in the subsequent Imperial Navy until she was converted into a training ship for boiler room personnel in 1901. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Loring {{also had}} its share of {{incidents}} that did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker crashed and burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed. On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on the ground at Loring and was destroyed. On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The cause was a frozen water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{approved}} a secret B-52 carpet bombing campaign of North Vietnamese (and, later, allied Khmer Rouge) positions in Cambodia in March 1969 (code-named Operation Menu), {{without the consent}} of Cambodian leader Norodom Sihanouk. In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> in an agreement. In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation.|$|E
