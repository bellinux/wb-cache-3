40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} generalize the Kleene theorem {{from the free}} monoid to richer {{algebraic}} structures, we consider the <b>non</b> deterministic <b>acceptance</b> by a finite automaton of subsets of vertices of a graph. The subsets accepted {{in such a way}} are the equational subsets of vertices of the graph in the sense of Mezei and Wright. We introduce the notion of deterministic acceptance by finite automaton. A graph satisfies the Kleene equality if the two acceptance modes are equivalent, and in this case, the equational subsets form a Boolean algebra. We establish that the infinite grid and the transition graphs of deterministic pushdown automata satisfy the Kleene equality and we present families of graphs in which the free product of graphs preserves the Kleene equality...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the compliments used by {{the characters in the}} film entitled “The Holiday”. This research was conducted to describe the types of topics of compliment employed by the characters in the film entitled “The Holiday”, the functions of each type of topics of compliment, and also the compliment responses expressed by the addressees in the film. This research is a descriptive qualitative research. This research uses pragmatic approach. The technique of sampling used is total sampling. All conversations containing compliments and the compliment responses were taken as the data. Based on the data analysis, the researcher draws conclusions as follows: There are four types of topics of compliments employed by the characters in the film entitled “The Holiday”. They are topic of personal appearance, topic of possession, topic of general ability, and topic of specific-act ability. Based on Wolfson’s classification of compliment functions, there are six functions of compliment proposed by Wolfson found in this research. They are: to affirm solidarity, to create or maintain rapport, to express admiration or approval, to encourage, to express positive evaluation, and also to strengthen or replace other speech act formulas. In responding the compliments, most of the addressees accept the compliments. The response acceptance of the compliment includes verbal and <b>non</b> verbal <b>acceptance.</b> In verbal acceptance, the addresses deliver the word thanks to respond to the speaker’s compliment. Meanwhile, the addressees respond to the compliment by smiling in the <b>non</b> verbal <b>acceptance.</b> Other upgrade, down grade, reassignment, question, and giving no acknowledgement. In the comment acceptance, the addressees accept the compliment and offer a relevant comment on the compliment. In the praise upgrade, the addressee accepts and asserts insufficiently of the compliment’s force. Meanwhile, in down grade, the compliment is not worth. In response of question, the addressee questions the sincerity or the appropriateness of the speaker’s compliment. Finally, in No Acknowledgment, the addressees give no indication of having heard the compliment, shift the topic, and even give no response. Based on the conclusions above, the researcher hopes that this research will give a contribution to the students in studying the speech act of compliments. There are still many cases on the study of compliments. It is suggested to other researchers who are interested in compliment speech act to conduct a further research on compliment structure and its vocabulary. ...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to the doctor - patient relationship concentrate on the professionals’ guidance and external control. Instead the more modern approaches have seen an increase of emphasis on the patients self – determination. But these normative approaches are hardly adequate {{within the context of}} clinical practice. The interactions between doctors and patients need to be analysed during everyday clinical practice. My focus is on how the interactions between assistant doctors and patients, who have experienced psychosis, contribute to the handling of external control and self – determination. My understanding of the term interaction is informed by the theory of symbolic interactionism, Strauss’ concept of contextuality and Bourdieus’ concept of habitus. I am using participant observation and problem - centered interviews as instruments for data collection. Grounded Theory is used for evaluation. In advance I shall complete a global evaluation, and I am using the computer - assisted ATLAS. ti system. The data evaluation highlights the influences of the context, and the aspects that determine the actions of assistant doctors, patients and others involved are analysed. The patients need to be differentiated from each other by type. A paternalistic orientated action and treatment is central during the interactions between paternalistic, protection - seeking patients and their assistant doctors. In cases where patients are looking for participation and helpful interventions, the creation and implementation of a shared treatment plan is key. Finally one can divide the interactions between self – determination, freedom - orientated patients and assistant doctors into compulsory treatment, the exploitation of a growing silence and the creation of an island of self – determination and compliance. Of further relevance – and independent of patient type – are the offering and <b>acceptance</b> or <b>non</b> - <b>acceptance</b> of a comfortable atmosphere, as well as the central phenomenon called masking external control. Within the discussion I interpret the data as neopaternalistic interactions. I demonstrate that the present normative approaches are insufficient. The handling of external control and self – determination should be analysed further in other contexts...|$|R

With the connotation of causal security bonds, besides the essential elements, {attributed to Cesare Vivante}: meaning literally, a negotiable instrument and autonomy, and the <b>non</b> essential ones: <b>acceptance,</b> collateral signature and endorsement, now said as interna corporis, trivial to this work, as a temporal boundary towards its liability, we are now talking about the essential elements named externa corporis {attributed to Francesco Carnelutti}: liquidity, certainty and liability, and same way the externa corporis, the non essential elements are also identified (collateral guaranty). Through this new approach, the causal security bonds are made of corpus and animus. The corpus is the negotiable instrument but the animus is only conceived through its external elements which introduce eventual effects from causality. Therefore security bonds without animus are equivalent to a human being without soul (without financial support). The externa corporis, collateral guaranty, described as new vestments of the credit both are specified, one as real security and the other as personal security. It should be remembered that among real security we have the pawn and mortgage (estate the debtor offers) and attachment (the right the creditor has against the debtor in a legal action). In a new situation, regarding the logical premises of personal securities it should be mention the guaranty without preferences (debtor ownership estate) and the personal security (linked to third party ownership). ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Anorexia nervosa is {{a serious}} illness with {{significant}} morbidity. The evidence base for existing psychological and pharmacological interventions to manage anorexia nervosa is not strong, and use of new adjunctive therapies that improve the effectiveness of existing treatments, and lead to improved mental health outcomes for this patient group is highly desirable. This study investigates the views of patients with anorexia nervosa receiving an acupuncture or acupressure intervention. Method: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in Sydney, Australia. Twenty-six inpatients with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa were randomised to a six week intervention of acupuncture or acupressure with light massage. Treatment was administered twice weekly for three weeks, then weekly for three weeks. A post treatment questionnaire was administered to explore participant views, of the study consultation. Questions examined {{important aspects of the}} clinical encounter including the, patient's perception of the practitioners' relational empathy (CARE), treatment perceptions and the, therapeutic relationship. Results: Participants in both groups scored highly on the CARE scale assessing empathy and the, therapeutic relationship. There was no difference in the mean CARE scores for the acupuncture group (50 (SD 0. 0)) and the acupressure group (49. 5 (SD 0. 8)). Participants highly valued the therapeutic, encounter and in particular the characteristics of empathy, positive regard, <b>acceptance,</b> <b>non,</b> judgemental responses and trust.

In the first year of Premier League football the club surprised many of the well established teams throughout the season. The team finished only a few points away from the top four.The second season (2006) was strangely, a greater challenge than the first. Several experienced players left the club as they pursued other personal challenges. These players were difficult to replace, particularly for the defence. The club also had to allow for players under the age of 20 as per regulations, so the Premier League team was significantly more inexperienced than the team from the previous season. The team struggled but the season was extremely valuable for the next generation of players.During 2006 Capital Football undertook a review of the Premier League with a view to restructuring the competition. The competition was dissolved so no clubs remained part of the Premier League. All the Premier League clubs and some Division 1 clubs were invited to apply for the new competition. For clubs to do so they were required to submit a 3-year Business Plan outlining for financial administration and technical development of players.Unfortunately the Premier League experience ends there as Capital Football moved the goal posts, again. The White Eagles were unsuccessful in retaining their position for the premier league as the Club did not have a sufficient junior base which was one of the requirements that Capital Football initiated.Club officials quickly moved to rectify the issue by forming a relationship with a junior club. An appeal was submitted to Capital Football addressing the issue but Capital Football, despite acknowledging that the issue had been addressed successfully, still denied the club a place in the Premier League and suggested that the clubs maintain their relationship and be prepared to apply for the Premier League in the future.Regardless of the setback of Premier League <b>non</b> <b>acceptance</b> the Club fought on and produced another successful season by winning the 2007 Division 1 Championship, the club’s 3rd Championship in 5 years.The team repeated the feat the following season in 2008 winning yet another all-to-familiar State League 1 title.They were also Minor Premiers in 2009 where they lost to Cooma in the final and in 2010 before losing the Grand Final to Queanbeyan FC 1-0.|$|E

Public good morality is defined as the (<b>non)</b> <b>acceptance</b> of behaviour that contravenes the law and harms society and the greater good of the collective, such as cheating on taxes if one has the chance, paying cash to avoid taxes, not paying one’s fare in public transport, and claiming state benefits one is not entitled to. Using data from the European Values Study in 2008 on more than 30, 000 respondents in 23 post-socialist states, we find that on average the level of public good morality is quite high: 8. 4 on a ten-point scale. However, there are marked differences between individuals and between countries, which we attempt to explain by looking at the legacy of communist rule, processes of democratization and compliance attitudes. We find that individuals living in former Soviet states are more ‘lenient’ when it comes to actions that harm the collective. However, those who lived under communist rule for a longer time display higher (and not lower) levels of public good morality. The level of democracy in a country does not seem to add any explanatory power, but individuals who hold more democratic values appear to be morally less strict. Finally, compliance attitudes such as interpersonal trust and confidence in government do not seem to mediate the observed relationships between communist rule and democracy {{on the one hand and}} public good morality on the other hand...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to gain an insight into factors that hinder a positive therapy outcome and to determine which factors are considered most important from a patient perspective. It was expected that psychopathologic-, somatic-, psychological-, behavioral- and social factors would be identified as impeding. Social factors were expected to be considered the most important barrier. Interviews (n= 12) and a card sorting task (n= 10) among former patients of Altrecht Psychosomatiek Eikenboom (APS) were conducted. Hierarchical cluster analysis yielded 4 clusters: ‘attitude of therapists’, ‘organizational aspects’, ‘individual factors’ and ‘group factors’. The content of clusters could confirm the expectations that psychological factors like <b>non</b> <b>acceptance,</b> high expectations, absence of hope, catastrophizing and concern over symptoms, behavioral factors like passiveness and social factors like interpersonal problems and perception of low social support can impede a positive therapy outcome. In addition to these findings the attitude of therapists, organizational aspects in therapy, individual and group factors are also mentioned as impeding. Organizational aspects were considered the most important barrier. However, individual differences were large and suggest that barriers are far from the same for everyone.

Such verifications made us think about the hypothesis that, on one side, there may be durable dispositions incorporated in the teachers, in other words, facets of habitus relative to the educational profession that command their vision on the continuous formation courses, taking them to practices that affect the interpretation and assimilation of new information. But, on the other hand, it is possible that there are also dispositions that go altering and restructuring starting from each person's relationships in the circumstances of the courses. In this perspective, the collectivized continuous education can be considered a favorable space to investigate how the socialization happens among teachers. Unmasking this space can contribute to the understanding of educational professionalization...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pertussis {{cocooning}} {{is one of}} {{the strategies}} aiming to prevent the potential harm of pertussis in infants by vaccinating (among others) their parents. Several countries adopted this strategy, but uptake is a problem. Determinants of parental uptake are important in the design of an effective vaccination programme. Therefore, this study aims to assess parents' intention to accept a pertussis cocooning vaccination and its determinants. METHODS: A 98 item questionnaire was developed based on a theoretical framework, assessing parents' intention to accept a pertussis cocooning vaccination and its personal and psychosocial determinants. In addition, beliefs underlying parents' attitude towards pertussis cocooning vaccination were assessed. Both logistic and linear regression analysis were used to assess univariate and multivariate associations amongst study variables. RESULTS: Parents returned 282 questionnaires. The majority of the parents (78 %) reported a positive intention to accept a pertussis cocooning vaccination. Attitude (OR 6. 6, p<. 001), anticipated negative affect in response to <b>non</b> <b>acceptance</b> (OR 1. 65, p<. 001), anticipated negative affect in response to acceptance (OR 0. 55, p. 040) and decisional uncertainty (OR 0. 52, p. 002) were significantly associated with intention. General vaccination beliefs (beta 0. 58, p<. 001), moral norm (beta 0. 22, p<. 001), perceived susceptibility of pertussis in children (beta 0. 10, p. 004), and efficacy outcome expectations (beta 0. 15, p. 011) were significant correlates of attitude towards pertussis cocooning vaccination. CONCLUSION: The parental intention to accept a pertussis cocooning vaccination in this study is rather high. Targeting the identified determinants of parents' acceptance in a pertussis cocooning vaccination programme is crucial to secure that intention is translated into actual vaccination uptake...|$|E
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} a decade since the year 2007 was {{dedicated}} towards painless motherhood. However the use and acceptance of labor analgesia is still very rare in developing countries. Objective: The present study was aimed to assess the knowledge, acceptance and reasons for rejection of labor analgesia among the expectant mothers. Methods: The present observational study was conducted after approval from the institute. All antenatal women who attended antenatal clinic were approached during January to March 2017. Data was collected from the consented women using a pretested questionnaire. Data were expressed in absolute numbers and percentage scale. Measures of central tendencies were calculated for quantitative data using INSTAT software and p < 0. 05 was considered significant for comparison. Results: Response from 280 women with mean ± SD age and gestational age of 25. 49 ± 4. 89 years and 28. 25 ± 8. 75 weeks respectively were analyzed. 126 were primi or multiparous; 56 graded labor pain as unbearable yet only 30 (23. 81 %) wanted labor analgesia. Only 20 (7. 14 %) prospective mothers were having knowledge of labor analgesia. The nulliparous wanted significantly less labor analgesia compared to primi and multiparous (p 0. 003). Desire to bear natural birth was the commonest reason to refuse painless labor. One quarter of the participants believed that labor analgesia was bad for child and against the will of God. Conclusion: Knowledge and acceptance of labor analgesia is poor although women who had previous experience were significantly more inclined towards it. Misinformation and myths is also a major contributor for <b>non</b> <b>acceptance</b> of labor analgesia...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme on Professional Development of Library and Information Science Students in South-West, Nigeria. Descriptive research design was adopted for the study and total enumeration sampling technique was used to select 277 respondents covering three institutions; Adeleke University, Ede Osun state, University of Ibadan, Ibadan and Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijebu Ode, Ogun state. The respondents are students who have gone through student industrial experience scheme. Questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. Data collected was analysed using descriptive statistics and simple percentages. Findings revealed that majority of LIS students understudied had their trainings in the libraries. The facilities available at the places of training included: computer laboratories, internet services, e-libraries and audio-visuals. Computer laboratory and internet facilities had the greatest frequencies 207 (93. 7 %) each These accounted for the students’ perceptions that SIWES influences professional development positively with response rate of 216 (97. 7 %) agreement, and that SIWES exposed them to new work methods also with response rate of 216 (97. 7 %) agreement. It was also discovered that SIWES provides avenue for technical skill development with response rate of 208 (94. 1 %) in agreement. Noticeable challenges facing SIWES include finance, students’ placements {{as a result of}} <b>non</b> <b>acceptance</b> of students by some employers into their establishments, inadequate supervision of trainees as well as irregularity in academic calendar of institutions among others. It was recommended that institutions and other stakeholders should look keenly into the modalities and operations of the scheme to allow the scheme achieve its stated objectives...|$|E
40|$|Research Questions: 1. To {{what extent}} do rural {{eligible}} couples accept the small family norm? 2. What are the factors which influence the adoption of small family norm by these couples? Objectives: 1. To {{determine the extent of}} adoption of small norm among family planning service acceptors (2) To identify factors influencing adoption of small family norm. Study Design: Cross sectional Study Setting: 2 villages- a PHC village and one 5 kms away of Block Sonarpur. Participants: 312 eligible couples of these villages. Study Variables: Socio &#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;" economics status, literacy of the wives, type of family, religion, number of children, type of family planning method. Outcome Variables: Prevalence of contraceptive method use, reasons for not using family planning methods. Statistical Analysis: Proportions Results : The prevalence of contraceptive use was 44. 9 &#x 0025; but the Effective Couple Protection Rate was only 20. 5 &#x 0025; and the Crude Birth Rate was still high (35 / 1000). This was because 40 &#x 0025; of the couples had more then 2 children and of them 38 &#x 0025; were still exposed to the risk of conception. Muslim couples had a lower contraceptive acceptance rate than Hindu couples. The more literate the wife, the greater the acceptance of the small family norm. Male preference pressure from elders and fear about contraception were the main reasons for <b>non</b> <b>acceptance</b> of family planning methods: The health teams were the main source of information to these couples. Recommendations: There is an urgent need to increase the emphasis on the 2 child family norm. The IEC activities of the health team should be strengthened...|$|E
