6000|$|By {{the time}} I had {{discovered}} that a profusion of <b>nickel-plating,</b> plush, and damask does not compensate for closeness and dust, the train ran into the daylight {{on the banks of}} the Sacramento River. A few windows were gingerly opened after the bunks had been reconverted into seats, but that long coffin-car was by no means ventilated, and we were a gummy, grimy crew who sat there. At six in the morning the heat was distinctly unpleasant, but seeing with the eye of the flesh that I was in Bret Harte's own country, I rejoiced. There were the pines and madrone-clad hills his miners lived and fought among; there was the heated red earth that showed whence the gold had been washed; the dry gulch, the red, dusty road where Hamblin was used to stop the stage in the intervals of his elegant leisure and superior card-play; there was the timber felled and sweating resin in the sunshine; and, above all, there was the quivering pungent heat that Bret Harte drives into your dull brain with the magic of his pen. When we stopped at a collection of packing-cases dignified by the name of a town, my felicity was complete. The name of the place was something offensive,--Amberville or Jacksonburgh,--but it owned a cast-iron fountain worthy of a town of thirty thousand. Next to the fountain was a [...] "hotel," [...] at least seventeen feet high including the chimney, and next to the hotel was the forest--the pine, the oak, and the untrammelled undergrowth of the hillside. A cinnamon-bear cub--Baby Sylvester in the very fur--was tied to the stump of a tree opposite the fountain; a pack-mule dozed in the dust-haze, a red-shirted miner in a slouch hat supported the hotel, a blue-shirted miner swung round the corner, and the two went indoors for a drink. A girl came out of the only other house but one, and shading her eyes with a brown hand stared at the panting train. She didn't recognise me, but I knew her--had known her for years. She was M'liss. She never married the schoolmaster, after all, but stayed, always young and always fair, among the pines. I knew Red-Shirt too. He was one of the bearded men who stood back when Tennessee claimed his partner from the hands of the Law. The Sacramento River, a few yards away, shouted that all these things were true. The train went on while Baby Sylvester stood on his downy head, and M'liss swung her sun-bonnet by the strings.|$|E

At a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode however, complete decomplexing and high COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and TOC (Total Organic Carbon) (up to 95 %) removal occurred at an average current density of 2 A dm- 2. It is shown that direct electrochemical oxidation at a BDD electrode resulted in lower energy consumption and higher treatment rates than indirect oxidation at a Ti-RuO 2 electrode. Decomplexing at the BDD electrode occurred at high current efficiencies ranging from 71 % to 95 % with decomplexing rates in the order of 3. 13 mmol (Ah) - 1 and 5. 02 mmol (Ah) - 1 for EDTA and NTA respectively.

The oxidation and activation processes were examined using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray Diffractometry (XRD). XPS analysis showed that HNO 3 oxidation improved the O/C ratio of the CF surface, which resulted {{in an increase in}} the amount of oxygen-containing groups.

Precision polishing of micro structured mold {{has been}} highly demanded {{due to the}} increasing demand for optics manufacturing such as solar optics and DVD pick-up system, and medical devices like µ-TAS [1 - 5]. These micro structured molds usually have complicated structure {{and need to be}} polished after grinding or cutting.

By driving the PZT in sine wave with particular phase different, dual direction trajectory such as circle can be achieved, and is proved to be effective in precision mold polishing [8].
