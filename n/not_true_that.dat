It is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> neurons are not {{replaced}} {{after the age of}} two; nor that only ten per cent of the brain is used. Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain, suggesting that functions are completely specific {{to one side of the}} brain or the other. Akio Mori coined the term game brain for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed the brain's pre-frontal region and the expression of emotion and creativity.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the {{scientific}} revolution the qualitative world of book-reading philosophers had been changed into a mechanical, mathematical world to be known through experimental research. Though it is certainly <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Newtonian science was like modern science in all respects, it conceptually resembled ours in many ways. Many of the hallmarks of modern science, especially with regard to its institutionalization and professionalization, did not become standard until the mid-19th century.|$|E

25|$|This is not, {{however, the}} typical case. For the example, {{we have a}} {{canonical}} form available that reduces any string to one of length at most three, by decreasing the length monotonically. In general, it is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> one can get a canonical form for the elements, by stepwise cancellation. One may have to use relations to expand a string many-fold, in order eventually to find a cancellation that brings the length right down.|$|E
25|$|Which means: if P and its {{negation}} ¬P {{are both}} {{assumed to be}} true, then P {{is assumed to be}} true, from which it follows {{that at least one of}} the claims P and some other (arbitrary) claim A is true. However, if we know that either P or A is true, and also that P is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> (<b>that</b> ¬P is true) we can conclude that A, which could be anything, is true. Thus if a theory contains a single inconsistency, it is trivial—that is, it has every sentence as a theorem.|$|E
25|$|Although Xp {{necessarily}} includes {{at least}} one forest, it is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> all graphs in Xp are forests: for instance, X1 consists of two graphs, a seven-vertex tree and the triangle K3. However, the set of trees in Xp may be precisely characterized: these trees are exactly the trees that can be formed from three trees in X'p−1 by connecting a new root vertex by an edge to an arbitrarily chosen vertex {{in each of the}} three smaller trees. For instance, the seven-vertex tree in X1 is formed in this way from the two-vertex tree (a single edge) in X0. Based on this construction, the number of forbidden minors in X'p can be shown to be at least (p!)2. The complete set X2 of forbidden minors for pathwidth-2 graphs has been computed; it contains 110 different graphs.|$|E

25|$|On August 6 and August 7, the Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited Dubrovnik, {{which was}} {{followed}} by fires in that area. It prompted some county officials to make arson accusations against {{the nearby town of}} Trebinje in the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mario Magud, the firefighting commander in Konavle, said: There are no firemen on the Trebinje side. Everything indicates that they set the fire themselves with the intention to burn Konavle and beyond. It's not a coincidence that, as soon as we localize one fire, a new fire breaks out.. Luka Korda, the chief of Konavle municipality, made similar accusations. The Bosnian civil defense secretary Stanko Slišković said it was <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the Bosnian firemen did not do anything to prevent fires in the border area near Dubrovnik: Our people made the greatest effort to fight every fire where it was possible. Nobody can say with certainty where a fire started... I'm sorry this happened and I understand the indignation of the citizens of Dubrovnik, but it's not our fault. He claimed that the Bosnian civil defense cooperated well with their Croatian counterparts and said that the Bosnian forces could not fight the fires in the inaccessible or mined areas.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E

Waskow wrote that the specific allegations in the paragraph concerning [...] "the Israeli government's behavior and its effects in the US are largely accurate BUT—factually, it is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the State of Israel has committed, is committing, genocide upon the Palestinian people."

500|$|Three years earlier, in {{the review}} [...] "Mr. Kean's Iago" [...] in The Examiner (7 August 1814), Hazlitt had ventured to {{speculate}} that Iago's suggestions of lasciviousness in Desdemona may have had some basis in truth, as [...] "purity and grossness sometimes 'nearly are allied,/And thin partitions do their bounds divide. Although he omitted this thought from Characters of Shakespear's Plays, that did not stop an anonymous reviewer in Blackwood's Magazine from accusing him of calling Desdemona a [...] "lewd" [...] character. In [...] "A Reply to 'Z, written in 1818 but never published, Hazlitt answers his accuser: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> I have insinuated that Desdemona was a lewd woman, any more than Shakespear has insinuated it, but I have dared {{to say that he}} alone could have given additional elegance and even delicacy to a female character from the very disadvantageous circumstances in which Desdemona is placed." ...|$|E
500|$|On 11 April 1913, the cricket {{pavilion}} was burnt down by militant suffragettes due to Kent {{having a}} policy of no-admittance to women. The fire was started in the dressing rooms with the perpetrator setting fire to cricket nets that were being stored in there. The fire was discovered by a passing lamplighter. The fire brigade extinguished the fire in an hour, {{too late to save}} the pavilion. In front of the remains of the pavilion, firemen found suffragette literature, an electric lantern and a picture of Emmeline Pankhurst. The fire also destroyed photographs of the first Canterbury Cricket Week and the Bluemantle Cricket Club's archives. The attack may have been provoked by a comment from an unknown Kent official who is reported to have said [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> women are banned from the pavilion.

500|$|Both Miller and Lillian Lorraine {{threatened}} {{legal action}} if {{so much as}} their names were mentioned in the film. Thus Miller's character was renamed [...] "Sally Manners", and Lorraine's character was renamed [...] "Audrey Dane" [...] (played by Virginia Bruce). In real life, Ziegfeld had reportedly been obsessed with Miller, and was involved in numerous sex scandals. In 1922 Miller had given an interview in which she accused him of [...] "making love to chorus girls" [...] and sending her a diamond ring as [...] "big as her hand"; this essence of Ziegfeld's character is captured in the film. Incidentally, Miller died from toxicity complications after surgery just before {{the release of the}} film on April 7, 1936, which led one reviewer writing in Liberty to denounce an urban legend which had arisen surrounding the timing of her death, saying, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Marilyn Miller died of a broken heart at not getting the lead in this." [...] Another myth surrounding her untimely death at the age of 37 is that she had contracted syphilis.|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How can I {{take seriously}} a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That {{sounds to me}} like a very insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E
