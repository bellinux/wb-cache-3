2500|$|Du Bois {{observed}} {{that it is}} not so much [...] "race" [...] that we think about, but culture: [...] "...a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life". Late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on [...] "race", ethnicity, and [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] to shape new nationalist doctrines. Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation. According to this view, culture is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to <b>nationality</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of Nordicism, the denomination [...] "Germanic" [...] was equivalent to superiority of race.|$|E

Moreover, the reports from the field also showed that even within the same family there often seemed to be some confusion about these terms. Since problems of this type had been reported by the teams of observers in many different parts of the country, and in fairly large number, the expert group concluded that special care would be required by the National Statistics Bureau to enable it to assess the quality of the data on nationality/ethnicity.|$|E
