50|$|A jet exhaust {{produces}} a net thrust from the energy obtained from combusting fuel which {{is added to}} the inducted air. This hot air passes through a high speed <b>nozzle,</b> a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle,</b> which enormously increases its kinetic energy.|$|R
50|$|A {{rocket engine}} <b>nozzle</b> is a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> (usually of the de Laval type) {{used in a}} rocket engine to expand and {{accelerate}} the combustion gases produced by burning propellants so that the exhaust gases exit the nozzle at hypersonic velocities.|$|R
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.|$|R
50|$|Bypass ducts {{deliver the}} {{flow from the}} fan with minimum losses to the bypass <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Alternatively the fan flow may be mixed with the turbine exhaust before {{entering}} a single <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> In another arrangement an afterburner may be installed between the mixer and nozzle.|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} performance {{task for}} a single shaft turbojet is to match {{the operation of the}} compressor, turbine and <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> For example, the way the compressor operates is determined by the flow resistances behind it, which occur in the combustor, turbine, tailpipe and <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{is the key}} {{component}} of all jet engines as it creates the exhaust jet. <b>Propelling</b> <b>nozzles</b> turn internal and pressure energy into high velocity kinetic energy. The total pressure and temperature don't change through the nozzle but their static values drop as the gas speeds up.|$|R

50|$|In its {{simplest}} form a turboprop {{consists of}} an intake, compressor, combustor, turbine, and a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor. Fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor, where the fuel-air mixture then combusts. The hot combustion gases expand through the turbine. Some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor. The rest is transmitted through the reduction gearing to the propeller. Further expansion of the gases occurs in the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle,</b> where the gases exhaust to atmospheric pressure. The <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop.|$|R
50|$|In {{jet engines}} and rocket engines, exhaust from <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{which in some}} {{applications}} shows shock diamonds.|$|R
50|$|The nozzle, {{by virtue}} of setting the back-pressure, acts as a {{downstream}} restrictor to the compressor, and thus determines what goes into {{the front of the}} engine. It shares this function with the other downstream restrictor, the turbine nozzle. The areas of both the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> and turbine nozzle set the mass flow through the engine and the maximum pressure. While both these areas are fixed in many engines (i.e. those with a simple fixed <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle),</b> others, most notably those with afterburning, have a variable area <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> This area variation is necessary to contain the disturbing effect on the engine of the high combustion temperatures in the jet pipe, though the area may also be varied during non-afterburning operation to alter the pumping performance of the compressor at lower thrust settings.For example, if the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> were to be removed to convert a turbojet into a turboshaft, the role played by the nozzle area is now taken by the area of the power turbine nozzle guide vanes or stators.|$|R
50|$|Matching may {{be defined}} as designing, sizing, and {{manipulating}} the operating characteristics of the compressor, turbine and <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> is a {{critical}} part of a ramjet design, since it accelerates exhaust flow to produce thrust.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} part of the {{complete}} powerplant which, with intake and <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle,</b> may be called a partial ramjet.|$|R
50|$|A <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{converts}} a {{gas turbine}} or gas generator into a jet engine. Energy {{available in the}} gas turbine exhaust is converted into a high speed <b>propelling</b> jet by the <b>nozzle.</b> Turbofan engines may have an additional and separate <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> which produces a high speed propelling jet from the energy {{in the air that}} has passed through the fan. In addition, the nozzle helps to determine how the gas generator and fan operate as it acts as a downstream restrictor.|$|R
50|$|Exhaust or Nozzle — Turbine {{exhaust gases}} {{pass through the}} <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> to produce a high {{velocity}} jet. The nozzle is usually convergent with a fixed flow area.|$|R
50|$|The <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{at speeds}} above about Mach 2 usually has extra {{internal}} thrust losses because the exit area is {{not big enough}} as a trade-off with external afterbody drag.|$|R
25|$|For smaller, low {{performance}} rockets such as {{attitude control}} thrusters where high performance is less necessary, a pressurised fluid {{is used as}} propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although a bypass engine {{improves}} propulsive efficiency it incurs {{losses of}} its own inside the engine itself. Machinery has {{to be added to}} transfer energy from the gas generator to a bypass airflow. The low loss from the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> of a turbojet is added to with extra losses due to inefficiencies in the added turbine and fan. These may be included in a transmission, or transfer, efficiency [...] However, these losses are more than made up by the improvement in propulsive efficiency. There are also extra pressure losses in the bypass duct and an extra <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R
50|$|In aviation, exhaust mixer is {{a feature}} of many {{turbofan}} engines, where the bypass (cold/slow) air is mixed with the core (hot/fast) exhaust gases, before exhausting to atmospheric pressure through a common (mixed flow) <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a gas}} turbine is increased by raising the overall pressure ratio, requiring higher-temperature compressor materials, and raising the turbine entry temperature, requiring better turbine materials and/or improved vane/blade cooling. It is also increased by reducing the losses as the flow progresses from the intake to the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> These losses are quantified by compressor and turbine efficiencies and ducting pressure losses. When used in a turbojet application, where the output from the gas turbine is used in a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle,</b> raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity. This reduces the propulsive efficiency, giving a loss in overall efficiency, as reflected by the higher fuel consumption, or SFC.|$|R
50|$|The {{turbojet}} is an airbreathing jet engine, usually used in aircraft. It {{consists of}} a gas turbine with a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The gas turbine has an air inlet, a compressor, a combustion chamber, and a turbine (that drives the compressor). The compressed air from the compressor is heated by the fuel in the combustion chamber and then allowed to expand through the turbine. The turbine exhaust is then expanded in the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> where it is accelerated to high speed to provide thrust. Two engineers, Frank Whittle in the United Kingdom and Hans von Ohain in Germany, developed the concept independently into practical engines during the late 1930s.|$|R
50|$|The {{specification}} for {{the aircraft}} required engine installations which permitted the fitting of different air intakes, engines and <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The 188 was {{originally intended to}} have Avon engines but the Gyron Junior was substituted in June 1957.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{pressure}} ratio (EPR) {{is the total}} {{pressure ratio}} across a jet engine, measured as {{the ratio of the}} total pressure at the exit of the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> divided by the total pressure at the entry to the compressor.|$|R
5000|$|Turbojets {{consist of}} an inlet, a compressor, a combustor, a turbine (that drives the compressor) and a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The {{compressed}} air is heated in the combustor and {{passes through the}} turbine, then expands in the nozzle to produce a high speed propelling jet ...|$|R

50|$|In a zero-bypass (turbojet) engine {{the high}} {{temperature}} and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated by expansion through a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> and produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs all the mechanical power {{produced by the}} turbine. In a bypass design extra turbines drive a ducted fan that accelerates air rearward {{from the front of}} the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to turboprops in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine's gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the hot nozzle to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between turbojets, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and turbo-props which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less). Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gave significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller were added to the turbojet's low-loss <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The turbofan has additional losses from its extra turbines, fan, bypass duct and extra <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> compared to the turbojet's single nozzle.|$|R
50|$|The {{afterburner}} {{received the}} exhaust from the turbine {{as well as}} the bleed air from the compressor. Most of the compressor bleed was required for cooling the afterburner duct and <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the remainder was used, together with the turbine exhaust, to burn the afterburner fuel flow.|$|R
50|$|Airbreathing {{jet engines}} are nearly always {{internal}} combustion engines that obtain propulsion from the combustion of fuel inside the engine. Oxygen {{present in the}} atmosphere is used to oxidise a fuel source, typically a hydrocarbon-based jet fuel. The burning mixture expands greatly in volume, driving heated air through a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R

50|$|The first {{production}} afterburning {{turbofan engine}} was the Pratt & Whitney TF30, which initially powered the F-111 Aardvark and F-14 Tomcat. Current low-bypass military turbofans include the Pratt & Whitney F119, the Eurojet EJ200, the General Electric F110, the Klimov RD-33, and the Saturn AL-31, {{all of which}} feature a mixed exhaust, afterburner and variable area <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Afterburner or reheat (British) — (mainly military) Produces extra thrust {{by burning}} fuel in the jetpipe. This {{reheating}} of the turbine exhaust gas raises the <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> entry temperature and exhaust velocity. The nozzle area is increased {{to accommodate the}} higher specific volume of the exhaust gas. This maintains the same airflow through the engine to ensure no change in its operating characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Exhaust gas or {{flue gas}} is emitted {{as a result}} of the {{combustion}} of fuels such as natural gas, gasoline, petrol, biodiesel blends, diesel fuel, fuel oil, or coal. According to the type of engine, it is discharged into the atmosphere through an exhaust pipe, flue gas stack, or <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> It often disperses downwind in a pattern called an exhaust plume.|$|R
50|$|The J85 and lift-fan {{combination}} was {{a precursor}} to developments {{which led to the}} first GE high BPR engine, the TF-39. The lift fans were driven by turbine blades mounted around the periphery of the fan, with mass flow 13 times greater than the gas generators mass flow and increased thrust 3 times over that available using a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{jet engine}} forms of {{internal}} combustion engines, a <b>propelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> is present. This takes the high temperature, high pressure exhaust and expands and cools it. The exhaust leaves the nozzle going at much higher speed and provides thrust, {{as well as}} constricting the flow from the engine and raising the pressure {{in the rest of}} the engine, giving greater thrust for the exhaust mass that exits.|$|R
