Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late 20th century, environmental problems became global in scale.

5|$|Though UCSC {{has been}} known for its {{conservation}} efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on <b>non-renewable</b> <b>energy.</b> This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus. Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety of different ways.|$|E

25|$|The Energy {{transition}} is the shift by several countries to sustainable economies {{by means of}} renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development. This trend has been augmented by the decentralization process of energy generation which is starting to allow average homeowners and small companies to generate their own electricity, allowing everyone to install solar panels on their rooftops and, in many markets, sell their excess electricity back on to the grid. This trend continues to grow and could in the future lead to a majority of our energy coming from decentralized solar panels and wind turbines scattered across the country rather {{than a handful of}} coal and nuclear power plants.

In order to thwart Harper's reelection, Williams launched the [...] "ABC" [...] campaign: Anything But Conservative. The ABC campaign encouraged people to vote for any other party but the Conservatives, with a goal of making sure no Conservative was elected in Newfoundland and Labrador. The campaign, which was supported by all but one member of Williams' caucus, crippled the federal party's ability to find candidates and volunteers. On election night the campaign was successful, the Conservative Party lost the three seats they had held prior to the election, and won only 17% {{of the popular vote}} in the province. Despite being shut out of Newfoundland and Labrador the Conservatives did manage to win a second minority government.

2500|$|Another {{important}} classification {{is based}} on the time required to regenerate an energy resource. [...] "Renewable" [...] resources are those that recover their capacity in a time significant by human needs. Examples are hydroelectric power or wind power, when the natural phenomena that are the primary source of energy are ongoing and not depleted by human demands. [...] Non-renewable resources are those that are significantly depleted by human usage and that will not recover their potential significantly during human lifetimes.

2500|$|A {{zero-energy}} building, {{also known}} as a zero net energy (ZNE) building, net-zero energy building (NZEB), or net zero building, is a building with zero net energy consumption, meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site, or in other definitions by renewable energy sources elsewhere. These buildings consequently contribute less overall greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than similar non-ZNE buildings. [...] They do at times consume <b>non-renewable</b> <b>energy</b> and produce greenhouse gases, but at other times reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount. A similar concept approved and implemented by the European Union and other agreeing countries is nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB), with the goal of having all buildings in the region under nZEB standards by 2020.|$|E
2500|$|The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines (1865) {{was a book}} by {{economist}} William Stanley Jevons that {{explored the}} implications of Britain's reliance on coal.

In propounding this thesis, Jevons covered a range of issues central to sustainability, including limits to growth, overpopulation, overshoot, energy return on energy input (EROEI), taxation of energy resources, renewable energy alternatives, and resource peakinga subject widely discussed today under the rubric of peak oil.|$|E

2500|$|Molecular {{hydrogen}} {{is not available}} on Earth in convenient natural reservoirs. Most hydrogen in the lithosphere is bonded to oxygen in water. Manufacturing elemental hydrogen does require the consumption of a hydrogen carrier such as a fossil fuel or water. The former carrier consumes the fossil resource and produces carbon dioxide, but often requires no further energy input beyond the fossil fuel. [...] Decomposing water, the latter carrier, requires electrical or heat input, generated from some primary energy source (fossil fuel, nuclear power or a renewable energy). Hydrogen can also be produced by refining the effluent from geothermal sources in the lithosphere. Hydrogen produced by zero emission renewable energy sources such as electrolysis of water using wind power, solar power, hydro power, wave power or tidal power {{is referred to as}} green hydrogen. Hydrogen produced by <b>non-renewable</b> <b>energy</b> sources may be referred to as brown hydrogen.

Advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system, and energy storage can {{play a significant role in}} meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid, lowering cost and ensuring high reliability, as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments. Finally, energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services.” [...] The report was written by a core group of developers representing Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, ARPA-E, Office of Science, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Sandia National Laboratories, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; all of whom are engaged in the development of grid energy storage.|$|E

40|$|Faced with an {{ever-increasing}} energy demand, the earth 2 ̆ 7 s sources of <b>non-renewable</b> <b>energies</b> {{are not expected}} to last long. Among the many contenders vying to replace fossil fuels, photovoltaic (PV) solar cells offer many advantages, including needing only little maintenance and being environmentally friendly. However, the major drawback up to date has been their cost. In order for PV to be viable for large-scale energy conversion, their efficiency and reliability must be improved whilst making them cheaper. Cadmium Sulfide/Cadmium Telluride (CdS/CdTe) solar cells have been studied extensively for those reasons. Their advantage lies in their very low fabrication cost, which can be as low as 3 /W in mass production[1]. Their disadvantages are the relative low conversion efficiency and stability compared to other solar cell types. One main limiting factor in this cell type is the US window layer, which absorbs light but does not convert it into electricity. Therefore, high efficiency PV cells try to minimize the US absorption by using ultra thin US layers. However, too thin of a US layer can lead to low voltage devices and yield other problems.

It is shown that material production processes have the largest impact on the values of the analysed indicators, and that pavement construction and deconstruction processes have a marginal impact on the analysed indicators in comparison to material production, transport and recycling processes. It is also demonstrated that the values of the IPCC Global Warming Potential indicator and the Ecological Scarcity indicator for the processes needed to construct and maintain concrete and composite pavements are higher than those for all processes required to construct and maintain asphalt pavements, due to the greater thickness of concrete and composite pavements. The values of the <b>Non-Renewable</b> Cumulative <b>Energy</b> Demand indicator are higher for processes applied to construct and maintain asphalt pavements than for concrete pavements, due to the use of bitumen within asphalt pavements, which causes a depletion of fossil energy resources...|$|R

However, there are certain challenges in the production and consumption of renewable {{sources of energy}}.

In particular, two applications in energy production and conservation are studied. First, a ZigBee-enabled solar PV power performance monitoring system at the module level is developed that enables the user to reduce {{operation and maintenance costs}} through real-time monitoring of power production. Due to the relatively high cost of solar energy production, Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting is a natural choice to reduce energy consumption for lighting. Thus, an energy-efficient LED testbed is developed using the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless technology. To this end, two lab prototypes are developed and implemented for both applications, and their performance is tested through experiments.
