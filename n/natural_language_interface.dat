40|$|A <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> query <b>interface</b> for {{databases}} {{provides the}} user friendliness in retrieving the desired information by querying in a native <b>natural</b> <b>language.</b> Up to now, many <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> query <b>interfaces</b> for conventional databases have been developed. However, {{the field of}} <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> query <b>interfaces</b> for object-oriented databases which have recently started to emerge as the next-generation databases has become a new research area. This paper describes a processing technique to manipulate <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> representations of path expressions. From {{the fact that the}} path expression {{is one of the key}} features in the object-oriented data model, a frame-based decomposition method is proposed for efficient processing. 1 Introduction The objective of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> is to take inputs in human language and extract from them something which is meaningful to a computer.

40|$|The Semantic Web {{grew out}} of {{research}} into formal logics, {{and many of the}} representational and technological commitments of the Semantic Web reflect this heritage. Notwithstanding the obvious advantages for machine processability and reasoning, the logical underpinnings of the Semantic Web present a number of usability challenges for human end-users, {{especially when it comes to}} the communication and exploitation of domain-relevant knowledge/information. In this report, we review one approach to the resolution of these usability challenges – an approach that is based on the use of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> user <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> exploit the medium of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> in order to support end-users with respect to a range of capabilities; for example, the authoring of knowledge content, the retrieval of information from semantic repositories, and the generation of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> texts from formal ontologies. The current report reviews the state-of-the-art with respect to <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> in all these capability areas. It also attempts to explore issues associated with the use of controlled <b>natural</b> <b>languages</b> as the representational basis for knowledge content on the Semantic Web. The idea that controlled <b>natural</b> <b>languages</b> could serve as a replacement for conventional Semantic Web ontologies is explored in some detail, as is the notion that <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> could contribute to the usability of the Semantic Web without requiring the wholesale replacement of pre-existing approaches. The report concludes with a discussion about the potential contribution of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> to the emergence of truly hybrid (human/machine) intelligent systems. This idea sees <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> to the Semantic Web as an essential component of a future extended cognitive system – one that co-opts elements of human cognition with the computational and representational resources of a globally-extensive and semantically-scaffolded information environment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn oft-heard {{argument}} for <b>Natural</b> <b>Language</b> <b>interfaces</b> is their promise {{of reducing the}} effort an infrequent user would have to exert in using a computer system. This viewpoint {{has led to a}} research concentration on removing “artificial” constraints on a user's freedom of expression, allowing it to move closer to everyday speech. This paper discusses two complementary directions for extending <b>Natural</b> <b>Language</b> <b>interfaces</b> to data bases, which can make them more useful systems. These extensions make <b>Natural</b> <b>Language</b> <b>interfaces</b> less simply “windows” through which data can be called into view, and more “articulate experts” on the data base system and what it represents. The two directions involve (1) broadening the range of query types that can be handled and (2) extending the range of responses that can be provided...|$|R

40|$|Users of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> should {{conveniently}} be able {{to express}} the commands and queries that the background system can deal with, and the system should react quickly and accurately to all input. Among other things {{this means that the}} interface must {{be able to}} cope with connected dialogue. Furthermore, the design of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> must take into consideration the characteristics of human-computer interaction instead of trying to mimic human interaction. This paper presents a dialogue manager for such <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces.</b> To control the interaction it uses a dialogue grammar with information on the functional role of an utterance as conveyed in the linguistic structure. Focus structure is handled using dialogue objects recorded in a dialogue tree which can be accessed by the various modules for interpretation, generation and background system access. The Dialogue Manager is designed to facilitate customization to the sublanguage utilized in various appli [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in speech recognition technology have raised hopes {{about the development}} of practical spoken <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Embedding the speech recognition technology within a sophisticated dialog processing mechanism can overcome many of the traditional problems in spoken <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> systems. This paper presents a theory of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> dialog that enables: (1) robust behavior in the presence of word misrecognitions; (2) flexible behavior according to the level of user expertise; and (3) practical implementation of spoken <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> systems using commercial hardware.

40|$|The {{construction}} of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> to computers {{continues to be}} a major challenge.

Much of the research related to the design and implementation of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> has involved the use of high-level declarative programming languages. This is to be expected as the task is extremely difficult, involving syntactic and semantic analysis of potentially ambiguous input. The use of LISP and Prolog in this area is well documented.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>interfaces</b> (NLI's) for databases {{has been a}} challenging problem in <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> processing (NLP) since the 1970 's. The need for NLI's has become more pronounced due to the widespread access to complex databases now available through the Internet. A challenging problem for empirical NLP is the automated acquisition of NLI's from training examples. We present a method for integrating statistical and relational learning techniques for this task which exploits the strength of both approaches. Experimental results from three dierent domains suggest that such an approach is more robust than a previous purely logic-based approach. 1 Introduction We use the term semantic parsing {{to refer to the}} process of mapping a <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> sentence to a structured meaning representation.

For example: [...] "starting balance last quarter" [...] is broken down to 'starting balance' (modifier) + 'last' (temporal index) + 'quarter' (period). The temporal index can be relative or absolute and the modifier can determine if the value returned is differential or cumulative.|$|E
