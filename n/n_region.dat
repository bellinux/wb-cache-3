40|$|The {{accurate}} partitioning of Ig H chain V(H) DJ(H) junctions and L chain V(L) J(L) junctions is problematic. We {{have developed}} a statistical approach for the partitioning of such sequences, by analyzing the distribution of point mutations between a determined V gene segment and putative Ig regions. The establishment of objective criteria for the partitioning of sequences between V(H), D, and J(H) gene segments has allowed us to more carefully analyze intervening putative nontemplated (N) nucleotides. An analysis of 225 IgM H chain sequences, with five or fewer V mutations, led to the alignment of 199 sequences. Only 5. 0 % of sequences lacked N nucleotides at the V(H) D junction (N 1), and 10. 6 % at the DJ(H) junction (N 2). Long <b>N</b> <b>regions</b> (> 9 nt) were seen in 20. 6 % of <b>N</b> 1 <b>regions</b> and 17. 1 % of <b>N</b> 2 <b>regions.</b> Using a statistical analysis based upon known features of N addition, and mutation analysis, two of these <b>N</b> <b>regions</b> aligned with D gene segments, and a third aligned with an inverted D gene segment. Nine additional sequences included possible alignments with a second D segment. Four of the remaining 40 long <b>N</b> 1 <b>regions</b> included 5 ` sequences having six or more matches to V gene end motifs, {{which may be the}} result of V gene replacement.

40|$|V(D) J {{recombination}} {{generates a}} remarkably diverse repertoire of antigen receptors through the rearrangement of germline DNA. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a polymerase that adds random nucleotides (<b>N</b> <b>regions)</b> to recombination junctions, {{is a key}} enzyme contributing to this diversity. The current model is that TdT adds <b>N</b> <b>regions</b> during V(D) J recombination by random collision with the DNA ends, without a dependence on other cellular factors. We previously demonstrated, however, that V(D) J junctions from Ku 80 -deficient mice unexpectedly lack <b>N</b> <b>regions,</b> although the mechanism responsible for this effect remains undefined in the mouse system. One possibility is that junctions are formed in these mice during a stage in development when TdT is not expressed. Alternatively, Ku 80 may be required for the expression, nuclear localization or enzymatic activity of TdT. Here we show that V(D) J junctions isolated from Ku 80 -deficient fibroblasts are devoid of <b>N</b> <b>regions,</b> as were junctions in Ku 80 -deficient mice. In these cells TdT protein is abundant {{at the time of}} recombination, localizes properly to the nucleus and is enzymatically active.

5000|$|A PIN diode {{operates}} {{under what}} is known as high-level injection. In other words, the intrinsic [...] "i" [...] region is flooded with charge carriers from the [...] "p" [...] and [...] "n" [...] regions. Its function can be likened to filling up a water bucket with a hole on the side. Once the water reaches the hole's level it will begin to pour out. Similarly, the diode will conduct current once the flooded electrons and holes reach an equilibrium point, where the number of electrons is equal to the number of holes in the intrinsic region. When the diode is forward biased, the injected carrier concentration is typically several orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic carrier concentration. Due to this high level injection, which in turn is due to the depletion process, the electric field extends deeply (almost the entire length) into the region. This electric field helps in speeding up of the transport of charge carriers from the P to the <b>N</b> <b>region,</b> which results in faster operation of the diode, making it a suitable device for high frequency operations.|$|E

Exposure of the transfected cells to 2 ′-deoxyadenosine and an ADA inhibitor increased the dATP pool and resulted in a marked increase in A–T insertions at recombination junctions, with an overall decreased frequency of V(D) J recombination. Sequence analysis of VH-DH-JH junctions from the IgM locus in B-cell lines from ADA-deficient patients demonstrated an increase in A–T insertions equivalent to that found in the transfected cells. In contrast, elevation of dGTP pools, as would occur in PNP deficiency, did not alter the already rich G–C content of <b>N</b> <b>regions.</b> We conclude that the frequency of V(D) J recombination and the composition of N-insertions are influenced by increases in dATP levels, potentially leading to alterations in antigen receptors and aberrant lymphoid development.

40|$|Telomerase is a {{ribonucleoprotein}} {{reverse transcriptase}} {{responsible for the}} maintenance of one strand of telomere terminal repeats. The key protein subunit of the telomerase complex, known as TERT, possesses reverse transcriptase-like motifs that presumably mediate catalysis. These motifs are located in the C-terminal region of the polypeptide. Hidden Markov model-based sequence analysis revealed in the N-terminal region of all TERTs the presence of four conserved motifs, named GQ, CP, QFP, and T. Point mutation analysis of conserved residues confirmed the functional importance of the GQ motif. In addition, the distinct phenotypes of the GQ mutants suggest that this motif may play at least two distinct functions in telomere maintenance.
