5|$|McLure and Collins <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was {{a bishop}} named Felix {{who held the}} see of Châlons in 626 or 627.

5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently. They <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out {{significant differences in the}} stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{industry}} {{has been criticized for}} lacking in racial diversity. For example, critics have <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are few Asian plus size models. Others have <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are few black plus-size models with darker skin tones.|$|R

25|$|<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is an {{additional}} male category, which is justified by {{the high number of}} participants in the corresponding age group. A maximum of 18 competitors from those 9 categories can take part as a national team.|$|E
25|$|The animals {{used by the}} Castro {{people are}} {{confirmed}} by classical documents and archaeological registers, and included horses, pigs, cows and sheep. It is interesting to <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a cultural taboo against the eating of horses or dogs.|$|E

25|$|<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are many}} nouns that use {{masculine}} or feminine genders without any reason of biological gender, for instance, words that denote inanimate objects. The masculine or feminine usage {{of these words}} is stable (with few exceptions) and doesn't depend on the will of a speaker.|$|E
25|$|<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{a single}} initial state, which is not necessary. Sometimes, NFAs are defined {{with a set of}} initial states. There is an easy {{construction}} that translates a NFA with multiple initial states to a NFA with single initial state, which provides a convenient notation.|$|E
25|$|The line above {{illustrates}} the principle: <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a natural}} pause after 'hondum' and that the first stressed syllable after that pause begins with the same sound as a stressed line from the first half-line (the first halfline is called the a-verse {{and the second is}} the b-verse).|$|E

25|$|<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are {{precisely}} two matrices with unit determinant {{which can be}} used to represent any given Möbius transformation. That is, SL(2,C) is a double cover of PSL(2,C). Since SL(2,C) is simply-connected it is the universal cover of the Möbius group. Therefore, the fundamental group of the Möbius group is Z2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are some}} {{assumptions}} and requirements {{that have to}} be fulfilled for the latter to be correct: There must be perfect competition in the market, and the total number of factors may never surpass the total number of assets (in order to avoid the problem of matrix singularity).|$|E
25|$|Entering {{can involve}} either {{physical}} entry by a person, or {{the insertion of}} an instrument to remove property.
