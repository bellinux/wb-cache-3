25|$|After several {{movements}} {{in a period}} of severe political unrest between 2012-2014 to prevent the ruling party to hold the 10th general election in January 2014 without a neutral care taker government, Khaleda led BNP and its alliances boycotted the election. Violence was reported in polling day including bombing of polling centers which Khaleda was accused of ordering. In 2016 BNP announced its new <b>National</b> <b>Standing</b> <b>Committee,</b> in which Khaleda retained her position as BNP Chairperson. In May 2017, Khaleda revealed BNP's Vision 2030 to gain public support for the next general elections. However the ruling Awami League government denounced Vision 2030 as an act of plagiarism of Awami League's Vision 2021 which they used in the ninth general election, and claimed most of the targets in the Visions were fulfilled by Awami League, thus declaring BNP's Vision 2030 as unoriginal. This renewed tensions between BNP and Awami League. In 2017 the police conducted a raid on Khaleda's house as per government orders, which BNP heavily protested and claimed the government was carrying out autocratic actions.|$|E
