40|$|Weeds {{are a major}} {{constraint}} to rice {{production in}} labor-limited, upland rice-based systems in West Africa. The effects of weeding regimes and rice cultivars on weed growth and rice yield were investigated at two upland locations (Abomey-Calavi and <b>Niaouli)</b> in the degraded coastal savanna zone of Benin in 2005 and 2006 with below-average rainfall. Four weeding regimes (hoe weeding at 21 d after sowing [DAS], delayed hoe weeding at 31 DAS, hoe weeding at 21 and 42 DAS, and a no weeding control) were the main plot treatments. Cultivars comprising three interspecific upland rice cultivars (NERICA 1, NERICA 2, and NERICA 7) and the parents (Oryza sativa WAB 56 - 104 and O. glaberrima CG 14) were tested in subplots. The most dominant weed species identified were Jamaican crabgrass, Mariscus, and silver spinach. Rice yield was generally low because of drought stress; none of the experiments had a higher mean yield than 1, 400 kg ha- 1 across cultivars. Across cultivars, the best weeding regimes in terms of weed control and rice yields were single weeding at 31 DAS (W 31) and double weeding at 21 and 42 DAS (W 21 + 42). Under these weeding regimes, WAB 56 - 104 out-yielded the three NERICA cultivars. CG 14 showed the strongest weed suppressive ability (WSA) in Abomey-Calavi but did not have strong WSA in <b>Niaouli</b> because of lower biomass accumulation. WSA of WAB 56 - 104 {{was similar to that}} of the three NERICA cultivars. Single weeding at 31 DAS, together with the use of cultivars with good adaptation to unfavorable rice growing conditions, would increase land and labor productivity of upland rice-based systems in West Africa.

40|$|AbstractTwenty-nine {{commercial}} {{essential oil}} (EO) products that were purchased from the Taiwan market, including three different company-made Melissa officinalis essential oils, were assayed on their glucose consumption activity and lipid accumulation activity on 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes.

By contrast, EOs of peppermint, lavender, bergamot, cypress, <b>niaouli</b> nerolidol, geranium-rose, and revensara {{did not increase}} glucose consumption activity from media, but displayed inhibited lipid accumulation activity (65 – 90 % of lipid accumulation vs. the control 100 %). Because of the promising activity of M. officinalis EOs, three different products were collected and compared for their gas chromatography chemical profiles and bioactivity. The Western blot {{data suggest that the}} key factors of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/acetyl-CoA carboxylase pathway can be mediated by M. officinalis EOs.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} vitro had {{identified}} <b>niaouli</b> essential oil (NEO) {{as a valuable}} transdermal permeation promoter for estradiol (ES). Subsequent considerations on the complex issue of NEO provenance and composition stimulated the present investigation, which was aimed at defining the composition of NEOs obtained from four different sources, at evaluating their influence on transdermal permeation of ES through hairless mouse skin, and at formulating and evaluating simpler terpene mixtures mimicking the NEOs' composition. While all oils contained 1, 8 -cineol (eucalyptol) as the main component, appreciable variations in composition could be evidenced, originating differences on the ES cutaneous permeation. Two artificial mixtures containing the same proportions of the main terpenes present in each oil (except the commercially unavailable y-terpineol) proved equal or significantly superior in activity {{when compared with the}} original oils. It is felt that this study might contribute to the formulation of terpene mixtures acting more efficiently and reproducibly with respect to natural NEOs, whose complex and variable composition, depending on growing place, season, and extraction process, is well documented in the relevant literature...|$|E
40|$|In {{tropical}} Africa, termite {{damage to}} rice crops leads to important losses of farmers’ income. The present study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effect of rice varieties and cultural practices on termite populations and damage in the field. For this purpose, 10 rice varieties (seven NERICA, one Oryza glaberrima and two O. sativa) were cultivated in rainfed upland at <b>Niaouli</b> (Benin) under four cultivation practices. Termite populations and damage were evaluated during tillering, heading and maturation stages. NERICA 6, CG 14 (the African O. glaberrima, parent of the NERICA), NERICA 10, NERICA 2 and NERICA 3 were the least infested and suffered least damage, while NERICA 4 and LA 23 were the most susceptible. Among the cultural practices, use of Metarhizium anisopliae and regular weeding resulted in lower termite populations and less damage than other practices. Rice was most susceptible to termite attack in the period from heading to maturation. Results of this study should help rice farmers in their choice of tolerant varieties and adapted cultural practices as effective alternative measures to control termites and save rice production in the rainfed upland ecology...|$|E
40|$|In a {{differential}} respiratory conditioning paradigm {{with normal}} Ss two odors (fresh smelling <b>niaouli</b> and bad smelling ammonia) {{were used as}} conditioned stimuli (CS+ or CS-) and 7. 4 % CO 2 -enriched air {{was used as the}} unconditioned stimulus (US). Three CS+ and three CS- trials were run during acquisition, followed on the next day by the same number of CS+ and CS- only trials. Respiratory frequency, minute ventilation, end-tidal fractional concentration of CO 2 and subjective complaints were measured throughout the experiment. While during acquisition all measures were affected, the conditioning effects included only respiratory frequency and subjective complaints. A selective association effect appeared in that the conditioning effects were confined to ammonia as CS+: respiratory frequency increased and more somatic complaints were presented when compared to the CS- condition. The conditioning effect on complaints was not confined to complaints of general arousal, but included respiratory complaints as well. Correlational analyses showed that increases in complaints as caused by the conditioning procedure were predicted by changes in somatic variables, but not by individual differences in Negative Affectivity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Agronomic {{evaluation}} {{for three}} Egusi species (Cucurbitaceae) used as food in Benin and model analysis for yield prediction. Six varieties of Egusi from three species of cucurbit were evaluated for {{the fruit and}} the seed yield at the Agricultural Research Centre of <b>Niaouli</b> (South-Benin). Using randomised blocs, the agronomic characters such as the germination percentage, the fl owering date, the number of fruit per plant, the average fruit weight, the weight of 1, 000 unhulled seed, the weight of 1, 000 hulled seed, the ratio kernel/seed, the fruit yield, the unhulled seed yield and the hulled seed yield (kg. ha- 1) were measured. Out of the six varieties, Aklamkpa (Lagenaria siceraria) showed the highest yield for dehulled and unhulled seed. It is followed by Kilonon and Kakoun (Citrullus lanatus) which yielded more than 200 kg. ha- 1. In contrary Zohan (Cucumeropsis edulis), well appreciated by consumers for its organoleptic qualities, appeared to have the lowest yield {{in addition to the}} fact that it is a late variety. The prediction model analysis indicated that the number of fruits per plant and the average fruit weight are good estimators of the unhulled and hulled seed yield and could effectively contribute to the increase of seed yield in egusi crops...|$|E
40|$|In {{continuation}} of a previous study dealing with the promoting effect of <b>niaouli</b> essential oil (NIA) on transdermal permeation of estrogens, the effect of vehicle composition on permeation of estradiol (ES) ex vivo across hairless mouse skin was investigated using a diffusion cell technique. Three types of gel vehicles possessing suitable esthetic and spreading characteristics, formulated with Carbopol 1342 and containing NIA at two concentrations (1. 0 and 10. 0 %) were tested. Promoter-free vehicles and two commercial alcohol-based gels (Gelestra and Sandrena) were used as reference. The solubility of ES in the solvent phase of the gels and the rheological properties of all formulations were also evaluated. The mean transdermal fluxes of ES at steady state from Gelestra and Sandrena were not significantly different, although Gelestra showed a shorter lag time and a greater amount of ES permeated after 30 It compared with Sandrena. In the gels under test, the presence of 1. 0 % NIA significantly increased the ES transdermalflux over the reference vehicles only when in association with ethanol and water. The present results may warrant further investigations on other drugs and skin models, aimed at optimizing the promoting activity of NIA, and the synergistic effect of solvents...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the reliability of pot-based screening method for iron (Fe) toxicity tolerance in rice using soils from hot spots. Five lowland rice varieties with known reaction to Fe toxicity were grown in pots in a screen house for three seasons. Fe-toxic soils from two hot spot fields – Edozighi, Nigeria and <b>Niaouli,</b> Benin were used and soil from Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) experimental farm, Cotonou, Benin was included as control. Leaf bronzing score (LBS) was determined at different stages, and grain yield was determined at maturity. Heritability was estimated using data across the three seasons. High heritability was recorded for LBS and grain yield. Grain yield reduction in stress treatment relative to control varied from 15 to 56 % depending on the variety and soil. Bao Thai, Suakoko 8, and WITA 4 had better performance under Fe toxicity in terms of LBS, yield and relative yield reduction, whereas Bouake 189 and IR 64 had poorer performance. Grain yield and LBS were significantly correlated but negatively at 60  days after sowing (DAS). Overall, the results found in this experiment were consistent with previous field studies. Therefore, pot screening using soils from hot spots can be used by rice breeding programs to reliably assess Fe toxicity tolerance ex situ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, <b>niaouli</b> essential oil (NIA) {{was found to}} enhance the permeation of estradiol (ES) through hairless mouse skill in vitro. In this study we evaluated in vivo, on female hairless rats, the trandermal penetration of ES from alcoholic get-vehicles containing 1. 0 or 5. 0 % NIA (Gel 2 and 3, respectively). One NIA-free gel (Get 1) and a commercial formulation, Sandrena gel, were used as reference. The ES serum levels after single or multiple cutaneous application of the gel-vehicles were determined, and the in vivo data were compared with new in vitro data obtained using hairless mouse skin. Both the in vitro and the single-dosing in vivo tests demonstrated the superiority of Gel 2 over all other gels. When tested in the multiple-dosing study against Sandrena gel, Gel 2 produced a 0 - 96 h plasma AUC two times {{greater than that of}} the reference. The absolute bioavailability values of ES from the vehicles under investigation were also in the order Gel 2 > Gel 3 > Sandrella gel > Gel 1. This study indicates that, in the presently investigated animal species, a relatively small percentage of NIA (1. 0 %) in association with ethanol (57. 8 %) promotes transdermal penetration of ES {{to a greater extent than}} ethanol (65 %) in association with propylene glycol (10. 5 %), the enhancers present in the commercial gel Sandrena...|$|E
40|$|Melaleuca quinquenervia is a {{small to}} medium sized tree (8 - 12 m) that is native to the coastal region of eastern Australia, {{southern}} Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia between latitudes 8 and 340 S. It has been planted as an exotic in the tropical lowlands of several countries {{and has become a}} serious weed in Florida, USA. The leaves are a source of the cineole-rich essential oil called <b>niaouli</b> oil or goman oil used in pharmaceutical preparations. It is often grown as a windbreak and as an ornamental. A strong flavoured honey is produced from the abundant flowers. The wood is an excellent fuel and makes good quality charcoal. It is suitable for pit props, fence posts, flooring and pulp. The paper-like bark may be used as mulch in potting mixes, for packaging and insulation. The paper describes the botanical features, aspects of its growth and development, its ecology, pests and diseases, harvesting and genetic resources. It concludes that the best prospects for the use of Melaleuca quinquenervia are on swampy sites, as more productive species are already available for better-drained habitats. It has a demonstrated ability to grow quite rapidly in areas of the humid and subhumid tropics that may be inundated for many months. Further research on this species and its close relatives is advocated and this should proceed with care in view of its potential to become a serious weed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Previous {{studies showed}} that somatic {{symptoms}} can be acquired in response to chemical substances using an associative learning paradigm, but only when the substance was foul smelling and not when it smelled pleasant. In this study, we investigated whether warnings about environmental pollution would facilitate acquiring symptoms, regardless of the pleasantness of the smell. Method: One group received prior information framing the study {{in the context of}} the rapidly increasing chemical pollution of our environment. Another group received no prior information. Conditional odor stimuli (CS) were diluted ammonia (foul-smelling) and <b>niaouli</b> (neutral-positive smelling); the unconditional stimulus (UCS) was 10 % CO 2 -enriched air. Each subject breathed one odor mixed with CO, and a control odor mixed with air in 80 -sec breathing trials. The type of odor mixed with CO, was counterbalanced across participants. Next, the same breathing trials were administered without CO, Breathing behavior was measured during each trial; subjective symptoms were assessed after each trial. Results: Only participants who had been given warnings about environmental pollution reported more symptoms to the odor that had previously been associated with CO 2, compared with the control odor. This was so for both the foul- and the pleasant-smelling odor. Symptom learning did not occur in the group that did not receive warnings. The elevated symptom level could not be accounted for by altered respiratory behavior, nor by experimental demand effects. Conclusions: Raising environmental awareness through warnings about chemical pollution facilitates learning of subjective health symptoms in response to chemical substances. status: publishe...|$|E

Methods: Conditional odor stimuli (CS) were (diluted) ammonia and <b>niaouli.</b> One odor was mixed with 7. 4 % CO 2 -enriched air (unconditional stimulus) during 2 -minute breathing trials (CS � trial), and the other odor was presented with air (CS � trial). Three CS � and three CS � trials were conducted in a semirandomized order (acquisition phase). The test phase involved one CS�-only (CS� without CO 2) and one CS � test trial, followed by three trials using new odors (butyric acid, acetic acid, and citric aroma). Half of the subjects (N � 28) were tested immediately, and the other half were tested after 1 week. Ventilatory responses were measured during and somatic symptoms were measured after each trial. Results: Participants had more symptoms in response to CS�-only exposures, but only when ammonia was used as the CS�. Also, generalization occurred: More symptoms were reported in response to butyric and acetic acid than to citric aroma and only in participants who had been conditioned.

40|$|The role of residue {{characteristics}} in enhancing {{the availability of}} P was investigated in a greenhouse study using two soils from the northern Guinea savanna (NGS) and four from the derived savanna (DS) zones of the West African moist savanna. Eight organic residues of varying C-to-P ratio were used and maize (Zea mays) was grown for 7 weeks. The effect of the organic residues on P availability (measured as resin P and maize P accumulation) differed among the soils. On average, the increase in resin P, calculated as {[(soil+residue) ?control]/(control) × 100 }, was between 8 % (Davié, DS) and 355 % (Danayamaka, NGS). Maize P accumulation was increased by ca. 11 % in Davié and <b>Niaouli</b> (DS) soils and 600 % in Danayamaka soil. The increase in maize total dry matter yield (DMY) ranged from 2 % to 649 %. Residues with C-to-P ratio > 200 produced lower DMY than those with lower ratios. Residue organic P (Po) extractable with 0. 2 N H 2 SO 4 (acid-Po) accounted for 92 % (P = 0. 0001) {{of the variation in}} DMY in a step-wise regression with residue parameters as independent variables and mean DMY as the dependent variable. The residue Po extractable with 0. 5 M NaHCO 3 (HCO 3 -Po) correlated significantly with DMY in Danayamaka and Davié soils, and with P accumulation in Danayamaka soil. The relationships between the residue Po and DMY might imply that Po fractions in decomposing residues contribute to P availability. However, the suitability of using the Po content of organic residues to predict their agronomic value with respect to P nutrition needs further evaluation. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
