40|$|Land-use/land cover change (LUCC) {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} causes of global environmental change. In recent years, understanding the regional climate impact of LUCC has become a hot-discussed topic worldwide. Some studies have explored LUCC impact on regional climate in specific cities, provinces, or farming areas. However, the quick-urbanized areas, which are highly influenced by human activities, have the most severe land-use changes in developing countries, and their climatic impact cannot be ignored. This study aims to identify the impact of land-use change coupled with urbanization on regional temperature and precipitation in the metropolitan areas of middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China by means of spatial analysis and numeric methods. Based on the exploration of land-use change and climate change during 1988 – 2008, the impact of land-use transition from <b>non-built-up</b> <b>area</b> to built-up area on temperature and precipitation was analyzed. The results indicated that the land-use conversion has affected the regional temperature with an increasing effect in the study area, while the influence on precipitation was not so significant. The results can provide useful information for spatial planning policies in consideration of regional climate change...|$|E
40|$|Urbanization {{results in}} habitat loss and habitat {{fragmentation}} concurrently, both influencing biodiversity and ecological processes. To evaluate these impacts, {{it is important}} to understand the relationships between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se (HLHF) during urbanization. The objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) to quantify the different forms of the HLHF relationship during urbanization using multiple landscape metrics, and 2) to test the validity of the HLHF relations reported in the literature. Our analysis was based on a long-term urbanization dataset (1800 - 2000) of 16 large cities from around the world. Habitat area was represented as the percentage of <b>non-built-up</b> <b>area</b> in the landscape, while habitat fragmentation was measured using several landscape metrics. Our results show that the relationship between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation during urbanization is commonly monotonic-linear, exponential, or logarithmic, indicating that the degree of habitat fragmentation per se increases with habitat loss in general. We compared our results with 14 hypothesized HLHF relationships based on simulated landscapes found in the literature, and found that four of them were consistent with those of urbanization, whereas the other ten were not. Also, we identified six new HLHF relationships when fragmentation was measured by total core area, normalized total core area, patch density, edge density and landscape shape index, respectively. In addition, our study demonstrated that the "space-for-time" approach, frequently used in ecology and geography, generated specious HLHF relationships, suggesting that this approach is largely inappropriate for analyses of urban landscapes that are highly heterogeneous in space and unusually contingent in dynamics. Our results show both generalities and idiosyncrasies of the HLHF relationship, providing new insights for assessing ecological effects of urbanization...|$|E
40|$|Storage of soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) is an {{essential}} function of ecosystems underpinning the delivery of multiple services to society: e. g. the production of food, wood, bio-energy and water and the regulation of the global climate, nutrient availability and the hydrological cycle. Whereas SOC content (%) {{is part of the}} routine measurements in general-purpose soil survey projects and in monitoring schemes of agricultural and forest soils, the resulting datasets are not readily fit for regional SOC stock (kg m- 2) assessments. This dissertation focused on two bottlenecks: (i) the spatial density of available soil profile collections is mostly too limited and too heterogeneously distributed across the territory to assign at least one observation to each combination of soil type and land cover type, and (ii) the sampling depth is often limited to the topsoil even though a considerable fraction of the total stock is known to be stored in the subsoil. To overcome the lack-of-data-problem related to the limited spatial density of existing soil profile collections, a multi-level generalisation approach was applied. This approach takes full advantage of all available data, by working with detailed land units in regions where sufficient data is available and with generalised units elsewhere. Applied to land units defined by the intersection of the 1990 Corine Land Cover dataset and the soil map of Flanders, Belgium (18, 809 non-built-up land units for 929, 546 ha), a legacy database (1947 – 1974) of 7, 020 profile descriptions with 42, 529 horizons and a 3 - (coastal region) and 5 -level (non-coastal region) generalisation, the approach succeeded in assigning at least one profile to 18, 731 land units or 98. 71 % of the territory’s area. This resulted in an estimated legacy stock of 87. 49 Mt OC in the upper 100 cm of soil. This stock is smaller than those revealed by previous assessments even though they are based on the same soil profile collection. Since the proposed method preserves the highest possible spatial and semantic detail, its result can be considered as closer to reality. The applicability of the multi-level spatial generalisation in more data-scarce conditions was confirmed by its application to the soil map of forests in Flanders (153, 544 ha) and a collection of 276 forest soil profiles. Approximately 90. 45 % of the forest area could be characterised and a total stock of 25. 31 Mt OC was obtained with a firm contribution of Histosols. However, for the particular case of the forests of Flanders, a digital soil mapping approach using boosted regression trees was more informative. Additionally compared to multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks and least-squares support vector machines, it obtained the best fit (training R² of 0. 68 and cross-validated R² of 0. 22) and moreover provided insights in the soil system by showing average predictor effects in partial dependence plots. Highest groundwater level, clay fraction, tree genus and soil type were identified as key predictors of the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm. With boosted regression trees, the total SOC stock in forest soil was estimated at 26. 99 Mt OC. Also using boosted regression trees and assuming that the potential natural dominant tree genus would occur according to the present soil conditions, the SOC stock in the current forest area was estimated at 30. 00 Mt OC, or 21. 26 kg OC m- 2 on average. When the complete non-built-up territory (1, 168, 850 ha) would be forested analogously, 255. 28 Mt OC would be stored, which is more than double the estimated stock under the actual land cover distribution. The results highlight the importance to conserve and restore carbon hotspots like alluvial forests. New soil inventories should focus on these and other data-scarce land units. Future modelling work can benefit from explicitly taking the soil type and tree genus into account as predictors. The secondly addressed bottleneck was the limited sampling depth, typically the upper 15 to 30 cm of soil. To assess SOC stocks and their changes in the upper 100 cm of the soil profile, vertical extrapolation of topsoil measurements is necessary. The commonly used exponential decline function is not valid, however, for soil types in which subsurface horizons with a larger SOC content, ‘anomalies’, occur. To account for these profile anomalies, an exponential change decline function was conceived and calibrated, assuming that not the SOC content, but rather its change over time declines exponentially with depth. To optimize calibration, more detailed descriptions of subsoil reference profiles, sampled by pedogenetic horizon rather than by fixed depth interval are needed. Applied to 54, 041 agricultural land units in Flanders it was possible with this function to model specific profile characteristics such as the presence of spodic horizons, plaggic topsoil and peat substrates, resulting in total arable and grassland SOC stock estimates of 40. 44 Mt OC in 388, 572 ha and 39. 70 Mt OC in 315, 074 ha, respectively. For the particular land units characterised by SOC-rich subsoil horizons, the exponential decline function underestimated SOC stocks, which compromised an in-depth assessment of changes in SOC stocks over time. To assess the SOC stock under Low-Input High-Diversity systems (30, 556 ha), such as non-forested nature reserves, both bottlenecks related to sampling depth and spatial density needed to be overcome. To this end, depth extrapolation of 139 topsoil (upper 15 cm) measurements using the exponential change decline function was combined with digital soil mapping. Also in this situation, boosted regression trees was the superior modelling approach as it resulted in the lowest cross-validation errors and provided insights in the determining variables of both top- and subsoil stocks. The predictors of the stock in the upper 100 cm were soil type, lowest groundwater level, clay fraction and plant height. These predictors extended with variables describing the site’s slope, specific leaf area, aboveground biomass production, rooting depth, mycorrhizal associations and species diversity also largely explained the topsoil stock variation. The results showed that the topsoil (1. 63 Mt OC) stored but 36 % of the stock found in the upper 100 cm (4. 53 Mt OC). Given the magnitude of subsoil OC and its dependency on typical ecosystem characteristics, it should not be neglected in regional ecosystem service assessments. By combining the abovementioned SOC stock assessments for the agricultural domain, forests and LIHD systems, the SOC stock for 887, 745 ha of the <b>non-built-up</b> <b>area</b> in Flanders was estimated to be 111. 67 Mt OC or 12. 58 kg OC m- 2 on average. Soils under more natural land use types including forests (17. 58 kg m- 2) and LIHD systems (13. 72 kg m- 2) on average stored more organic carbon than agricultural soils: arable (10. 40 kg m- 2) and grassland (12. 60 kg m- 2). Given their large area fraction, however, the latter contain the largest absolute stock. From a final study on a 954 ha study area it became clear that region-wide soil datasets as the ones used in our research have a rather weak performance in the identification of carbon hotspots such as Histosols. This finding shows that local surveys with more dense sampling are necessary when the SOC stock assessments are to serve carbon-aware land management rather than regional reporting. nrpages: 137 status: publishe...|$|E

Therefore, an important part of pedestrian safety management is selecting the right type of crossings, which are suitable for the conditions. At certain speeds and traffic volume, the only safe option for pedestrian crossings is to apply multi-level solutions, that is footbridges or tunnels.

This risk compensation effect was commented on in the findings of the evaluation of the “Bikesafe Scotland” scheme, where a number of those who undertook training said they rode faster in <b>non-built-up</b> <b>areas</b> after the course (Ormston et al., 2003).

40|$|Within-class {{spectral}} {{variation and}} between-class spectral confusion in remotely sensed imagery degrades {{the performance of}} built-up area detection when using planar texture, shape, and spectral features. Terrain slopes and building heights extracted from auxiliary data, such as Digital Surface Models (DSMs) however, can improve the results. Stereo imagery incorporates height information unlike single remotely sensed images. In this study, a new Stereo Pair Disparity Index (SPDI) for indicating built-up areas is calculated from stereo-extracted disparity information. Further, a new method of detecting built-up areas from stereo pairs is proposed based on the SPDI, using disparity information to establish the relationship between two images of a stereo pair. As shown in the experimental results for two stereo pairs covering different scenes with diverse urban settings, the SPDI effectively differentiates between built-up and <b>non-built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> Our proposed method achieves higher accuracy built-up area results from stereo images than the traditional method for single images, and two other widely-applied DSM-based methods for stereo images.

TheStadtparterreconcept refers to the city’s “parterre” as a holistic urban system: it covers both built-up and <b>non-built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> Thus street, ground floor and courtyard are treated as entity, so that interrelations are coming to light. Because we perfectly know that the potentials of ground floor use and the structure of the correlating public street space are directly related to each other.

40|$|International audienceUrban fabric {{characterization}} is {{very useful}} in urban design, planning, modeling and simulation. It is traditionally {{considered as a}} descriptive task mainly based on visual inspection of urban plans. Cartographic databases and geographic information systems (GIS) capabilities make possible the analytical formalization of this issue. This paper proposes a renewed approach to characterize urban fabrics using buildings' footprints data. This characterization method handles both architectural form and urban open space morphology since urban space can be intuitively and simply divided into built-up <b>areas</b> (buildings) and <b>non-built-up</b> <b>areas</b> (open spaces). First, we propose to build a mesh of the open space (a morphologic tessellation) and then we formalize relevant urban morphology properties and translate them into a set of indicators (using some common-used indispensable indicators and proposing a new formulation or generalization of a few others). This first step produces a highly dimensional data set for each footprint characterizing both the building and its surrounding open space. This data set is then reduced and classified using a spatial clustering process, the self-organizing maps in this case. Our method only requires buildings' footprints as input data. It can be applied on huge datasets and is independent from urban contexts. The {{results show that the}} classification produced is more faithful to ground truth (highlighting the variety of urban morpho-logic structures) than traditional descriptive characterizations generally lacking open space properties...|$|R
40|$|Safety issues {{affecting}} modern highway geometric design of roads in <b>non-built-up</b> <b>areas</b> are discussed. The status {{of knowledge of}} Safety Criteria I and II (achieving operating speed consistency and design consistency) for two-lane rural roads is briefly reviewed. Considerations for design consistency are also extended to multiple-lane rural and suburban road design to evaluate good, fair, and poor design levels for these road categories. Utilization ratios (n) for maximum permissible side friction factors are developed for different road categories, topography levels, and maximum and minimum superelevation rates. Relevant minimum radii for curve design are established and compared with present AASHTO values insofar as possible. Safety Criterion III (achieving driving dynamic consistency) is further developed, through which reliable and quantitative ranges between the side friction assumed and the actual friction demand at curved sites could be established. AASHTO's design policy is evaluated {{on the basis of}} Criteria II and III. The evaluation showed, for lower design speeds (30, 40, and 50 mph), an unbalanced degree of curve and superelevation rate ranges, which lead to poor design practices from a safety viewpoint. By heeding the three safety criteria and the recommended side-friction utilization ratios, sound alignments can be established for the various design cases in future highway geometric design and redesign and for resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Methodology of {{automated}} {{human settlement}} mapping is highly needed for utilization of historical satellite data archives for urgent issues of urban growth in global scale, such as disaster risk management, public health, food security, and urban management. As development of global data with spatial resolution of 10 - 100 m {{was achieved by}} some initiatives using ASTER, Landsat, and TerraSAR-X, next goal has targeted to development of time-series data which can contribute to studies urban development with background context of socioeconomy, disaster risk management, public health, transport and other development issues. We developed an automated algorithm to detect human settlement by classification of built-up and non-built-up in time-series Landsat images. A machine learning algorithm, Local and Global Consistency (LLGC), was applied with improvements for remote sensing data. The algorithm enables to use MCD 12 Q 1, a MODIS-based global land cover map with 500 -m resolution, as training data so that any manual process is not required for preparation of training data. In addition, we designed the method to composite multiple results of LLGC into a single output to reduce uncertainty. The LLGC results has a confidence value ranging 0. 0 to 1. 0 representing probability of built-up and non-built-up. The median value of the confidence for a certain period around a target time {{was expected to be}} a robust output of confidence to identify built-up or <b>non-built-up</b> <b>areas</b> against uncertainties in satellite data quality, such as cloud and haze contamination.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} and direct {{relationship}} between urban street space and the structures and uses of the buildings’ ground floor. When addressing urban development issues the necessity to consider the “StadtParterre“ (street-level-environment) —a holistic urban zone of public, private, and semi-private spaces—must therefore be emphasized. In consequence the spatial representation of Vienna’s street-level environment 3 D-ZPA is covering both built-up and <b>non-built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> it includes the street {{as well as the}} adjacent houses and yards. Vienna’s official digital map serves as matrix where the individual ground level plans of the flanking buildings is set in—both historical plans and most recent conversion documents are taken into account, so that the morphological evolution of the street-level is reflected. Given the importance of ceiling and building heights the plan is elevated into the third dimension, which marks the major distinction from the Comprehensive Ground Floor Surveys, originally carried out in the 1960 ies (Muratori, Caniggia). 3 D-ZPA differs in precision and scale from the current settings of 3 D city models that mostly render a distant bird’s eye perspective and that by simply showing the external building perimeters do not provide an objective representation and description of the city’s interior structure. 3 D-ZPA precisely represents the buildings’ ground floor; the areas above and below are generically outlined as a rather simple cubic model, so that street profile and day light situation on the ground are reflected. 3 D-ZPA yields information about a building’s spatial and functional relationship to public space and topographical environment; qualitative statements can be made concerning use, use-frequency and intensity. It facilitates conclusions regarding use-potential of the ground floor zone and places structural functions of the street space in relation to it. Interrelations can be identified, problematic situations considered and resolved in context; thus 3 D-ZPA is providing a fundamental tool for planning and research...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{geospatial}} analysis model, this paper analyzes {{the relationship between}} the landscape patterns of source and sink in urban areas and atmospheric haze pollution. Firstly, the classification result and aerosol optical thickness (AOD) of Wuhan are divided into a number of square grids with the side length of 6 km, and the category level landscape indices (PLAND, PD, COHESION, LPI, FRAC_MN) and AOD of each grid are calculated. Then the source and sink landscapes of atmospheric haze pollution are selected based on the analysis of the correlation between landscape indices and AOD. Next, to make the following analysis more efficient, the indices selected before should be determined through the correlation coefficient between them. Finally, due to the spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity of the data used in this paper, spatial autoregressive model and geo-weighted regression model are used to analyze atmospheric haze effect by source and sink landscape from the global and local level. The results show that the source landscape of atmospheric haze pollution is the building, and the sink landscapes are shrub and woodland. PLAND, PD and COHESION are suitable for describing the atmospheric haze effect by source and sink landscape. Comparing these models, the fitting effect of SLM, SEM and GWR is significantly better than that of OLS model. The SLM model is superior to the SEM model in this paper. Although the fitting effect of GWR model is more unsuited than that of SLM, the influence degree of influencing factors on atmospheric haze of different geography can be expressed clearer. Through the analysis results of these models, following conclusions can be summarized: Reducing the proportion of source landscape area and increasing the degree of fragmentation could cut down aerosol optical thickness; And distributing the source and sink landscape evenly and interspersedly could effectively reduce aerosol optical thickness which represents atmospheric haze pollution; For Wuhan City, the method of adjusting the built-up area slightly and planning the <b>non-built-up</b> <b>areas</b> reasonably can be taken to reduce atmospheric haze pollution...|$|R
