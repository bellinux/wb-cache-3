2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the <b>nozzle,</b> <b>hose,</b> swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this procedure, the term "ARB " refers to the State of California Air Resources Board, and the term "ARB Executive Officer " refers to the Executive Officer of the ARB or his or her {{authorized}} representative or designate. 1. 1 General This procedure applies to novel vapor recovery systems for controlling gasoline vapors emitted during the dispensing of the fuel into motor vehicles (Phase II). This procedure is only applicable if previously certified vapor recovery equipment (<b>nozzle,</b> <b>hose,</b> P/V valve, etc.) are used with the system. However, if uncertified vapor recovery equipment is used with the system, then such equipment may require prior certification by CP- 201. Small, integral aboveground tank systems shall be tested during the summer months (normally between May and October) when heat transfer rate, solar insolation, and diurnal temperature variation are at a maximum. Vapor recovery systems are complete systems and shall include all necessary piping, nozzles, couplers, processing units, storage tanks and any other equipment necessary for the control of gasoline vapors during fueling operations. This procedure applies to any vapor emissions associated with the dispensing of any fluid, although it is written to reflect application to the hydrocarbon (HC) vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline at facilities with balance, hybrid, or assist type vapor recovery systems. 1. 2 Modifications Additional modifications may be required for unique installations. Any modification of this method shall be subject to approval by the ARB Executive Officer...|$|E

5000|$|One major rule change {{regarding}} time trials {{was implemented}} for 1982. All cars {{would be allowed}} only two warm up laps for qualifying, down from three, which had been the rule since 1946. After two major pit fires in 1981 (Rick Mears at the 1981 Indy 500 and Herm Johnson at the Michigan 500), new rules were implemented for refuling safety. Pit side fuel tanks were required to be anchored to the ground, while new high-pressure fire hoses were installed {{the length of the}} pit lane. Significant improvement were also made the fuel <b>nozzles,</b> <b>hoses,</b> and [...] "buckeyes" [...] on the cars themselves.|$|R

5000|$|The fatal {{shooting}} of Douglas Zerby occurred on December 12, 2010 in Long Beach, California. Zerby {{was shot by}} two Long Beach Police Department officers while playing with a garden <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle.</b> They claimed that they mistook the <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> for a gun and fired at Zerby, killing him, and did not make any verbal warnings or commands. It was later discovered through audio recordings of the officers radios that a house phone rang startling an officer causing him to shoot. The other officers fired once the first shooter did, blaming it on [...] "contagious fire" [...] proving the officers were not trained well.|$|R

60|$|He helped Jim to {{push the}} huge ladder on wheels to the window mentioned, {{and placed it in}} position. While Jim ran for a <b>nozzle</b> and <b>hose,</b> there was a great cry from the crowd. A woman had got out on the ledge of an attic window, and knelt there shrieking and waving her arms, while the smoke curled round her, and the flames leapt up at her. She was high above the head of the escape; but there were fly-ladders which could be raised above that. These were {{instantly}} hoisted, and our foreman sprang up to the rescue.|$|R
50|$|Wet {{decontamination}} lines require {{not only}} a water source, but occasionally electricity for deployment. As a rule, dry decontamination is faster both in deployment and clean-up as {{it does not require}} an immediate water supply, contaminated water collection basin, resources (like <b>hoses,</b> <b>nozzles,</b> shelters, and other large pieces of equipment), or a large number of personnel.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{event is}} the hose advance. This simulates a {{firefighter}} running from a fire engine towards a close fire. The competitor sprints 140 feet {{and picks up}} a 1.75 in. diameter charged (pressurized with water) hose, sprints five more feet with the hose, then drags it an additional 75 feet. Once at the 75 ft line and through the swinging doors, the competitor must then open the <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle,</b> releasing water onto a small target. After hitting the target, they must close the nozzle and drop the hose, which completes the event. The <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> may only be opened once the nozzle opens the swinging doors, if the nozzle is opened earlier a 2 second penalty is added to the final time. If the competitor does not close the nozzle, they must come back close the nozzle and then resume the final event.|$|R

On either side, the relief inscription along the circumference [...] "RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE" [...] ("FRENCH REPUBLIC"). The medal is struck in silver, silver-gilt and gold. The silver grade award's ribbon suspension bar is adorned with opposing fire <b>hose</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Each grade above silver is denoted by an increasingly intricate ornamentation on the ribbon suspension bar. For the silver-gilt variant, this consists of crossed firemen's axes superimposed over part of a ladder below horizontal fire <b>hose</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The gold variant replaces the nozzles with a laurel wreath.|$|R

50|$|Nozzles are {{attached}} to the pump via flexible hoses, allowing them to be placed into the vehicle's filling inlet. The hoses are robust to survive heavy wear and tear, including exposure to weather and being driven over, and are often attached using heavy spring or coil arrangements to provide additional strength. A breakaway valve is also fitted to the hose to allow the <b>nozzle</b> and <b>hose</b> to break off and fuel flow to be stopped in the case a vehicle drives off with the nozzle still in the filler, although this is largely prevented today by the point-of-sale systems not allowing payment for fuel until the nozzle is returned to its petrol pump holder.|$|R
50|$|The {{art deco}} tower, built of {{unpainted}} reinforced concrete, {{was designed by}} architects Arthur Brown, Jr. and Henry Howard, with fresco murals by 27 different on-site artists and their numerous assistants, plus two additional paintings installed after creation off-site.

5000|$|Several {{mistakes}} and failures of logic {{occur in the}} serial. One example is that the film shows the Bat-Signal working in broad daylight.

40|$|Several simple {{systems are}} {{examined}} {{to illustrate the}} importance of the estimation of damping parameters in closed-loop system performance and stability. The negative effects of unmodeled damping are particularly pronounced in systems that do not use collocated sensors and actuators. An example is considered for which even the actuators (a tip jet <b>nozzle</b> and flexible <b>hose)</b> for a simple beam produce significant damping which, if ignored, results in a model that cannot yield a reasonable time response using physically meaningful parameter values.

50|$|The basic {{pressure}} washer {{consists of a}} motor (either electric, internal combustion, pneumatic or hydraulic) that drives a high-pressure water pump, a high-pressure hose and a trigger gun-style switch. Just as a garden <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> is used to increase the velocity of water, a {{pressure washer}} creates high pressure and velocity. The pump cannot draw more water from the pipe to which the washer is connected than that source can provide: the water supply must be adequate for the machine connected to it, as water starvation leads to cavitation damage of the pump elements.|$|R

5000|$|Their {{contributions}} to the victory, however, have been considered overstated in some cases. Historians agree that Clark's Lotus-Ford was capable of winning the race handily without the added help of the Wood Brothers. In fact, the only work done on the cars was routine refueling, as they {{did not need to}} change tires during the race. Clark made only two stops all day, and the quickness of the refueling process was largely attributed to a specially-designed gravity fueling rig with a venturi tube. One of the things they did ahead of time was to [...] "break in" [...] the new fueling <b>hose</b> <b>nozzles</b> by simply working them {{in and out of the}} coupling for a period of time.|$|R
60|$|In the {{immediate}} foreground, beneath our very eyes, was the small yard with the half-cleaned motor-car standing in it.

The human race is gone, {{extinguished}} in a day, but the planets swing round and the tides rise or fall, and the wind whispers, and all nature goes her way, down, as it would seem, to the very amoeba, with never a sign that he who styled himself the lord of creation had ever blessed or cursed the universe with his presence. Down in the yard lies Austin with sprawling limbs, his face glimmering white in the dawn, and the <b>hose</b> <b>nozzle</b> still projecting from his dead hand. The whole of human kind is typified in that one half-ludicrous and half-pathetic figure, lying so helpless beside the machine which it used to control.|$|R
