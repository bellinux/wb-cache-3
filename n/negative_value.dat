Similarly, a positive longitude value refers to the eastern hemisphere, and a <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> refers to the western hemisphere. The coordinates used {{in this article are}} sourced from Google Earth, which makes use of the WGS84 geodetic reference system. Additionally, a negative altitude value refers to land below sea level.|$|E
5|$|An Octopus card may store {{a maximum}} value of HK$1,000, with an On-Loan card having an initial deposit value of HK$50 and a Sold card having no initial deposit value. <b>Negative</b> <b>value</b> is {{incurred}} on a card {{if it is}} used with insufficient funds—both types of cards may carry a maximum <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> of HK$35 before value needs {{to be added to}} them again for use. At the time, the maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line was HK$34.8, the cost of travelling between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Lo Wu Station; the current maximum cost is HK$55.3, the cost of travelling between Disneyland Resort Station and either Lo Wu Station or Lok Ma Chau Station.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than the}} Octopus card itself, {{operator}} Octopus Cards Limited also sells watches and mobile phone covers that function as anonymous Octopus cards. The types of watches available include wrist watches, pocket watches, and watch key chains. The mobile phone covers were {{specifically designed for}} Nokia models 3310 and 3330, and iPhone 4 and 4S. As with the card itself, these products are used by waving them over a card reader. They may be reloaded with money value {{the same way as}} the card itself, including automatic reloading via the Automatic Add Value Service, with the exception that they cannot be reloaded at Add Value Machines due to their shapes. An Octopus watch or mobile phone cover may be stored with a maximum of HK$1,000, but do not have any initial stored value at the time of its purchase. It may have a maximum <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> of HK$35 as with an Octopus card. These products are not refundable for their costs, but the remaining value stored on them may be refunded if they are damaged, with the damaged product itself also returned to the customer.|$|E

The first three regions, investigated by Leech [6], Shanks [9] and Lehmer [6], contain {{only a few thousand}} <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> of ÃŽÂ” 4 (x, 3, 1). However, the authors [1] have recently discovered 3 new regions, the sixth occurring before 20 billion and containing more than half a billion <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> of ÃŽÂ” 4 (x, 3, 1). In this paper numerical and graphical details of all six regions are given. Moreover, new results for the modulus 8 are presented. Previously, no <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> have been found for ÃŽÂ” 8 (x,c, 1), c= 3, 5, or 7 and our search to 1012 reveals no such values for ÃŽÂ” 8 (x, 3, 1) or ÃŽÂ” 8 (x, 7, 1). For ÃŽÂ” 8 (x, 5, 1) we have discovered the first two regions of <b>negative</b> <b>values.</b> The first of these regions, beginning at x= 588067889, contains 422, 500 <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> of ÃŽÂ” 8 (x, 5, 1); the second occurs in the vicinity of 35 billion and contains more than a billion <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> of ÃŽÂ” 8 (x, 5, 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Uniform auctions are {{commonly}} used to elicit willingness to pay for new or novel products, product attributes, or non-market goods. However, most auctions or other contingent-valuation techniques do not allow for <b>negative</b> <b>values,</b> {{despite the fact that}} many consumers hold <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> for these products or product attributes. We conducted a WTP auction for a new product along with a within-sample WTA second auction allowing for negative responses. We find that failing to allow for <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> significantly inflates willingness to pay estimates and estimates of expected market share. This paper provides a method of incorporating <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> into auctions and willingness to pay elicitation.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{concerns}} the interrelationship between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>values.</b> Previous research has treated personal values as a bipolar {{process in which}} <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> can be described merely as desired values with the opposite sign. Contrary to values research, the study of motivation has shown that approach motivation is conceptually distinctive from the motivation of avoidance. The results revealed that, in general, level positive and <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> form two opposite domains that are not completely independent. On a more specific level of analysis the structure of <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> did not mirror the structure of positive values: They formed a single general negativity factor, which had no significant loadings {{on any of the}} six positive value factors...|$|R

25|$|Note {{that this}} {{negative}} being {{the same number}} is detected as an overflow condition since there was a carry into but {{not out of the}} most-significant bit. This can lead to unexpected bugs in that an unchecked implementation of absolute value could return a negative number {{in the case of the}} minimum negative. The abs family of integer functions in C typically has this behaviour. This is also true for Java.
