40|$|The article treats {{theoretical}} aspects {{and features}} of obsolescence of <b>new</b> <b>forms.</b> The {{article contains a}} vision of the causes and consequences of the emergence of <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> of obsolescence and their comparative analysis with classical forms of obsolescence. The study is based on analysis of the theoretical framework of the research, covering the processes of the occurrence of an obsolescence of <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> and their consequences. Making a comparative analysis of causation, the author came to the conclusion of the special economic essence and nature of obsolescence of <b>new</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R

40|$|As the European Union {{is turning}} into a polity, issues of {{accountability}} increasingly have found their way onto political and academic agendas. One recurring issue is whether these <b>new</b> multi-level <b>forms</b> of governance require <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> of accountability. The article explores the meaning of new accountabilities and whether these would help to overcome possible accountability deficits. Since accountability is an ambiguous and contestable concept, the contribution first analyses the concept and then narrows it substantially before discussing the meaning of these <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> of accountability, both theoretically and in practice. <b>New</b> <b>forms</b> of accountability are diagonal or horizontal in character and include accountability to administrative forums, to citizens, clients, and civil society. The conclusion is that <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> of accountability enhance policy learning and provide a series of formal and informal checks and balances but they are no alternative to traditional forms of popular control. We therefore need traditional and <b>new</b> <b>forms</b> of accountability regarding European governance...|$|R

Dr. Mario, Roy, Young Link, Mewtwo, and Pichu are the first characters to not return from a previous game, though they do appear as stickers or trophies.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic {{table in a}} <b>new</b> <b>form,</b> with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows, and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist. These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements. It is often stated that the last naturally occurring element to be discovered was francium (referred to by Mendeleev as eka-caesium) in 1939. However, plutonium, produced synthetically in 1940, was identified in trace quantities as a naturally occurring element in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Lutyens {{was profoundly}} {{affected}} by the war and sought a <b>new</b> <b>form</b> of architecture to memorialise the Lost Generation.

It is the most intricate of Lutyens' civic memorials to feature a statue of Saint George, though his memorial inside Wellington College's chapel features a similar sculpture of George and the Dragon. Fordham War Memorial in Cambridgeshire and Hove War Memorial in East Sussex both feature less intricate bronze statues of George with a sword and shield.|$|E
