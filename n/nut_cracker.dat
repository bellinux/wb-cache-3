50|$|<b>Nuts</b> <b>Cracker,</b> {{the first}} villain {{seen in the}} game, {{is the leader of}} a {{dangerous}} criminal gang known as the Gingerbread Grifter Gang.

He also speaks in a goofy Italian accent. When defeated, he will often throw his head—which then explodes—while his body runs away.

Though defeated, <b>Nuts</b> <b>Cracker's</b> body manages to escape, as always, and Mail thus cannot claim any bounty. Frustrated once more, she off-putedly takes <b>Nuts</b> <b>Cracker's</b> head and wanders back into town. At the bounty post, she attempts to trade the head in for cash, but like with many who have sought to capture <b>Nuts</b> <b>Cracker</b> before her, duplicates of his head are all they could retrieve, making the attempt a failure. Instead, however, she learns of a new bounty and becomes reinvigorated when she spots a 2,000,000 gold reward poster for the wizard turned criminal, Muttonhead, near the post. With sword in hand and hope in heart, Mail makes leads into the nearby forest for clues. Eventually, her quest to undertake the biggest catch of her career, will turn out greater, more perilous, more dangerous- yet more important, and even more rewarding- than she imagines.|$|R

5000|$|Mickey {{falls asleep}} after reading Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll. An astral {{projection}} of himself (presumably Mickey {{in his dream}} state) leaves his body and passes through his mirror into an alternate version of his house. His furniture and possessions have come to life and are complete with faces and personalities, {{but most of them}} remain motionless. He jumps on a rocking chair that throws him off in annoyance while a nearby coat rack watches in surprise, and lands on the foot rest that behaves like a puppy while Mickey rides on it like a horse until it jumps into the rocking chair. While the chair tries to calm down the foot rest, Mickey tries to comfort them, only to end up angering them instead. He bumps into an umbrella, who scolds him until it suddenly drops open and re-closes itself in embarrassment and returns to where it originally was. Mickey then comes across a <b>nut</b> <b>cracker</b> breaking open a walnut and offers it to him while it eats the shells, who suddenly shrinks after eating it. The telephone suddenly rings and it throws its receiver down to Mickey, who uses it to climb up to the table. He attempts to answer the call only to get responses from the phone itself and then proceeds to jump rope with the telephone, who uses its receiver and wire as a jump rope while the radio begins playing music. Mickey begins to dance his way through his house, tap dancing on a top hat (wearing a tiny one with a match for a cane) with some gloves, playing cards, and eventually the Queen of Hearts card (who resembles Greta Garbo). The joker on his bicycle notices and alerts the King of Hearts who uses the joker's bike to get down there and pulls the queen aside before proceeding to fight for his lady in a sword duel with Mickey, who uses both a sewing needle and a button as a makeshift sword. Mickey defeats the king by pushing him into an inkwell, where a stamp takes him out and cleans him. Considering this as the last straw, the king then orders for the cards to be called out to get rid of Mickey for good and the radio acts as an alarm to summon the cards like police cars - [...] "Calling all cards! Calling all cards!" [...] in which some come out from the king's throne and some come out from a drawer. Chaos ensues and Mickey runs from the cards. He picks up a fountain pen, hides in a basket of yarn, and uses the pen like a machine gun to fire ink at the cards while wearing a thimble like a helmet. The pen eventually runs out of ink. allowing the cards to pig-pile on Mickey, who then escapes in a torn sock. After being spotted, the cards give chase again and throw their pictures at him, who then turns on an electric fan to blow the cards back while the telephone calls the police in panic, swings from a lamp rope, runs on a globe until him trips and falls into the globe's ocean and is throw out by who appears to be small version of Neptune, grows back to his normal size, and escapes back to the real world through the mirror where he reenters his body. Eventually he is awakened by his alarm clock and it has all been a dream, and goes back to sleep after throwing his alarm clock into a drawer.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impinging}} velocitythat gives that maximum cracking {{efficiency of}} a vertical shaft centrifugal palm nut cracking machine was determined in this study. A nut cracking energy instrument {{which consists of}} a hammering mass falling vertically on palm nuts placed on a base {{was used to determine}} potential energy required to crack the nuts. This energy was equated to the kinetic energy required to crack the nuts in a centrifugal palm nut cracking machine, from which the average impinging velocity was determined. Experiment was carried out to generate cracking energy data for both Dura and Tenera varieties of palm nuts available in the study area. For Dura type, highest percentage of fully cracked (FC) nuts and average impinging velocity of 32. 50 m/s were obtained when the height of the hammering mass was set at 0. 15 m, 0. 25 m and 0. 30 m for nuts sorted into diameter ranges of d < 15 mm, 15 mm ≤ d ≤ 18 mm, and 18 mm ≤ d ≤ 22 mm respectively. For the Tenera type, highest percentage of fully cracked (FC) nuts and average impinging velocity of 39. 56 m/s were obtained when the height of the hammering mass was set at 0. 09 m, 0. 10 m and 0. 13 m for nuts sorted into diameter ranges of 9 mm <d < 13 mm, 13 mm ≤ d ≤ 15 mm, and 15 mm ≤ d ≤ 20 mm respectively. The overall average impinging velocity of 36 m/s was obtained for both varieties of palm nut and which was used in the design and construction of a centrifugal palm <b>nut</b> <b>cracker.</b> The results of testing the cracker showed that it has cracking efficiency of 98. 75 % and kernel extraction efficiency of 63. 4 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the association between the probability of having high DMFT scores and reported consumption of eight food groups. The sample included Americans (aged from 9 to 29 years) examined during the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 1971 and 1974. Analysis was restricted to comparing those individuals having DMFT scores equal to or above the 80 th percentile of the DMFT distribution with those having scores equal to or below the 20 th percentile of the distribution. The strongest discriminator between the low- and high-DMFT groups was the between-meal consumption of table sugars and syrups. The between-meal consumption of sugary desserts was also significantly associated with high DMFT scores. Foods to which table sugars are usually added before consumption, such as coffee, chocolate, and tea drinks, were associated with high DMFT scores in the bivariate analysis. When the same-day consumption of table sugars and syrups was accounted for, the associations became nonsignificant. The reported consumption of breakfast cereals, bread, fruit juices, ice cream, and <b>nuts</b> and <b>crackers</b> was not associated with high DMFT scores, perhaps because they were consumed only infrequently...|$|R

40|$|The genus Canarium (Burseraceae) {{contains}} approximately 100 species, mostly {{found in}} tropical Asia and the Pacific. In the Pacific, C. indicum is widely utilized for its edible nuts.

We are investigating postharvest processing methods for C. indicum that are appropriate to Pacific Island countries. Our research is examining depulping, drying, cracking, testa removal, roasting and packaging methods.
