25|$|In The Concept of Anxiety, Haufniensis {{focuses on}} the first anxiety {{experienced}} by man: Adam's choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or <b>not.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> concepts {{of good and evil}} did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed original sin, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety {{comes from the fact that}} God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.|$|E

2500|$|A1234In transliterations {{of modern}} Israeli Hebrew, initial and final ע (in regular transliteration), silent or initial א, and silent ה are not transliterated. To {{the eye of}} readers orientating {{themselves}} on Latin (or similar) alphabets, these letters {{might seem to be}} transliterated as vowel letters; however, these are in fact transliterations of the vowel diacritics – niqqud (or are representations of the spoken vowels). E.g., in אִם ("if", [...] ), אֵם ("mother", [...] ) and אֹם ("nut", [...] ), the letter א always represents the same consonant: [...] (glottal stop), whereas the vowels /i/, /e/ and /o/ respectively represent the spoken vowel, whether it is orthographically denoted by diacritics or <b>not.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> Academy of the Hebrew Language ascertains that א in initial position is not transliterated, the symbol for the glottal stop ʾ is omitted from the transliteration, and only the subsequent vowels are transliterated (whether or not their corresponding vowel diacritics appeared in the text being transliterated), resulting in [...] "im", [...] "em" [...] and [...] "om", respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The large {{majority}} of Mexicans have historically been classified as [...] "Mestizos". In modern Mexican usage, the term mestizo is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity {{it was during the}} colonial era, resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes being classified under the same identity, regardless of wheter they are of mixed ancestry or <b>not.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> term carries a variety of different socio-cultural, economic, racial and biological meanings, it was deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification, thus it was abandoned by the government and is not in wide use in Mexican society, although it's often used in literature about Mexican social identities and on intellectual circles. In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo has historically had a different meaning, being used to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the Caste War of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos. In Chiapas the word [...] "Ladino" [...] is used instead of mestizo. According to Encyclopædia Britannica racially Mestizo Mexicans make up 50% to 67% of the country's population.|$|E
2500|$|The year {{following}} the Melody Maker cover saw Suede captivate a pop phenomenon of critical praise and hype. <b>Not</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{dawn of the}} Smiths had a British band caused such excitement {{with the release of}} just a few singles. Suede are regarded by many as the first British band to break into the mainstream from the new wave of alternative rock in the '90s. With their glam rock style and musical references of urban Britain, Suede paved the way for acts such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp to enter the British mainstream. They were influential in returning some of the creative impetus to English guitar music in a scene increasingly dominated by Madchester, Grunge and Shoegazing. A March 1993 article in The Independent wrote that [...] "Suede have had more hype than anybody since the Smiths, or possibly even the Sex Pistols. The reviews are florid, poetic, half-crazed; they express the almost lascivious delight of journalists hungry for something to pin their hopes on." [...] Even beyond their own shores, American heavy metal personality Eric Greif declared that Suede [...] "reinvented and repackaged glam in a creative way, and how refreshing that was as a counterpoint to the drab grunge of the time." ...|$|E
