25|$|The word law is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym of probability distribution, and convergence in law means convergence in distribution. Accordingly, the Poisson distribution {{is sometimes}} called the law of small numbers {{because it is the}} probability distribution of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences</b> of an event that happens rarely but has very many opportunities to happen. The Law of Small Numbers is a book by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz (Bortkevitch) about the Poisson distribution, published in 1898.|$|E
25|$|In {{an ideal}} error free world with high read coverage, {{the task of}} variant calling {{from the results of}} a NGS data {{alignment}} would be simple; at each locus (position on the genome) the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences</b> of each distinct nucleotide among the reads aligned at that position can be counted, and the true genotype would be obvious; either AA if all nucleotides match allele A, BB if they match allele B, or AB if there is a mixture. However, when working with real NGS data this sort of naive approach is not used, as it cannot account for the noise in the input data. The nucleotide counts used for base calling contain errors and bias, both due do the sequenced reads themselves, and the alignment process. This issue can be mitigated to some extent by sequencing to a greater depth of read coverage, however this is often expensive, and many practical studies require making inferences on low coverage data.|$|E
40|$|A {{borehole}} {{with the}} depth of 405 m was drilled in the lava dome, which is 2. 8 km northwestof the active crater of Minami-dake, Sakurajima Volcano. A hydrophone was installed inthe groundwater {{at the bottom of}} the borehole to observe acoustic waves associated with thevolcanic activity. The acoustic waves observed by the hydrophone are classified into two types by thewaveforms. One is a low-frequency acoustic wave of which dominant frequency is 8. 8 Hz. The acoustic waves of this type are inferred to be caused by seismic waves. The other isa high-frequency acoustic wave (HAW) of which dominant frequencies are both 25 Hz and 8. 8 Hz. No significant seismic events are observed at the time <b>of</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> HAW. Examining the relationship among the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> HAW, seismic activityand the concentration of hydrogen gas monitored in Mochiki borehole-C which is 4. 0 kmsouthwest of the active crater, the following results were obtained. 1) The increases in <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> HAW are observed after the significantincreases in the concentration of hydrogen gas. 2) The increases in <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> HAW are observed at the almost same timewhen A-type earthquakes occurred beneath the active crater. 3) The change <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> the HAW is similar to that of B-typeearthquakes. The increases in <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> HAW are observed before B-type earthquakeswarms and eruptions occur...|$|R

40|$|Hairpin {{completion}} is {{an abstract}} operation modeling a DNA bio-operation which receives as input a DNA strand w = xα y, and outputs w' = x α y α̅x̅, where x̅ denotes the Watson-Crick complement of x. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the problem of finding conditions under which the iterated hairpin completion of a given word is regular. According to the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> words α and that initiate hairpin completion and how they are scattered, we classify the set of all words w. For some basic classes of words w containing small <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences</b> <b>of</b> α and, we prove that the iterated hairpin completion of w is regular. For other classes with higher <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences</b> <b>of</b> α and, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the iterated hairpin completion of a word in these classes to be regular.

Since the study investigates the effect <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> disaster <b>occurrences</b> (and not the effect generated by the specific type and severity of the disasters), when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> disaster <b>occurrences</b> increases, then the probability of having high impact disasters within those occurrences also increases. This in turn indicates a clear negative effect on countries’ technological change and technological catch-up levels. Furthermore, {{our findings suggest that}} the turning points are much lower for lower-income countries indicating that these countries suffer more from the negative impact of disasters.
