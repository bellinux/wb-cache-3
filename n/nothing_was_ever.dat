5|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic. Cabot sailed in 1497, {{five years after the}} European discovery of America, but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland, and, mistakenly believing (like Christopher Columbus) that he had reached Asia, there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> heard of his ships again.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 1942, Marseille {{claimed his}} 100th aerial victory. He was the 11th Luftwaffe pilot {{to achieve the}} century mark. Marseille then {{returned}} to Germany for two months leave and the following day was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. On 6 August, he began his journey back to North Africa accompanied by his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper. On 13 August, he met Benito Mussolini in Rome and was presented with the highest Italian military award for bravery, the Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare. While in Italy Marseille disappeared for some time prompting the German authorities to compile a missing persons report, submitted by the Gestapo head in Rome, Herbert Kappler. He was finally located. According to rumours he had run off with an Italian girl and was eventually persuaded {{to return to his}} unit. Unusually, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> said about the incident and no repercussions were visited upon Marseille for this indiscretion.|$|E

25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E
500|$|Gian Gastone {{died from}} [...] "an {{accumulation}} of diseases" [...] on 9 July 1737, surrounded by prelates and his sister. Anna Maria Luisa {{was offered a}} nominal regency by the Prince de Craon, the Grand Duke's envoy, until Francis III could arrive in Florence, but declined. At Gian Gastone's demise, all the House of Medici's allodial possessions, including £2,000,000 liquid cash, a vast art collection, robes of state and lands in the former Duchy of Urbino, were conferred on Anna Maria Luisa. In regards to this, her most notable act was the Patto di Famiglia ("Family Pact"), signed on 31 October 1737. In collaboration with the Holy Roman Emperor and Francis of Lorraine, she willed all the personal property of the Medici's to the Tuscan state, provided that <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> removed from Florence.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first {{match at}} Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1. According to {{football}} writer Sid Lowe, [...] "There {{have been relatively}} few mentions of the game [...] {{and it is not}} a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims." [...] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> proven.|$|E

500|$|Gens {{started a}} {{theater in the}} ghetto, where poetry {{readings}} {{as well as the}} production of new and old plays took place. Gens continued the policy of supporting the ghetto library and in March 1943 he ordered that all ghetto residents should turn their privately owned books over to the library, except for textbooks and prayer books. He also set up a ghetto publishing house. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> published, but the authors were paid for their manuscripts. An archive of historical documents relating to the ghetto was set up. The ghetto had a symphony orchestra, the formation of which owed some impetus to Gens and his police force. Gens justified these cultural activities by claiming that the Jewish administration [...] "wanted to give man the chance to be free of the ghetto for a few hours, and we succeeded in this. Our days here are harsh and grim. Our body is here in the ghetto, but they have not broken our spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1897 {{as members}} of the Household {{prepared}} to depart for Cimiez for the Queen's annual visit, they insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party, and decided to resign if he did so. When Harriet Phipps, one of the Queen's maids of honour, informed her of the collective decision, the Queen swept the contents of her desk onto the floor in a fury. The Household backed down, but the holiday was marred by increased resentment and rows between the Household and Victoria. She thought their distrust and dislike of Karim was motivated by [...] "race prejudice" [...] and jealousy. When Rafiuddin Ahmed joined Karim in Cimiez, the Household forced him to leave, which Victoria thought [...] "disgraceful", and she asked the prime minister to issue an apology to Ahmed, explaining he was only excluded because he had written articles in newspapers and pressmen were not permitted. Ponsonby wrote in late April, [...] " [...] happens to be a thoroughly stupid and uneducated man, and his one idea in life seems to be to do nothing and to eat as much as he can." [...] Reid warned the Queen that her attachment to Karim had led to questions about her sanity, and Hamilton telegraphed to Elgin requesting information on the Munshi and his family in an effort to discredit him. On receiving Elgin's reply that they were [...] "Respectable and trustworthy... but position of family humble", Hamilton concluded [...] "the Munshi has done nothing to my knowledge which is reprehensible or deserving of official stricture... enquiries wd not be right, unless they were in connection with some definite statement or accusation." [...] He did, however, authorise further investigation of the [...] "Mohamedan intriguer named Rafiuddin". <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> proven against Ahmed, who later became a Bombay government official and was knighted in 1932. The effect of the row, in Hamilton's words, was [...] "to put him [...] more into his humble place, and his influence will not be the same in the future".|$|E
500|$|Gladstone {{resigned}} as Prime Minister in 1885 following a Government defeat over the Irish home rule question. The new Tory government {{was led by}} Lord Salisbury. However, as a minority administration it was not expected to last, and a swift return of the former administration was anticipated. During this period serious (if unproven) charges of plotting and ruthless ambition {{were about to be}} levelled against Lady Rosebery. Sir Charles Dilke, considered as a likely replacement for Gladstone, and thus a rival to Rosebery in government, was implicated {{in one of the most}} scandalous and ruinous divorce cases of the era. Involvement in any divorce was social suicide in the 19th century, but the facts which emerged were enough to ensure it was political suicide as well. A friend of the Roseberys, Donald Crawford, MP, sued his wife Virginia for divorce naming Dilke as co-respondent. There was little evidence and Dilke denied the charge, which could have been ultimately forgotten, if Virginia had not suddenly decided to sign a confession giving such lurid details that a great scandal was unavoidable. She claimed that not only had Dilke slept with her and taught her [...] "French vices", but also slept with her mother and partaken in a three-in-a-bed orgy with Virginia and a maid. Dilke denied everything, but his hopes of high political office were ruined forever. Dilke claimed the whole thing was an embroidery of lies and conspiracies by his political enemies. Rumours began to circulate that the Roseberys, and Lady Rosebery in particular, were at the bottom of Dilke's misfortune. In his futile quest to exonerate himself, and grasping at rumour, Dilke wrote to Rosebery accusing Lady Rosebery of having paid Virginia to make the confession. An outraged Rosebery denied all on his wife's behalf, while in December 1885 Lady Rosebery's only response on being told of Virginia Crawford's confessions was: [...] "Dilke's behaviour is very astonishing in some reports, though it is not an actual surprise to me." [...] Early the following year Gladstone was returned to power and Rosebery was appointed Foreign Secretary in Gladstone's third but brief term of office. Dilke's political career was ruined, and for years afterwards he continued to expound the Rosebery conspiracy theory. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> proven against Lady Rosebery and no tangible evidence exists to substantiate the claim.|$|E
