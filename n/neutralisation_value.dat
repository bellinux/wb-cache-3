40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} artificial intelligence for diagnosing the condition of high voltage bushings. The techniques include neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy set theory, particle swarm optimisation, multi-classifier systems, factor analysis, principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, data-fusion techniques, automatic relevance determination and autoencoders. The classification is done using Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) data based on field experience together with criteria from IEEEc 57. 104 and IEC 60599. A review of current literature showed that common methods for the diagnosis of bushings are: partial discharge, DGA, tan- (dielectric dissipation factor), water content in oil, dielectric strength of oil, acidity level (<b>neutralisation</b> <b>value),</b> visual analysis of sludge in suspension, colour of the oil, furanic content, degree of polymerisation (DP), strength of the insulating paper, interfacial tension or oxygen content tests. All the methods have limitations {{in terms of time}} and accuracy in decision making. The fact that making decisions using each of these methods individually is highly subjective, also the huge size of the data base of historical data, as well as the loss of skills due to retirement of experienced technical staff, highlights the need for an automated diagnosis tool that integrates information from the many sensors and recalls the historical decisions and learns from new information. Three classifiers that are compared in this analysis are radial basis functions (RBF), multiple layer perceptrons (MLP) and support vector machines (SVM). In this work 60699 bushings were classified based on ten criteria. Classification was done based on a majority vote. The work proposes the application of neural networks with particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) to compensate for missing data in classifying high voltage bushings. The work also proposes the application of fuzzy set theory (FST) to diagnose the condition of high voltage bushings. The relevance and redundancy detection methods were able to prune the redundant measured variables and accurately diagnose the condition of the bushing with fewer variables. Experimental results from bushings that were evaluated in the field verified the simulations. The results of this work can help to develop real-time monitoring and decision making tools that combine information from chemical, electrical and mechanical measurements taken from bushings...|$|E

40|$|Lime is an {{important}} and versatile chemical used {{in a wide range}} of applications. The term lime, which is strictly calcium oxide (CaO), is applied to a range of products arising from the processing of limestone and dolomite. Many less developed countries do not have adequate lime production and this leads to problems associated with under-utilisation of lime. In particular, insufficient application of agricultural lime (aglime) can lead to soil acidification, with associated aluminium / manganese toxicity and poor crop yields. As part of the UK Government’s commitment to provide technical assistance to developing countries, a project was initiated to help solve this problem. The BGS / Department for International Development (DFID) project “Local development of affordable lime in Southern Africa” (R 6492) aimed to encourage the development of low-cost lime for agriculture and water treatment. As part of the project, carbonate resources were matched with appropriate lime production technology to provide a methodology for the establishment of local production units. This document is a compilation of reports, including the project deliverables. It is a companion document to the project summary report (WC/ 98 / 21). The project was undertaken in collaboration with the Zambian Geological Survey Department (GSD) and Intermediate Technology Zimbabwe (ITZ). It focused on aglime production in Zambia, following the recommendations of a recent survey of the lime industry of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region (AUSTROPLAN, 1990). The project was divided into three main activities: 1) 	Lime evaluation programme 2) 	Small-scale lime production research 3) 	Dissemination The aim of the lime evaluation programme was to identify carbonate resources suitable for use as lime close to the point of need. A ‘market survey’ was carried out to determine the demand for lime, its quality, quantity and where it is most needed. The findings indicated that Zambia has a suppressed demand for aglime, especially in the northern provinces and those provinces more heavily cultivated. Aglime consumption is held back by its poor availability and relatively high cost. A review of the carbonate resources of Zambia identified numerous dolomitic carbonates that are potentially suitable for the production of aglime. Most of the carbonates occur in the Basement Complex and the Katanga Supergroup, along the line of rail from Livingstone up to the Copperbelt and North-Western provinces, as well as smaller deposits in Luapula, Northern and Eastern provinces. Appropriate laboratory evaluation test methods were identified to determine the properties that are critical for the effective use of limestone and dolomite as aglime, as follows: i) 	Plant nutrient content, especially calcium and magnesium oxide content ii) 	Neutralising ability, important for amelioration of soil acidity iii) 	Particle-size distribution, a principal factor in controlling the effectiveness of aglime iv) 	Agronomic effectiveness, the rate at which aglime reacts to neutralise soil acidity v) 	Ease of pulverisation (or grindability), {{an important}} factor in the production of ground limestone and dolomite A carbonate-sampling programme resulted in the collection of 35 samples from approximately 20 sites across Zambia. All the samples were evaluated, firstly for their mineralogy and major element chemistry at the BGS, and secondly for their plant nutrient content, neutralising ability, agronomic effectiveness and ease of pulverisation at the GSD. The test results were used to “screen” the samples, those with <b>Neutralisation</b> <b>Values</b> higher than 80...|$|R
