5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri {{plan their}} next heist. As Dixit's {{analysis}} has named Rio {{the location of}} Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, and Ali immediately falls for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. Aryan forces Sunehri {{to play a game}} of Russian roulette. Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted shots from the gun, neither is injured, because Aryan has <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. Sunehri indicates that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up {{on the top of a}} waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free.|$|E

25|$|Barrel {{burnishing}} {{is a type}} of barreling {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or cream of tartar. The barrel is <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 November, the {{reinforcements}} and the loyal members of the 26th and 62nd Regiments moved into position. They secretly surrounded the sepoy camp ground and a final message {{was sent to the}} mutineers, demanding that they lay down arms before any discussion on grievances but it is said that only ten minutes were offered to make up their minds. The sepoys either hesitated or rejected the ultimatum and Paget ordered two cannons to fire on the rebels, followed by an attack from the rear by the secretly placed horse artillery. Surprised by this sudden assault, the sepoys tried to flee {{but the rest of the}} British regiments attacked from all directions. Some of the sepoys jumped into the Hooghly River to escape and drowned, others entered local households for shelter but the loyalists chased them in and killed them with bayonets. Many bystanders, including women and children who happened to be in the neighbourhood, were killed during the operation. Afterwards, it was found that the muskets of the Indian sepoys were <b>not</b> <b>loaded.</b> Stevenson concludes that this implies no violence was intended by the rebels.|$|E

500|$|Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) {{returns from}} the , bearing Charlie's final message that the {{freighter}} offshore is not owned by Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger). [...] The survivors reunite at 815's cockpit. [...] Jack knocks Locke to the ground, takes his gun and pulls the trigger, but finds that the gun is <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> because Locke {{had no intention of}} killing Jack earlier that day. [...] Locke tells the castaways that they are in great danger and leaves for the Barracks with Hurley, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and her baby Aaron, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) and her captive Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), Alex (Tania Raymonde) and her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff), Vincent the dog (Pono) and four other survivors. [...] Soon after, Jack and Kate see a helicopter and meet Daniel.|$|E
500|$|Three {{minutes after}} the count was resumed, the hatch {{installation}} was started. The hatch consisted of three parts: a removable inner hatch, which stayed inside the cabin; a hinged outer hatch, {{which was part of}} the spacecraft's heat shield; and an outer hatch cover, which was part of the boost protective cover enveloping the entire Command Module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch, and from launch escape rocket exhaust {{in the event of a}} launch abort. The boost hatch cover was partially, but not fully, latched in place because the flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power. (The spacecraft's fuel cell reactants were <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> for this test.) After the hatches were sealed, the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at , [...] higher than atmospheric pressure.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{allow the}} cast to perform {{many of their}} own stunts. In filming fight sequences, they were carefully choreographed beforehand so the actors could participate themselves. The guns featured on the series are real. In scenes where guns are included, an armourer is on hand throughout {{the entirety of the}} sequence to see if the actors are handling them properly and gives out the guns to the actors at the last possible second before filming. After the sequence is shot, the guns have to be returned and locked in a case to prevent anybody from playing with them, even if the guns are <b>not</b> <b>loaded.</b> Among other stunt work, Armitage was asked to be subjected to an actual waterboarding scene to ensure the authenticity of the sequence. The actor agreed after he was convinced by conultants from the FSB and CIA. Kudos film and television, the production company behind Spooks, had to follow several health and safety provisions from an advisor to ensure the sequence strictly adheres to the advice. The advisor and a medic were present during filming. Armitage was only waterboarded for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear as if he was on for longer. The ambient temperature of the room was also raised to make Armitage as comfortable as possible. Following the sequence, Armitage stated [...] "I only lasted five to ten seconds, and the sound of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Version 9.1 was {{released}} in November, 1991. It is a maintenance update that makes REVIC compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. Previous versions of REVIC will <b>not</b> <b>load</b> files correctly similar to the previous problem with MS-DOS 4.0/4.01.|$|R
50|$|Variations on {{the above}} include a smaller BSaved file format that does <b>not</b> <b>load</b> the unused memory {{after the second}} interleaf, nor the {{traditional}} trailer byte 0x1a (CPM EOF). This resulted in a slight saving of disk space.|$|R
25|$|In Internet Explorer 9, the {{extensibility}} {{mechanisms for}} Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) and toolbars remain the same. <b>Not</b> <b>loading</b> BHOs or toolbars improves startup time, but limits {{the ability of}} developers to augment the user experience through these extensibility mechanisms.|$|R
500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, but it is <b>not</b> <b>loaded.</b> Nina's boyfriend Simon {{is a fan of}} cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the office of Squires—a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinx—to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E
2500|$|Jamie {{insists that}} he was only {{thinking}} of Richmond, brandishes a gun and scorns his idealism. He tells him that if {{he wants to be a}} leader, he has to be willing to get [...] "blood on your hands". After a dispatcher informs Holder that Jamie's campaign vehicle was found at City Hall, he, Linden, and Gwen arrive at the campaign office. Jamie commits suicide by cop when he points the gun at Linden, and Holder then shoots him dead. Later, a cop informs them that the gun was <b>not</b> <b>loaded.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With anti-sand filters fitted, {{a maximum}} {{horizontal}} speed of 250km/h (155mph) {{was reported in}} some cases and several units were even unable to take off at all. These machines were fitted with [...] "Spezzoniera" [...] Nardi dispensers (with 119kg/262lb bomblets), 1,000 rounds for the three 12.7mm (0.5in) machine guns and 500 rounds for the 7.7mm (0.303in) Bredas. Although the weapons were <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> to full capacity and the aircraft was lightened by eliminating the rear machine gun, observer, bombs and some fuel, lessening the weight did not substantially affect the aircraft's performance.|$|E

2500|$|When {{determining}} if a decision-maker {{has failed}} {{to take into account}} mandatory relevant considerations, the courts tend to inquire into {{the manner in which the}} decision-maker balances the considerations. This is evident from the case of Chew Kia Ngee where the High Court held that the Singapore Society of Accountants' disciplinary committee had given [...] "undue emphasis" [...] to the fact that the applicant had signed an incompletely filled form. Similarly, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court stated that [...] "undue weight" [...] had been placed on certain documents as evidence that the applicant's company had <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> some goods on to ships for export.|$|E
2500|$|Suppose a {{researcher}} rolls {{a pair of}} dice once and assumes a null hypothesis that the dice are fair, <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> or weighted toward any specific number/roll/result; uniform. The test statistic is [...] "the sum of the rolled numbers" [...] and is one-tailed. The researcher rolls the dice and observes that both dice show 6, yielding a test statistic of 12. The p-value of this outcome is 1/36 (because under the assumption of the null hypothesis, the test statistic is uniformly distributed) or about 0.028 (the highest test statistic out of 6times&6nbsp&=nbsp&36 possible outcomes). If the researcher assumed a significance level of 0.05, this result would be deemed significant and {{the hypothesis that the}} dice are fair would be rejected.|$|E
2500|$|The second scheme, {{and the one}} {{implemented}} in many production-quality C++ compilers, is a table-driven approach. This creates static tables at compile time and link time that relate ranges of the program counter to the program state with respect to exception handling. [...] Then, if an exception is thrown, the runtime system looks up the current instruction location in the tables and determines what handlers are in play and {{what needs to be}} done. This approach minimizes executive overhead for the case where an exception is not thrown. This happens at the cost of some space, but this space can be allocated into read-only, special-purpose data sections that are <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> or relocated until an exception is actually thrown. [...] This second approach is also superior in terms of achieving thread safety.|$|E
50|$|Lightbox scripts are {{dependent}} upon a browser's JavaScript support,. Many Lightbox scripts use unobtrusive JavaScript. Browsers that do <b>not</b> <b>load</b> {{the script for}} whatever reason can instead simply load the image as a separate page load, losing the Lightbox effect but still retaining the ability to display the image.|$|R

2500|$|Chuckwagon {{racing is}} a team event, led by a driver who {{commands}} a team of horses pulling the chuckwagon, and is supported by two or four outriders, each racing individual thoroughbred horses that follow the chuckwagon. [...] Each race typically involves three or four teams, and begins with the outriders [...] "breaking camp", by tossing two tent poles (with four outriders only) and a barrel representing a camp stove {{into the back of}} their wagon before mounting their horses and following the wagons as they complete a figure eight around two barrels before circling a race track. [...] The first wagon to cross the finish line typically wins, although various time penalties are handed out for infractions such as a barrel being knocked over, a tent pole or stove <b>not</b> <b>loaded,</b> wagon interference or an outrider crossing the finish line too far behind his wagon driver.|$|E
2500|$|A {{static test}} of the C-17 wing in October 1992 {{resulted}} in the wing failing at 128% of design limit load, which was below the 150% requirement. Both wings buckled rear {{to the front and}} failures occurred in stringers, spars and ribs. Some $100 million was spent to redesign the wing structure; the wing failed at 145% during a second test in September 1993. A careful review of the test data, however, showed that the wing was <b>not</b> <b>loaded</b> correctly and did indeed meet the requirement. [...] The C-17 received the [...] "Globemaster III" [...] name in early 1993. In late 1993, the Department of Defense gave the contractor two years to solve production and cost overrun problems or face termination of the contract after the delivery of the 40th aircraft. [...] By accepting the 1993 terms, McDonnell Douglas incurred a loss of nearly US$1.5 billion on the development phase of the program.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lowering}} of Boat 2, {{the second of}} the two cutters, with an occupancy of 25 people was overseen by Wilde and Smith at about 1:45a.m. When Lightoller moved to the boat to get it ready for loading, he found that it was already filled with a large group of male passengers and crewmen. He ordered them out at gunpoint, telling them, [...] "Get out of there, you damned cowards! I'd like to see every one of you overboard!" [...] They fled, but {{had no way of knowing}} that his revolver was <b>not</b> <b>loaded.</b> Even at this late stage some boats were leaving with plenty of space aboard; Boat 2 appears to have been lowered with only 17 people aboard, out of a capacity of 40. The occupants were principally women, plus one male Third Class passenger, Anton Kink, who joined his wife and young daughter in the boat. Fourth Officer Boxhall was given charge of the boat.|$|E
