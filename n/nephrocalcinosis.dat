50|$|<b>Nephro{{calcinosis}},</b> {{once known}} as Albright's calcinosis after Fuller Albright, or Anderson-Carr kidneys, is a term originally used to describe deposition of calcium salts in the renal parenchyma due to hyperparathyroidism. It is now more commonly used to describe diffuse, fine, renal parenchymal calcification on radiology. During its early stages, <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> is visible on x-ray, and appears as a fine granular mottling over the renal outlines. These outlines eventually come {{together to form a}} dense mass.It is most commonly seen as an incidental finding with medullary sponge kidney on an abdominal x-ray.However, it may be severe enough to cause (as well as be caused by) renal tubular acidosis or even end stage renal failure, due to disruption of the renal tissue by the deposited calcium.|$|E
50|$|Dent's disease (or Dent disease) {{is a rare}} X-linked {{recessive}} inherited {{condition that}} affects the proximal renal tubules of the kidney. It is one cause of Fanconi syndrome, and is characterized by tubular proteinuria, excess calcium in the urine, formation of calcium kidney stones, <b>nephrocalcinosis,</b> and chronic kidney failure.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{irregularities}} {{often associated}} with Jansen's include: prominent or protruding eyes, a high-arched palate, micrognathia or abnormal smallness of the jaws - particularly the lower (mandible) jaw, choanal stenosis, wide cranial sutures and irregular formation of the long bones which can resemble rickets. <b>Nephrocalcinosis</b> (accumulation of calcium in the interstitum of the kidney) is seen commonly as well.|$|E
50|$|This is {{relatively}} straightforward. It involves correction of the acidemia with oral sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or potassium citrate. This will correct the acidemia and reverse bone demineralisation. Hypokalemia and urinary stone formation and <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> {{can be treated}} with potassium citrate tablets which not only replace potassium but also inhibit calcium excretion and thus do not exacerbate stone disease as sodium bicarbonate or citrate may do.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nephrocalcinosis</b> (kidney stones) cause {{significant}} mortality {{during both}} the hatchery and grow-out stages. These stones vary in diameter from 2-6 mm in the kidney and can block the urethra. This condition {{is not fully}} understood, but {{is thought to be}} a symptom of prolonged exposure to free carbon dioxide in excess of 10 mg/L. The ratio of calcium to magnesium in the diet could also be out of balance.|$|E
50|$|Most {{cases are}} {{asymptomatic}} or are discovered during {{an investigation of}} blood in the urine. Symptomatic patients typically present as middle-aged adults with renal colic, kidney stones, <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> and/or recurrent urinary tract infections; however, MSK also may affect children very rarely. In addition to the typical clinical phenotype of recurrent stone disease, other clinical profiles have now been recognized, that is, an indolent, almost asymptomatic MSK, and a rare form characterized by intractable pain.|$|E
50|$|Hypercalciuria or hypercalcinuria is the {{condition}} of elevated calcium in the urine. Chronic hypercalcinuria may lead to impairment of renal function, <b>nephrocalcinosis,</b> and renal insufficiency. Patients with hypercalciuria have kidneys that put out higher levels of calcium than normal. Calcium may come from one of two paths: through the gut where higher than normal levels of calcium are absorbed by the body or from the bones. A bone density scan (DSX) may be performed to determine if calcium is obtained from the bones.|$|E
50|$|In 90% of cases, {{neonatal}} Bartter {{syndrome is}} seen between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation with excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios). After birth, the infant {{is seen to}} urinate and drink excessively (polyuria, and polydipsia, respectively). Life-threatening dehydration may result if the infant does not receive adequate fluids. About 85% of infants dispose of excess amounts of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria) and kidneys (<b>nephrocalcinosis),</b> which may lead to kidney stones. In rare occasions, the infant may progress to renal failure.|$|E
50|$|The gene Claudin-16 was cloned by Simon et al. (1999), {{but only}} {{after a series of}} reports {{described}} the Mg2+ flux itself with no gene or protein. The expression pattern of the gene was determined by RT-PCR, and was shown to be very tightly confined to a continuous region of the kidney tubule running from the medullary thick descending limb to the distal convoluted tubule. This localisation was consistent with the earlier reports for the location of Mg2+ re-uptake by the kidney. Following the cloning, mutations in the gene were identified in patients with familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and <b>nephrocalcinosis,</b> strengthening the links between the gene and the uptake of Mg2+.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cause of kidney failure in {{multiple}} myeloma is due to proteins secreted by the malignant cells. Myeloma cells produce monoclonal proteins of varying types, most commonly immunoglobulins (antibodies) and free light chains, resulting in abnormally high levels of these proteins in the blood. Depending on the size of these proteins, they may be excreted through the kidneys. Kidneys can be damaged by the tubulopathic effects of proteins or light chains. Increased bone resorption leads to hypercalcemia and causes <b>nephrocalcinosis,</b> thereby contributing to the kidney failure. Amyloidosis is a distant third in the causation. Patients with amyloidosis have high levels of amyloid protein that can be excreted through the kidneys and cause damage to the kidneys and other organs.|$|E
50|$|Patients with classic Bartter {{syndrome}} {{may have}} symptoms {{in the first}} two years of life, but they are usually diagnosed at school age or later. Like infants with the neonatal subtype, patients with classic Bartter syndrome also have polyuria, polydipsia, and a tendency to dehydration, but normal or justslightly increased urinary calcium excretion without the tendency to develop kidney stones. These patients also have vomiting and growth retardation. Kidney function is also normal if the disease is treated, but occasionally patients proceed to end-stage kidney failure.Bartter's syndrome consists of low levels of potassium in the blood, alkalosis, normal to low blood pressures, and elevated plasma renin and aldosterone. Numerous causes of this syndrome probably exist. Diagnostic pointers include high urinary potassium and chloride despite low serum values, increased plasma renin, hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus on kidney biopsy, and careful exclusion of diuretic abuse. Excess production of prostaglandins by the kidneys is often found. Magnesium wasting may also occur. Homozygous patients suffer from severe hypercalciuria and <b>nephrocalcinosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Symptomatic GI {{involvement}} {{occurs in}} less than 1% of persons (note that this is if one excludes the liver), and most commonly the stomach is affected, although the small or large intestine may also be affected in {{a small portion of}} cases. Studies at autopsy have revealed GI involvement {{in less than}} 10% of people. These cases would likely mimic Crohn's disease, which is a more commonly intestine-affecting granulomatous disease. About 1-3% of people have evidence of pancreatic involvement at autopsy. Symptomatic kidney involvement occurs in just 0.7% of cases, although evidence of kidney involvement at autopsy has been reported in up to 22% of people and occurs exclusively in cases of chronic disease. Symptomatic kidney involvement is usually <b>nephrocalcinosis,</b> although granulomatous interstitial nephritis that presents with reduced creatinine clearance and little proteinuria is a close second. Less commonly, the epididymis, testicles, prostate, ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, or the vulva may be affected, the latter may cause vulva itchiness. Testicular involvement has been reported in about 5% of people at autopsy. In males, sarcoidosis may lead to infertility.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. The aim of {{our study}} was to examine {{long-term}} effects of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> in prematurely born children. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Preterm neonates (gestational age < 32 weeks) with (n = 3 D 42) and without (n = 3 D 32) <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> were prospectively studied at a mean age of 7. 5 (11. 0) years. RESULTS. Blood pressure did not differ in ex-preterm infants with and without <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> but was significantly higher than expected for healthy children. In comparison to healthy children, more ex-preterm infants with neonatal <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> had (mild) chronic renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate: < 85 mL/min per 1. 73 m 2; 6 of 40); this is in contrast to ex-preterm infants without neonatal <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> (2 of 32). Tubular phosphate reabsorption and plasma bicarbonate were significantly lower in children with <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> compared with children without <b>nephrocalcinosis.</b> In addition, more ex-preterm infants with and without <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> than expected had low values for plasma bicarbonate and early-morning urine osmolality compared with healthy children. Kidney length of ex-preterm infants with and without <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> was significantly smaller than expected in healthy children of the same height. <b>Nephrocalcinosis</b> persisted long-term in 4 of 42 children but was not related to blood pressure, kidney length, or renal function. CONCLUSIONS. <b>Nephrocalcinosis</b> in preterm neonates can have long-term sequelae for glomerular and tubular function. Furthermore, prematurity per se is associated with high blood pressure, relatively small kidneys, and (distal) tubular dysfunction. Long-term follow-up of blood pressure and renal glomerular and tubular function of preterm neonates, especially with neonatal <b>nephrocalcinosis,</b> seems warranted...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. Our aim was {{to review}} the sonographic {{features}} of type I primary hyperoxaluria in children and to correlate the sonographic patterns with the clinical development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). MATERIALS AND METHODS. We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical and imaging files of 13 patients with type I primary hyperoxaluria who were treated in one institution and of the sonographic patterns and the clinical follow-up reports. RESULTS. We encountered the following two sonographic patterns: medullary <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> in eight patients and cortical <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> in five patients. The sonographic appearance of cortical <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> is quite specific: a hyperechoic peripheral renal cortex with acoustic shadowing behind it. Medullary <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> is less specific {{because there are many}} other causes of hyperechoic pyramids. All patients with medullary <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> developed lithiasis {{during the course of the}} disease. All patients with cortical <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> but only two of eight with medullary <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> developed ESRD. CONCLUSION. Sonography can be used differentiate the two patterns of type 1 primary hyperoxaluria. The cortical <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> type carries a higher risk of developing ESRD. © American Roentgen Ray Society. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose <b>Nephrocalcinosis</b> is {{commonly}} present in primary hyperparathyroidism, distal {{renal tubular acidosis}} and medullary sponge kidney disease. To our knowledge {{it has not been}} studied in patients with calcium phosphate stones who do not have systemic disease. Materials and Methods We studied patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy who had calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate stones and did not have hyperparathyroidism, distal renal tubular acidosis or medullary sponge kidney disease. On postoperative day 1 all patients underwent noncontrast computerized tomography. If there were no residual calcifications, the patient was categorized as not having <b>nephrocalcinosis.</b> If there were residual calcifications, the patient underwent secondary percutaneous nephrolithotomy. If the calcifications were found to be stones, the patient was categorized as not having <b>nephrocalcinosis.</b> If the calcifications were not stones, the patient was categorized as having <b>nephrocalcinosis.</b> Patients were grouped based on the type of stones that formed, including hydroxyapatite, brushite and idiopathic calcium oxalate. The extent of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> was quantified as 0 —absent <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> to 3 —extensive <b>nephrocalcinosis.</b> Patients with residual calcifications on postoperative day 1 noncontrast computerized tomography who did not undergo secondary percutaneous nephrolithotomy were excluded from analysis. The presence or absence of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> was correlated with metabolic studies. Results A total of 67 patients were studied, including 14 with hydroxyapatite, 19 with brushite and 34 with idiopathic calcium oxalate calculi. <b>Nephrocalcinosis</b> was present in 10 of 14 (71. 4 %), 11 of 19 (57. 9 %) and 6 of 34 patients (17. 6 %) in the hydroxyapatite, brushite and idiopathic calcium oxalate groups, respectively (chi-square p = 0. 01). The mean extent of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> per group was 1. 98, 1. 32 and 0. 18 for hydroxyapatite, brushite and idiopathic calcium oxalate, respectively (p ≤ 0. 001). The presence of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> positively correlated with urine calcium excretion (mean ± SD 287. 39 ± 112. 49 vs 223. 68 ± 100. 67 mg per day, p = 0. 03).

40|$|<b>Nephrocalcinosis</b> is {{the result}} of a myriad of {{hereditary}} or acquired diseases in the calcium, phosphate or oxalate metabolism that lead to deposition of calcium containing precipitates within the kidney. <b>Nephrocalcinosis</b> and nephrolithiasis are pathophysiologically tightly related and often co-exist. In the case of recurrent nephrolithiasis, <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> has to be excluded. Stone analysis can yield important clues to the underlying disease process. The best way to diagnose <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> and an accompanying nephrolithiasis is by native computer tomography scans.

40|$|Background: An {{association}} between chronic hyperaldosteronism and medullary <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> {{has rarely been}} made, with {{only a handful of}} cases described in literature. Case Report: We describe five cases of hyperaldosteronism with a long- standing history in whom associated medullary <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> was established.

40|$|The {{premature}} has {{a reduced}} number of nephrons.

40|$|The {{effects of}} parathyroidectomy (PTX) on the {{development}} of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> in rats fed a diet containing alpha protein were investigated for the purpose of determining whether the <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> was phosphate-induced. PTX completely prevented the occurrence of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> in rats fed a phosphate-supplemented commercial laboratory diet for 4 weeks. However, PTX did not completely prevent the occurrence of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> in rats fed a phosphate-supplemented alpha protein diet. Several calciferous deposits were found in the inner medulla. The same was also found in rats that underwent sham operations and PTX rats fed the basal alpha protein diet. Total renal calcium and phosphorous levels in these three groups were also similar and were about twice as great as those in corresponding groups fed phosphate-supplemented and unsupplemented commercial laboratory diets. Therefore, we conclude that the <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> in rats fed a basal alpha protein diet is not induced by PTH or excess phosphate, but is induced by some other factor associated with the diet...|$|E
30|$|On {{the basis}} of these findings, an {{alternative}} hypothesis can be advanced: the genes involved {{in the development of the}} DD phenotype in the CLCN 5 − patients cause CKD through mechanisms other than those in the CLCN 5 + patients, where the associations between hypercalciuria and <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> and between <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> and CKD seem to indicate the direct involvement of the ClC- 5 alteration in the pathogenesis of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> and subsequent CKD, as shown in animal models (Cebotaru et al. 2005).|$|E
30|$|Unlike the {{relatively}} low but numerically similar frequency of nephrolithiasis and <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> in Groups II and III, in Group I, the presence of nephrolithiasis was much {{lower than that of}} <b>nephrocalcinosis,</b> although in this group, nephrolithiasis, when present, was practically always associated with <b>nephrocalcinosis.</b> Thus, nephrolithiasis appears to be a direct consequence of <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> and is also accompanied by hypercalciuria. Therefore, nephrolithiasis was linked to hypercalciuria in Group I as an expression of the PTC damage and a consequence of the dysfunction of the chloride/proton exchanger CIC- 5. Our results, then, may confirm in humans what has been shown in different ClC- 5 KO animal models and in vitro studies (Wang et al. 2000; Silva et al. 2003; Sayer et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a {{group of}} {{hereditary}} disorders that affect the quality and/or quantity of dental enamel.

Scanning electron microscopy of the teeth revealed hypoplastic enamel, and a renal ultrasound detected bilateral <b>nephrocalcinosis,</b> leading to a diagnosis of AI and <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> syndrome. Since <b>nephrocalcinosis</b> is often asymptomatic and can be associated with impaired renal function, dentists who see children with a generalized and thin hypoplastic AI should consider a renal ultrasound scan and referral to a Nephrologist.
