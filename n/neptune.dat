5|$|In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian {{mechanics}} {{to predict}} {{the position of the}} then-undiscovered planet <b>Neptune</b> after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of <b>Neptune</b> in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides <b>Neptune.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptune</b> (30.1 AU), though {{slightly}} smaller than Uranus, is more massive (equivalent to 17 Earths) and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat, {{but not as}} much as Jupiter or Saturn. <b>Neptune</b> has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit. <b>Neptune</b> is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed <b>Neptune</b> trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{seasonal}} changes, the cloud bands {{in the southern}} hemisphere of <b>Neptune</b> have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980 {{and is expected to}} last until about 2020. The long orbital period of <b>Neptune</b> results in seasons lasting forty years.|$|E

5|$|Herschel's {{proposed}} {{name was}} not popular outside Britain, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jérôme Lalande proposed {{that it be}} named Herschel in honour of its discoverer. Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the name <b>Neptune,</b> which was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet {{in the course of}} the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even <b>Neptune</b> George III or <b>Neptune</b> Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of <b>Neptune,</b> but <b>Neptune</b> long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three <b>Neptune</b> orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, <b>Neptune</b> is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptune</b> {{differs from}} Uranus in its typical level of {{meteorological}} activity. Voyager 2 observed weather phenomena on <b>Neptune</b> during its 1989 flyby, but no comparable phenomena on Uranus during its 1986 fly-by.|$|E

5|$|Triton's orbit is {{associated}} with two tilts, the inclination of <b>Neptune's</b> spin to <b>Neptune's</b> orbit, 30°, and the inclination of Triton's orbit to <b>Neptune's</b> spin, 157° (an inclination over 90° indicates retrograde motion). Triton's orbit precesses forward relative to <b>Neptune's</b> spin with {{a period of about}} 678 Earth years (4.1 Neptunian years), making its Neptune-orbit-relative inclination vary between 127° and 180° and in the past, to 173°. That inclination is currently 130°; Triton's orbit is now near its maximum departure from coplanarity with <b>Neptune's.</b>|$|R

5|$|SDOs are {{typically}} characterized by orbits with medium and high eccentricities with a semi-major axis greater than 50AU, but their perihelia bring them within influence of <b>Neptune.</b> Having a perihelion of roughly 30AU {{is one of}} the defining characteristics of scattered objects, as it allows <b>Neptune</b> to exert its gravitational influence.|$|E
5|$|Struve {{came out}} in favour of the name <b>Neptune</b> on 29 December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Soon, <b>Neptune</b> became the internationally {{accepted}} name. In Roman mythology, <b>Neptune</b> was {{the god of the}} sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which, except for Earth, were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is {{subdivided}} {{into the inner}} planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and <b>Neptune.</b> Beyond <b>Neptune</b> lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend {{as far as a}} light-year.|$|E

5|$|The Sun {{has eight}} known planets. This {{includes}} four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and <b>Neptune).</b> The Solar System also {{has at least}} five dwarf planets, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, {{and a large number}} of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of <b>Neptune.</b>|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of <b>Neptune</b> is 28.32°, {{which is}} similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, <b>Neptune</b> {{experiences}} similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of <b>Neptune</b> means that the seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11hours. Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.|$|E
5|$|The dipole {{component}} of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of <b>Neptune</b> is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The dipole magnetic moment of <b>Neptune</b> is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius of <b>Neptune).</b> Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of <b>Neptune</b> {{may be the result}} of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
50|$|Newham <b>Neptunes</b> is an English {{basketball}} team {{based in the}} Newham area of East London. The team was formed in 2010 as the senior team of the Newham All-Star Sports Academy, or NASSA for short, and were originally named Newham <b>Neptunes</b> before being rebranded to East London All-Stars in 2015. This name lasted only one season, returning to Newham <b>Neptunes</b> {{in time for the}} 2016-17 season.|$|R
50|$|After he starred as {{a running}} back at Uniontown Area High School in his hometown, Munsey {{switched}} to defensive back when he played at the University of Wyoming.

It was while playing for the <b>Neptunes</b> that he met Vivian Seaborne, the first black cheerleader for the Norfolk <b>Neptunes.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Neptune's</b> orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from <b>Neptune's</b> orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so <b>Neptune's</b> gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by <b>Neptune's</b> gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|R
5|$|This {{alone is}} not enough to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially <b>Neptune)</b> could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, <b>Neptune</b> makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, <b>Neptune</b> is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, <b>Neptune</b> will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and <b>Neptune</b> actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} {{mechanisms}} {{have been proposed}} for Triton's capture. To be gravitationally captured by a planet, a passing body must lose sufficient energy to be slowed down to a speed less than that required to escape. An early theory of how Triton may have been slowed was by collision with another object, either one that happened to be passing by <b>Neptune</b> (which is unlikely), or a moon or proto-moon in orbit around <b>Neptune</b> (which is more likely). A more recent hypothesis suggests that, before its capture, Triton {{was part of a}} binary system. When this binary encountered <b>Neptune,</b> it interacted {{in such a way that}} the binary dissociated, with one portion of the binary expelled, and the other, Triton, becoming bound to <b>Neptune.</b> This event is more likely for more massive companions. Similar mechanisms have been proposed for the capture of Mars's moons. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence, including binaries being very common among the large Kuiper belt objects. The event was brief but gentle, saving Triton from collisional disruption. Events like this may have been common during the formation of <b>Neptune,</b> or later when it migrated outward.|$|E
5|$|A scheme {{introduced}} by a 2005 {{report from the}} Deep Ecliptic Survey by J. L. Elliott et al. distinguishes between two categories: scattered-near (i.e. typical SDOs) and scattered-extended (i.e. detached objects). Scattered-near objects are those whose orbits are non-resonant, non-planetary-orbit-crossing and have a Tisserand parameter (relative to <b>Neptune)</b> less than 3. Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to <b>Neptune)</b> greater than 3 and have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Neptunes</b> {{released}} a self-credited album called The <b>Neptunes</b> Present... Clones in 2003, with songs and remixes from various artists. This topped the U.S. Billboard 200 Albums Chart.

The track [...] "Frontin'" [...] was a big hit (the 34th biggest of 2003 according to Billboard). A survey in August 2003 found the <b>Neptunes</b> produced almost 20 percent of songs played on British radio at the time, a survey in the US had them at 43 percent.

[...] The track also had a brief rap section performed by Williams.|$|R
5|$|As in the {{original}} Nice model, objects are captured into resonances with <b>Neptune</b> during its outward migration. Some remain in the resonances, others evolve onto higher-inclination, lower-eccentricity orbits, and are released onto stable orbits forming the dynamically hot classical belt. The hot belt's inclination distribution can be reproduced if <b>Neptune</b> migrated from 24 AU to 30 AU on a 30 Myr timescale. When <b>Neptune</b> migrates to 28 AU, it has a gravitational encounter with the extra ice giant. Objects captured from the cold belt into the 1:2 mean-motion resonance with <b>Neptune</b> are left behind as a local concentration at 44 AU when this encounter causes Neptune's semi-major axis to jump outward. The objects deposited in the cold belt include some loosely bound 'blue' binaries originating from closer than the cold belt's current location. If Neptune's eccentricity remains small during this encounter, the chaotic evolution of orbits of {{the original}} Nice model is avoided and a primordial cold belt is preserved. In the later phases of Neptune's migration, a slow sweeping of mean-motion resonances removes the higher-eccentricity objects from the cold belt, truncating its eccentricity distribution.|$|E
5|$|At 20:00, Troude ordered Hautpoult {{to steer}} to the {{northwest}} while he took Courageux and Polonais southwest {{in an effort to}} divide the pursuit. Pompee and Recruit kept with Hautpoult, while <b>Neptune,</b> accompanied by the brig HMS Hawk continued to follow Troude's main force. During the night however Troude outdistanced <b>Neptune,</b> and on the morning of 16 April Cochrane ordered all available ships to converge on Hautpoult. The lone French ship of the line had finally forced the damaged Recruit to retire, but could see Pompee and <b>Neptune</b> to the southeast and the newly arrived frigates HMS Latona under Captain Hugh Pigot and HMS Castor under Captain William Roberts to the northeast, with the Spanish coast of Puerto Rico directly north. During the day the chase continued, <b>Neptune</b> falling behind but Pompee remaining in sight and the frigates gaining on Hautpoult. At 17:00, Puerto Rico appeared on the horizon, the French forced to follow the coastline westwards. During the night, the British pursuers were confused by the overcast sky, which helped Hautpoult to partially obscure herself among the lights from shore.|$|E
5|$|Between the 2:3 and 1:2 {{resonances}} with <b>Neptune,</b> {{at approximately}} 42–48AU, the gravitational interactions with <b>Neptune</b> occur {{over an extended}} timescale, and objects can exist with their orbits essentially unaltered.

Because the first modern KBO discovered, , is considered the prototype of this group, classical KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos ("Q-B-1-os"). The guidelines established by the IAU demand that classical KBOs be given names of mythological beings associated with creation.|$|E
