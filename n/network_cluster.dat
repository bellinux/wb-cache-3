40|$|Abstract In this study, we {{investigate}} the relative organization of three (not independent) categorizations of metabolites—pathways, subcellular localizations and <b>network</b> <b>clusters</b> both qualitatively and quantitatively and further characterize the categories from topological point of view. The {{picture of the}} metabolism we obtain is that of peripheral modules, characterized both by being dense <b>network</b> <b>clusters</b> and localized to organelles, connected by a central, highly connected core. Pathways typically run through several <b>network</b> <b>clusters</b> and localizations, connecting them laterally. The significant overlap between organelles, pathways and <b>network</b> <b>clusters</b> suggest that, to some extent, the topology of metabolic networks could spell out the spatial isolations of cellular architectures and functional coherence of metabolic systems. Such systems level analysis of the correlation between different categorizations is helpful for understanding the influence of intracellular organization on the regulation of metabolic processes...|$|R

For functional module identification, single <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithms may not yield accurate and robust results. In order to borrow information across multiple sources to alleviate such problems due to data quality, we propose a new joint <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithm ASModel in this paper. We construct an integrated network to combine network topological information based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) datasets and homological information introduced by constituent similarity between proteins across networks. A novel random walk strategy on the integrated network is developed for joint <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> and an optimization problem is formulated by searching for low conductance sets defined on the derived transition matrix of the random walk, which fuses both topology and homology information. The optimization problem of joint clustering is solved by a derived spectral <b>clustering</b> algorithm. <b>Network</b> <b>clustering</b> using several state-of-the-art algorithms has been implemented to both PPI networks {{within the same}} species (two yeast PPI networks and two human PPI networks) and those from different species (a yeast PPI network and a human PPI network).

5000|$|Preclassic {{people in}} the Copan Valley in Western Honduras {{utilized}} obsidian primarily from the Guatemalan highlands but also in small quantities from La Esperanza in Honduras and Ucareo and Pachuca in Central Mexico (Aoyama 2001). This is further evidence of extensive trade networks operating in the Preclassic. Copan demonstrates that there was variation in obsidian technology and trade in the Preclassic. This region did not feature blade production technology until the Late Preclassic, instead primarily relying on informal nodes and flakes with very limited trade of prismatic blades, which is abnormal when compared to surrounding areas (Aoyama 2001). Some regions, such as the inland Central Petén and the Puuc region in Northern Yucatán, had relatively low access to obsidian despite drawing from the same primary sources of Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal in the Guatemalan highlands as other regions of Mesoamerica (Rice 1984; Braswell et al. 2011). This variation has been explained by examining potential inland and riverine trade routes that when combined allow for further transport of bulk obsidian from highlands into lowlands as well as competing commercial and distributional systems created by sociopolitical relationships (Hester et al. 1980; Hammon 1972). More recent network analyses that examine the distribution of obsidian and relationship between actors in the exchange systems aid in understanding this variation as well. These <b>network</b> <b>cluster</b> models highlight the prominence of the Southern Gulf region creating connections between Eastern and Western Mesoamerican obsidian exchange {{as well as the}} Pacific coastal region bridging the gap as well (Golitko and Feinman 2015). This could explain the lower quantities and smaller scale of obsidian production in the Maya region during the Preclassic. [...] The Protoclassic is growing in acceptance as a distinct period in Maya history, but is generally referred to as the Terminal Preclassic (0 - 250 AD). Increases in obsidian production technology, procurement, and distribution can be used as lines of evidence in this debate. In Copan and its hinterland regions the pattern of large flakes spalls and small nodules continued until the late Protoclassic when the population increased and a subsequent rise in production technology (Aoyama 2001). Polyhedral cores and blade production debitage are noted in assemblages related to principle urban group residences suggesting political control by a ruler over obsidian trade and distribution (Aoyama 2001). This time period is also when Teotihuacan was established and rose to prominence in Central Mexico. It has been theorized that Teotihuacan dominated the procurement of nearby obsidian sources and controlled the trade of obsidian into the Maya region due to the increasing presence of Central Mexican obsidian in Maya contexts (Aoyama 2001; Braswell et al. 2011; Hammon 1972). Network clustering and distribution analysis shows Teotihuacan as not being thoroughly connected to the overall obsidian exchange systems during the Protoclassic which means control over obsidian cannot explain the city’s rise to prominence (Golitko and Feinman 2015; Spence 1996). During this time there was also a considerable decrease across the Maya region in the use of Ixtepeque and San Martin Jiotepeque obsidian and increases in El Chayal obsidian; a pattern that continued into the Classic (Hester et al. 1980; Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984; Healy et al. 1984).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that spatial clustering features have presented in many large scale distributed networks, such as the Internet, peer-to-peer networks, and wireless sensor networks. Topologies of such networks can be partitioned into 2 ̆ 2 densely 2 ̆ 2 intra-connected clusters which are 2 ̆ 2 sparsely 2 ̆ 2 inter-connected. Understanding these clustering features could greatly facilitate various networking research areas. However, they are far from being well studied, mainly {{due to the lack of}} good <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithms. In this dissertation, we tackle the challenge of <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithm design by introducing a new clustering algorithm, SAGA, and its distributed version, SDC. We then further apply <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> into different research areas. ^ Our work consists of three research thrusts: (1) Effective clustering algorithm design; (2) Clustering-based Internet topology modeling; (3) Scalable and efficient hierarchical p 2 p file sharing. In the first thrust, we address the fundamental problem of <b>network</b> <b>clustering.</b> We present a novel centralized clustering algorithm, called SACA, and prove that it can satisfy all the desired design goals. One advantage of SACA over other centralized algorithms is that it does not require global topology information. Inspired by this decentralized nature of SAGA, we develop a fully distributed algorithm, called SDC, which can be readily deployed into large-scale distributed systems. In the second thrust of this dissertation, we apply <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> into Internet topology modeling. Clustering features are significant properties of the Internet topology, but very little research effort is devoted into the large scale clustering features, which results in the lack of realistic topology generation model. In our work, we provide comprehensive characterizations on the clustering features in the AS-level Internet topology and present a realistic topology generation model based on the characterized clustering features. We prove that our model can reproduce all the existing properties of the AS-level Internet topology. In the third thrust of our work, we utilize our distributed clustering method SDC to enhance the performance of hierarchical p 2 p file sharing systems. <b>Network</b> <b>clustering</b> is a common technique in hierarchical p 2 p systems. We develop a <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> protocol PPDC based on SDC for PSON, a powerful p 2 p file sharing system proposed in our previous work. We show that a good <b>network</b> <b>clustering</b> protocol can significantly improve the scalability and efficiency of PSON. Besides <b>network</b> <b>clustering,</b> we further improve the performance of PSON with an effective load balancing mechanism. ^ In this dissertation, we will present these three thrusts of work in detail.
