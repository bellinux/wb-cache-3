5|$|After a {{few months}} Barnes gained a second {{opportunity}} with a professional club, joining the youth ranks at Bolton Wanderers. As with when he played for Birmingham, he trained with Moor Green and played for Bolton's youth team at the weekend. Upon turning 18, Barnes was called up for <b>national</b> <b>service,</b> and was based with the RAF at Stafford. He continued to play for Bolton when circumstances permitted it, but when the club made a formal request for his services the RAF refused. Upon completion of his <b>national</b> <b>service</b> Barnes joined semi-pro Stafford Rangers. He made his debut against Newport County on 14 June 1947, and continued {{to play for the}} club for the next three years.|$|E

5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform <b>national</b> <b>service</b> was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform <b>national</b> <b>service</b> would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E

5|$|Once Australia's wartime {{military}} forces had been demobilised, the part-time force was re-established {{in the guise}} of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), which was formed in 1948. Within this, an amalgamated 16th/28th Battalion was raised. This battalion existed until August 1952 when, following the reintroduction of <b>national</b> <b>service,</b> the 28th Battalion was re-raised in its own right, based in East Perth with sub-units at Albany, Katanning and Geraldton. Heart of Oak was approved as the battalion's regimental march in 1953, but it was replaced the following year by Colonel Bogey. In 1960, following the introduction of the Pentropic organisation and the suspension of <b>national</b> <b>service,</b> this battalion was subsumed into the newly formed Royal Western Australia Regiment, providing three company-sized elements to the regiment's 1st Battalion (1 RWAR). The Australian Army ceased using the Pentropic organisation in July 1965 and at this time 1 RWAR was split into two smaller battalions: 1 RWAR and 2 RWAR. In early 1966, these were renumbered 16 RWAR and 11 RWAR, with the companies that had originally come from the 28th Battalion being allocated to 16 RWAR. In October 1966, when <b>national</b> <b>service</b> was reintroduced, the 28th Battalion was re-formed as a full battalion known as 28 RWAR, and fulfilling the role of a remote area battalion, catering for the training needs of men eligible for call up who wished to exercise the option to serve in the CMF instead of the Regular Army, but who could not parade regularly due to where they lived or what civilian occupation they held. The <b>national</b> <b>service</b> scheme ended in December 1972, after which many who had joined the CMF to defer full-time <b>national</b> <b>service</b> took their discharge. Numbers fell significantly and in 1977 the 28th Battalion was reduced to an independent rifle company, along with the 11th Battalion. This continued until October 1987, when the two companies were amalgamated to form the current 11th/28th Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment.|$|E

5|$|During McNicoll's {{tenure as}} {{commanding}} officer of Warramunga, the ship operated in Australian waters {{as part of the}} Australia Station, sailing to New Zealand for a visit during March 1950. On the outbreak of the Korean War in June that year, Warramunga was selected as part of the Australian contribution to the conflict. Moreover, the ship was to be attached to a force of five Royal Navy destroyers led by a captain, making it expedient to have the Australian ship commanded by an officer of lower rank; McNicoll was consequently replaced by Commander Otto Becher on 28 July. McNicoll was then posted to the Navy Office to assist in the introduction and co-ordination of <b>National</b> <b>Service</b> in the Australian military in response to the <b>National</b> <b>Service</b> Act 1951.

During the 1980 Malaysia Cup season, Fandi scored eight goals, including the winning goal in the final against Selangor FA. He enlisted for <b>National</b> <b>Service</b> in September 1980 and was given light duties, such as collecting the camp garbage, so he could continue playing for Singapore FA. In 1981, Fandi won the FAS Footballer of the Year award for helping Singapore FA reach the Malaysia Cup final. The following year, Singapore FA did not play in the Malaysia Cup for political reasons, and Fandi underwent a shoulder operation; he could not play football for six weeks and was discharged early from <b>National</b> <b>Service.</b>|$|E
