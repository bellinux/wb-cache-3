5|$|The <b>Nomad</b> {{does not}} have its own game library, but instead plays Genesis games. At {{the time of its}} launch, the <b>Nomad</b> had over 500 games {{available}} for play. However, no pack-in title was included. The <b>Nomad</b> can boot unlicensed, homebrew, and bootleg games made for the Genesis. Some earlier third-party titles have compatibility issues when played on the <b>Nomad,</b> but can be successfully played {{through the use of a}} Game Genie. Likewise, due to its lack of compatibility with any of the Genesis' add-ons, it is unable to play any games for the Sega Master System, Sega CD, or Sega 32X. The <b>Nomad</b> employs two different regional lockout methods, physical and software, but methods have been found to bypass these.|$|E
5|$|Sold {{exclusively}} in North America, the <b>Nomad</b> was never officially released worldwide, and employs a regional lockout.

5|$|The <b>Nomad</b> was {{released}} in October 1995 in North America only. The release was five years into the market span of the Genesis, with an existing library of more than 500 Genesis games. According to former Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the <b>Nomad</b> {{was not intended to}} be the Game Gear's replacement and believes that there was little planning from Sega of Japan for the new handheld. Sega was supporting five different consoles: Saturn, Genesis, Game Gear, Pico, and the Master System, as well as the Sega CD and 32X add-ons. In Japan, the Mega Drive had never been successful and the Saturn was more successful than Sony's PlayStation, so Sega Enterprises CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to focus on the Saturn. By 1999, the <b>Nomad</b> was being sold at {{less than a third of}} its original price.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} had promulgated the Powers of <b>Nomad</b> Shiekhs Ordinance in 1922, and had recognized and reinforced the judicial powers of over 300 tribal leaders by 1923.

The principle of indirect rule had also given the Sayyids, including Abd al-Rahman, more power to prevent changes demanded by the secular opposition. In a shift of policy, the Graduates' General Congress was launched in 1938 as a forum for the intelligentsia of Sudan to express their opinions and as an alternative voice to that of the tribal leaders, who had become discredited.|$|E

The <b>Nomads</b> were deducted one point, which saw Carmarthen Town elevated to sixth place and The <b>Nomads</b> left in the play-off conference to fight against relegation and attempt to secure a lucrative UEFA Europa League place.

5|$|Composite bows {{have been}} known from {{archaeology}} and art since the second millennium BCE, but their history is not well recorded as they were developed by cultures without a written tradition. They originated among Asiatic pastoralists who used them as daily necessities, classically for mounted archery although {{they can also be}} used on foot. Such bows spread among the military (and hunters) of civilizations that came into contact with <b>nomad</b> tribes; composite bows have been used across Asia from Korea to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa, and southwards in the Arabian peninsula and in India. The use of horn in a bow was even remarked on in Homer's epic, The Odyssey, believed to have been written in the 8th century BCE.|$|E

Zephiel is eventually killed by the Etrurian Army and his Divine Weapon is taken from him, but the war does not end with his death. Before his last battle, Zephiel had sent his remaining forces to gather somewhere in Elibe. The eight Divine Weapons suddenly emit a light that leads the Lycian Army to this location: an ancient temple that had long ago been built by the dragons.|$|E
