5|$|With {{strong support}} from Ryzhkov, Gorbachev {{abolished}} the Central Committee economic department, thereby strengthening the authority of central government over economic matters. From then on, the government could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for economic policies initiated by the Party leadership. The establishment of the post of President of the Soviet Union by Gorbachev in 1990 weakened {{the power of the}} government apparatus; a move Ryzhkov and his second cabinet opposed.|$|E
5|$|The former Oxford University {{historian}} Adrian Goldsworthy {{has argued}} that the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> on barbarization of the late Roman Army, but on its recurrent civil wars, which led to its ability to repel or defeat invasions from outside its frontiers to be seriously weakened. The East Roman or Byzantine empire on the other hand had fewer civil wars to contend with in the late fourth and early fifth centuries, or in the years from 383-432 A.D.|$|E
5|$|According to {{an article}} on The Conversation written by Robert Merkel, Heartbleed {{revealed}} a massive failure of risk analysis. Merkel thinks OpenSSL gives more importance to performance than to security, which no longer makes sense in his opinion. But Merkel considers that OpenSSL should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> as much as OpenSSL users, who chose to use OpenSSL, without funding better auditing and testing. Merkel explains that two aspects determine the risk that more similar bugs will cause vulnerabilities. One, the library's source code influences the risk of writing bugs with such an impact. Secondly, OpenSSL's processes affect the chances of catching bugs quickly. On the first aspect, Merkel mentions {{the use of the}} C programming language as one risk factor which favored Heartbleed's appearance, echoing Wheeler's analysis.|$|E

25|$|Another consequentialist {{version is}} motive consequentialism which looks at {{whether the state}} of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better {{or at least as}} good as each of the {{alternative}} state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. A possible inference is, that one can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for mistaken judgements if the motivation was to do good.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} made {{an important}} {{note that this}} report was investigating {{the actions of the}} German army and that the German people should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for the crimes of their national army. This careful investigation of all 1,200 depositions created the belief that the term ‘atrocity’ should be directly connected with the German army, due to the army's extreme practice of militarism. This is confirmed by the German diaries, which showed the German account of the war crimes in Belgium was directly ordered by commanding army officers. In its final conclusion, the committee claimed that the militarism of the German army was the cause of the outrages in Belgium.|$|E

25|$|Criticism of King Shantanu {{from his}} {{subjects}} {{as to why}} he removed Bhishma from the title of the crown prince, as he was so capable, abounded. There was worry about the nobility of Shantanu's unborn children, now promised the throne. Hearing this, Bhishma said it was his decision and his father should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> as Shantanu had never promised anything to Satyavati's father. The prime minister then asked who would be held responsible if the future crown prince isn't capable enough. Bhishma then took another vow that he would always see his father's image in whomever sat on the King's throne, and would thus serve him faithfully.|$|E
25|$|As sole {{representative}} of the Mittelwerk Gmbh, Georg Rickhey {{was at the center}} of the Court proceedings on forced labor in the plant. Rickhey was alleged to have been responsible for the disastrous working conditions, cooperating closely with the SS and Gestapo, and being present during executions. The proof for this war crime was important, as Rickey– unlike the other defendants– could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for the catastrophic living conditions in the concentration camps or the execution of the death marches. The basis of the prosecution was his participation in the underground missile production of the V-1 and V-2 rockets, which required the use of forced labor.|$|E
25|$|The {{border between}} Mystarria and Inkarra is a closed one, as some sixty years before, criminals and assassins crept across the border. Three such assassins were {{captured}} and executed outright, their bodies sent home as warning. Zandaros protested the executions and insulted the Mystarrians, {{and so a}} response was sent by skyrider that if the Inkarrans would not patrol the border and catch their own criminals, Mystarria could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for doing so themselves. Zandaros's own response to this message was to send the child skyrider's head back in a sack. Ever since, Rofehavanish from Mystarria have been forbidden to enter Inkarra on penalty of death, and Mystarria has forbidden any Inkarrans from ever entering the nation. Most other nations of Rofehavan tolerate Inkarran traders and traveling performers.|$|E

However some argue that the whole Mauritian population should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blame</b> for the mistakes of a few people. The Irish politician Seán Kelly supported the campaign by saying: [...] "No justice for Michaela McAreavey in Mauritius. It is a massive indictment of Mauritius authorities’ incompetence. No Irish should visit Mauritius yet until justice is done." [...] Calls for a boycott intensified following the events of 15 July 2012.|$|R

500|$|At 3am a blood-stained {{fragment}} of Eddowes' apron was found {{lying in the}} passage of the doorway leading to 108 to 119 Goulston Street, Whitechapel, about a third of a mile (500m) from the murder scene. There was chalk writing {{on the wall of the}} doorway, which read either [...] "The Juwes are the men that will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for nothing" [...] or [...] "The Juwes are not the men who will be blamed for nothing." [...] At 5am, Commissioner Warren attended the scene and ordered the words erased for fear that they would spark anti-Semitic riots. Goulston Street was on a direct route from Mitre Square to Flower and Dean Street, where both Stride and Eddowes lived.|$|E
500|$|Other, more positive, {{views were}} also expressed. The suffragist Inez Milholland defended September Morn, stating {{that it was}} [...] "exquisite and delicate, {{depicting}} perfect youth and innocence", and found it [...] "funny, if it weren't so sad" [...] that such a work would be censored while more titillating film posters were left untouched. The social activist Rose Pastor Stokes wrote that this [...] "glorious work of art" [...] was a [...] "rare" [...] depiction of [...] "the loveliest dream that nature ever made real—the human Body Beautiful" [...] and that shame over one's body should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> on September Morn, but on a failed education system. The artist James Montgomery Flagg proclaimed [...] "only a diseased mind can find anything immoral in September Morn".|$|E
500|$|Ross rebuked Nogueira for {{allowing}} the broadcast, saying its content was insidious and goading. Nogueira agreed that Reedman's words were provocative, but said Portugal could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> {{as it did}} not censor public broadcasts. Britain considered withdrawing Ross in protest, but its Foreign Office ruled this out, saying Britain {{could not afford to}} be without an ambassador in Lisbon to influence Portugal's actions in the event of UDI. British Cabinet Secretary Burke Trend rejected this view, pointing to Lisbon's conduct regarding Reedman, which he said showed the Portuguese [...] "ha very clearly made up their minds" [...] to support a Rhodesian UDI. The British ambassador {{would not be able to}} affect matters, he surmised, and British interests would be better served by immediately taking a firm hand against Portugal, in the hope that this would send a strong message to Rhodesia. Ross then protested to the Portuguese about Reedman's calling himself [...] "head of the Rhodesian diplomatic mission" [...] on the radio; Lisbon replied impassively that this was a private expression of views by Reedman, and not Portugal's responsibility.|$|E

500|$|In May 2002, {{hundreds}} of hooligans attaching themselves to Millwall {{were involved in}} disorder around the ground, after the team lost a play-off game to Birmingham City. It was described by the BBC {{as one of the}} worst cases of civil disorder seen in Britain in recent times. A police spokeswoman said that 47 police officers and 24 police horses were injured, and the Metropolitan Police considered suing the club after the events. The then chairman Theo Paphitis responded that Millwall could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> for the actions of a mindless minority who attach themselves to the club. [...] "The problem of mob violence is not solely a Millwall problem, it is not a football problem, it is a problem which plagues the whole of our society", he said. Paphitis later introduced a membership scheme whereby only fans who would be prepared to join and carry membership cards would be allowed into The Den. Scotland Yard withdrew its threat to sue, stating: [...] "In light of the efforts made and a donation to a charity helping injured police officers, the Metropolitan Police Service has decided not to pursue legal action against Millwall F.C. in relation to the disorder". Some legal experts said it would have been difficult to hold a football club responsible for something that occurred away from its ground and involved people who did not attend the match. The scheme introduced by Paphitis now only applies to perceived high-risk away games. Many fans blame the scheme for diminishing Millwall's away support, such as at Leeds United where fans are issued with vouchers which are then exchanged for tickets at a designated point of West Yorkshire Police's choosing {{on the day of the}} game. Also, early kick-off times arranged by the police often result in only a few hundred fans making the trip.|$|E
