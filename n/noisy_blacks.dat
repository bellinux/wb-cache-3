40|$|When {{capturing}} {{a document}} using a digital camera, the resulting document image is often {{framed by a}} <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> border or includes noisy text regions from neighbouring pages. In this paper, we present a novel technique for enhancing the document images captured by a digital camera by automatically detecting the document borders and cutting out <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> borders as well as noisy text regions appearing from neighbouring pages. Our methodology is based on projection profiles combined with a connected component labelling process. Signal cross-correlation is also used in order to verify the detected noisy text areas. Experimental results on several camera document images, mainly historical, documents indicate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed technique. 1...|$|R
40|$|Scanning two book pages at {{the same}} time helps to {{accelerate}} the scanning process {{but on the other hand}} introduces several difficulties if the user needs to have one page per image. A major difficulty is the appearance of <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> borders around text areas as well as of <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> stripes between the two pages. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for detecting the page frames on double page document images. Our aim is to split the image into the two pages as well as to remove noisy borders. First we apply a pre-processing which includes binarization, noise removal and image smoothing. Then, we detect the vertical zones of the two pages. In this stage, we introduce the vertical white run projections which have been proved efficient for detecting vertical zones of text areas. Finally, the horizontal zones of the two pages are detected based on horizontal white run projections. The experimental results on several double page document images from fifteen different books demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalized associative memory model, which stores {{a collection of}} tu-ples whose components are sets rather than scalars. It is shown that all library patterns are stored stably. On the other hand spuri-ous memories may develop. Applications of this model to storage and retrieval of naturally-arising generalized sequences in bioinformatics are presented. The model is shown to work well for detection of novel generalized sequences against a large database of stored sequences, and for removal of <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> pixels in a probe image against a very large set of stored images. ...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{algorithm}} for {{the global}} optimization of expensive and <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> box functions using a surrogate model based on radial basis functions (RBFs). A method for RBF-based approximation is introduced in order to handle noise. New points are selected to minimize the total model uncertainty weighted against the surrogate function value. The algorithm is extended to multiple objective functions by instead weighting against {{the distance to the}} surrogate Pareto front; it therefore constitutes the first algorithm for expensive, noisy and multiobjective problems in the literature. Numerical results on analytical test functions show promise in comparison to other (commercial) algorithms, as well as results from a simulation based optimization problem...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study a {{classical}} problem in communication and wireless networks called Finding White Space Regions. In this problem, {{we are given}} a set of antennas (points) {{some of which are}} <b>noisy</b> (<b>black)</b> and the rest are working fine (white). The goal is to find a set of convex hulls with maximum total area that cover all white points and exclude all black points. In other words, these convex hulls make it safe for white antennas {{to communicate with each other}} without any interference with black antennas. We study the problem on three different settings (based on overlapping between different convex hulls) and find hardness results and good approximation algorithms. ...|$|R

25|$|Visual {{extinction}} {{has also}} been used to demonstrate brain bias towards gestalt processing. When presented with a figure containing illusory contours, patients were able to correctly report the presence of stimuli in both contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres, due to their unconscious processing of the whole field to produce the illusion. This experiment implied that the attention center prioritizes the visualization of surfaces over other stimuli – therefore, although under race model the ipsilesional stimuli should extinguish the contralesional, {{the creation of the}} gestalt takes priority over detection of both. Further, a study using Gabor signals (alternating blurred and <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> and white bars, commonly used by opticians in diagnostic tests) investigated how the orientation of these signals affected their extinction rate. Bilateral stimuli were least extinguished when both stimuli were oriented horizontally, although both stimuli being oriented vertically also showed a reduction in extinguishing rate when compared to one stimulus vertical and one horizontal – in what could be assumed by the brain to represent two different surfaces.|$|R

40|$|Gaussian Process bandit {{optimization}} {{has emerged}} as a powerful tool for optimizing <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> box functions. One example in machine learning is hyper-parameter optimization where each evaluation of the target function requires training a model which may involve days or even weeks of computation. Most methods for this so-called "Bayesian optimization" only allow sequential exploration of the parameter space. However, it is often desirable to propose batches or sets of parameter values to explore simultaneously, especially when there are large parallel processing facilities at our disposal. Batch methods require modeling the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new approach for parallelizing Bayesian optimization by modeling the diversity of a batch via Determinantal point processes (DPPs) whose kernels are learned automatically. This allows us to generalize a previous result as well as prove better regret bounds based on DPP sampling. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world robotics and hyper-parameter optimization tasks indicate that our DPP-based methods, especially those based on DPP sampling, outperform state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|Cone-beam CT (CBCT) {{scanners}} {{are based}} on volumetric tomography, using a 2 D extended digital array providing an area detector [1, 2]. Compared to traditional CT, CBCT has many advantages, such as less X-ray beam limitation, and rapid scan time, etc. However, in CBCT images the x-ray beam has lower mean kilovolt (peak) energy, so the metal artifact is more pronounced on. The position of the shadowed region in other views can be tracked by projecting the 3 D coordinates of the object. Automatic image segmentation was used to replace the pixels inside the metal object with the boundary pixels. The modified projection data, using synthetically Radon Transformation, were then used to reconstruct a new back projected CBCT image. In this paper, we present a method, based on the morphological, area and pixel operators, which we applied on the Radon transformed image, to reduce the metal artifacts in CBCT, then we built the Radon back project images using the radon invers transformation. The artifacts effects on the 3 d-reconstruction is that, the soft tissues appears as bones or teeth. For the preprocessing of the CBCT images, two methods are used to recognize the <b>noisy</b> <b>black</b> areas that the first depends on thresholding and closing algorithm, and the second depends on tracing boundaries after using thresholding algorithm too. The intensity of these areas is {{the lowest in the}} image than other tissues, so we profit this property to detect the edges of these areas. These two methods are applied on phantom and patient image data. It deals with reconstructed CBCT dicom images and can effectively reduce such metal artifacts. Due to the data of the constructed images are corrupted by these metal artifacts, qualitative and quantitative analysis of CBCT images is very essential...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-This paper {{presents}} noise removal algorithm for {{gray scale}} images corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. A robust open close sequence filter based on mathematical morphology for high probability additive Gaussian noise removal is discussed. First, an additive Gaussian noise detector using mathematical residues {{is to identify}} pixels that are contaminated by the additive Gaussian noise. Then the image is restored using specialized open-close sequence algorithms that apply only to the <b>noisy</b> pixels. Finally, <b>black</b> and white blocks that degrade {{the quality of the}} image will be recovered by a block smart erase method. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the robust open close sequence filter outperforms a number of other existing algorithms and is particularly effective for highly corrupted images...|$|R
50|$|Of {{the larger}} mammals, Bennett's {{wallabies}} and wombats are common, and are regularly {{seen in the}} ski village during summer and winter, even under blizzard conditions. Pademelons are abundant in the wet gullies and areas with thick undergrowth. Forester kangaroos have been recorded along the south-west edge of the park. Eastern quolls inhabit the ski village during winter, and are sometimes sighted during daylight hours. Dusky antechinus occasionally visit lodges. The echidna has been recorded and the platypus has been sighted in the Upper Ford River. Various other species, including the long-nosed potoroo, Tasmanian bettong, brushtail possum, ringtail possum, sugar glider, native rodents such as the velvet-furred rat and the long-tailed mouse, and six species of bat have all been recorded in the park. Among the birds, no systematic study has been made. Wedge-tailed eagles are regularly reported, as is the <b>noisy</b> yellow-tailed <b>black</b> cockatoo. Among the endemic species recorded are the green rosella, scrubtit, brown thornbill, yellow wattlebird, yellow-throated honeyeater, black-headed honeyeater, strong-billed honeyeater and the black currawong. Little is known of the reptiles from Ben Lomond. Of particular interest is the endemic northern snow skink Niveoscincus greeni which is an alpine species restricted to several other mountain top areas in the State. Amphibians recorded from Ben Lomond include the brown tree frog, common eastern froglet and the endemic Tasmanian froglet.|$|R
