More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E
25|$|The damped <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> is {{less than}} the undamped <b>natural</b> <b>frequency,</b> but for many {{practical}} cases the damping ratio is relatively small and hence the difference is negligible. Therefore, the damped and undamped description are often dropped when stating the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> (e.g. with 0.1 damping ratio, the damped <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> is only 1% less than the undamped).|$|E

30|$|In {{mechanical}} and structural system design, engineers are often {{faced with the}} task of designing systems which either have <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> which must fall outside a specific range or operate at exactly certain frequencies. These design problems can be considered as eigenvalue problems, since the eigenvalues are used to determine the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> (frequency spectrum) of the system. Generally, the problem begins by defining the system’s physical parameters and then calculating the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> using eigenvalue theory. If specific <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> are sought, empirical or iterative methods are used to modify the system’s physical parameters until the desired eigenvalues are obtained. This approach is both time consuming and indirect. A better approach would be to design the system directly from the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{cases of}} the use of <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> to {{identify}} crack location and crack depth in beams under noise-free conditions have been widely reported. However, the capability of <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> to identify cracks in noisy conditions has not yet been systematically addressed. Unlike previous work stressing the merits of <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> in depicting cracks, this study reports the performance assessment of <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> in characterizing cracks in noisy conditions. In the performance assessment, a cracked cantilever Timoshenko beam, with the crack flexibility modeled by fracture mechanics principles, is considered. The results demonstrate quantitatively and exhaustively that <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies,</b> as global dynamic properties of a structure, are somewhat insensitive to local slight damage.

25|$|The plots to {{the side}} present how 0.1 and 0.3 damping ratios effect how the system “rings” down over time. What is often done in {{practice}} is to experimentally measure the free vibration after an impact (for example by a hammer) and then determine the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of the system by measuring the rate of oscillation, {{as well as the}} damping ratio by measuring the rate of decay. The <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> and damping ratio are not only important in free vibration, but also characterize how a system behaves under forced vibration.|$|E

In this paper, we present a pseudo-spectral approach to solve for the series coefficients.

The effects of the skew angle and aspect ratio on the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> of isotropic skew plates were studied. The effects of the skew angle, aspect ratio, fiber orientation angle and laminate sequence (keeping the number of layers constant) on the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> of antisymmetric composite laminates were also studied.

25|$|Resonance {{is simple}} to {{understand}} if {{the spring and}} mass are viewed as energy storage elements – with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring storing potential energy. As discussed earlier, when the mass and spring have no external force acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate equal to the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency.</b> In other words, to efficiently pump energy into both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a rate equal to the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency.</b> Applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on swing, a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher. As {{in the case of}} the swing, the force applied need not be high to get large motions, but must just add energy to the system.|$|E
25|$|Parametric {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. Parametric resonance takes place when the external excitation frequency equals twice the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of the system.

40|$|The first {{adjustable}} feed {{support system}} in FAST is a six-cable-driven parallel manipulator. Due to {{flexibility of the}} cables, the cable-driven parallel manipulator bears a concern of possible vibration caused by wind disturbance or internal force from the fine drive system. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze vibration characteristic of the six-cable-driven parallel manipulator in FAST. The tension equilibrium equation of the six-cable-driven parallel manipulator is set up regarding the cables as catenaries. Then, vibration equation is established considering the longitudinal vibration of the cables. On this basis, the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> are depicted in figures since both analytical and numerical solutions are ineffective. Influence of the sags of the cables on the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> is discussed. It is shown that the sags of the cables will decrease the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the six-cable-driven parallel manipulator. Simplification to acquire the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> is proposed in this paper.

With the goal of showing the change in <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> when the disc is submerged. In addition, analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the same disc are presented. The roving hammer experiment measures the vibration response of the disc to impacts on various positions. The frequency response experiment measures the vibration response to excitation from a piezoelectric patch glued to the disc. From these experiments the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> and the mode shapes are identified. The analytical calculation are based on table values of eigenvalues for an annular plate with clamped inside and free outside. The numerical simulations are performed in ANSYS with material properties of standard steel to simulate the disc in air, and with an increased density to simulate the disc submerged in water. The increased density {{is calculated based on}} results from the frequency response experiment. All methods found the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the disc gave similar results, with only minor differences. The roving hammer experiment found the <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the disc in air, and indicated their mode shape. The frequency response experiment gave the frequency response function of the disc in both air and submerged in water, and by comparing of the functions the change in <b>natural</b> <b>frequencies</b> was shown.

25|$|The {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} eventually, the APU and tail vibrations eventually {{reached the same}} frequency and went into resonance, where the force of multiple same-frequency vibrations add to that of one another and create one large vibration. This {{seems to indicate that}} the replacement of that one bolt may have actually worsened the vibration by changing the vertical stabilizer's <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> and possibly bringing it closer to that of the APU. Thus, the tail's vibration increased in amplitude until it failed and broke off.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{calculating the}} FRF for a massndash&springndash&damper {{system with a}} mass of 1nbsp&kg, spring {{stiffness}} of 1.93nbsp&N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{analysis}} is mainly concerned with finding out {{the behavior of}} a physical structure when subjected to force. This action can be in the form of load due to the weight of things such as people, furniture, wind, snow, etc. or some other kind of excitation such as an earthquake, shaking of the ground due to a blast nearby, etc. In essence all these loads are dynamic, including the self-weight of the structure because {{at some point in time}} these loads were not there. The distinction is made between the dynamic and the static analysis on the basis of whether the applied action has enough acceleration in comparison to the structure's <b>natural</b> <b>frequency.</b> If a load is applied sufficiently slowly, the inertia forces (Newton's first law of motion) can be ignored and the analysis can be simplified as static analysis.|$|E
25|$|Note: angular {{frequency}} ω (ω=2 π f) with the units of radians per second {{is often used}} in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to ordinary frequency (units of Hz or equivalently cycles per second) when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness {{of the system is}} known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} was to choose a single frequency {{for all of the}} IFF transponders to operate on, no matter what the radar system's <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> might be. The selected frequency was 180MHz, a little under the lowest of the existing 1.5m radars. The transponder radio was tuned only to this frequency, not the radar itself. The radar system also added a separate radio system for transmitting and receiving these pulses, the interrogator. When the radar operator pressed a button on their console, the interrogator began sending out pulses synchronised with those of the radar unit. The IFF unit in the target aircraft then responded with pulses with the same timing. The output of the interrogator's receiver was mixed with the radar's, causing the blip to extend as before. When this was added to the spiral scan display, instead of stretching the blip, the IFF signal appeared as a series of short line segments extending outward {{from the middle of the}} display, the sunrise pattern.|$|E

[...] He was also successful in arranging with the War Office for Royal Engineers officers to study the Engineering Tripos at the university. [...] The university drew praise for the quality of its teaching during Inglis' tenure, though his department has been criticised for its [...] "comparative neglect of original research". [...] From 1923, he was involved with the analysis of vibration and its effects on railway bridges, including a period spent working with Christopher Hinton during the latter's final year as a student at Cambridge. [...] Inglis was appointed to a sub-committee of the British government's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Bridge Stress Committee by Ewing, who was chairman, and became responsible for almost all of the mathematics of the investigation. [...] Inglis derived a theory that allowed for the accurate assessment of the vibrations caused by hammer blow force imparted to the bridge by locomotives, and the committee's 1928 report included recommendations that the hammer blow force be included in bridge design calculations in the future. [...] During the course of this work Inglis was able to show that the increased oscillation of bridges at train speeds beyond those that corresponded with the <b>natural</b> <b>frequency</b> of the bridge was due to the influence of the locomotive's suspension– the first time that this phenomenon had been explained. [...] Inglis' work on bridge vibration has been described as his most important post-war research.
