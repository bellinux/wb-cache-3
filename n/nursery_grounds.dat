5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and <b>nursery</b> <b>grounds.</b> Stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E
25|$|The low {{physical}} {{energy and}} high grasses provide {{a refuge for}} animals. Many marine fish use salt marshes as <b>nursery</b> <b>grounds</b> for their young before they move to open waters. Birds may raise their young among the high grasses, because the marsh provides both sanctuary from predators and abundant food sources which include fish trapped in pools, insects, shellfish, and worms.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish {{often make}} great migrations between their spawning, feeding and <b>nursery</b> <b>grounds.</b> Schools of a {{particular}} stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern Norway, their feeding ground in Iceland, and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring.|$|E

40|$|Seagrass beds {{represent}} a shallow waters ecosystem which has high productivity {{and play a}} pivotal role ecologically and physically. The Ecological role of seagrass beds are as <b>nursery</b> <b>ground,</b> feedings ground, and spawning ground of diverse marine organisms {{and many of them}} (e. g. fishes and shrimps) are very important as economical resources. This research was conducted to study the condition and potency of seagrass bed ecosystems as a <b>nursery</b> <b>ground</b> of diverse marine organisms. The results showed that the conditions of seagrass beds in Barranglompo Island are categorized as medium and many of juvenile marine organisms that have high economic value were found...|$|R
25|$|Spawning grounds are {{the areas}} of water where aquatic animals spawn, or produce their eggs. After spawning, the spawn {{may or may not}} drift to new grounds which become their <b>nursery</b> <b>grounds.</b> Many species {{undertake}} migrations each year, and sometimes great migrations, to reach their spawning grounds. For example, lakes and river watersheds can be major spawning grounds for anadromous fish such as salmon. These days, it is often necessary to construct fish ladders and other bypass systems so salmon can navigate their way past hydroelectric dams or other obstructions such as weirs on their way to spawning grounds. Coastal fish often use mangroves and estuaries as spawning grounds, while reef fish can find adjacent seagrass meadows that make good spawning grounds. Short-finned eels can travel anything up to three or four thousand kilometres to their spawning ground in deep water somewhere in the Coral Sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{perception}} of bay salt marshes as a coastal 'wasteland' has since changed, acknowledging {{that they are}} one of the most biologically productive habitats on earth, rivalling tropical rainforests. Salt marshes are ecologically important providing habitats for native migratory fish and acting as sheltered feeding and <b>nursery</b> <b>grounds.</b> They are now protected by legislation in many countries to look after these ecologically important habitats. In the United States and Europe, they are now accorded to a high level of protection by the Clean Water Act and the Habitats Directive respectively. With the impacts of this habitat and its importance now realised, a growing interest in restoring salt marshes, through managed retreat or the reclamation of land has been established. However, many Asian countries such as China are still to recognise the value of marshlands. With their ever-growing populations and intense development along the coast, the value of salt marshes tends to be ignored and the land continues to be reclaimed.|$|E
25|$|These {{mangroves}} {{are important}} <b>nursery</b> <b>grounds</b> {{for nearly all}} major angling fish including yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), flat-tail sea-mullet (Liza argentea), luderick (Girella tricuspidata) and sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) which are caught in adjoining waters as adults, mangroves also provide rich organic matter to the Port Hacking Estuary by fixing carbon into the river system through the addition of leaves into the thick rich black mud. Many crustacean and mollusc species rely on mangroves {{as a source of}} food whether by providing foraging through leaf litter, mud or direct predation of the mangrove trees and seeds. Soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), semaphore crab (Heloecius cordiformis), blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) and hermit crabs (Pagurus sinuatus) also call the mangroves home. A more casual visitor to the mangroves at high tide is the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis) which scoots around just an inch from the surface and is virtually invisible unless viewed through a snorkel.|$|E

40|$|A {{hydrodynamic}} model was coupled to a particle tracking model to examine physical {{factors that influence}} transport of the white croaker larvae in the Ariake Sea, Kyushu, Japan. The idealized particles that mimic the larvae of white croaker are tracked under various physical and biological conditions. Freshet reduces the possibility of particles that reach the <b>nursery</b> <b>ground</b> around {{the head of the}} bay by 7 % on average. Spring tide has a positive impact on the feeding migration of particles. Selective tidal stream transport (STST) mechanism dramatically changed particle trajectories. Particles tend to reach the shallower <b>nursery</b> <b>ground</b> easier during ebb or low tide rather than high or flood tide, depending on whether the STST is considered during the particle tracking experiment. In particular, the ratio of the number of particles that reach the <b>nursery</b> <b>ground</b> increases by approximately 24 % from flood tide to low tide. When the sinking velocities of particles, ranging from 10 - 5 to 10 - 3 m/s, are considered during the particle tracking experiment, majority of the particles stayed in the releasing area. 海洋数値シミュレーションモデルと粒子追跡モデルを用いて，物理的要因が有明海の仔魚輸送に及ぼす影 響について調べた。モデルにおいて仔魚は仮想的流体粒子として表現される。河川水の出水は生育場へ輸送 される粒子数を７%減少させる。大潮時に潮流流速が増すことによって，生育場へ輸送される粒子数は増加 する。稚魚の鉛直移動の効果（Selective tidal stream transport）によって，粒子の輸送過程は大幅に変化 する。干潮時や下げ潮時に投入された粒子は，より生育場へ到達しやすくなる傾向がある。 10 - 5 から 10 - 3 m/s の範囲で粒子の沈降速度を加味した場合，粒子は放流地点付近にとどまる傾向が強くなる...|$|R
500|$|Coral reefs {{were damaged}} in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary by the hurricane. Donna caused a {{significant}} negative impact on aquatic life in north Florida Bay. Marine life was either stranded by retreating salt water which had been driven inland or killed by muddied waters in its wake. Oxygen depletion due to animals perishing in the hurricane caused additional mortality. Although salinity levels returned to normal within six weeks, dissolved oxygen concentrations remained quite low for a longer time frame. Marine life was scarce for several months in areas of greatest oxygen depletion. Sports fishing in the area took {{a few months to}} recover. Juvenile pink shrimp moved from their estuarine <b>nursery</b> <b>grounds</b> into deeper water about [...] offshore, where they were subsequently captured by fishermen.
