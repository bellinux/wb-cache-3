5|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a reservist, Matsui {{had more}} time to pursue his pan-Asian project. Between October and December 1935 he toured the major cities of China and Manchukuo {{speaking}} to Chinese politicians and businessmen about pan-Asianism and setting up a new branch of the Greater Asia Association in Tianjin. Upon his return to Japan in December 1935 he became President of the Greater Asia Association. In February and March 1936, amid ongoing tension with China, Matsui made a second trip to China, this time on a government-sponsored goodwill tour. Matsui met personally with Chiang, and though he found little common ground with him, they at least were united in their anti-communism. Matsui came out of the meeting believing that joint anti-communism could be the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. Then in December 1936, following the Xi'an Incident, Chiang agreed to join with the Communist Party of China to resist Japan, a move that Matsui viewed as a personal betrayal.|$|E

In preparation, Claudius commended both his son and adopted son to the Senate as equals in his last Senate address.

Dodd left Little Rock the next day. As he left Union territory, the guard tore up Dodd's pass since {{he would no longer}} need it <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in Confederate land. He went to spend the night with his uncle, Washington Dodd, on the Middle Hot Springs Road southwest of Little Rock.

He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter {{from the back of the}} coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.|$|E
25|$|In December 1902, Bertholf {{reported}} for duty {{as an assistant}} inspector for the U.S. Life-Saving Service in Atlantic City. It was common practice for Revenue Cutter Service officers to perform this duty.

He was responsible as an assistant inspector to examine and drill the surfmen at the 42 life saving stations along the New Jersey shore each month. He also had to investigate any shipwrecks along the coast to see if the rescues had been conducted properly by the life saving stations. This tour of duty with the Life Saving Service would be of valuable experience later in his career when the USLSS merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E

25|$|In the 1840s, {{when the}} {{railways}} reached {{the coasts of}} Picardy, Normandy and Brittany, the market changed suddenly. The railway saw to the rapid transit aspect of the trade. The chasse-marée vehicle was redundant {{on the main road}} routes but was still used more locally. The important thing then was for the fisherman to make his landing in time to catch the early morning train which took the product to the morning markets in inland towns. In order to make a living, he had to see that with or without wind, he was ashore in time. He would therefore choose his fishing ground and the time of leaving it with a view to how the tide would carry him to the fish quay for 4 a.m. or thereabouts. Nonetheless, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> working to city time rather than the tide, the railway fish quay had to be accessible at all states of the tide. Over the years, the canneries took ever more of his catch so that missing the train did not represent a total loss.|$|E
25|$|When the new {{government}} was formed, Thiers, with no government experience, was given a lesser position, that of undersecretary of state for Finance, under Laffitte, but was also awarded the Legion of Honor and the position of state counselor, which had a substantial salary. He ranked {{as one of the}} Radical supporters of the new dynasty, in opposition to the party of which his rival François Guizot was the chief literary man, and Guizot's patron, the duc de Broglie, the main pillar. To have real influence and independence, Thiers knew that he needed a seat in the chamber of deputies, not just a government position. But to be eligible to run, he needed to own property important enough that he paid taxes of at least one thousand francs a year. His intimate friend, Madame Dosne, spoke to her husband, a wealthy businessman. Dosne arranged a loan of one hundred thousand francs to Thiers so that he could buy a lot and build a house in a new real estate development at Place Saint-George. In return, Dosne received the position of Receiver-General in Brest. A seat for Aix-en-Provence in the chamber of deputies was vacant. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eligible, Thiers ran and was elected on 21 October 1830. Ten years after his arrival in Paris, he began his political career.|$|E

500|$|In late 1810, King George III {{began his}} final descent into madness.

500|$|Hitler {{immediately}} {{turned to}} the Luftwaffe to help blunt the offensive. At this point, its close support corps was deployed in the Crimea, {{taking part in the}} siege of Sevastopol. 8th Air Corps under the command of Wolfram von Richthofen was initially ordered to deploy to Kharkov from the Crimea, but the command was rescinded. In an unusual move, Hitler kept it in the Crimea, but did not put the corps under the command of Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4), which already contained 6th Air Corps, under the command of General Kurt Pflugbeil, and Fliegerführer Süd (Flying Command South), a small anti-shipping command based in the Crimea. Instead, he allowed Richthofen to take charge of all operations over Sevastopol. The siege in the Crimea was not over, and the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula had not yet been won. Still, Hitler was pleased with the progress there and content to keep Richthofen where he was and withdraw air support from Fliegerkorps VIII in order to prevent a Soviet breakthrough at Kharkov. The use of the Luftwaffe to compensate for the German Army's lack of firepower suggested that the OKW saw the Luftwaffe primarily as a ground support arm. This angered Richthofen who complained that the Luftwaffe was treated as [...] "the army's whore". <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not being redeployed to Kharkov, Richthofen also complained about the withdrawal of his units to the region, arguing that the Kerch and Sevastopol battles were ongoing and owing to the transfer of aerial assets to Kharkov, victory in the Crimea was no longer guaranteed. In reality, the Soviet units at Kerch were already routed and the Axis position at Sevastopol was comfortable.|$|E

He often wore an electric blue suit with flared trousers and a ruffled shirt to the restaurant he frequented. The restaurant owner recalled: [...] "It was horrible.
