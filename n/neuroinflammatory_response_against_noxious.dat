40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) is ubiquitous, neurotropic, and {{the most}} common {{pathogenic}} cause of sporadic acute encephalitis in humans. Herpes simplex encephalitis {{is associated with a}} high mortality rate and significant neu-rological, neuropsychological, and neurobehavioral sequels. HSV- 1 infects limbic system structures in the central nervous system (CNS), and has been suggested as an environmental risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The possibility that HSV- 1 reactivates in CNS neurons causing chronic progressive damage at cellular level and altering the neuronal functionality has not been thoroughly investigated. Currently it is ignored if recurrent reactivation of HSV- 1 in asymptomatic patients involves some risk of progressive deterioration of the CNS functions caused, in example, by a <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> <b>against</b> the virus or by direct toxicity of the pathogen on neurons. Therefore, studies regarding the routes of dissemination of HSV- 1 from the peripheral ganglions to the CNS, as well as the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms implied in generating neuronal damage during latent and productive infection, are of much relevance...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} an in vitro masking action of IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) towards IgG antinuclear antibodies (IgG-ANA) {{which can be}} recovered by using D-penicillamine (DP) as an unmasking agent. The mechanism of this masking effect was elucidated by using smears of rat free nucleus as substrate, instead of the classical rat liver cryostat sections technique. It was postulated that the 'inhibition' of IgG-ANA by IgM-RF {{may be due to}} the formation of high molecular weight complexes (HMWC); this would be the same in vivo. Allowing the formation of HMWC which can be removed from the circulation, IgM-RF may have a protective effect by preventing or minimizing systemic lesions. Therefore, IgM-RF may be considered as a defence <b>response</b> <b>against</b> potentially <b>noxious</b> ANA or antigen-antibody complexes.

40|$|Healthy aged {{individuals}} {{are more likely}} to suffer profound memory impairments following a challenging life event such as a severe bacterial infection, surgery, or an intense psychological stressor, than are younger adults. These peripheral challenges are capable of producing a <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response,</b> (e. g., increased pro-inflammatory cytokines), and in the healthy aged brain this response is exaggerated and prolonged. Normal aging primes or sensitizes microglia and this appears to be the source of this amplified response.

40|$|Up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines {{in brain}} ("neuroinflammation") accompanies {{neurological}} disease and neurotoxicity. Previously, we documented a striatal <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> to acute administration of a neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine (METH), i. e. one associated {{with evidence of}} dopaminergic terminal damage and activation of microglia and astroglia. When we used minocycline to suppress METH-induced neuroinflammation, indices of dopaminergic neurotoxicity were not affected, but suppression of neuroinflammation was incomplete. Here, we administered the classic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), {{in an attempt to}} completely suppress METH-related neuroinflammation. METH alone caused large increases in striatal proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine mRNA and subsequent astrocytic hypertrophy, microglial activation, and dopaminergic nerve terminal damage. Pre-treatment of mice with acute CORT failed to prevent <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to METH. Surprisingly, when mice were pre-treated with chronic CORT in the drinking water, an enhanced striatal <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> to METH was observed, an effect that was accompanied by enhanced METH-induced astrogliosis and dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Chronic CORT pre-treatment also sensitized frontal cortex and hippocampus to mount a <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> to METH.

However, the specific role of neuroinflammation in the progression of cognitive deficits remains unclear. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these events we used a rodent model of focal cerebral stroke, which causes deficits in hippocampus-dependent cognitive function. Methods: Cerebral stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Hippocampus-dependent cognitive function was evaluated by a contextual fear conditioning test. The glial <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> were investigated by immunohistochemical evaluation and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI).

This review delineates the current literature concerning in vitro mechanisms and in vivo efficacy of iv lidocaine on the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> in acute and chronic pain. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: We searched PUBMED and the Cochrane Library for in vitro and in vivo studies from July 1975 to August 2014. In vitro articles providing an explanation for the mechanisms of action of lidocaine on the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> in pain were included. Animal or clinical studies were included concerning iv lidocaine for acute or chronic pain or during inflammation. RESULTS: Eighty-eight articles regarding iv lidocaine were included: 36 in vitro studies evaluating the effect on ion channels and receptors; 31 animal studies concerning acute and chronic pain and inflammatory models; 21 clinical studies concerning acute and chronic pain. Low-dose lidocaine inhibits in vitro voltage-gated sodium channels, the glycinergic system, some potassium channels and Galphaq-coupled protein receptors. Higher lidocaine concentrations block potassium and calcium channels, and NMDA receptors. Animal studies demonstrate lidocaine to have analgesic effects in acute and neuropathic pain syndromes and anti-inflammatory effects early in the inflammatory response. Clinical studies demonstrate lidocaine to have advantage in abdominal surgery and in some neuropathic pain syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous lidocaine has analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antihyperalgesic properties mediated by an inhibitory effect on ion channels and receptors.

40|$|Neuroinflammatory {{processes}} {{are well known}} to regulate behavior, mood, and cognition and are considered {{a key factor in}} the development of psychiatric disorders. Exposure to acute or chronic stressors primes the neuroimmune microenvironment to produce exaggerated or enhanced <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to a subsequent immune challenge. This primed state persists for many days after stress exposure. However the mechanism(s) that lead stressors to prime neuroinflammation are largely unknown. Advancement in our understanding of peripheral innate immune function led to the discovery that endogenous molecules are released in response to `danger 2 ̆ 7 to assist immune/inflammatory processes. Recent evidence suggests similar {{processes are}} present in the CNS. Here, stress is explored as a process that can be conceptualized as `danger 2 ̆ 7 in which the danger signal, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB- 1) is released in the brain to prepare <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to subsequent pro-inflammatory stimuli. The data presented in this dissertation established that signaling via toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and/or TLR 4 in the brain is required for stress-induced microglia priming and sensitization of <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to a peripheral immune challenge. Next, HMGB- 1 was explored as the signal to TLR 2 /TLR 4. Inescapable tailshock increased HMGB- 1 protein in the hippocampus and HMGB- 1 was actively released by hippocampal microglia. Central administration of an HMGB- 1 antagonist during inescapable tailshock prevented stress-induced microglia priming. HMGB- 1 is susceptible to post-translational modifications that determine receptor interaction and inflammatory function. Disulfide HMGB- 1 has been shown to bind TLRs and is likely the primary form that drives stress-induced priming. Central administration of dsHMGB- 1 was sufficient to prime the overall <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> to a peripheral LPS injection as well as microglia response to LPS ex vivo. This is likely mediated, in part, by a direct effect on microglia as microglia treated with dsHMGB- 1 were primed to a later LPS challenge. Lastly, the intracellular mechanism by which HMGB- 1 drives neuroinflammatory priming was explored. Stress-induced HMGB- 1 likely primes <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> via the NLRP 3 inflammasome. Both inescapable tailshock and central administration of dsHMGB- 1 increased hippocampal NLRP 3 protein for at least 24 h. Furthermore, direct treatment of dsHMGB- 1 on isolated microglia increased NLRP 3 transcription. This effect was not accompanied by the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that the NLRP 3 inflammasome is primed but not active. The work presented in this dissertation implicates HMGB- 1 as an endogenous danger signal that is released in the brain in response to stress to prime <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> by acting on the NLRP 3 inflammasome, in preparation for a later immune challenge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cyclooxygenases (COX) - 1 and - 2 are key {{mediators}} of the {{inflammatory response}} in the central nervous system. Since COX- 2 is inducible by inflammatory stimuli, it has been traditionally considered as the most appropriate target for anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the specific roles of COX- 1 and COX- 2 in modulating a <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> are unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that COX- 1 deficient mice show decreased <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> and neuronal damage in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods In this study, we investigated the role of COX- 2 in the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> to intracerebroventricular-injected LPS (5 μg), a model of direct activation of innate immunity, using COX- 2 deficient (COX- 2 -/-) and wild type (COX- 2 +/+) mice, as well as COX- 2 +/+ mice pretreated for 6 weeks with celecoxib, a COX- 2 selective inhibitor. Results Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, COX- 2 -/- mice showed increased neuronal damage, glial cell activation, mRNA and protein expression of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, such as cytokines, chemokines, iNOS and NADPH oxidase. Brain protein levels of IL- 1 β, NADPH oxidase subunit p 67 phox, and phosphorylated-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) were higher in COX- 2 -/- and in celecoxib-treated mice, compared to COX- 2 +/+ mice. The increased <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> in COX- 2 -/- mice was likely mediated by the upregulation of STAT 3 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS 3). Conclusion These results show that inhibiting COX- 2 activity can exacerbate the inflammatory response to LPS, possibly by increasing glial cells activation and upregulating the STAT 3 and SOCS 3 pathways in the brain. </p...|$|R
40|$|Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a multi-symptom {{disorder}} {{with features}} characteristic of persistent sickness behavior. Among conditions {{encountered in the}} Gulf War (GW) theater were physiological stressors (e. g., heat/cold/physical activity/sleep deprivation), prophylactic treatment with the reversible AChE inhibitor, pyridostigmine bromide (PB), the insect repellent, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and potentially the nerve agent, sarin. Prior exposure to the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), at levels associated with high physiological stress, can paradoxically prime the CNS to produce a robust proinflammatory response to neurotoxicants and systemic inflammation; such neuroinflammatory effects {{can be associated with}} sickness behavior. Here, we examined whether CORT primed the CNS to mount <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to GW exposures as a potential model of GWI. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were treated with chronic (14 days) PB/ DEET, subchronic (7 - 14 days) CORT, and acute exposure (day 15) to diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), a sarin surrogate and irreversible AChE inhibitor. DFP alone caused marked brain-wide neuroinflammation assessed by qPCR of tumor necrosis factor- 1, IL 6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, IL- 12, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M. Pre-treatment with high physiological levels of CORT greatly augmented (up to 300 -fold) the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to DFP. Anti-inflammatory pre-treatment with minocycline suppressed many proinflammatory responses to CORT+DFP. Our findings are suggestive of a possible critical, yet unrecognized interaction between the stressor/environment of the GW theater and agent exposure(s) unique to this war. Such exposures may in fact prime the CNS to amplify future <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to pathogens, injury, or toxicity. Such occurrences could potentially result in the prolonged episodes of sickness behavior observed in GWI. Gulf War (GW) veterans were exposed to stressors, prophylactic medicines and, potentially, nerve agents in theater. Subsequent development of GW Illness, a persistent multi-symptom disorder with features characteristic of sickness behavior, may be caused by priming of the CNS resulting in exaggerated <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses</b> to pathogens/insults. Nerve agent, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), produced a <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> that was exacerbated by pre-treatment with levels of corticosterone simulating heightened stressor conditions. While prophylactic treatments reduced DFP-induced neuroinflammation, this effect was negated when those treatments were combined with corticosterone.

Untreated the disease is invariably fatal, and melarsoprol, the only available and effective treatment for CNS disease, is associated in up to 10 % of cases with a severe post-treatment reactive encephalopathy (PTRE), which can itself cause death. We used a reproducible mouse model of the PTRE to investigate the pathogenesis and treatment of this condition. Mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei and treated subcuratively with diminazene aceturate develop a severe meningoencephalitis that closely resembles PTRE. We previously reported that substance P {{plays an important role}} in PTRE. We investigated the effect of disrupting the gene encoding for the NK 1 receptor in mice on the clinical and <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> in this model. After induction of PTRE, NK 1 (-/-) mice showed a significant reduction in clinical impairment compared with NK 1 (+/+) mice, but the severity of the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> was significantly greater in NK 1 (-/-) mice.

40|$|Introduction: β-Amyloid (Aβ) {{accumulation}} in cortical capillaries is {{a variant}} of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) referred to as capillary CAA (capCAA). capCAA {{is associated with a}} <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response.</b> In vitro studies indicate that Aβ induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mainly generated through NADPH oxidase (NOX), by activated microglia. ROS in turn can induce altered expression of tight junctions (TJ), which are essential for blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Whether the function of the BBB is affected in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with comorbid capCAA remains elusive. Cases with capCAA and no other AD-related changes allow studying capCAA-associated BBB alterations independent of AD pathology. Aim: In this study, we have investigated BBB alterations in capCAA and addressed the role of the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response.</b> Methods: Human postmortem brain tissue with capCAA was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Results: In this study, we show {{for the first time a}} dramatic loss of TJ proteins claudin- 5, occludin and ZO- 1 in Aβ-laden capillaries. In addition, affected capillaries are associated with clusters of NOX- 2 -positive activated microglia.

Cultures were exposed to nanomolar OTA concentrations and samples were collected 48 h after a single exposure, or after 10 days of repeated administration. OTA-induced changes in gene- and protein expression, as well as alterations in cell morphology were assessed. Forty-eight-hour OTA exposure resulted in a disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton and reduced expression of several oligodendrocyte-specific markers indicative of demyelination. Astrocyte disturbances were revealed by a decrease in two astrocytic proteins involved in regulation of inflammatory responses, metallothioneins I and II. Repeated OTA administration induced a <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response,</b> as visualized by an increase of isolectin B 4 labelled cells, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and detection of macrophagic ED 1 /CD 68 positive cells, {{as well as an}} upregulation of neurodegenerative M 1 microglial phenotype markers. Partial recovery from OTA-induced deleterious effects on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes was achieved by co-treatment with sonic hedgehog (SHH). In addition, metallothionein I and II co-treatment partially restored OTA-induced effects on oligodendrocytes after 48 h, and modulated microglial reactivity after 10 days. These results suggest that OTA-exposure affects Shh-signalling, which in turn may influence both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Furthermore, the primarily astrocytic proteins MTI/MTII may affect microglial activation. Thus the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> appears to be downstream of OTA-induced effects on demyelination, axonal instabilities and astrocytes disturbances.

Evidence primarily from in vitro studies, indicates that neuroinflammatory effects can be either beneficial or harmful, possibly related to stimulus strength. We investigated using in vivo models, {{the effect of a}} mild or substantial cerebral hypoxia-ischemia on: cerebral microglial/macrophage activation (ED 1), pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), nitrosative stress (nitrotyrosine) and permanent brain damage. A mild insult produced a transient (1 - 2 days post) increase in activated microglia/macrophages within subcortical white and not gray matter but transiently increased cytokine or nitrotyrosine expression in cortex and not white matter. There was also prolonged scattered cell death in cortex and white matter over weeks along with loss of myelin/axons and cortical atrophy at 4 weeks post-insult. In contrast, a substantial insult produced white and gray matter necrosis, cyst formation and atrophy, along with increases in tumor necrosis factor and nitrotyrosine staining within both white and gray matter starting at 1 - 2 days post-insult. Microglial/macrophage staining was increased starting at 1 -week post a substantial insult and remained elevated for weeks thereafter. Thus, a transient <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> occurs following a mild insult whereas prolonged scattered cell death occurs for weeks, particularly in white matter.

40|$|Insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) {{effects on}} aging and neurodegeneration is still controversial. However, {{it is widely}} {{admitted}} that IGF- 1 {{is involved in the}} <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response.</b> In peripheral tissues, several studies showed that IGF- 1 inhibited the expression of inflammatory markers, although other studies concluded that IGF- 1 has proinflammatory functions. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α impaired IGF- 1 signaling. In the brain, there are controversial results on effects of IGF- 1 in neuroinflammation. In addition to direct protective effects on neurons, several studies revealed anti-inflammatory effects of IGF- 1 acting on astrocytes and microglia, and that IGF- 1 may also inhibit blood brain barrier permeability. Altogether suggests that the aging-related decrease in IGF- 1 levels may contribute to the aging-related pro-inflammatory state. IGF- 1 inhibits the astrocytic response to inflammatory stimuli, and modulates microglial phenotype (IGF- 1 promotes the microglial M 2 and inhibits of M 1 phenotype). Furthermore, IGF- 1 is mitogenic for microglia. IGF- 1 and estrogen interact to modulate the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> and microglial and astrocytic phenotypes. Brain renin-angiotensin and IGF- 1 systems also interact to modulate neuroinflammation.

Their role in central nervous system diseases, including infections, is discussed in terms of a participation in both acute and chronic <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses.</b> Specific reference is made also to their involvement in Alzheimer's disease where microglial cell activation is thought to be critically important in the neurodegenerative process. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Heroin (3, 6 -diacetylmorphine) has various {{effects on}} {{the central nervous system}} with several neuropathological {{alterations}} including hypoxic-ischemic brain damage from respiratory depressing effects and <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response.</b> Both of these mechanisms induce the release of cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory mediators by the activation of many cell types such as leucocytes and endothelial and glial cells, especially microglia, the predominant immunocompetent cell type within the central nervous system. The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify the correlation between intravenous heroin administration in heroin related death and the <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response.</b> We selected 45 cases among autopsies executed for heroin-related death (358 total cases); immunohistochemical studies and Western blotting analyses were used to investigate the expression of brain markers such as tumor necrosis factor-α, oxygen-regulated protein 150, (interleukins) IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, IL- 15, cyclooxygenase- 2, heat shock protein 70, and CD 68 (MAC 387). Findings demonstrated that morphine induces inflammatory response and cytokine release. In particular, oxygen-regulated protein 150, cyclooxygenase- 2, heat shock protein 70, IL- 6 and IL- 15 cytokines were over-expresse...|$|R
40|$|Aging {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} risk factors for the development of sporadic age-related neurodegenerative diseases and neuroinflammation is a common feature of this disease phenotype. In the immunoprivileged brain, neuroglial cells, which mediate <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>responses,</b> are influenced by the physiological factors in the microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS). These physiological factors include but are not limited to cell-to-cell communication involving cell adhesion molecules, neuronal electrical activity and neurotransmitter and neuromodulator action. However, despite this dynamic control of neuroglial activity, in the healthy aged brain there is an alteration in the underlying <b>neuroinflammatory</b> <b>response</b> notably seen in the hippocampus, typified by astrocyte/microglia activation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and signaling. These changes may occur without any overt concurrent pathology, however, they typically correlate with deteriorations in hippocamapal or cognitive function. In this review we examine two important phenomenons, firstly the relationship between age-related brain deterioration (focusing on hippocampal function) and underlying neuroglial response(s), and secondly how the latter affects molecular and cellular processes within the hippocampus that makes it vulnerable to age-related cognitive decline...|$|R
