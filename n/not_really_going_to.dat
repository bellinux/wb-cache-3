5000|$|When {{asked in}} ABC's Primetime about his {{involvement}} with stopping the episode rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone?

6000|$|... "Now all men," [...] he went on, [...] "look for a space {{upon this}} assegai that I hold up," [...] and {{he lifted the}} bangwan of the {{deceased}} Bombyane high above his head {{so that all the}} multitude could see it. Every eye was fixed upon the broad bright spear. For a while he held it still, then he moved it round and round in a circle, muttering as he did so, and still their gaze followed it. For my part, I watched his movements with the greatest anxiety. That assegai had already been nearer my person than I found at all pleasant, and I had no desire to make a further acquaintance with it. Nor, indeed, was I sure that Indaba-zimbi was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill me. I could not understand his proceedings at all, and at the best I did not relish playing the corpus vile to his magical experiments.|$|E
60|$|The little model {{tried to}} answer, but her words would not pass her throat; {{she threw her}} head back trying to free them, and stood, swaying. Seeing her like this before him, white as a sheet, {{with her eyes closed}} and her lips parted, as though about to faint, Hilary seized her by the shoulders. At the touch of those soft shoulders, his face became suffused with blood, his lips trembled. Suddenly her eyes opened ever so little between their lids, and looked at him. And the {{perception}} that she was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> faint, that it was a little desperate wile of this child Delilah, made him wrench away his hands. The moment she felt that grasp relax she sank down and clasped his knees, pressing them to her bosom so that he could not stir. Closer and closer she pressed them to her, till it seemed as though she must be bruising her flesh. Her breath came in sobs; her eyes were closed; her lips quivered upwards. In the clutch of her clinging body there seemed suddenly the whole of woman's power of self-abandonment. It was just that, which, at this moment, so horribly painful to him, prevented Hilary from seizing her in his arms just that queer seeming self-effacement, as though she were lost to knowledge of what she did. It seemed too brutal, too like taking advantage of a child.|$|E
6000|$|We {{swept in}} the course of five minutes into the Grand Canal; whereupon she uttered a murmur of ecstasy as fresh {{as if she had been}} a tourist just arrived. She had {{forgotten}} how splendid the great waterway looked on a clear, hot summer evening, and how the sense of floating between marble palaces and reflected lights disposed the mind to sympathetic talk. We floated long and far, and though Miss Tita gave no high-pitched voice to her satisfaction I felt that she surrendered herself. She was more than pleased, she was transported; the whole thing was an immense liberation. The gondola moved with slow strokes, to give her time to enjoy it, and she listened to the plash of the oars, which grew louder and more musically liquid as we passed into narrow canals, as if it were a revelation of Venice. When I asked her how long it was since she had been in a boat she answered, [...] "Oh, I don't know; a long time--not since my aunt began to be ill." [...] This was not the only example she gave me of her extreme vagueness about the previous years and the line which marked off the period when Miss Bordereau flourished. I was not at liberty to keep her out too long, but we took a considerable GIRL before going to the Piazza. I asked her no questions, keeping the conversation on purpose away from her domestic situation and the things I wanted to know; I poured treasures of information about Venice into her ears, described Florence and Rome, discoursed to her on the charms and advantages of travel. She reclined, receptive, on the deep leather cushions, turned her eyes conscientiously to everything I pointed out to her, and never mentioned to me till sometime afterward that she might be supposed to know Florence better than I, as she had lived there for years with Miss Bordereau. At last she asked, with the shy impatience of a child, [...] "Are we <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Piazza? That's what I want to see!" [...] I immediately gave the order that we should go straight; and then we sat silent with the expectation of arrival. As some time still passed, however, she said suddenly, of her own movement, [...] "I have found out what is the matter with my aunt: she is afraid you will go!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 2006, legal {{commentator}} {{and television}} personality Nancy Grace interviewed Elizabeth Smart, purportedly {{to talk about}} pending legislation on sex-offender registration, but repeatedly asked her for information about her experience. In response to the questioning, Elizabeth told Grace, [...] "I really am here to support the bill and not to go into what -- you know, what happened to me." [...] When Grace persisted, asking Elizabeth {{what it was like}} to see out of a burqa her abductors forced her to wear, Elizabeth stated: [...] "I'm <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> talk about this at this time ... and to be frankly honest I really don't appreciate you bringing all this up." [...] Grace did not pursue further questioning about the abduction.|$|R
40|$|Howard Shevrin's {{interest}} in neuroscience was first methodological: it provided independent evidence on {{what goes on}} unconsciously. The foundation of the mind needs not to be entirely neurophysiological: {{it is possible to}} describe the mechanisms in psychological terms. However, we aren't anywhere near a unified theory of the brain and mind. When one goes into analysis, the theory is no longer simply about ideas, one's life almost hangs in the balance. There is an enormous disparity between the neuroscientist publishing his findings and the analyst who is treating patients, but not publishing. If neuro-psychoanalysis is only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> rely on the neuroscience part, it's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> achieve its important objective. People into psychoanalysis should be trained in "the basic science of psychoanalysis", which should not be limited to neuroscience, but should include a really important training in psychology, sociology, etc. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{on several}} occasions, {{specifically}} on November 23, 1996 during a {{show at the}} Electric Factory in Philadelphia, Maynard James Keenan does grant some insight into another meaning of the song. Speaking to the audience he says, [...] "So, any of you ever watched those Warner Bros. cartoons? Sometimes there's that one where that guy is {{having a tough time}} trying to make a decision. He's got an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. Seems pretty obvious, right? Usually it's the angel who is kind of the one trying to give him the good advice while the devil is {{trying to get him to}} do what's bad for him. It's not always that simple though. Most times they're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> angels or devils. They're just friends giving you advice, looking out for your best interest but <b>not</b> <b>really</b> understanding what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be best for you. So it kind of comes down to you.

500|$|Cruise's {{representative}} {{responded to}} the controversy shortly after it broke, telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise's involvement were [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "he never said that". According to The Washington Post, Cruise's publicist asserted that [...] "Tom {{had nothing to do}} with this matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm <b>really</b> <b>not</b> even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dignify this.

5000|$|Stacy Ferguson, Sean Garrett and Mike Hartnett wrote [...] "London Bridge" [...] {{together}} with Polow da Don, who produced the song. The song contains a compositional sample of [...] "Down to The Nightclub" [...] by Tower of Power. The song was recorded at two separate locations: at the Chalice Recording Studios in Hollywood, California and at Hit Factory Criteria in Miami, Florida. Jones, credited under his production name Polow da Don, produced the song {{as well as}} provided background vocals with Jay Anderson, who also provided additional vocals to the song. Hartnett plays the bass and guitar on the song while Nate Hills, know professionally as Danja, played the drums and percussion. The keys for the song were provided by Elvis Williams while engineering was handled by Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon and Jason Schweitzer. Phil Tan worked with Josh Houghkirk on mixing the song, which took place at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. A&M Records, in association with will.i.am Music Group and Interscope Records, sent the song to contemporary hit radio on July 18, 2006. Fergie stated {{in an interview with}} The Age that the song was about bringing humor to certain subject matters, stating [...] "'It's poking fun at certain things. I'm <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> spray the paparazzi with mace - I don't know if you know that about me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yeah, {{that was}} when we started trying to get outside what was normal for us. Plus we had a new {{engineer}} in Mackand a new environment in Munich. Everything was different. We turned our whole studio technique around in a sense, because Mack {{had come from a}} different background from us. We thought {{there was only one way}} of doing things, like doing a backing tracks: We would just do it until we got it right. If there were some bits where it speeded up or slowed down, then we would do it again until it was right. We had done some of our old backing tracks so many times, they were too stiff. Mack's first contribution was to say, [...] "Well you don't have to do that. I can drop the whole thing in. If it breaks down after half a minute, then we can edit in and carry on if you just play along with the tempo". We laughed and said [...] "Don't be silly. You can't do that". But in fact, you can. What you gain is the freshness, because often a lot of the backing tracks is first time though. It really helped a lot. There was less guitar on that album, but that's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the same forever; that was just an experiment. Brian May ...|$|R
5000|$|The tracks {{intended}} to comprise the completed album Jennifer Warnes which Warnes presented to her label Arista Records {{did not include}} [...] "Right Time of the Night".

I was shocked, and then admiring of George’s ruthlessness. It’s a tough thing to build up a character and make somebody as memorable and impressive as Ned and then get rid of him. But {{at the same time it}} leads to a story that is so much more suspenseful because you truly have no idea what is going to happen and who is going to survive.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Fangoria, director Balagueró stated that the film would not have an apocalyptic style presumed by its title, stating, [...] "All of the movies in the REC series have the same budget, so you’re <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see big scenes of Barcelona full of zombies; they’re just not intended that way. There {{has to be a}} story that’s controlled and strong." [...] Apocalypse is set to follow the events of the second film, and will not be made in the [...] "found footage" [...] style. Production was scheduled to begin in 2013. At the 2012 Sitges Film Festival, it was announced the film would have its world premiere there in October 2013. An announcement trailer was released in late November, confirming the return of Manuela Velasco.|$|E
5000|$|Speculation has {{surrounded}} the song [...] "H." [...] The [...] "meaning" [...] of this song has seldom been detailed by the band, {{as they do}} not regularly comment on such things. However, on several occasions, specifically on November 23, 1996 during a show at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia, Maynard did grant {{some insight into the}} meaning of the song.

[...] The song was discussed live during a few other shows around this time, one example being on February 23, 1997, when Maynard introduced this song by referring to the shoulder angel and devil, and also said it is about a hurtful yet dependent relationship. In an interview Keenan gave in December 1996, he commented, [...] "My son's name is Devo H. That's all I'll say." [...] It is also of note that the song's working title was [...] "Half Empty", as it was introduced during a mini-tour of California by the band in December 1995. In the book Teachings of Don Juan, a Yaqui Way of Knowledge, Carlos Castaneda refers to a character named H. Keenan.|$|R

5000|$|Maynard {{utilized}} superior wrestling to earn {{a unanimous}} decision victory by a score of 30-27. In 2009, Edgar credited this fight as a positive turning point in his career. [...] "The Maynard loss definitely opened my eyes. I started training with Ricardo Almeida and the Renzo Gracie team. That's where I've been the past year, and I think it had helped me tremendously." [...] He also anticipated an eventual rematch with Maynard. [...] "I think if Maynard keeps going where he's going, and I go where I plan on going, I think we'll eventually have to meet up. That would be something that I'd {{like to see in}} the future, but I'm not dwelling on it because I think if you dwell on losses you're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> focus on what you have ahead of yourself." ...|$|E
5000|$|A fourth {{film was}} released, titled REC 4: Apocalypse, with Manuela Velasco reprising {{her role as}} Ángela Vidal, the {{reporter}} from the first two films.

To further tease the release, Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds on the song to increase buzz among the general public.
