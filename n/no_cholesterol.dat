40|$|Interaction {{of dietary}} sucrose and fiber on serum lipids in healthy young men fed high {{carbohydrate}} diets 13 Margaret J A/brink, MD and Irma H Ullrich, MD ABSTRACT High sucrose diets may cause increased serum triglycerides and decreased high density lipoprotein concentration. To determine whether dietary fiber protects against these effects, four groups of six healthy {{young men were}} {{assigned to one of}} four very high carbohydrate diets providing 0, 18, 36, or 52 % of calories as sucrose. Each diet was fed in both low ( 34 g) levels of dietary fiber for 10 days each. Triglycerides increased during the 36 and 52 % sucrose diets compared to 0 and 18 % sucrose diets, and fiber protected partially against this rise. Serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were lower during the 0 and 18 % sucrose diets than the 36 or 52 % sucrose diets but fiber had <b>no</b> effect. HDL <b>cholesterol</b> decreased during all low fat diets, with a trend toward a greater decrease during the high sucrose diets. The results suggest that fiber protects against carbohydrate-induced lipemia but has <b>no</b> effect on <b>cholesterol</b> during very high carbohydrate diets. Am iC/in Nuir l 986; 43 : 419 - 428.

30|$|If {{the model}} is valid, once the {{accumulation}} of CHO in the senile plaques is demonstrated, it is proposed to test the specificity of the synthesized nanoconjugate.

The specificity of the nanoconjugate will be determined, by evaluating the colocalization of the anti-CHO-MNPs with the CHO deposits and the senile plaques present in the 5 XFAD brain sections, performing the appropriated controls. In case that <b>no</b> evident <b>cholesterol</b> accumulations in 5 XFAD were detected, an alternative Swedish mutation on amyloid precursor protein mouse model (APPsw), mouse model of AD, will be used, since in this model, an accumulation of CHO clearly associated with amyloid plaques has been described in the hippocampus [9].|$|R

40|$|Except for {{conversion}} to bile salts, there is <b>no</b> major <b>cholesterol</b> degradation pathway in mammals. Efficient excretion {{from the body}} is therefore a crucial element in cholesterol homeostasis. Yet, the existence and importance of cholesterol degradation pathways in humans {{is a matter of}} debate. We quantified cholesterol fluxes in 15 male volunteers using a cholesterol balance approach. Ten participants repeated the protocol after 4 weeks of treatment with ezetimibe, an inhibitor of intestinal and biliary cholesterol absorption. Under basal conditions, about 65 % of daily fecal neutral sterol excretion was bile derived, with the remainder being contributed by direct transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE). Surprisingly, ezetimibe induced a 4 -fold increase in cholesterol elimination via TICE. Mouse studies revealed that most of ezetimibe-induced TICE flux is mediated by the cholesterol transporter Abcg 5 /Abcg 8. In conclusion, TICE is active in humans and may serve as a novel target to stimulate cholesterol elimination in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease...|$|R
50|$|By {{inhibiting}} HMG-CoA reductase, statins {{block the}} pathway for synthesizing cholesterol in the liver. This {{is significant because}} most circulating cholesterol comes from internal manufacture rather than the diet. When the liver can <b>no</b> longer produce <b>cholesterol,</b> levels of cholesterol in the blood will fall. Cholesterol synthesis appears to occur mostly at night, so statins with short half-lives are usually taken at night to maximize their effect.
