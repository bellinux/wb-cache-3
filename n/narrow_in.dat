5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} <b>narrow</b> <b>in</b> chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E

5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually <b>narrow</b> <b>in</b> scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream. Its {{watershed}} {{is relatively}} <b>narrow.</b> <b>In</b> {{the upper reaches}} of the creek's watershed, residential areas are sparse and tend to be somewhat removed from the creek itself. In Blakely, it follows Pennsylvania Route 347 closely and crosses it several times. A gas line crosses the creek upstream of US Route 6. There are several patches of wetlands in the watershed's upper reaches, and two more in the middle and lower reaches. Upstream of Blakely, the watershed contains forested land and pastures on a rolling plateau.|$|E

5|$|Wales has {{a complex}} {{geological}} history which has left it a largely mountainous country. The coastal plain is <b>narrow</b> <b>in</b> {{the north and}} west of the country but wider in the south, where the Vale of Glamorgan has some of the best agricultural land. Exploitation of the South Wales Coalfield during the Industrial Revolution resulted in the development of an urban economy in the South Wales Valleys, and the expansion of the port cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea for the export of coal. The smaller North Wales Coalfield was also developed at this time, but elsewhere in the country, the landscape is rural and communities are small, the economy being largely dependent on agriculture and tourism. The climate is influenced by the proximity of the country to the Atlantic Ocean and the prevailing westerly winds; thus it tends to be mild, cloudy, wet and windy.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too <b>narrow,</b> <b>in</b> my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front {{part of the}} zygomatic arch, is narrow, with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front, but there is considerable variation in {{the features of the}} plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the bony palate, is very <b>narrow.</b> <b>In</b> the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, extend to near the front margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates the root of the incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the chewing edge in the horizontal plane) to slightly opisthodont (with the chewing edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E

40|$|Spectral {{diffusion}} dephasing and motional <b>narrowing</b> <b>in</b> single semiconductor {{quantum dots}} Guillaume CASSABOIS Abstract In this review, we address the extrinsic dephasing mechanism of spectral diffusion that dominates the decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots at cryo-genic temperature. We discuss {{the limits of}} random telegraph and Gaussian stochas-tic noises, and we describe the general effect of motional <b>narrowing</b> <b>in</b> the context of spectral noise. We emphasize the unconventional phenomenology of motional <b>narrowing</b> <b>in</b> standard semiconductor quantum dots at low incident power and tem-perature, that makes the quantum dot emission line a sensitive probe of the extrinsic reservoir fluctuation dynamics. We further show that the text book phenomenology of motional <b>narrowing</b> <b>in</b> nuclear magnetic resonance is recovered in quantum dots embedded in field-effect heter-ostructure. In that case, the electrical control of the mesoscopic environment of the quantum dot leads to conventional motional nar-rowing where the motion consists in carrier tunneling out of the defects around the quantum dot. ...|$|R
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A stub that is <b>narrow</b> <b>in</b> comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E
