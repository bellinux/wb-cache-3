5|$|After {{the success}} of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, wanted a {{spacecraft}} launched on 7 November 1957, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

5|$|Before the 2014 season, Hamels {{announced}} that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to pitch on Opening Day because of tendonitis in his biceps. On April 6 Hamels pitched in a Minor League Class A-Advanced game, striking out four while allowing two earned runs on three hits in four innings. He made his first start of the season on April 23.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Sunderland's planned {{new stadium}} {{was on the}} {{shortlist}} for Euro 96 venues, as England had been named as hosts of the competition in May 1992.

5|$|The {{effects on}} the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only {{confirming}} the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would continue to seek reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating {{on the construction of}} several new ships in Italian seaports that would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action {{of the year in the}} Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers' conscious effort to have more professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for the 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities were}} chosen based on bids {{presented}} to the ACC and its member schools. Each city requested and was granted a two-year contract, locking the ACC into the locations {{well in advance of}} the actual games. Tampa was chosen as the site of the 2008game because Charlotte was scheduled to hold the annual convention of the Association for Career and Technical Education {{at the same time as}} the game, and adequate hotel space would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> in time for the two events.|$|E

5|$|Curie and {{her husband}} {{declined}} to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905. The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant. Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre a position, the University of Paris gave Pierre a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still {{did not have a}} proper laboratory. Upon Pierre's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> until 1906.|$|E

25|$|However, Central Plains Water Trust appealed this {{decision}} to the Court of Appeal {{and the case}} was heard on 28 February 2008. On 19 March 2008, the Court of Appeal released a majority decision, that reversed the Environment Court and High Court decisions and awarded priority to Central Plains Water Trust. Justice Robertson gave a dissenting minority opinion that without the full information, the original CPW application had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> for notification in 2001.|$|R

5|$|Dowding {{later wrote}} a memo {{considering}} several aircraft for the role, rejecting the Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat fighter {{due to its}} cramped rear turret area. He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter would be perfect for the role, but it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for some time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with the radar, while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; K7033s propeller was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E
5|$|HMS Renown was {{the lead}} ship of her class of battlecruisers of the Royal Navy built during the First World War. She was {{originally}} laid down as an improved version of the s. Her construction was suspended on the outbreak of war on the grounds she would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> in a timely manner. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to restart her construction as a battlecruiser that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-D'Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher's requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ships in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but the ship was delivered {{a few months after}} the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Renown, and her sister , were the world's fastest capital ships upon completion.|$|E
5|$|The British {{bargaining}} position had worsened; the American scientists {{had decided that}} the United States no longer needed outside help, {{and they wanted to}} prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war—especially not bomb design—even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them. They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{action was}} the first of two in this {{campaign}} in which lone British frigates were briefly overwhelmed by superior French forces as they sailed independently to join Rowley's squadron. On each occasion however, Rowley was able to recapture the lost frigate and drive off the French attackers. Corbet's action was particularly violent, British casualties totalling 49 killed and 114 wounded, including every single officer and all but three of the soldiers embarked. Africaine was seriously damaged and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to return to active service for some months. French losses were less severe, Astrée suffering one killed and two wounded, Iphigénie nine killed and 33 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Apollo 8 {{was planned}} to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, {{launched}} on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs. In the summer it had become clear that the LM would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, and other lifeforms around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7. Gemini veterans Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, and rookie William Anders captured the world's attention by making ten lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Ewbank {{maintained}} through {{training camp}} that second-year Mike Taliaferro was the number-one quarterback and disappointed a sellout crowd at Houston's Rice Stadium by keeping Namath {{on the bench}} at the Jets' season opener. Ewbank felt that Namath might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for several more weeks, but Werblin intervened. Namath saw his first regular season action in the AFL the next week against the Kansas City Chiefs (the former Dallas Texans), and he was starting quarterback the following week against the Buffalo Bills. Namath's performance was inconsistent as he gained pro experience, but he was named AFL Rookie of the Year. The Jets finished the season 5–8–1 again. Beginning in 1966, the Jets began to improve on the field behind Namath, who led them to a 6–6–2 record. That season, the NFL and AFL announced a merger, which would be effective in 1970. A championship game (it {{came to be known}} as the Super Bowl), played between the two league champions, would follow each season until the merger took place.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} rested {{here when}} the men, horses and several hundred Ottoman prisoners were watered and fed. During {{this time a}} squadron led by armoured cars went ahead to reconnoitre the track across the Mount Carmel Range from Sindiane through the Abu Shusheh Pass. The reconnaissance group reported the track across the Abu Shusheh pass rough and in a bad repair. Macandrews informed Chauvel that his division would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to move from Liktera before 18:15 when the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades would advance without wheels to negotiate the pass at night. As a consequence the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade remained to guard the guns. The artillery and the Jodhpur and 1st Hyderabad Lancers, were to follow at daylight on 20 September, while the Mysore Lancers waited at Liktera for the division's transport, which they were to guard. Chauvel arrived at Liktera after midnight on 19/20 September when he ordered the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade to take the 5th Cavalry Division's guns via J'ara and Abu Shushe. They arrived at Abu Shusheh at 03:00 and rejoin their division at Afulah during the night.|$|E
