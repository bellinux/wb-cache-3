2500|$|Global civics {{suggests}} that civics can be understood, {{in a global}} sense, as a social contract between global citizens {{in the age of}} interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth. World citizen has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional geopolitical divisions derived from national citizenship. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in Socrates, whom Plutarch quoted as saying: [...] "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world." [...] In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.|$|E

Our model is restricted to formalisms where the entities and the relationships between these entities are defined on the same domain. The method is an upstream step to a previous framework dealing with a set of QCNs defined on the same formalism. It consists of translating the input QCNs into a well-chosen common formalism. Two approaches are investigated: in the first one, each input QCN is translated to an equivalent QCN; in the second one, the QCNs are translated to approximations. These approaches take advantage of two dual <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> introduce, the ones of refinement and abstraction between qualitative formalisms...|$|R

2500|$|With the Renaissance {{came the}} Protestant Reformation, which {{in many ways}} downplayed mysticism, {{although}} it still produced {{a fair amount of}} spiritual literature. Even the most active reformers can be linked to Medieval mystical traditions. Martin Luther, for instance, was a monk who was influenced by the German Dominican mystical tradition of Eckhart and Tauler as well by the Dionysian-influenced Wesenmystik ("essence mysticism") tradition. He also published the Theologia Germanica, which he claimed was the most important book after the Bible and Augustine for teaching him about God, Christ, and humanity. Even John Calvin, who rejected many Medieval ascetic practices and who favored doctrinal knowledge of God over affective experience, has Medieval influences, namely, Jean Gerson and the Devotio moderna, with its emphasis on piety as the method of spiritual growth in which the individual practices dependence on God by imitating Christ and the son-father relationship. Meanwhile, his <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can begin to enjoy our eternal salvation through our earthly successes leads in later generations to [...] "a mysticism of consolation".|$|E

Coates testified that the Justice Department's administration's decision to drop the Black Panther Case [...] "was intended to send a direct message to people {{inside and outside the}} civil rights division. That message is that the filing of voting cases like the Ike Brown and the NBPP cases would not continue in the Obama administration."

Unlike in continuous-time scenarios, when discrete-time dynamics are considered, dead-beat stabilization becomes possible in principle.

In particular, we define a class of quasi-locality <b>notions,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> name "tree-like hypergraphs," and show that the states that are robustly stabilizable in finite time are then unique ground states of a frustration-free, commuting quasi-local Hamiltonian.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{unification}} {{and matching}} in equational theories based on semirings, which include Kleene algebra and extensions with {{different forms of}} concurrency, constraint semirings, and synchronous ac-tions algebra. Generally the unification problems are undecidable in this setting, but different undecidability proofs are required. On the other hand, the matching problems are decidable and a general pattern can be drawn. This pattern is developed into a matching algorithm, relying on {{a new way of}} combining non-disjoint theories, which we call stratification, and on a relaxation of the finite variant property, which we call separa-bility. Consequently, <b>we</b> believe <b>that</b> our algorithm and the <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> introduce have an importance i) beyond theories based on semirings; ii) for other problems related to unification and matching. ...|$|R

2500|$|In Aupers and Houtman (2010) Bovbjerg {{identifies}} NLP as a New Age [...] "psycho-religion" [...] {{and uses}} NLP as a case-study {{to demonstrate the}} thesis that the New Age psycho-religions such as NLP are predicated on an instrinsically religious idea, namely concern with a transcendent [...] "other". In the world's monotheistic faiths, argues Bovbjerg, the purpose of religious practice is communion and fellowship with a [...] transcendent 'other', i.e. a God. [...] With the New Age psycho-religions, argues Bovbjerg, this orientation towards a transcendent 'other' persists but the other has become [...] "the other in our selves", the so-called unconscious: [...] "he individual's inner life becomes the intangible focus of religious practices and the subconscious becomes a constituent part of modern individuals' understanding of the Self." [...] Bovbjerg adds, [...] "ourses in personal development would make no sense without an unconscious that contains hidden resources and hidden knowledge of the self." [...] Thus psycho-religious practice revolves around ideas of the conscious and unconscious self and communicating with and accessing the hidden resources of the unconscious self—the transcendent other. According to Bovbjerg the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have an unconscious self underlies many NLP techniques either explicitly or implicitly. Bovbjerg argues, [...] "hrough particular practices, the [...] psycho-religious practitioner expects to achieve self-perfection in a never-ending transformation of the self." ...|$|E
2500|$|By [...] "necessary connection", Hume {{means the}} power or force which {{necessarily}} ties one idea to another.

Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of {{some sense of the}} power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the [...] "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" [...] which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone.
