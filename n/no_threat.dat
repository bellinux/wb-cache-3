5|$|The 1939 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{ran through the}} summer and fall of 1939. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes was extremely unreliable. Most east Pacific storms were of <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to land. However, 1939 saw a large number of storms threaten California.|$|E
5|$|During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms {{period of}} China (907–960), while the {{fractured}} political realm of China saw <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> in a Tibet {{which was in}} just as much political disarray, there was {{little in the way}} of Sino-Tibetan relations. Few documents involving Sino-Tibetan contacts survive from the Song dynasty (960–1279). The Song were far more concerned with countering northern enemy states of the Khitan-ruled Liao dynasty (907–1125) and Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty (1115–1234).|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} in which the air strikes were conducted, a force of 25 Wildcat and Supermarine Seafire fighters from 801, 842 and 880 Naval Air Squadrons {{provided}} air defence for the Home Fleet. Nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers, which were also operated by 842 Naval Air Squadron, conducted anti-submarine patrols. <b>No</b> <b>threat</b> to the fleet developed, and Corsairs took over air defence duties {{at the conclusion of the}} two attacks.|$|E

5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to the terns.|$|E
5|$|The 1953 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active season on record. The season officially began on May 15 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific. They ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit {{the time of year}} when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to land.|$|E

5|$|The Wayne Sewerage Company was {{incorporated}} on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek {{to build a}} sewer system and built an engine house with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the water would be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, the State Board of Health {{filed a lawsuit against}} the company alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the Board of Health and a new plant was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Well you can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't {{attempt to make}} any evasive manoeuvres. And all they had was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If I did this, I would get one every time.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E

5|$|Angry at his {{treatment}} by the Byers enquiry, Scott sought {{other means of}} pursuing his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also an agent for the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence. In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to denounce Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published. Depressed, Scott retreated {{into a state of}} torpor, assisted by tranquilisers, and for a while presented <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to Thorpe.|$|E
5|$|In 15–16th-century French and English {{depictions of}} {{relationships}} between women (Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brantôme in 1665, John Cleland's 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, L'Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women. At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Batista's {{government}} held presidential elections, but no politician {{stood against}} him; {{the election was}} widely considered fraudulent. It had allowed some political opposition to be voiced, and Castro's supporters had agitated for an amnesty for the Moncada incident's perpetrators. Some politicians suggested an amnesty would be good publicity, and the Congress and Batista agreed. Backed by the U.S. and major corporations, Batista believed Castro to be <b>no</b> <b>threat,</b> and on May 15, 1955, the prisoners were released. Returning to Havana, Castro gave radio interviews and press conferences; the government closely monitored him, curtailing his activities. Now divorced, Castro had sexual affairs with two female supporters, Naty Revuelta and Maria Laborde, each conceiving him a child. Setting about strengthening the MR-26-7, he established an 11-person National Directorate but retained autocratic control, with some dissenters labeling him a caudillo (dictator); he argued that a successful revolution could not be run by committee and required a strong leader.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E
5|$|The Whiskers' new {{neighbours}} {{were the}} Zappa and the Starsky. Although {{smaller than the}} Whiskers, the Zappa attacked frequently, and when they fled after one attack, the Whiskers – in a rare occurrence – adopted an abandoned Zappa pup. The Starsky group, on the other hand, was <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to the Whiskers. Formed by a trio of Flower's daughters permanently evicted from the Whiskers, the small group was ravaged by illness, predators, {{and a lack of}} new pups. The constantly struggling Starsky succumbed in the penultimate episode, with the death of the last survivor, Mozart, who was killed by a jackal. Former Whiskers female Maybelline broke away from the group {{at the end of the}} third series, forming a new group called the Aztecs which became the Whiskers' rivals in the fourth series.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operational}} {{deployment of}} RAAF Hornets {{took place in}} 2001. Following the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Australian Government agreed to deploy F/A-18s to protect the major USAF air base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, which was being used to mount operations in Afghanistan. Four No.77 Squadron Hornets and 70 personnel departed for the island on 9 November. No.3 Squadron pilots and ground crew relieved the No.77 Squadron personnel in early February 2002. RAAF Hornets were not assigned to the War in Afghanistan as {{at the time they}} were less capable than other available coalition aircraft. While the F/A-18s were occasionally scrambled in response to reports of aircraft near the base, <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> developed. The detachment returned to Australia on 21 May 2002.|$|E

5|$|This species {{lives in}} many habitats, {{including}} deserts, forests, woodland and urban areas. They nest underground below logs, stones, twigs, and shrubs, or in decayed wooden stumps, and are sometimes found living in termite mounds. They {{are among the}} first insects {{to be found in}} burnt-off areas after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain presents <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to colonies {{as long as it is}} a light shower in continuous sunshine. The green-head ant is diurnal, active throughout the day, preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as honeydew from sap-sucking insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal, scattering and consuming seeds from a variety of species. Predators include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and a number of bird species.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} <b>no</b> <b>threat</b> to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall {{to parts of}} Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would remain high for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the alert level to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be cautious about venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E
5|$|In {{his role}} as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, Cunningham had to {{negotiate}} with the French Admiral Rene-Emile Godfroy for the demilitarisation and internment of a French squadron at Alexandria, in June 1940, following the Fall of France. Churchill had ordered Cunningham to prevent the French warships from leaving port, and to ensure that French warships did not pass into enemy hands. Stationed at the time at Alexandria, Cunningham entered into delicate negotiations with Godfroy to ensure his fleet, which consisted of the battleship Lorraine, four cruisers, three destroyers and a submarine, posed <b>no</b> <b>threat.</b> The Admiralty ordered Cunningham to complete the negotiations on 3 July. Just as an agreement seemed imminent Godfroy heard of the British action against the French at Mers el Kebir and, for a while, Cunningham feared a battle between French and British warships in the confines of Alexandria harbour. The deadline was overrun but negotiations ended well, after Cunningham put them on a more personal level and had the British ships appeal to their French opposite numbers. Cunningham's negotiations succeeded and the French emptied their fuel bunkers and removed the firing mechanisms from their guns. Cunningham in turn promised to repatriate the ships' crews.|$|E
