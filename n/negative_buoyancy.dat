40|$|The {{effects of}} {{opposing}} buoyancies on natural convection heat and mass transfer in the boundary layer over a vertical&# 13; cylinder {{immersed in a}} quiescent Newtonian fluid are presented in this paper. The surface of the cylinder is&# 13; maintained at a constant temperature and concentration. The homotopic transformation is proposed to transform the&# 13; physical domain into a flat plate. The boundary layer equations and the boundary conditions are solved numerically&# 13; using an implicit finite difference scheme and the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. The buoyancy ratio N, Prandtl number Pr&# 13; and Schmidt number Sc are important parameters for this problem. The numerical results for Pr=Sc and Pr≠ Sc,&# 13; including the velocity, temperature, concentration fields and the Nusselt number {{as well as the}} Sherwood number&# 13; along the surface of the cylinder are discussed for aiding and opposing buoyancies. Results show that the Nusselt&# 13; (Sherwood) number increases with positive or <b>negative</b> <b>buoyancies</b> ration N (N=Grc/Grt). Moreover, for opposing&# 13; flows with Sc<Pr, the flow is completely downward, the thickness of the concentration layer is larger than that of the&# 13; thermal layer.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} is used {{to document}} the statistical structure and better understand energy transfers in a low-Reynolds-number turbulent flow generated by <b>negative</b> axial <b>buoyancy</b> in a long circular tilted pipe under the Boussinesq approximation. The flow is found to exhibit specific features which strikingly contrast with the familiar characteristics of pressure-driven pipe and channel flows. The mean flow, dominated by an axial component exhibiting a uniform shear in the core, also comprises a weak secondary component made of four counter-rotating cells filling the entire cross-section. Within the cross-section, variations of the axial and transverse velocity fluctuations are markedly different, the former reaching its maximum {{at the edge of}} the core while the latter two decrease monotonically from the axis to the wall. The <b>negative</b> axial <b>buoyancy</b> component generates long plumes travelling along the pipe, yielding unusually large longitudinal integral length scales. The axial and crosswise mean density variations are shown to be respectively responsible for a quadratic variation of the crosswise shear stress and density flux which both decrease from a maximum on the pipe axis to near-zero values throughout the near-wall region. Although the crosswise buoyancy component is stabilizing everywhere, the crosswise density flux is negative in some peripheral regions, which corresponds to apparent counter-gradient diffusion. Budgets of velocity and density fluctuations variances and of crosswise shear stress and density flux are analysed to explain the above features. A novel two-time algebraic model of the turbulent fluxes is introduced to determine all components of the diffusivity tensor, revealing that they are significantly influenced by axial and crosswise buoyancy effects. The eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity concepts and the Reynolds analogy are found to work reasonably well within the central part of the section whereas non-local effects cannot be ignored elsewhere...|$|R

As the less depleted mantle with less positive compositional buoyancy is added, the <b>negative</b> thermal <b>buoyancy</b> of the layer eventually exceeds its positive compositional buoyancy. The depleted layer then sinks into and mixes with the convecting interior.

In the air-sea moisture flux, for example, small-scale precipitation structures could be caused by unresolved clouds and small-scale evaporation structures could be caused by unresolved turbulence in the surface wind field. In an attempt to capture the climatic impacts of such st ructures, coupled GCM experiments are performed in which the air-sea fluxes are stochastically perturbed. Stochastic approaches are used increasingly widely by climate modellers (e. g. Palmer and Williams, 2008). The stochasticity impacts significantly upon the simulated mean climate, especially in the tropics.

40|$|Cratons are {{underlain}} by thick, cold, {{and highly}} melt-depleted mantle roots, the latter imposing a chemical buoyancy that roughly offsets the craton’s <b>negative</b> thermal <b>buoyancy</b> associated with its cooler thermal state. Petrologic/geochemical predictions of three endmember scenarios for {{the origin of}} cratonic mantle are discussed: (1) high-degree melting in a very hot plume head with a potential temperature> 1650 °C, (2) accretion of oceanic lithosphere, and (3) accretion of arc lithosphere. The hot plume scenario predicts that cratonic peridotites were formed by high degrees of melting at very high pressures (≥ 7 GPa), whereas the two accretion scenarios predict an origin by melting on average at lower pressures (<~ 4 GPa) followed by subsequent transport of these residual peridotites to the greater depths (3 – 7 GPa) from which they presently derive. Major-element and mildly incompatible trace-element compositions of cratonic peridotite xenoliths suggest a low pressure origin, favoring the two accretion scenarios.

40|$|In this paper, a {{numerical}} investigation is performed {{to study the}} mixed convective flow and heat transfer characteristics past a square cylinder in cross flow at incidence. Utilizing air (Pr = 0. 71) as an operating fluid, computations are carried out at a representative Reynolds number (Re) of 100. Angles of incidences are varied as, 0 degrees <= alpha <= 45 degrees. Effect of superimposed positive and <b>negative</b> cross-flow <b>buoyancy</b> is brought about by varying the Richardson number (RI) in the range - 1. 0 <= Ri <= 1. 0. The detail features of flow topology and heat transport are analyzed critically for different angles of incidences. The thermo fluidic forces acting on the cylinder during mixed convection are captured {{in terms of the}} drag (C-D), lift (C-L), and moment (C-M) coefficients. The results show that the lateral width of the cylinder wake reduces with increasing alpha and the isotherms spread out far wide. In the range 0 degrees < alpha < 45 degrees, C-D reduces with increasing Ri. The functional dependence of C-M with Ri reveals a linear relationship. Thermal boundary layer thickness reduces with increasing angle of incidences. The global rate of heat transfer from the cylinder increases with increasing alpha. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark's body. However, bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance; these are the rectal gland, kidneys, liver, and gills. All elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater.

40|$|International audienceMelting {{processes}} in the deep mantle {{have important implications for}} the origin of the deep-derived plumes believed to feed hotspot volcanoes such as those in Hawaii(1). They also provide insight into how the mantle has evolved, geochemically and dynamically, since the formation of Earth(2). Melt production in the shallow mantle is quite well understood, but deeper melting near the core-mantle boundary remains controversial. Modelling the dynamic behaviour of deep, partially molten mantle requires knowledge of the density contrast between solid and melt fractions. Although both positive and <b>negative</b> melt <b>buoyancies</b> can produce major chemical segregation between different geochemical reservoirs, each type of buoyancy yields drastically different geodynamical models. Ascent or descent of liquids in a partially molten deep mantle should contribute to surface volcanism or production of a deep magma ocean, respectively. We investigated phase relations in a partially molten chondritic-type material under deep-mantle conditions. Here we show that the iron partition coefficient between aluminium-bearing (Mg,Fe) SiO 3 perovskite and liquid is between 0. 45 and 0. 6, so iron is not as incompatible with deep-mantle minerals as has been reported previously(3). Calculated solid and melt density contrasts suggest that melt generated at the core-mantle boundary should be buoyant, and hence should segregate upwards. In the framework of the magma oceans induced by large meteoritic impacts on early Earth, our results imply that the magma crystallization should push the liquids towards the surface and form a deep solid residue depleted in incompatible elements...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{forces are}} {{involved}} in the process of slab rollback. Two forces acting against each other at the interface of the two subducting plates exert forces against one another. The subducting plate exerts a bending force (FPB) that supplies pressure during subduction, while the overriding plate exerts a force against the subducting plate (FTS). The slab pull force (FSP) is caused by the <b>negative</b> <b>buoyancy</b> of the plate driving the plate to greater depths. The resisisting force from the surrounding mantle opposes the slab pull forces. Interactions with the 660-km discontinuity cause a deflection due to the buoyancy at the phase transition (F660). [...] The unique interplay of these forces is what generates slab rollback. When the deep slab section obstructs the down-going motion of the shallow slab section, slab rollback occurs. The subducting slab undergoes backward sinking due to the <b>negative</b> <b>buoyancy</b> forces causing a retrogradation of the trench hinge along the surface. Upwelling of the mantle around the slab can create favorable conditions for the formation of a back-arc basin.|$|E
40|$|Primary-cementing {{displacement}} flows {{occur in}} long narrow eccentric annuli during {{the construction of}} oil and gas wells. A common problem is that the displacing fluid fingers up the upper wide side of the annulus, leaving behind a “mud channel” of displaced fluid on the lower narrow side of the annulus. Tehrani et al. report that the interface between displacing fluid and mud channel can in certain circumstances become unstable, and a similar phenomenon has been observed in our ongoing experiments. Here an explanation for these instabilities is provided via analysis of the stability of two-layer eccentric annular Hele-Shaw flows, using a transient version of the usual Hele-Shaw approach, in which fluid acceleration terms are retained. Two Newtonian fluids are considered, as a simplification of the general case in which the fluids are shear-thinning yield-stress fluids. It is shown that <b>negative</b> azimuthal <b>buoyancy</b> gradients are in general stabilizing in inclined wells, but that buoyancy may also have a destabilizing effect via axial buoyancy forces that influence the base-flow interfacial velocity. In a variety of special cases where buoyancy is not dominant, it is found that instability is suppressed by a positive product of interfacial velocity difference and reduced Reynolds-number difference between fluids. Even a small positive azimuthal buoyancy gradient, (heavy fluid over light fluid), can be stabilized in this way. Eccentricity of the annulus seems to amplify the effect of buoyancy on stability or instability, e. g. stably stratified fluid layers become more stable as the eccentricity is increased. ...|$|R

We fitted 12 northern bottlenose whales with data loggers that recorded depth, 3 -axis acceleration and speed either with a fly-wheel or from change of depth corrected by pitch angle. We fitted measured values of the change in speed during 5 s descent and ascent glides to a hydrodynamic model of drag and buoyancy forces using a Bayesian estimation framework. The resulting estimate of diving gas volume was 27. 4 ± 4. 2 (95 % credible interval, CI) ml kg− 1, closely matching the measured lung capacity of the species. Dive-by-dive variation in gas volume did not correlate with dive depth or duration. Estimated body densities of individuals ranged from 1028. 4 to 1033. 9 kg m− 3 at the sea surface, indicating overall <b>negative</b> tissue <b>buoyancy</b> of this species in seawater. Body density estimates were highly precise with ± 95 % CI ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 4 kg m− 3, which would equate to a precision of < 0. 5 % of lipid content based upon extrapolation from the elephant seal. Six whales tagged near Jan Mayen (Norway, 71 °N) had lower body density and were closer to neutral buoyancy than six whales tagged in the Gully (Nova Scotia, Canada, 44 °N), a difference that was consistent with the amount of gliding observed during ascent versus descent phases in these animals.

Such characteristic repose time represents the average time that magma takes to form a high-density pathway through the less dense rock layer, and it may give a hint to predict possible eruptive scenarios.
