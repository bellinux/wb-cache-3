5|$|As well as rugby sevens, {{baseball}} and softball, which were {{dropped from the}} Olympic programme in 2005, karate, squash, golf and roller sports (inline speed skating) were all seeking {{to be included in}} the 2016 games and leaders of the seven sports made formal presentations to the IOC executive board in June 2009. A new system was in place at this session in which a sport now <b>needs</b> <b>only</b> a simple majority rather than the two-thirds majority that was required before.|$|E
5|$|Only two {{or three}} frets are needed for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each major and minor chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each <b>needs</b> <b>only</b> two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed {{at the end of}} this section.|$|E
5|$|Bluto and D-Day {{steal the}} answers to an {{upcoming}} test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he <b>needs</b> <b>only</b> one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a girl he met at the supermarket. They make out, but do not have sex because she passes out drunk. Pinto takes her home in a shopping cart and later discovers {{that she is the}} mayor's daughter.|$|E

25|$|Although Maslow's {{theory is}} widely known, in the {{workplace}} it {{has proven to be}} a poor predictor of employee behavior. Maslow theorized that people will not seek to satisfy a higher level need until their lower level needs are met.

25|$|In placental mammals, {{fertilization}} typically occurs {{inside the}} female in the oviducts. The oviducts are positioned near the ovaries where ova are produced. An ovum therefore <b>needs</b> <b>only</b> to travel {{a short distance}} to the oviducts for fertilization. In contrast sperm cells must be highly motile, since they are deposited into the female reproductive tract during sexual intercourse and must travel through the cervix (in some species) {{as well as the}} uterus and the oviduct (in all species) to reach an ovum. Sperm cells that are motile are spermatozoa.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} some areas where {{there is not a}} {{sufficient}} amount of solar radiation to justify using solar power. A common alternative or supplement is using wind turbines. To generate power, the average autonomous house <b>needs</b> <b>only</b> one small wind generator, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.|$|E
25|$|A game point {{occurs in}} tennis {{whenever}} {{the player who}} is in the lead in the game <b>needs</b> <b>only</b> one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.|$|E

One <b>needs</b> <b>only</b> to compare the maxim לעולם (v. 2) with Sanh. 23a and Mek. Mishpaṭim 20 to see that the compiler had the Talmud before him. The next maxim is a combination of Er. 65b and Ab. R. N., ed. כל המתנבל S. Schechter, xxxii. 68. Ab. R. N. viii., (ed. Schechter, xxii. 46), Midr. Mishle ix. 9. Pesiḳ. viii., כל זמן (ed. S. Buber, 44b), and probably Derek Ereẓ Rabbah were also used.|$|E
25|$|Demand {{breathing}} systems {{reduce the}} amount of gas required to adequately ventilate the diver, as it <b>needs</b> <b>only</b> to be supplied when the diver inhales, but the slightly increased work of breathing caused by this system is a disadvantage at extreme levels of exertion, where free-flow systems may be better. The demand system is also quieter than free-flow, particularly during the non-inhalation phase of breathing. This can make voice communication more effective. The breathing of the diver is also audible to the surface team over the communications system, and this helps to monitor the condition of the diver and is a valuable safety feature.|$|E

From their examples we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E
