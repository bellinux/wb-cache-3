The runs test of exchangeability counts the runs among the observations and their mirror images on the minimal spanning tree. The nearest <b>neighbour</b> <b>test</b> of exchangeability is {{based on the number of}} nearest neighbour type coincidences among the observations and their folded images on the plane. The rank test of exchangeability compares the within and between ranks of the interpoint distances. We also consider the sign test of exchangeability, which uses the signs of the observations in specific regions, and a bootstrap test of exchangeability based on the maximum distance between the mirror images. We compare the power of these methods in a Monte Carlo study which shows different power orderings of the methods, depending on the alternative hypothesis. Copyright (c) 2008 The Author.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the problem of learning rich implicit models - those from which we can sample, but can not evaluate their density. These models apply some parametric function, such as a deep network, to a base measure, and are learned end-to-end using stochastic optimization. One strategy of devising a loss function is through the statistics of two sample tests - if we can fool a statistical test, the learned distribution should be a good model of the true data. However, not all tests can easily fit into this framework, as they might not be differentiable with respect to the data points, and hence with respect to the parameters of the implicit model. Motivated by this problem, in this paper we show how two such classical tests, the Friedman-Rafsky and k-nearest <b>neighbour</b> <b>tests,</b> can be effectively smoothed using ideas from undirected graphical models - the matrix tree theorem and cardinality potentials. Moreover, as we show experimentally, smoothing can significantly increase the power of the test, which might of of independent interest. Finally, we apply our method to learn implicit models...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{automatic}} classification techniques {{has been suggested}} {{as a means of}} increasing the effectiveness of docu-ment retrieval systems; however, the automatic generation of a classification requires a large amount of computation, and it is thus of importance to know whether this computation will result in material increases in retrieval performance. This paper describes three methods- the overlap test, the nearest <b>neighbour</b> <b>test</b> and the density test- which can be used to measure the degree of clustering tendency in a set of docu-ments. It is shown that the three tests are not in complete agreement with each other in their evaluation of the degree of clustering tendency present in seven document test collections. A comparison of the predicted degree of clustering tendency with the relative effectiveness of cluster and non-cluster searches suggests that the density test gives the most useful results; it also has the advantage that it does not require query and relevance data and can thus be used in a predictive manner when a document collection is to be processed for the first time. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Motivation: Most of {{existing}} methods for genetic sequence classification {{are based on}} a computer search for homologies in nucleotide or amino acid sequences. The standard sequence alignment programs scale very poorly as the number of the sequences increases or the degree of sequence identity is less then 30 %. Some new computationally inexpensive methods based on nucleotide or amino acid compositional analysis have been proposed, but prediction results are still unsatisfactory and depend on the features chosen to represent the sequences. Results: In this paper a feature selection method based on the Gamma (or near <b>neighbour)</b> <b>test</b> is proposed. If there is a continuous or smooth map from feature space to the classification target values the Gamma test gives an estimate for the mean-squared error of the classification, despite the fact that one has no a priori knowledge of the smooth mapping. We can search a large space of possible feature combinations for a combination which gives a smallest estimated mean-squared error using a genetic algorithm. The method was used for feature selection and classification of the large subunits of ribosomal RNA according to RDP (Ribosomal Database Project) phylogenetic classes. The sequences were represented by dinucleotide frequency distribution. The nearest-neighbour criterion has been used to estimate the predictive accuracy of the classification based on the selected features. For examples discussed we found that the classification according to the first nearest neighbour is correct for 80...|$|E

40|$|Aims: In {{order to}} {{understand}} the genetic diversity of Acacia tortilis ssp. raddiana-rhizobia in Tunisia, isolates from nine geographical locations were obtained and analysed. Methods and Results: Characterization using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA gene and the intergenic spacer (IGS) between the 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes was undertaken. Symbiotic efficiency of the strains was also estimated. Analysis of the 16 S rRNA by PCR-RFLP showed that the isolates were phylogenetically related to Ensifer ssp., Rhizobium tropicii-IIA, and Rhizobium tumefaciens species. Analysis of 16 S- 23 S spacer by PCR-RFLP showed a high diversity of these rhizobia and revealed eleven additional groups, which indicates that these strains are genetically very diverse. Full 16 S rRNA gene-sequencing showed that the majority of strains form a new subdivion inside the genera Ensifer, with Ensifer meliloti being its nearest <b>neighbour.</b> Nodulation <b>test</b> performed on the plant host demonstrated differences in the infectivity among the strains. Conclusion: Rhizobial populations that nodulate specifically and efficiently Acacia tortilis ssp. raddiana in representative soils of Tunisia is dominated by E. meliloti-like genomospecies.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{three-dimensional}} Kasteleyn transition in both nearest neighbours and dipolar spin ice models using an algorithm that conserves {{the number of}} excitations. We first limit the interactions range to nearest <b>neighbours</b> to <b>test</b> the method {{in the presence of}} a field applied along [100], and then focus on the dipolar spin ice model. The effect of dipolar interactions, which is known to be greatly self screened at zero field, is particularly strong near full polarization. It shifts the Kasteleyn transition to lower temperatures, which decreases ≈ 0. 4 K for the parameters corresponding to the best known spin ice materials, Dy_ 2 Ti_ 2 O_ 7 and Ho_ 2 Ti_ 2 O_ 7. This shift implies effective dipolar fields as big as 0. 05 tesla opposing the applied field, and thus favoring the creation of "strings" of reversed spins. We compare the reduction in the transition temperature with results in previous experiments, and study the phenomenon quantitatively using a simple molecular field approach. Finally, we relate the presence of the effective residual field to the appearance of string-ordered phases at low fields and temperatures, and we check numerically that for fields applied along [100] there are only three different stable phases at zero temperature.

No study has addressed the possibility of kin-selected cooperation in nest defence in this species. Reciprocal altruism, kin selection and by-product mutualism are not mutually exclusive alternatives, but few studies of territorial <b>neighbours</b> have <b>tested</b> for multiple mechanisms simultaneously. We test for these three possibilities in a population of red-winged blackbirds. We used simulated defections to test for reciprocal altruism. We used analysis of microsatellite loci to test for kin selection between adult male neighbours. We also used microsatellite loci to test for by-product mutualism resulting from nest defence of offspring sired on neighbouring territories. We found that male red-winged blackbirds cooperate in nest defence primarily as a form of reciprocal altruism. Experimental males reduced their level of nest defence relative to controls following simulated defection by a neighbour. In contrast to some earlier studies, we found no evidence for by-product mutualism: males did not defend nests where they had sired extra-pair offspring. We also found no evidence for kin selection: males were no more cooperative with more closely related neighbours. Considered alongside the results from other studies, our study suggests that mechanisms stabilizing cooperation in red-winged blackbirds may vary among populations...|$|R

The model is able to predict correctly the frequency dependence of the coupling between adjacent strips. Furthermore, we have used such model for the study of the signal propagation along the detector when a current signal is injected in a strip. Only electrical coupling is considered here, without any contribution due to charge sharing derived from carrier diffusion. For this purpose, the AC pads of the strips have been connected to a read-out electronics and the current signal has been injected into a DC pad. Good agreement between measurements and simulations has been reached for the central strip and the first <b>neighbours.</b> Experimental <b>tests</b> and computer simulations have been performed for four different strip and field plate layouts, in order to investigate how the detector geometry affects the parameters of the SPICE model and the signal propagation.

Firstly I tested the novelty and the reinforcement hypotheses in isolated voles, predicting respectively a habituation or a continuous increase in mark deposition.

After the addition of a neighbour, only the females left more marks in the corridor that ran alongside the common border than in the two other corridors. The territorial-defence hypothesis was thus confirmed in (territorial) females while the self-advertisement was supported in (non-territorial) males. Finally, I tested the competitive-ability hypothesis in females, stating that the abundance of scent marks of an individual before a social interaction can predict its degree of intolerance in a future social interaction.

Following the injection of [3 H]GABA into different laminae of striate cortex in two untreated animals and in one animal treated with amino-oxyacetic acid, selective accumulation of the labelled amino acid was demonstrated in perikarya by autoradiography. Radiographically labelled neurons (n, 519) and their unlabelled <b>neighbours</b> were <b>tested</b> in consecutive 0. 5 micron thick sections by immunocytochemistry for GABA immunoreactivity. Injection of [3 H]GABA did not increase the number of neurons showing GABA immunoreactivity. On the contrary many of the cells that accumulated [3 H]GABA were immunonegative. These neurons were mostly located in layers IVC and VA following [3 H]GABA injection into layers II-III, and in layers upper III and II following injection into layers V and VI. A comparison of the position of these neurons with known local projection patterns in the striate cortex of monkey suggests that GABA-immunonegative neurons may nevertheless become labelled by [3 H]GABA if most of their local axon terminals fall within the injection site. The interlaminar projection of GABA-immunopositive neurons, which probably contain endogenous GABA, could be deduced from the position of the [3 H]GABA injection site that leads to their autoradiographic labelling. Although the present study confirmed our previous results on the interlaminar connections of neurons that accumulate [3 H]GABA, it demonstrated that [3 H]GABA labelling alone may not be a sufficient criterion to assess the GABAergic nature of neurons in the striate cortex of monkey...|$|R

Aggregation without considering variation in individual profile shapes easily leads to aggregation bias, while classification based on exogenous criteria {{runs the risk of}} loosing important information on behavioural (co-) variation. In this paper we test how three pattern recognition techniques (cluster analysis, supervised learning and dimension reduction) can be applied to automatically classify the shapes of speed profiles of individual vehicles into interpretable types, with a minimum of a priori assumptions. The data for the tests is obtained from an automated video analysis system and the results of automated classification are compared to the classification by a human observer done from the video. Normalisation of the speed profiles to a constant number of data points with the same spatial reference allows them to be treated as multidimensional vectors. The k-means clustering algorithm groups the vectors (profiles) based on their proximity in multidimensional space. The results are satisfactory, but still the least successful among the tested techniques. Supervised learning (nearest <b>neighbour</b> algorithm <b>tested)</b> uses a training dataset produced beforehand to assign a profile to a specific group. Manual selection of the profiles for the training dataset allows better control of the output results and the classification results are the most successful in the tests. Dimension reduction techniques decrease the amount of data representing each profile by extracting the most typical “features”, which allows for better data visualisation and simplifies the classification procedures afterwards. The singular value decomposition (SVD) used in the test performs quite satisfactorily. The general conclusion is that pattern recognition techniques perform well in automated classification of speed profiles compared to classification by a human observer.

Human gait, however, possesses {{a high degree of}} variability across individuals, and is subject to numerous nuisance factors. Therefore, off-the-shelf Machine Learning techniques may fail to classify it with the accuracy required in clinical trials. In this paper we propose a novel framework in which IMU gait measurement sequences sampled during a 10 metre walk are first encoded as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to extract their dynamics and provide a fixed-length representation. Given sufficient training samples, the distance between HMMs which optimises classification performance is learned and employed in a classical Nearest <b>Neighbour</b> classifier. Our <b>tests</b> demonstrate how this technique achieves accuracy of 85. 51 % over a 156 people with Parkinson’s with a representative range of severity and 424 typically developed adults, which is the top performance achieved so far over a cohort of such size, based on single measurement outcomes. The method displays the potential for further improvement and a wider application to distinguish other conditions...|$|R
40|$|In four {{experiments}} {{we investigated}} {{the formation of}} novel word memories across modalities, using competition between novel words and their existing phonological/orthographic <b>neighbours</b> as a <b>test</b> of lexical integration. Auditorily acquired novel words entered into competition both in the spoken modality (Experiment 1) and in the written modality (Experiment 4) after a consolidation period of 24 h. Words acquired from print, on the other hand, showed competition effects after 24 h in a visual word recognition task (Experiment 3) but required additional training and a consolidation period of a week before entering into spoken-word competition (Experiment 2). These cross-modal effects {{support the hypothesis that}} lexicalised rather than episodic representations underlie post-consolidation competition effects. We suggest that sublexical phoneme-grapheme conversion during novel word encoding and/or offline consolidation enables the formation of modality-specific lexemes in the untrained modality, which subsequently undergo the same cortical integration process as explicitly perceived word forms in the trained modality. Although conversion takes place in both directions, speech input showed an advantage over print both in terms of lexicalisation and explicit memory performance. In conclusion, the brain is able to integrate and consolidate internally generated lexical information as well as external perceptual input...|$|R

The considered methods refer to clustering and classification techniques. In particular, the investigated clustering techniques are Self-Organizing Maps and K-means, while classification techniques are Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Support Vector Machines, and k- Nearest <b>Neighbours.</b> Training and <b>testing</b> data have been collected selecting suitable diagnostic signals recorded during four years of EFDA-JET experiments. Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks exhibit the best performance in classifying four classes of plasma disruptions. Moreover, Multiple Classifiers significantly improve the robustness and reliability of the system. The tool is presently implemented at JET. 1...|$|R
