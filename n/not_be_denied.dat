5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into {{the myth of the}} clean Wehrmacht.|$|E

50|$|In late 2015, aerial {{photography}} and drone manufacturer DJI acquired minority interest in Hasselblad. In early January 2017, some reports, citing reliable sources, indicated that DJI had since acquired majority interest. These reports have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> verified by either company to date but have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Enckell was homosexual, as seems {{indicated}} in some erotic portraits which were quite uninhibited for their time. As Routledge's Who’s who in {{gay and lesbian}} history puts it, [...] "His love affairs with men have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> ... Enckell's naked men and boys are openly erotic and sensual.".|$|R
5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was another area that was {{expanded}} by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|This wall is {{visited by}} all our {{brothers}} on every feast and festival; {{and the large}} space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as {{we have a very}} old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} attack {{developed}} on the 27th, the South Vietnamese General Assembly {{handed over the}} presidency to General Dương Văn Minh, who was sworn in the following day. It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history of aggressive action against the communists, {{would be able to}} establish a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time since}} the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any political changes in Saigon. They would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> victory, the only thing for which they had striven for over 30 years. The hope that the communists would make the same mistake they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E

25|$|The LaGrand {{case was}} a legal action heard before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which {{concerned}} the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.

25|$|On May 15, 2008, at a {{time when}} only the Massachusetts Supreme Court had ruled favorably on {{same-sex}} marriage, the California Supreme Court ruled on the 2004 San Franciscan challenge with other cases in the watershed In re Marriage Cases. Applying strict scrutiny to the state's discrimination between heterosexual and other citizens, marriage was found to be a fundamental right that may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> based on sexual orientation, and the relevant laws were struck down.|$|E
25|$|Stringham {{opposed the}} plan to block the inlets from the beginning. He {{believed}} that the tidal currents would either sweep the impediments away or would rapidly scour new channels. As he saw it, the Rebels could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> access to the sounds unless the inlets were actually held by the Union. In other words, {{in order to establish}} an effective blockade in this part of North Carolina, the forts that the state had set up would have to be captured. Since the Navy could not do it alone, the cooperation of the Army would be needed.|$|E

25|$|With {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the War Office planned for CRUs to accept only Far East {{prisoners of war}} (FEPOWs), based on the {{assumption}} that the CRUs would not be able to manage the combined number of POWs from Europe and the Far East and that the FEPOWs were more in need of the service. Wilson and Rendel felt that European POWs should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> the opportunity to attend, and went to lengths to expand the programme where possible and make space for both groups. Rendel and Wilson were removed from heading the programme as a result. By the end of March 1947, more than 19,000 European POWs and 4,500 FEPOWs had attended a CRU.|$|E
25|$|Border {{guards are}} {{required}} to stamp the travel documents of third-country nationals when they cross external borders. However, nationals of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City are exempt from this requirement, as are heads of state, whose visits were announced through diplomatic channels, and holders of local border traffic permits and residence permits. Certain exemptions also apply to the crews of ships and aircraft. Third-country nationals who otherwise fulfil all the criteria for admission into the Schengen area must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> entry for the sole reason {{that there is no}} remaining empty space in their travel document to affix a stamp; instead, the stamp should be affixed on a separate sheet of paper.|$|E
25|$|The Court held 5–3 that {{citizenship}} {{should be}} allowed. The majority {{stated that the}} oath aliens {{are required to take}} to become citizens does not require them to bear arms in defense of the United States. The court also drew support from the War Powers Act of 1941, enacted by Congress in 1942, which relaxed naturalization requirements for aliens who served in the United States Armed Forces during World War II, including those who served in non-combatant roles. The court explained that serving in a combatant role {{is not the only way}} to uphold and defend the US Constitution and that Girouard should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> citizenship because of his religious pacifism.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} season, he again finished the season runners-up to first place Copenhagen by just one point. However, he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied</b> in the 2004–05 season, where he finally {{led the team}} to the Danish Superliga title. In the same season, he also completed The Double after he won his second Danish Cup in four seasons. This saw him being given his second Danish Manager of the Year award. After finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 Danish Superliga, Laudrup announced that he, along with assistant Faxe Jensen, could not {{come to an agreement}} for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. The pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left Brøndby in June 2006.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 Wimbledon Championships had Evert faced {{off against}} Billie Jean King in the semifinals, which saw Evert win {{the first set}} because of the fine groundstrokes she was hitting. King got a pivotal service break on the Evert serve {{in the first game}} of the second set, which proved decisive, which Evert showed her poise by {{breaking}} back in the fourth game, but this was not enough to get it done against the tenacious King, who broke back in the fifth and seventh service games. During the last set Evert was a cruising up three games and had a 40 to 15 point lead in the set, but King would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied,</b> which Evert never once again won a game in the match and lost it in 62, 26, 36.|$|E
25|$|Jourdan, Carnot and Representative Ernest Dominique François Joseph Duquesnoy {{accompanied}} Balland's {{division in}} the center. The army commander planned {{to wait for the}} attacks of his two wings to make significant progress before launching the attack of Balland's division. In mid-morning, the division filed out of the woods in front of Dourlers and opened fire with its artillery. Seeing the initial success of the two wings, Carnot wanted the attack to be started at once. Jourdan wanted more ground to be gained on the flanks but the politician would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>denied.</b> Finally, Jourdan put himself at the head of Balland's division and ordered the assault. As the French soldiers came over the crest of the ridge in front on the sunken road, they came under murderous fire from the crack Austrian grenadiers. Despite heroic attempts to get light artillery forward, cannons were dismounted and gunners and horses were shot down. In the thick of the bullets, Jourdan bravely urged his troops on but an Austrian force appeared from the direction of Saint-Aubin, threatening the French left flank. At nightfall the representatives authorized a retreat after Balland's division had lost between 1,200 and 1,500 casualties.|$|E

500|$|Until {{at least}} the 1970s, {{membership}} was restricted to white men of [...] "sound mind and body, in good standing in the community, engaged in lawful business {{who are able to}} speak and write the English language".

30|$|This argumentation {{not only}} {{reflects}} the symbolic distance {{that was part}} of the overall framing of Muslim chaplaincy, considering Muslim ‘assistants’ as not yet equal to Christian chaplains, but also demonstrates that the administration has drawn on this distancing in order to give greater prevalence to the security mission of the prison. Even though the religious dimension of Muslim spiritual care has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied,</b> the institutional balance seems to have shifted towards a greater emphasis on the security (and rehabilitation) dimension of the chaplain’s function.|$|R
