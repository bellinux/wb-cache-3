50|$|On 8 September 1969, {{banknotes}} of 50 cents (5 shillings), $1 (10 shillings), $2 (£1), and $10 (£5) were introduced. The $5 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> introduced on 20 October 1970, {{followed by}} the $20 in June 1976, when the 50 cent <b>note</b> <b>was</b> replaced by a coin. $100 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> added on 2 December 1986, followed by $50 notes on 27 July 1988. The $2 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> dropped in 1994, whilst the $1 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> replaced by a coin in 1990. In 1994, coins replaced the $5 notes and $500 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced. In 1999, $10 coins replaced notes, whilst, in 2000, $20 coins replaced the notes and $1000 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced.|$|R
50|$|In 1877, Norges Bank {{introduced}} {{notes for}} 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 kroner. In 1917, 1-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued, and 2-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued between 1918 and 1922. Because of metal shortages, 1- and 2-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> again issued between 1940 and 1950. In 1963, 5-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> replaced by coins, {{with the same}} happening to the 10-krone notes in 1984. 200-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The Bank of Abyssinia {{introduced}} banknotes for 5, 10, 100 and 500 talari in 1915. 280,000 talari {{worth of}} <b>notes</b> <b>was</b> printed. The {{text on the}} <b>notes</b> <b>was</b> in Amharic and French. A 50-talari <b>note</b> <b>was</b> added in 1929, by which time over 1.5 million talari in <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> circulating.|$|R
5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} the Western Wall differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall, and the Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts. More than a million prayer <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> {{placed in the}} Western Wall each year.|$|E
5|$|Carl Arend Friedrich Wiegmann (1893, 1898) {{discussed}} {{portions of}} the anatomy of A. adamsii, A. porcellanus, A. contrarius, and A. sinistralis. Walter Edward Collinge (1901, 1902) briefly noted features of A. palaceus and A. parakensis (reported as A. perversus). Haniel (1921) dissected A. contrarius and A. reflexilabris, and Bernhard Rensch published a few scattered notes in his various faunistic surveys. A few earlier <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> mentioned in Pilsbry (1900).|$|E
5|$|Hell money: Hell {{money is}} a form of joss paper printed to {{resemble}} fake legal tender bank notes. The <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> not an official form of recognized currency or legal tender since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors financial problems. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, {{during the}} German occupation, <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} in denominations of 6 pence, 1 shilling 3 pence, 2 shillings 6 pence and 5 shillings. The {{first to be}} issued were the 5 shilling and 2/6 <b>notes.</b> They <b>were</b> printed on States of Guernsey watermarked paper; {{the height of the}} <b>notes</b> <b>was</b> 2⅜ inches; the length of the 2/6 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> 3⅝ inches and that of the 5/- <b>note</b> <b>was</b> 2¾ inches. The 5/- <b>note</b> <b>was</b> printed in black and red with the Seal of the Bailiwick in red on the reverse. The 2/6 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> printed in light blue with the denomination in orange and the Seal of the Bailiwick in royal blue on the reverse. [...] From 1942, the 1 shilling 3 pence <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> overprinted to produce 1 shilling notes. In 1945, following liberation, 5 pound <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced and production of all denominations below 10 shillings ended.|$|R
50|$|<b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> {{issued in}} {{denominations}} of 1 rupee by the Indian government and 5, 10 and 100 rupees by the Reserve Bank of India. The <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> in designs {{very similar to}} the standard Indian <b>notes</b> but <b>were</b> printed in different colours. While the 1 rupee and 10 rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> printed in red, the 5 rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> printed in orange and the 100 rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> printed in green. The serial numbers of the banknotes issued in all denominations were prefixed by a Z.|$|R
2500|$|... 1862: The first $100 United States <b>Note</b> <b>was</b> issued. Variations of this <b>note</b> <b>were</b> issued that {{resulted}} in slightly different wording (obligations) on the reverse; the <b>note</b> <b>was</b> issued again in Series of 1863.|$|R
5|$|It is a centuries-old custom for Jews {{to place}} kvitelach {{containing}} personal prayers to God between {{the stones of}} the Western Wall in Jerusalem. This practice has been also adopted by Christian pilgrims and foreign dignitaries as well. More than a million prayer <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> placed in the Western Wall each year.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} the highest-value {{banknote}} in {{the world}} in terms of absolute value (approx. US$7,700) that is in public circulation. Even though larger denominations being withdrawn around the world, the MAS has retained the use of the $10,000 denomination. MAS discontinued issuing new $10,000 banknotes from 1 October 2014 as authorities suspect these <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> meant for illegal purposes.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{strength}} {{was to create}} a set of corresponding notes that allow readers to identify the meaning behind many of Shakespeare's more complicated passages or ones that may have been transcribed incorrectly over time.

2500|$|The Bank {{has issued}} {{banknotes}} since 1694. <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> originally hand-written; {{although they were}} partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> [...] "White Notes", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> issued in £1 and £2 denominations. During the 20th century White <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> issued in denominations between £5 and £1000.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, {{banknotes}} dated 1964 {{were introduced}} in denominations of 50 tambala, 1, 2 and 10 kwacha. 5 kwacha <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced in 1973 when the 2 kwacha <b>note</b> <b>was</b> discontinued. 20 kwacha <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced in 1983. 50 tambala <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> last issued in 1986, with the last 1 kwacha notes printed in 1992. In 1993, 50 kwacha <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced, followed by 100 kwacha in 1993, 200 kwacha in 1995, 500 kwacha in 2001 and 2000 kwacha in November 2016 to ease desperate cash shortages.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Gibraltar was forced to issue banknotes to prevent paying out sterling or gold. These <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued under emergency wartime legislation, Ordinance 10 of 1914. At first the typeset <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> signed by hand by Treasurer Greenwood, though he later used stamps. The notes bore the embossed stamp of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank Ltd. and circulated alongside British Territory notes. The 1914 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued in denominations of 2 and 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 50 pounds. The 2 shilling and 50 pound <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> not continued when {{a new series of}} <b>notes</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1927. The 10 shilling <b>note</b> <b>was</b> replaced by the 50 pence coin during the process of decimalization. In 1975, 10 and 20 pound <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced, followed by 50 pounds in 1986. The 1 pound <b>note</b> <b>was</b> discontinued in 1988. In 1995, a new series of <b>notes</b> <b>was</b> introduced which, for the first time, bore the words [...] "pounds sterling" [...] rather than just [...] "pounds". The government of Gibraltar introduced a new series of banknotes beginning with the 10 and 50 pound sterling notes issued on July 8, 2010. On May 11, 2011, the 5, 20 and 100 pound sterling <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued.|$|R
5|$|Some of Kellogg's {{diary and}} notes survived the battle and these, {{along with his}} news accounts, {{are one of the}} primary {{historical}} sources for information on the days preceding the battle. His <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> now in the possession of the State Historical Society of North Dakota. His satchel, pencil, and eyeglasses are on display in the Newseum in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|The short {{instrumental}} introduction {{is based}} on a pedal point sustained for several measures, reminiscent of pedal points in funeral music by Schütz and Bach, in Mozart's Requiem in the same key of D minor, and in Reger's previous Latin Requiem. In a pattern similar to the beginning of A German Requiem, the bass <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> repeated, here on a low D (D1).|$|E
5|$|The {{taste of}} the red wine depends on the {{ripeness}} of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.|$|E
50|$|Musical {{terminology}} {{also uses}} inclusive counting of intervals between {{notes of the}} standard scale: going up one <b>note</b> <b>is</b> a second interval, going up two <b>notes</b> <b>is</b> a third interval, etc., and going up seven <b>notes</b> <b>is</b> an octave.|$|R
25|$|During the 1970s, 20 and 50 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced; {{denominations}} {{higher than}} 100 were demonetised in 1978. In 1987, the 500 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> introduced, {{followed by the}} 1,000 note in 2000 while 1 and 2 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> discontinued in 1995.|$|R
2500|$|In 1921, States <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> over-stamped {{with the}} word [...] "British" [...] to signify the island's {{conversion}} to a pound equal to sterling. From 1924, 10 shilling <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued without any reference to the franc. The 5 shilling <b>note</b> <b>was</b> discontinued.|$|R
5|$|There {{is a much}} publicised {{practice}} of placing slips of paper containing written prayers into the crevices of the Wall. The earliest account of this practice is attributed to Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar, (d. 1743). More than a million <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> placed each year {{and the opportunity to}} e-mail notes is offered by a number of organisations. It has become customary for visiting dignitaries to place notes too.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3tuning {{even when they are}} inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third.|$|E
25|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Treasury <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 afghanis. In 1936, 2, 20 and 100 afghani <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> added. The Bank of Afghanistan took over paper money production in 1939, issuing notes for 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 afghanis. The 2 and 5 afghani <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> replaced by coins in 1958. In 1993, 5000 and 10,000 afghani <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced.|$|R
50|$|The Bank of England £1 <b>note</b> <b>was</b> a {{banknote}} of {{the pound}} sterling. After the ten shilling <b>note</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn in 1970 {{it became the}} smallest denomination note issued by the Bank of England. The one pound <b>note</b> <b>was</b> issued by the Bank of England {{for the first time}} in 1797 and continued to be printed until 1984. The <b>note</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn in 1988 in favour of the one pound coin.|$|R
25|$|In 1978, 5,000-peseta <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced. The 100-peseta <b>note</b> <b>was</b> {{replaced}} by a coin in 1982, with 1,000-peseta notes introduced in 1983, 200 pesetas in 1984 and 10,000 pesetas in 1987. The 200- and 500-peseta <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{replaced by}} coins in 1986 and 1987.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park {{received}} invitations to perform at various rock concerts and tours, including Ozzfest, the Family Values Tour, KROQ-FM's Almost Acoustic Christmas, and the band's self-created tour, Projekt Revolution, which was headlined by Linkin Park and featured other bands such as Cypress Hill and Adema. During this time, Linkin Park reunited with their original bassist, Dave “Phoenix” Farrell. The band kept an online journal on their official website throughout their 2001 and 2002 touring regime, in which each band member made a respective notation. Although the <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> no longer on their website, they are available on fansites. Linkin Park played 324 shows in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Having exactly three pitch {{classes for}} its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds tuning repeats every note {{in a higher}} octave, because guitars have six strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this {{repetition}} simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> played with the same finger as the original notes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; <b>notes</b> <b>are</b> generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E

25|$|Regular {{government}} issues commenced in 1948 in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 100 rupees. The government {{continued to}} issue 1 rupee notes until the 1980s but other <b>note</b> issuing <b>was</b> {{taken over by}} the State Bank of Pakistan in 1953, when 2, 5, 10 and 100 rupees <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued. Only a few 2 rupees <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued. 50 rupees <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> added in 1957, with 2 rupees notes reintroduced in 1985. In 1986, 500 rupees <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> introduced, followed by 1000 rupees the next year. 2 and 5 rupees <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> replaced by coins in 1998 and 2002. 20 rupee <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> added in 2005, followed by 5000 rupees in 2006. Until 1971, Pakistani banknotes were bilingual, featuring Bengali translation of the Urdu text (where the currency was called taka instead of rupee), since Bengali was the state language of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).|$|R
50|$|On 3 November 1958, {{banknotes}} {{were introduced}} by the Central Bank of Tunisia in denominations of ½, 1 and 5 dinars. The designs of these denominations were changed {{with a series of}} notes dated 1-6-1965, but issued on 3 March 1966. A 10-dinar <b>note</b> dated 1-6-1969 <b>was</b> issued on 2 January 1970.
