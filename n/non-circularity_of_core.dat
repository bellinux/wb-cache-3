Then, we transform the augmented array matrix to the real array matrix due to the centro-Hermitian of the augmented array matrix. To this end, a subspace-weighted mixed-norm minimization problem is formulated for the DoA estimation. In the proposed algorithm, we utilize singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimension of matrix, which improves the computational efficiency. We design the weighted scheme by utilizing the orthogonality of the noise subspace and the array manifold dictionary, which increases {{the reliability of the}} sparse DoA estimation. As shown by simulations, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in difficult scenarios, such as low signal-to-noise ratio, small snapshots, and correlated source. Moreover, the proposed algorithm exhibits a superior performance for the DoA estimation in the underdetermined case.|$|R

The algorithm {{makes the most}} <b>of</b> the <b>non-circularity</b> <b>of</b> the sources and formulates the DoA estimation as a weighted subspace mixed-norm minimization problem. The offered improvement mainly displays in two aspects: For one thing, the algorithm {{takes advantage of the}} strictly non-circular sources, enhances the DoF to two times of the number of sensors, which increases the number of detectable sources and decreases the estimation error. For another, the subspace weighting scheme exploits the relationship between the over-complete dictionary and the noise subspace, which improves the reliability of weighted coefficient and further enforces the sparsity of the signal. Results verify that our proposed algorithm provides superior performance than l 1 -SVD and SW- l 2, 1 -SVD algorithms under small snapshots and low SNR regime. Moreover, the proposed algorithm offers the ability to estimate DoAs in underdetermined conditions.|$|R

The covariance matrix of the unbiased estimator is computed for smooth, non-circular beams. Quantitative results are shown for CMB maps made by an experiment with a non-circular beam comparable to our fits to the WMAP beam maps described in the appendix. We find that significant effects on CMB power spectrum can arise due to non-circular beam on multipoles comparable to, and beyond, the inverse average beam-width where the pseudo-$C_l$ approach may be the method of choice due to computational limitations of analyzing the large datasets from current and near future CMB experiments...|$|R
