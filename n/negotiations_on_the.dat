When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered {{he decided to}} send an envoy to Flamininus to open <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terms of a peace. Nabis offered to withdraw {{the rest of his}} garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners. Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and unseat Nabis.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon, {{expecting to}} win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed; they prevailed. Napoleon adamantly refused.|$|E

40|$|Evolution {{towards the}} {{next-generation}} Internet assumes dynamic end-to-end (E 2 E) {{quality of service}} <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path between the two providers, which are interconnected {{by a number of}} transit providers. Negotiation is performed by means of an appropriate signaling protocol. Basic models for E 2 E service negotiation include: (1) the cascade model, which assumes that a single provider controls service <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path, and (2) the third-party (3 P) model, in which the trusted intermediary performs service <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> behalf of all domains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path. This article presents a comparative study of the aforementioned negotiation models, regarding transport of signaling traffic. The three realistic topologies of interconnected networks have been simulated, using the network simulator NS 2. Particularly, we point out the applicability and deployment of the 3 P model...|$|R
5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less.|$|E
5|$|Protracted {{negotiations}} {{took place}} over House conference <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bill, revolving in large part around Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield's eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from Vietnam; during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted. On August 5, the Nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the Senate went on recess, but Gravel blocked Stennis's attempt to limit debate, and no vote was held. Finally on September 21, 1971, the Senate invoked cloture over Gravel's second filibuster attempt by one vote, and then passed the two-year draft extension. Gravel's attempts to stop the draft had failed (notwithstanding Gravel's later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft, taken at face value in some media reports, during his 2008 presidential campaign).|$|E

5|$|The Ottomans had {{meanwhile}} {{seized the}} Hungarian forts {{along the river}} Neratva. Matthias nominated the wealthy baron Nicholas Újlaki as King of Bosnia in 1471, entrusting the defence of the province to him. Uzun Hassan, head of the Aq Qoyunlu Turkmens, proposed an anti-Ottoman alliance to Matthias but he refrained from attacking the Ottoman Empire. Matthias supported the Austrian noblemen who rebelled against Emperor Frederick in 1472. The following year, Matthias, Casimir IV and Vladislaus entered into <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terms of a peace treaty, but the discussions lasted for months. Matthias tried to unify the government of Silesia, which consisted of dozens of smaller duchies, through appointing a captain-general. However, the Estates refused to elect his candidate Duke Frederick I of Liegnitz.|$|E
5|$|John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open {{rebellion}} against the rule of Mary and her mother {{in the spring of}} 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia. The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana, forcing John of Palisna to flee to Bosnia. The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary, who had been present during the siege along with her mother, on 4November. To strengthen Mary's position against Charles of Naples, Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marriage of Mary to the younger brother of CharlesVI of France, Louis, who had once been engaged to Mary's sister, Catherine. Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia early next year.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose an {{efficient}} negotiation agent system that guarantees the reciprocity of the attendants in a bilateral <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ecommerce. The proposed negotiation agent system exploits incremental learning based on artificial neural networks to generate counter-offers and is trained by the previous offers that have been rejected by the other party. During a <b>negotiation,</b> <b>the</b> software agents <b>on</b> behalf of <b>the</b> buyer and the seller negotiate each other by considering the multi-attributes of a product. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed negotiation system achieves better agreements than other negotiation agent systems that can be operable under the realistic and practical environment. Furthermore, the proposed system carries out negotiations about twenty times faster than other <b>negotiation</b> systems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> average. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considered}} {{the stage and}} features of formation of the state border with Poland and Lithuania, {{as well as the}} delimitation of the Russian marine area in the Kaliningrad region zone. The Polish border was established by the Soviet-Polish border agreement of 1945. It was of astronomical nature and did {{not take into account the}} earlier administrative and economic structure of East Prussia. Since 1993, representatives of the Kaliningrad region participated in <b>the</b> <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Russian-Lithuanian border. This border replicated the Lithuanian-German border of 1928 and was of orographic nature. <b>The</b> termination of <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state border of the Russian Federation and the delimitation of marine areas in the Baltic Sea with Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden in 2005 made it possible to define the geographical parameters of the territory of the Kaliningrad region and adjacent territorial waters and the Russian exclusive economic zone...|$|R
