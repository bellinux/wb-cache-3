5|$|Æthelbert retired {{some time}} before his death, consecrating Eanbald as his successor. The exact date this {{occurred}} is unclear. Alcuin gives a date corresponding to July 778, {{but it could be}} 777 too. Eanbald's position may have just been as an associate bishop, with Æthelbert remaining in office until his death while sharing the office with Eanbald. During his retirement, he had constructed a <b>new</b> <b>church</b> dedicated to Alma Sophia. He lived long enough to consecrate the <b>new</b> <b>church,</b> ten days before his death on 8 November.|$|E
5|$|A <b>new</b> <b>church</b> {{was needed}} because the old church needed {{significant}} repair {{and also because}} the growth of Brynsiencyn meant that more people lived there than in Llanidan itself. Like its predecessor, it is dedicated to Nidan, a 7th-century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|After 1261, <b>new</b> <b>church</b> {{architecture}} in Constantinople consisted mainly of additions to existing monastic churches, {{such as the}} Monastery of Lips and Pammakaristos Church, {{and as a result}} the building complexes are distinguished in part by an asymmetric array of domes on their roofs. This effect may have been in imitation of the earlier triple-church Pantokrator monastic complex.|$|E

5|$|After the council, Cuthbert {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Boniface up until Boniface's martyrdom in 754, and then sent condolences to Boniface's successor. Cuthbert held a second synod in 758, but nothing is known of any enactments it made. He also built the church of St. John the Baptist in Canterbury, which was destroyed by fire in 1067. He was buried in his <b>new</b> <b>church.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>church</b> was located {{on the west side}} of the cathedral, and was used as a baptistery. The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops, and later was used for trials by ordeal. There is no explicit contemporary reference that states that these uses were intended by Cuthbert, but the fact that the church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist argues strongly that Cuthbert at least intended the new building as a baptistery.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{only two}} Catholic churches existed in Moscow: the Saint Louis des Français church for the French {{population}} and the St. Peter and Paul church for the Polish parishioners. As the congregation for the Polish church had increased to around 30,000 members, the existing buildings were too small. Following the submission of a petition to the Governor-General of Moscow, the local council voted for a <b>new</b> <b>church</b> in 1894. Construction of a <b>new</b> <b>church</b> was permitted with several conditions, including two pertinent to the building site: the structure was to be built away from the old city centre, and was not to be located in the vicinity of any Orthodox sacred sites.|$|E

This was followed on 10 August 1297 by a charter from Lord Furnival establishing Sheffield as a free borough.|$|E
5|$|About halfway along Euston Road, at the {{junction}} with Upper Woburn Place, is St Pancras <b>New</b> <b>Church,</b> built in 1822. Designed by William and Henry Inwood and costing around £90,000 (now £), {{it was the most}} expensive religious building in London since St Paul's Cathedral, completed in the previous century. Almost opposite is Euston Road fire station, built 1901–2, in an Arts and Crafts style by Percy Nobbs. The Shaw Theatre opened at No.100–110 in 1971, in honour of George Bernard Shaw. It was refurbished in 2000 as part of an adjacent Novotel development. The Keith Grant sculpture at the theatre's front was removed but was subsequently reinstated after protests.|$|E

5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the <b>new</b> <b>church</b> was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, Bath's abbey {{church was}} {{dilapidated}} and Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to rebuild it {{on a smaller}} scale in 1500. The <b>new</b> <b>church</b> was completed just a few years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city's parish church in the Elizabethan era, when the city experienced a revival as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert (died 26 October 760) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in England. Prior to his {{elevation}} to Canterbury, he was abbot of a monastic house, and perhaps {{may have been}} Bishop of Hereford also, but evidence for his holding Hereford mainly dates from after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. While Archbishop, he held church councils and built a <b>new</b> <b>church</b> in Canterbury. It was during Cuthbert's archbishopric that the Diocese of York was raised to an archbishopric. Cuthbert died in 760 and was later regarded as a saint.|$|E
