500|$|While {{vacationing in}} the Bahamas and Costa Rica in 2008, Saadiq {{observed}} people there listening to classic soul music and {{was inspired to}} pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for Blues & Soul, saying that [...] "I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it’s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though {{you can hear it}} in many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this time is that I took a more focused route." [...] As a part of Tony! Toni! Toné! during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of Motown in his songwriting for the group. Before recording The Way I See It, Saadiq signed to Columbia Records. Label executive Rick Rubin visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice to him as a solo artist, [...] "He told me to never box myself in. I just have to be myself. You've got to follow your own path. I've always gone down the road less traveled, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it even more aggressively." ...|$|E

2500|$|Freeman Dyson, a British (and later American) {{physicist}} who {{had worked}} as a young man with RAF Bomber Command from July 1943 {{to the end of the}} war, wrote in later years: [...] "For many years I had intended to write a book on the bombing. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not need to write it, because Vonnegut has written it much better than I could. He was in Dresden at the time and saw what happened. His book is not only good literature. It is also truthful. The only inaccuracy that I found in it is that it does not say that the night attack which produced the holocaust was a British affair. The Americans only came the following day to plow over the rubble. Vonnegut, being American, did not want to write his account in such a way that the whole thing could be blamed on the British. Apart from that, everything he says is true." [...] Dyson later goes on to say: [...] "Since the beginning of the war I had been retreating step by step from one moral position to another, until at the end I had no moral position at all".|$|E

6000|$|... 'There <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{think you}} would care when I told you of a soldier, a Waterloo man too, and you only call him a half-pay officer!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not pretend}} to explain WHY our Lord stayed {{behind in the}} temple.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{world was}} never conquered by intrigue: it was conquered by faith. <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not see that}} you have faith in anything.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} how Carrington had heard {{of what was going}} on, but his answer made it evident that he had.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh? ... what?" [...] she queried in that high-pitched voice {{peculiar}} to the deaf. [...] "I am somewhat {{hard of hearing}} just <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seduced her! Oh, 'gad, so <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Stap me, <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Yes, <b>I</b> {{made her}} jump on my black horse, and bore her off like--like Aeneas bore his wife {{away from the}} siege of Rome! hey, l'Abbe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you know}} {{something}} about it. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not tell you to make the margins exactly an inch, and half an inch, but only as near as you could tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believed}} what {{my father}} and George Wright said about you--that bloody, despicable record! <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe. I see--I wronged you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, prodigious! I {{never thought}} of that. F-o-u-r {{thousand}} dollars a day. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> begin to see! But will dead policemen answer?" ...|$|E
60|$|The way I feel <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{honestly}} believe I {{would rather be}} just my own humble self at this moment than paragraph 14.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{had given}} me a promise! But never mind. It is all over <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not come to upbraid you, but to tell you that <b>I</b> <b>now</b> know how it must be, and that I am going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A secret spring!" [...] cried Clifford. [...] "Ah, <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>now!</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> discover it, {{one summer}} afternoon, when I was idling and dreaming about the house, long, long ago. But the mystery escapes me." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think, at that time, {{that that}} was either a very dignified or very logical {{argument}} but so it was, I had {{to get along with}} it as well as I could.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no need," [...] she {{interrupted}} proudly; [...] "I {{could keep}} myself <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want anything from you, Monsieur Paul,--save one thing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Holmes," [...] said Hopkins, [...] "I do {{not know}} how to express my gratitude. Even <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} how you attained this result." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} this talk," [...] whispered Taminah; [...] "and {{this morning by}} the {{riverside}} I saw the body. Where it is <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, ah—yes,” he answered, {{brightening}} up; “I remember <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> have {{a headache}} that afternoon. It was the pickles, you know. They were the most disgraceful pickles I ever tasted in a respectable boat. Did you have any?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Lady Kenton, really <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not think}} that foolish affair should be encouraged. It is such an unfortunate thing for him; and as Miss Lang and I agreed, {{it would be so}} much better for both of them if it were given up.' ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> {{with the}} {{privileges}} when I have removed one objection.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{had had a}} small {{opinion of}} the maid, who, when I told her the crew had deserted the ship, had sat down and covered her head; but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{pretty much the same}} thing; I {{crouched}} on the deck and pulled my cap over my eyes. I felt that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wish to see, hear, or feel anything.|$|R
5000|$|Mercury said:"Two years ago, I would {{released}} the album {{with a song}} like Rapunzel, or other dancing song. But <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> have nothing more to prove. This time, the focus its on the song. Its the melody that moves. They can get sick of music, but the album has other different songs." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed the other, {{brightening}} {{for a brief}} moment; [...] "yes, I {{did hear}} him. He {{said we were going}} six knots. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand what that means." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not decline because I mind {{talking to}} an audience, but because (1) {{traveling}} alone is so heartbreakingly dreary, and (2) shouldering the whole show is such a cheer-killing responsibility.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, not <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not mean}} to-night,' Elfride responded, {{with a slight}} decline in the {{firmness}} of her voice. 'It is not light as you think it--it troubles me a great deal.' Fearing now the effect of her own earnestness, she added forcedly, 'Though, perhaps, you may think it light after all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{might have}} known,” he said. “If I {{had had the}} courage you would have saved me from everything, but {{is it too late}} <b>now?</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it because <b>I</b> loved you, Violet—and you will give me the chance to redeem myself.

60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not care}} to depart from Cho-Sen except with the Lady Om. When I {{broached}} the possibility of it she told me, warm in my arms, that I was her king and that wherever I led she would follow. As you shall see it was truth, full truth, that she uttered.|$|R
