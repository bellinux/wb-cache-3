These initiatives do not differentiate between occupational noise-induced hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss incurred independently of occupational noise exposure. However, it is worthwhile to examine non-occupational noise-induced hearing loss because noise sources are varied and ubiquitous, the population at risk is so wide-ranging, it is not formally scrutinized by mandated programs or dedicated professionals to the same degree as occupational noise-induced hearing loss, and often does not utilize good principles of health communication to create concise educational messages. Audiologists can individually work to prevent non-occupational noise-induced hearing loss through education, which should involve principles of health communication and promotion, thoughtful and concise messages, the use of national messages as a springboard, and can also occur through school programs and routine office appointments.

To this point, not much research has been done on these risks, and even less has been done on the hazardous noise risks these service members are subjected to. These workers typically work many days a week as well as long hours while being around loud noises for extended periods of time. The purpose of this research study was to collect data on personal noise exposure for security forces at multiple locations at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB) to compare the results with the Air Force Occupational and Environmental Exposure Limit (OEEL) of 85 dBA for an 8 -hour time weighted average (TWA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 90 dBA for an 8 -hour TWA. Personal noise dosimeters were used for collecting personal noise exposure, and sound level meters were used for collecting area noise exposure. A Lieutenant at MacDill offered the data she was at liberty to divulge on the security forces for this study. Dosimetry testing was done at four locations, and sound level surveys were done at two locations, with one of the locations being tested by both, dosimeters and a sound level meter.

Many farmers, farm workers, and family members are exposed to noise levels above recommended levels and have greater hearing loss than their non-farming contemporaries. The {{aim of this study}} was to gather up-to-date information on farm noise levels and to enhance the quality of information available to assist farmers in reducing noise exposure and meeting Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) regulations regarding noise management. Farm visits were conducted on 48 agricultural establishments that produce a range of commodities.

In each of the two experimental collectives, under identical test conditions, the impact of exposure to white noise of 105 dB and five minutes duration on the dependent variables systolic/diastolic blood pressure, on the history of finger pulse amplitude and on the hearing threshold were measured and the subjective estimate of noise exposure was inquired using a fully standardized method. From the different responses of the two collectives a typical response (standard response type) was determined for each of the four parameters under investigation. Starting from the hypothesis that a particular sensitivity to noise is given, when a person of normal hearing under standardized exposure to sound responds in the same way as a person of poor hearing does, a search algorithm was used to individually examine the subjects of the Collective ''Standard'' under this aspect: 16 subjects (6. 25 % out of 258) meet these requirements; for these one has to assume an individually increased <b>noise</b> <b>hazard.</b> (orig.)

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 81 - 84) This {{study was}} inaugurated {{in the belief}} that understanding the origins of present land use is requisite to solving the problems of obtaining and maintaining compatible land uses within airport environments. The three basic factors influencing land use compatibility are identified as <b>noise,</b> <b>hazard,</b> and fear. The tolerance of specific areas to these factors varies according to the existing land use activity. Some land uses are not compatible within an airport environment, notably residential and institutional uses. Hollywood-Burbank Airport is used as the study example because it was created in a compatible rural environment which subsequently was surrounded by urban land uses, some of which are incompatible with the airport operations. The historical development of land use patterns surrounding Hollywood-Burbank Airport is traced through the interpretation of air photographs from 1928 to 1970. The findings of this study reveal that the initial urban use of the land tends to persist and is difficult to change in order to maintain land use compatibility in an expanding airport environment. There is a need for comprehensive land use preplanning in a jet-age airport environment to ensure compatible land use. Hopefully, more effective and currently maintained research will be conducted to provide a better understanding of compatible land use in an airport environment and to provide palliative solutions to existing land use problems and proper preplanning for the jet-age airports of the future...|$|R

This qualitative study took place at two high schools in rural Michigan. Twenty-five adolescents living and working on farms or living in rural areas participated {{in one of two}} focus groups. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analyzed by two researchers and checked by an additional researcher to ensure reliability. Noise exposure was ubiquitous among participants, both in farm-related (e. g., equipment, livestock) and non-farm-related (e. g., music, firearms) activities. Perceived barriers to use of hearing protection devices outweighed perceived benefits, resulting in uncommon use of protection. When hearing protection was used, it was usually earmuffs or earplugs. Participants indicated a lack of training in <b>noise</b> <b>hazards</b> and protective strategies. Despite their acknowledged risk of hearing loss, participants did not associate their use of hearing protection today with their hearing ability later in life. Categories emerging that relate to hearing protector use included: Barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, situational influences, impersonal influences, cues to action, susceptibility, and severity. Farm and rural adolescents are at risk for noise exposure and hearing loss. The findings stress the significance of work environment and adult modeling in facilitating hearing conservation behaviors.

In addition to reproducing the conductive path from air to the cochlea accurately it includes a non-linear stapes (clips large displacements) and an active middle ear muscle system. It is being written into a new US Army MIL-STD- 1474 (e) and {{is used by the}} Society of Automotive Engineers for the analysis of airbag <b>noise</b> <b>hazard.</b> The model shows that low-frequency energy at high levels can act to reduce the flow of energy into the inner ear, reducing the hazard. Traditional analyses tend to overrate the hazard from large calibre weapons impulses. The model also shows that impulses with little low-frequency energy, e. g. rifles, may be underrated in hazard by traditional methods. Hearing protective devices (HPDs), in order to be effective for gunfire type impulses, were shown to need most attenuation in the mid-range and less at lower frequencies, much like the attenuation curve for the non-linear combat arms plug. At the same time, speech intelligibility with such an attenuator could be much better than for an HPD with good low-frequency attenuation. Future developments of the model will include expansion to cover a wider range of intensities and an adaptive middle ear muscle system. ...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{requests}} help {{in preventing}} injury and illness in workers at indoor firing ranges in the United States. Workers are potentially exposed to hazardous amounts of lead and noise at these ranges. They include thousands of {{employees at the}} firing ranges {{as well as more}} than a million Federal, State, and local law officers who train regularly at these facilities. In addition to workers, 20 million active target shooters are potentially exposed to lead and <b>noise</b> <b>hazards</b> at indoor firing ranges. This Alert presents five case reports that document lead and noise exposures of law enforcement officers and students. The Alert examines firing range operations, exposure assessment and control methods, existing regulations, and exposure standards and guidelines. NIOSH requests that the recommendations in this Alert be {{brought to the attention of}} all firing range owners, operators, workers, and users as well as safety and health officials, industry associations, unions, and editors of trade journals.
