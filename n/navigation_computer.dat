25|$|Stanley F. Schmidt is {{generally}} credited with developing the first {{implementation of a}} Kalman filter. He realized that the filter could {{be divided into two}} distinct parts, with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements.

25|$|Since {{the wind}} was calm, Cali's {{controllers}} asked the pilots whether they wanted to fly a straight-in approach to runway 19 rather than coming around to runway 01. The pilots agreed, hoping to make up some time. The pilots then erroneously cleared the approach waypoints from their <b>navigation</b> <b>computer.</b> When the controller asked the pilots to check back in over Tuluá, north of Cali, {{it was no longer}} programmed into the computer, and so they had to pull out their maps to find it. In the meantime, they extended the aircraft's speed brakes to slow it down and expedite its descent.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Germany began a {{comprehensive}} upgrade program, {{known as the}} Improved Combat Efficiency (ICE) program, for their Alpha Jet fleet; these upgrades were to involve the installation of a Mil Spec 1553B databus, new sensors integrated with the navigation/attack systems, modernized electronic countermeasures suite, measures to minimize the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures, protection measures around the fuel system, and new armaments such as the AGM-65 Maverick. In 1988, {{it was announced that}} the ICE program has been cancelled. A more austere upgrade program did proceed in its place, which integrated the AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile and <b>navigation</b> <b>computer</b> upgrades, along with several minor airframe and equipment refinements, such as the addition of a jettisonable gun pod.|$|E

500|$|International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) {{simulation}} {{and analysis}} of the flight data recorder determined that this deviation was probably caused by the aircraft's autopilot system operating in HEADING mode, after the point that it should have been switched to the INS mode. According to the ICAO, the autopilot was not operating in the INS mode either because the crew did not switch the autopilot to the INS mode (shortly after Cairn Mountain), or they did select the INS mode, but the computer did not transition from INERTIAL NAVIGATION ARMED to INS mode because the aircraft had already deviated off track by more than the [...] tolerance permitted by the inertial <b>navigation</b> <b>computer.</b> Whatever the reason, the autopilot remained in the HEADING mode, and the problem was not detected by the crew.|$|E
2500|$|Precision guided entry {{made use}} of onboard {{computing}} ability to steer itself toward the pre-determined landing site, improving landing accuracy {{from a range of}} hundreds of kilometers to [...] This capability helped remove some of the uncertainties of landing hazards that might be present in larger landing ellipses. Steering was achieved by the combined use of thrusters and ejectable balance masses. The ejectable balance masses shift the capsule center of mass enabling generation of a lift vector during the atmospheric phase. A <b>navigation</b> <b>computer</b> integrated the measurements to estimate the position and attitude of the capsule that generated automated torque commands. This was the first planetary mission to use precision landing techniques.|$|E
2500|$|American Airlines settled {{numerous}} lawsuits {{brought against}} {{it by the}} families of the victims of the accident. American Airlines filed a [...] "third-party complaint" [...] lawsuit for contribution against Jeppesen and Honeywell, which made the <b>navigation</b> <b>computer</b> database and failed to include the coordinates of Rozo under the identifier [...] "R"; the case went to trial in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami. At the trial, American Airlines admitted that it bore some legal responsibility for the accident. Honeywell and Jeppesen each contended that they had no legal responsibility for the accident. In June 2000, the jury found that Jeppesen was 30 percent at fault for the crash, Honeywell was 10 percent at fault, and American Airlines was 60 percent at fault.|$|E

2500|$|According to roleplaying {{and other}} material, X-wings {{depicted}} in the movies and expanded universe material that takes place around the same era are equipped with four laser cannons {{and a pair of}} proton torpedo launchers. The fighter has two flight modes: one in which the wings are flat and another when they are expanded into [...] "attack position", affording the wingtip lasers a larger fire area. [...] "S-foil" [...] servomotors control the transition between the two, hence the expression [...] "to lock s-foils in attack position". Lacking an on-board <b>navigation</b> <b>computer,</b> they rely on an astromech droid to calculate hyperspace jumps. The Rebel Alliance adopted the military strategy of Doctrine of Space Denial, wherein the Rebellion would raid Imperial boneyards and shipping frigates, both to disrupt Imperial logistics and operations, and also to requisition desperately needed materials. X-wing hyperdrive capabilities allowed for this kind of harassment and escape before the Empire may react. The presence of a hyperdrive and deflector shields differentiate the X-wing from the Empire's TIE fighters, emphasizing the importance the Rebels place on pilots surviving their missions.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the pilots found Tuluá's coordinates, they had already passed over it. In {{response}} to this, they attempted to program the <b>navigation</b> <b>computer</b> for the next approach waypoint, Rozo. However, the Rozo NDB was identified as R on their charts. Colombia had duplicated the identifier for the Romeo NDB near Bogotá, and the computer's list of stored waypoints {{did not include the}} Rozo NDB as [...] "R", but only under its full name [...] "ROZO". In cases where a country allowed duplicate identifiers, it often listed them with the largest city first. By picking the first [...] "R" [...] from the list, the captain caused the autopilot to start flying a course to Bogotá, resulting in the airplane turning east in a wide semicircle. By {{the time the}} error was detected, the aircraft was in a valley running roughly north-south parallel to the one they should have been in. The pilots had put the aircraft {{on a collision course with}} a 3,000-meter (9,800 feet) mountain. The air traffic controller, Nelson Rivera Ramírez, believed that some of the requests of the pilots did not make sense, but did not know enough non-aviation English to convey this.|$|E
2500|$|Mahon's report, {{released}} on 27 April 1981, cleared {{the crew of}} blame for the disaster. Mahon said the single, dominant and effective cause of the crash was Air New Zealand's alteration of the flight plan waypoint coordinates in the ground <b>navigation</b> <b>computer</b> without advising the crew. The new flight plan took the aircraft directly over the mountain, rather than along its flank. Due to whiteout conditions, [...] "a malevolent trick of the polar light", the crew were unable to visually identify the mountain in front of them. Furthermore, they may have experienced a rare meteorological phenomenon called sector whiteout, which creates the visual illusion of a flat horizon far in the distance. (It {{appeared to be a}} very broad gap between cloud layers allowing a view of the distant Ross Ice Shelf and beyond.) Mahon noted that the flight crew, with many thousands of hours of flight time between them, had considerable experience with the extreme accuracy of the aircraft's inertial navigation system. Mahon also found that the radio communications centre at McMurdo Station had authorised Collins to descend to , below the minimum safe level.|$|E
