5000|$|Kincaid {{recalls that}} when she was a writer for The New Yorker, she would often be questioned, {{particularly}} by women, on how she was able to obtain her position. Kincaid felt that these questions were posed to her because she was a young black woman [...] "from nowhere...I have <b>no</b> <b>credentials.</b> I have <b>no</b> money.

The next thing you know Im writing for The New Yorker, I have this sort of life, and it must seem annoying to people." ...|$|R
60|$|Gradually Hodder {{began to}} realize {{something}} of their numbers. Gradually, as he was drawn more and more into the network of the relationships of this extraordinary man,--nay, as he inevitably {{became a part of}} that network,--a period of bewilderment ensued. He found himself involved, and quite naturally, in unpremeditated activities, running errands, forming human ties on a human basis. No question was asked, <b>no</b> <b>credentials</b> demanded or rejected. Who he was made no difference--he was a friend of Horace Bentley's. He had less time to read, less time to think, to scan the veil of his future.|$|R
50|$|Trainer's {{importance}} {{stems from}} his publication in 1965, {{of his most}} famous work, The Lolita Complex, which had {{the appearance of a}} serious psychological work, with an extensive bibliography of legitimate authorities, who were liberally quoted and referenced from their work. Trainer, however, had <b>no</b> <b>credentials</b> at all as a psychologist, and many authorities saw the work as a sham and the author as a charlatan. The title is a reference to Vladimir Nabokov's book, Lolita, in which a middle-aged man becomes sexually obsessed with a 12-year-old girl. When Trainer's book was translated into Japanese, it triggered a movement known as lolicon, the Japanese form of the title of the translated book.|$|R

5000|$|... "I had and have, <b>no</b> <b>credentials</b> worth {{mentioning}} being only {{a teacher of}} college physics and math. It is precisely this that prevented me, for so long, from doing more: I knew I carried no weight, had no formal qualifications, and was not suited for a leadership role. But {{as the years passed}} and no one better came forward, I finally had to write, and later felt I had to form organizations (although others had come into existence). This tragedy, in various manifestations, may persist. Potentially effective leaders may have turned aside because I (and later a few other obscure people) reluctantly preempted leadership. Business people and investors may have hesitated because the small, poorly capitalized organizations already in the field have had such limited (although increasing!) success in attracting participants." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1816, Fran√ßois Magendie {{discovered}} that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein {{as an essential}} dietary component. William Prout in 1827 {{was the first person}} to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein. During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds). With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with <b>no</b> <b>credentials</b> in animal physiology, Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value. In the 1860s, Claude Bernard {{discovered that}} body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the war, Greeley {{played with}} ideas {{as to how}} to settle it. In 1862, Greeley had {{approached}} the French minister to Washington, Henri Mercier, to discuss a mediated settlement. However, Seward rejected such talks and the prospect of European intervention receded after the bloody Union victory at Antietam in September 1862. In July 1864, Greeley received word that there were Confederate commissioners in Canada, empowered to offer peace. In fact, the men were in Niagara Falls, Canada to aid Peace Democrats and otherwise undermine the Union war effort. but they played along when Greeley journeyed to Niagara Falls, at Lincoln's request: the president was willing to consider any deal that included reunion and emancipation. The Confederates had <b>no</b> <b>credentials</b> and were unwilling to accompany Greeley to Washington under safe conduct. Greeley returned to New York, and the episode, when it became public, embarrassed the administration. Lincoln said nothing publicly concerning Greeley's credulous conduct, but privately indicated that he had no confidence in him anymore.|$|R
50|$|Miller's {{death was}} very tragic, {{and his life}} brief, but he left a {{heritage}} of new discoveries of several Silurian sea scorpions (the eurypterid genus Hughmilleria was named in his honour), and many Devonian fishes, including several placoderms (the arthrodire Millerosteus also honoured him), described in his popular books. Though he had <b>no</b> academic <b>credentials,</b> he is today considered one of Scotland's premier palaeontologists.|$|R

40|$|College-for-all {{has become}} the {{educational}} policy in the United States, and {{it has led to}} many changes. Postsecondary subbaccalaureate (sub-BA) credentials (certificates and associate's degrees) are an increasing portion of college credentials, and we examine the implications for the reproduction of social inequalities. We find that despite the growth of sub-BA credentials, many students who enroll in college continue to get <b>no</b> <b>credentials.</b> After replicating prior findings of sub-BA employment and earnings payoffs, using the 2004 ‚Äì 2012 Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS) survey, we analyze the AddHealth survey to see whether sub-BA credentials are associated with jobs with nonmonetary job rewards similar to those BAs get (autonomy, career relevance, and so on). Moreover, although BA degrees often reproduce social and academic inequalities, we examine whether sub-BA credentials pose socioeconomic status (SES) and test score obstacles to credential completion, and to employment and earnings within credentials. Beyond the usual earnings payoffs in prior research, we conclude that sub-BA credentials provide ways college students can attain desirable job rewards while avoiding SES and test score obstacles. We speculate on possible reasons and policy implications...|$|R
5000|$|In 1943 an {{official}} provincial guidebook, Historic Nova Scotia, {{described it as}} authentic. But then a Nova Scotia born professor of archaeology, A. D.

All mention of the stone was removed from [...] "Historic Nova Scotia". Despite all this in 1947 the local museum ordered more copies of Standwold's pamphlet on the stone, and others claiming expertise continued to pronounce it genuine.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{technological}} {{changes in the}} workplace have placed considerable pressure on the U. S. educational system to adequately prepare students for occupations that increasingly require specific skills. However, certain educators and policy-makers have {{raised the question of}} whether vocational education at the high school level, with its focus on immediately entering the workforce after high school, adequately prepares students for college. At the postsecondary level, the debate has centered on whether vocational education restricts access to a four-year college, which may hamper future earnings. This report estimates the returns to a sub-baccalaureate education. The analyses emphasize the effect of a student's program of study, the amount of schooling accumulated with and without attaining a degree, and the type of credential earned. We test whether the earnings of degree attainers are significantly larger than those of similar students with the same amount of postsecondary education but <b>no</b> <b>credential.</b> We also examine whether economic gains from occupational education are realized not only for students who concentrated on vocational education in high school but also for special subpopulations such as older students, racial-ethnic minorities, and academically or economically disadvantaged students...|$|R
50|$|Mrs. Frederick Spencer was an {{official}} delegate {{of the government}} of Australia and Norway was represented {{by the president of the}} National Suffrage Association, Fredrikke Marie Qvam, and the president of the National Council of Women, Gina Krog. The Governors of California, Oregon and Washington had appointed representatives. Written or telegraphed greetings were received from nineteen countries. Fraternal delegates -- 163 were present from twelve countries -- offered their greetings and a large number advocated for their organizations. A resolution was adopted that <b>no</b> <b>credentials</b> should be accepted until the society presenting them should be approved by the National Suffrage Association of its country and no fraternal delegate should speak except by invitation of the president of the Alliance and with the consent of the congress. This checked a torrent of oratory and allowed the convention to carry out its program. The Chinese Woman Suffrage Society was admitted, for which Catt had sowed the seeds at the time of her visit to that country, and the embroidered banner they had sent was presented to the Alliance by Dr. Aletta Jacobs, president of the Netherlands Association, who had accompanied her.|$|R
