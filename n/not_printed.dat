5|$|During {{the last}} few decades, these paper targets have been {{gradually}} replaced by electronic target systems, immediately displaying the results on monitors. When using these systems, actual scoring lines are <b>not</b> <b>printed,</b> but {{the location of the}} impact hole (which can be determined acoustically) is automatically converted into corresponding scores by a computer. ISSF rules now require the use of these systems in top-level competitions. They are generally used in other international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E
5|$|According to The Intellectual in Twentieth-Century Southern Literature, Godwin {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was a popular novelist that was also working in academia. Godwin taught at the University of Illinois Center for Advanced Studies from 1971 to 1972. During her time as an author, she was also a {{lecturer}} at the Iowa Writers' Workshop (1972 to 1973), Vassar College (1977), and Columbia University (1978/1981). She acted as chair of the fiction panel for the National Book Awards in 1986 and 2008. In 1989, Godwin also founded a small publishing house called St. Hilda's Press. It published religious texts <b>not</b> <b>printed</b> by more commercialized publishers. She later became a Distinguished Alumna of the University of North Carolina and the University of Iowa.|$|E
5|$|However, by 1783 Forster {{saw that}} his {{involvement}} with the Rosicrucians not only led him away from real science, but also deeper into debt (it is {{said he was not}} good at money); for these reasons Forster was happy to accept a proposal by the Polish Komisja Edukacji Narodowej (Commission of National Education) and became Chair of Natural History at Vilnius University in 1784. Initially, he was accepted well in Vilnius, but he felt more and more isolated with time. Most of his contacts were still with scientists in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with Immanuel Kant about the definition of race. In 1785, Forster traveled to Halle where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine. Back in Vilnius, Forster's ambitions to build a real natural history scientific center could not get appropriate financial support from the Polish authorities. Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was <b>not</b> <b>printed</b> until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community. Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as Catherine II of Russia had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the Mulovsky expedition) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in Saint Petersburg. This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist Jędrzej Śniadecki. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left Vilnius. He then settled in Mainz, where he became head librarian of the University of Mainz, a position held previously by his friend Johannes von Müller, who made sure Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to the administration of Elector Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal.|$|E

50|$|Among {{justifications}} {{used for}} <b>not</b> <b>printing</b> everything believers’ wrote included {{the argument that}} believers would <b>not</b> <b>print</b> atheist material in their publications, that by doing so it would help disseminate religious propaganda and also because believers wrote things that bordered on criticism of the state. The publications that believers were permitted to print were limited to be far smaller in circulation than the atheistic propaganda, and the material that was permitted to be printed by believers was also often dictated by the state.|$|R

25|$|Special {{handling}} instructions for breakage are <b>not</b> <b>printed</b> on the packaging of household CFL bulbs in many countries. The amount of mercury released by one bulb can temporarily exceed U.S. federal guidelines for chronic exposure. Chronic, however, implies exposure {{for a significant}} time, and it remains unclear what the health risks are from short-term exposure to low levels of elemental mercury. Despite following EPA best-practice clean-up guidelines on broken CFLs, researchers were unable to remove mercury from carpet, and agitation of the carpet— such as by young children playing— created localized concentrations as high as 0.025mg/m3 in air close to the carpet, even weeks after the initial breakage.|$|E

Syllable-initial consonants {{are on the right}} (shown green in the picture), and syllable-final consonants and consonant clusters are on the left (shown red). Some consonant clusters are <b>not</b> <b>printed</b> on the keyboard; the user has to press multiple consonant keys to input some consonant clusters, unlike Sebeolsik Final.
