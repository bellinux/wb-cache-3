The long vestibule of the V. affinis <b>embryo</b> <b>nest</b> was not effective in preventing access to the nest by small species of ants. V. affinis and V. tropica (L.) females produce a substance which is repellent to ants. The substance is produced by the 6 th and 7 th abdominal sternal glands and {{is thought to be}} applied to the <b>embryo</b> <b>nest</b> petiole via the sternal brush. As the substance is produced by workers and queens during the entire life of the colony, it probably has a dual function...|$|R

40|$|Reproductive {{success in}} loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtles is {{strongly}} {{dependent on the}} effective placement and internal conditions of their <b>nests.</b> <b>Embryos</b> rely on optimal incubation conditions for proper development and growth, which determines how many hatchlings will emerge from the nest. The internal microclimate of each nest is delicately balanced and can be easily influenced by external environmental conditions. This study was designed to examine several environmental variables and determine their effects on sea turtle nesting numbers, hatching success, and incubation conditions in Broward County Florida. Over a span of 25 years (1991 - 2015), the Broward County Sea Turtle Conservation Program has collected data on each sea turtle nest laid in Broward County. This data was analyzed and plotted to visualize nesting and hatching trends, and regressions were fitted to make comparisons to historic air temperature, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and lunar illumination data. These regressions were tested for significance, and each environmental variable was found to have varying levels of impact on sea turtle nesting and hatching behavior. Of the environmental variables considered in this study, analyses suggest that sea turtles are most responsive to temperature, with sea surface temperature serving as the best proxy for predicting nesting behaviors. Air temperature over the incubation period was found to be the best indicator for hatch success percentage. Air temperature, sea surface temperature, and precipitation averages all significantly affected the length of the incubation period. The regression models created in this study could be used to examine the interactions between climatic variables, and to indicate what impacts can be expected by these various environmental factors. This information could be used to estimate the future effects of climate change on sea turtle reproduction, and to predict general reproductive success and future population trends...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{how life}} {{histories}} influence reproductive success under uncertain conditions {{is necessary to}} predict population dynamics. For many organisms, protracted reproduction may increase expected offspring recruitment in variable environments, requiring that temporal patterns of reproduction be considered when developing management or conservation strategies. We explored the interrelationships among birth date, production of <b>embryos</b> on <b>nests,</b> survival of larvae to the open-water stage, and survival of juveniles through the first fall and winter of life for bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus and L. gibbosus) in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, during May 1998 through May 1999. Age- 0 sunfish were sampled with <b>nesting</b> surveys for <b>embryos,</b> surface tows for free-swimming larvae, and seining/trawling for juveniles.

40|$|Sex ratios {{that differ}} from unity have been {{reported}} for several bird species, but are poorly understood. Skewed sex ratios may originate at ovulation (primary sex ratio) or arise through differential mortality between the sexes (secondary sex ratio). To estimate the primary sex ratio from nestlings is difficult because in some nests not all the offspring can be sexed. Both when including and excluding such nests, {{there is a risk}} of overestimating the proportion of the better-surviving sex. Here we sexed dead Sparrowhawk embryos to determine whether unhatched eggs affect primary sex ratio estimates that are based on nestling data. In <b>nests</b> in which <b>embryo</b> mortality occurred, there was up to a 9 % discrepancy in the primary sex ratio estimates based on nestlings alone compared to nestlings and dead embryos together. There was no evidence that these differences were based on sex-specific causes of mortality of embryo...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the reproductive {{parameters of the}} introduced non-migratory flock of whooping cranes in Florida. Of 289 cranes introduced, 67 males and 65 females survived at least 3 years. The first behavioral pairs appeared in 1995, and eggs were first laid in 1999. In total, eggs were laid in 47 nests, 17 chicks hatched, and 4 young fledged by 2005. Severe drought conditions through 2001 {{were thought to be}} the reason for low reproductive nest success. In 2003 nesting conditions improved and 71 % of nests with eggs, hatched chicks. During the next 2 years, with continued wet conditions, the proportion of pairs that laid eggs increased, but only 17 % of those <b>nests</b> hatched. <b>Embryos</b> could not be seen in most of the decomposed eggs that were examined. In an effort to determine the cause for the low reproductive success of the flock, we {{examined the}} effects of behavioral pair formation, mortality, gonad size and histology, age, egg laying, hatching success, egg size, fertility, and egg microbial culture results on nesting success. When compared with the natural wild Aransas/Wood Buffalo flock, the productivity of birds reaching 8 years (100 % egg laying, hatching, 60 % fledging) was very low. When compared with the originating captive flock, however, evidence of fertility was similar. Productivity did however, increase in the captive flock beyond 8 years of age. At the time of this report, the reproductive birds in the Florida resident flock remain relatively young when compared with the captive flock. Therefore there may be improvement of reproductive success as the Florida flock ages...|$|R
40|$|The {{hatching}} {{success of}} nests deposited by olive ridley turtles Lepidochelys olivacea during aggregated nesting events (‘arribada’) is typically {{low and the}} underlying mechanisms are not clear. In this study, temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures (PO 2 and PCO 2) of in situ nests as well as nests relocated into a hatchery with clean sand were monitored throughout incubation. Hatching success of hatchery nests {{was significantly higher than}} in situ nests (83. 1 vs. 21. 6 %) and mainly resulted from higher mortality of early-stage embryos. During the first half of incubation, temperature and PCO 2 were higher (by 0. 6 1 C and 0. 7 kPa, respectively) and PO 2 was lower (by 1. 1 kPa) within in situ relative to hatchery <b>nests.</b> Because <b>embryo</b> metabolism does not interfere significantly with nest gas contents {{during the first half of}} incubation, these results suggest that the greater content of organic matter and/or microorganisms in the sand surrounding in situ nests had an effect on nest gas contents. As PO 2 and PCO 2 differences were relatively small, microbial activity (such as fungal and bacterial infection) may have caused the early embryo mortality found in situ. Moreover, our results suggest that during the second half of incubation, neither PO 2 nor PCO 2 reached threshold levels that resulted in the death of embryos or hatchlings. Overall, this study showed a clear benefit of using clean sand to increase hatchling production in arribada beaches and highlights the importance of further investigating the relationship between nest micro-environment, sand microbial activity and embryo development under natural conditions during these unique nesting events...|$|R
5000|$|Goose egg “addling” is a {{wildlife}} management method of population control for Canada geese and other bird species. The process of addling involves temporarily removing fertilized eggs from the <b>nest,</b> testing for <b>embryo</b> development, terminating embryo development, and placing the egg {{back in the}} nest. Returning the egg to the nest misleads the goose into believing the egg is still developing. Otherwise, the goose would begin laying again. Though considered more humane than hunting by some, {{it is not as}} cost-effective as other measures, such as extended hunting seasons and professional culling. [...] In order to work effectively, addling must be conducted in a manner that does not arouse the suspicion of the goose, and must not change the odor, appearance or texture of the egg. Effective addling techniques are disseminated by the Humane Society of the United States and Internet Center for Wildlife Damage Management. Perhaps the easiest way to addle is to coat the egg with corn oil, thereby depriving the embryo of oxygen and killing it.|$|R

40|$|Cannibalism is {{widespread}} in natural populations of fishes, where the stomachs of adults frequently contain conspecific juveniles. Furthermore, field observations suggest that guardian males routinely eat offspring {{from their own}} nests. However, recent genetic paternity analyses have shown that fish <b>nests</b> often contain <b>embryos</b> not sired by the nest-tending male (because of cuckoldry events, egg thievery, or nest piracy). Such findings, coupled {{with the fact that}} several fish species have known capabilities for distinguishing kin from nonkin, raise the possibility that cannibalism by guardian males is directed primarily or exclusively toward unrelated <b>embryos</b> in their <b>nests.</b> Here, we test this hypothesis by collecting freshly cannibalized embryos from the stomachs of several nest-tending darter and sunfish males in nature and determining their genetic parentage by using polymorphic microsatellite markers. Our molecular results clearly indicate that guardian males do indeed consume their own genetic offspring, even when unrelated (foster) embryos are present within the nest. These data provide genetic documentation of filial cannibalism in nature. Furthermore, they suggest that the phenomenon may result, at least in part, from an inability of guardians to differentiate between kin and nonkin within their own nests...|$|R
40|$|Offspring {{phenotype}} {{is strongly}} influenced by the environmental conditions experienced early in ontogeny when embryos are rapidly organizing physiological systems. Numerous evolutionary theories posit that processes that match offspring phenotype to their environment can enhance survival and fitness into adulthood. Importantly, the phenotype that is most beneficial for a given environment often differs between sexes. Turtles with temperature-dependent sex determination are a powerful system in which to investigate how early environmental conditions impact offspring phenotype and sex because these traits are affected by both maternally derived steroids and incubation temperatures. The following research focuses on how natural variation in maternal steroids and fluctuating incubation temperatures affect offspring behavior and sex. In Trachemys scripta hatchlings, behavioral types consisting of repeatable and correlated behaviors exist, and are robust to maternal steroids and incubation temperatures. Conversely, offspring sex is affected by both maternal steroid levels and fluctuating incubation temperatures. Late season clutches have higher concentrations of maternally derived estrogens {{and are more likely}} to produce female hatchlings. This seasonal increase in female biased sex ratios is exacerbated by subtle increases in diurnally fluctuating incubation temperatures, as would occur across the <b>nesting</b> season. <b>Embryos</b> are sensitive to brief exposures to warm incubation temperatures, which mimic heat waves, with a seasonal pattern in the sensitivity where late season eggs produce more females at any given heat wave duration. Embryos in three climatically disparate populations of T. scripta respond similarly to heat waves during incubation. Models derived from the empirical studies, which were designed to predict sex ratios based on thermal variability, perform better than models based on temperature aggregation methods (e. g. average). Taken together, these data underscore the importance of considering biologically meaningful variation and provide insight into how phenotype is affected by early developmental conditions. The results shed light onto how sex is determined in nature in species with TSD, ultimately informing their conservation and management in rapidly changing environments...|$|R
40|$|Physical and {{biological}} conditions of nests in which sea turtle embryos develop can vary among and within nesting beaches. Monitoring these conditions {{and their effects}} on embryonic development should be considered when assessing conservation efforts to increase sea turtle hatchling production. Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge (SPNWR), St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, hosts a leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea nesting colony that has increased exponentially in the past 2 decades, {{due in part to}} an ongoing egg relocation program. We characterized the influence of nest environment conditions (e. g. partial pressures of oxygen, pO 2, and carbon dioxide, pCO 2, and temperature) on hatching success of relocated eggs at 3 different sites at SPNWR to evaluate potential intra-beach variation in nest environment conditions and hatching success. Although nest conditions varied significantly among sites, hatching success did not vary significantly among relocation sites. Among all clutches and sites, hatching success varied significantly with minimum pO 2, maximum pCO 2, and maximum temperatures measured in leatherback <b>nests.</b> Thus, leatherback <b>embryos</b> collectively affected their nest environment (i. e. decreased pO 2, increased pCO 2, and temperature), and appeared to show developmental sensitivity to low pO 2 and high levels of pCO 2 and temperature in nests.

40|$|AbstractIn jawed vertebrates, the Dlx code, or nested {{expression}} patterns of Dlx genes, specify the dorsoventral polarity of pharyngeal arches, downstream of endothelin- 1 (Edn- 1) and its effectors, Bapx 1 (Nkx 3. 2) and dHand (Hand 2). To elucidate {{the evolution of}} the specification mechanism of the oropharyngeal skeletal system, lamprey homologs of Dlx, Edn, endothelin receptor (Ednr), Bapx 1, and dHand were identified. Our analysis suggested that the Edn gene family emerged at the advent of vertebrates, and that gene duplications leading to the different Edn gnathostome subtypes (Edn 1 – 3) occurred before the cyclostome–gnathostome split. This timing of gene duplications, giving rise to multiple subtypes, was also implied for Dlx, Ednr, Hand, and Bapx. In lamprey <b>embryos,</b> <b>nested</b> expressions of Dlx genes were not observed in pharyngeal arches, nor was any focal expression of Bapx 1, known in gnathostomes to specify the jaw joint. The dHand homolog, however, was expressed more intensively ventrally, as in gnathostomes. Lamprey homologs of Edn- 1 and EdnrA were also shown to be expressed as described in mice, indicating involvement of this signaling pathway in the craniofacial patterning early in vertebrate evolution. These results suggest that the last common ancestor of all the extant vertebrates would have possessed basic gene repertoires involved in oropharyngeal patterning in gnathostomes, but the elaborate genetic program leading to the Dlx code is likely to have been acquired uniquely in gnathostomes...|$|R
50|$|The pachyostosis seen in {{the bones}} of Mesosaurus may have enabled it to reach neutral {{buoyancy}} in the upper few meters of the water column. The additional weight may have stabilized the animal at the water's surface. Alternatively, it could have given Mesosaurus greater momentum when gliding underwater. While many features suggest a wholly aquatic lifestyle, Mesosaurus may {{have been able to}} move onto land for short periods of time. The elbows and ankles had restricted movement, making walking impossible. It is more likely that if Mesosaurus moved onto land, it would push itself forward in a similar way to living female sea turtles when <b>nesting</b> on beaches.Fossil <b>embryos</b> of Mesosaurus have been discovered in Uruguay and Brazil. These fossils are the earliest record of amniote embryos, although amniotes are inferred to have had this reproductive strategy since their first appearance in the Late Carboniferous. Prior to their description, the oldest known amniotic embryos were from the Triassic. The embryo fossils of Mesosaurus are not surrounded by egg shells, suggesting that Mesosaurus, like many other marine reptiles, gave live birth. If this interpretation is correct, these embryos represent the earliest known example of vivipary in the fossil record. One Mesosaurus specimen called MCN-PV 2214 clearly preserves a medium-size adult and a small embryo in utero. Other specimens include small individuals, which may be embryonic, in association with the bones of larger individuals that may be their parents.|$|R
40|$|Analyses of {{allozyme}} and mitochondrial {{nucleotide sequence}} variation in Philoria from northeastern NSW and southeastern Queensland revealed {{that there are}} more species than the three that are currently recognized. In addition to the three species presently recognized P. kundagungan, P. loveridgei, and P. sphagnicolus, another two species P pughi n. sp. and P. richmondensis n. sp. were recognized under the evolutionary species concept. All species are allopatric. Each of the five species had two or more fixed genetic differences with all other species. Additionally, each species possessed two or more unique allozyme characters (apomorphies). Each species had strongly supported reciprocally monophyletic mitochondrial haplotypes in comparison with each of the other species. Multivariate morphometric analysis was able to distinguish P. sphagnicolus from the remaining four northern taxa but was unsuccessful in reliably distinguishing the two new species. Mating call analysis identified two distinct call groups: P. sphagnicolus and the remaining species, the latter showing little discrimination between species. The distribution of Philoria in NSW and Queensland shows a strong association with high rainfall rainforest at mid to high altitudes (above 600 m elevation). The habitat of all species is remarkably similar, all are found predominantly in the headwaters of rainforest streams or soaks on the forest floor. All species lay their eggs in nests in the ground, where the larvae remain throughout their entire development until they emerge post metamorphosis. It was confirmed that <b>nests</b> where the <b>embryos</b> were at an early stage of development were of two types: foaming egg masses, and nests containing a non-foaming jelly substance. All species are limited in their distribution. In particular P richmondensis is in need of special conservation consideration, as it is known from only three localities within a very small range. A number of populations in southeastern Queensland and northern NSW await molecular analysis to be identified with certainty...|$|R
40|$|The Lourinha Formation, {{cropping}} out on {{the western}} shore of Portugal, dated from the Late Kimmeridgian to latest Tithonian-earliest Berriasian, has produced an extensive record of fossil vertebrates, including nine localities with <b>nests,</b> eggs and <b>embryos.</b> In four of these localities, Paimogo N and S, Casal da Rola and Peralta, associated with dinosaur egg material, several thinner eggshell fragments were recovered. Besides the fragments, 3 partial eggs were found. In a fifth locality, in Cambelas, a nest with 13 mostly well preserved eggs was recovered. In average, these eggs are 42 mm long and 26 mm wide. A preliminary observation suggested a crocodilian affiliation based on eggshell features such as tabular ultrastructure, wedge-shaped shell units and triangular blocky extinction. We found that, excluding the small nest, all the samples exhibit a clear, outer diagenetic layer (DL) with recrystallized and secondary calcite. The typical crocodiloid ultrastructure and shell units are present, although faint and not always clearly defined; strong sub-horizontal fracturing precludes a more extensive description. No ultrastructure is observable in the nest sample. The presence of basal plate group knobs on the inner eggshell surface are also diagnostic. Three layers can be differentiated {{in three of the}} samples, with an inner or mammillary layer corresponding to the dark basal knobs, a medium layer characterized by the presence of the tabular ultrastructure, and an outer layer, below the DL, distinguishable from the medium layer by a darker thin band. Furthermore, all the samples show the distinct triangular blocky alternating extinction. The thicknesses range between 163 μm and 392 μm, which is consistent with values for fossil crocodiloid eggshells. The density of the mammillae is very similar to what is observable in extant eggshells, as are the pores, with long, straight canals. Moreover, the ellipsoid shape of the eggs is typically crocodilian, even though such shape is shared with some dinosaur eggs. Thus, this analysis allows us to ascribe it to the oofamily Krokolithidae, making it the oldest crocodylomorph eggs known so far, as well as the best record for eggs of non-crocodylian crocodylomorphs. Based on the morphological characters, we tentatively assign it to the oogenus Krokolithes. The structure of crocodilian eggshells is very conservative and has seemingly remained unchanged since at least the Late Jurassic...|$|R
