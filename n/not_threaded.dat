60|$|Don Camillo Monforte landed {{near the}} retired graves of the proscribed. As {{he wished to}} ascend the low sand-hills, which have been thrown up by the waves and the winds of the gulf on {{the outer edge of}} the Lido, it was {{necessary}} that he should pass directly across the contemned spot, or make such a circuit as would have been inconvenient. Crossing himself, with a superstition that was interwoven with all his habits and opinions, and loosening his rapier, in order that he might not miss the succor of that good weapon at need, he moved across the heath tenanted by the despised dead, taking care to avoid the mouldering heaps of earth which lay above the bones of heretic or Jew. He had <b>not</b> <b>threaded</b> more than half the graves, however, when a human form arose from the grass, and seemed to walk like one who mused on the moral that the piles at his feet would be apt to excite. Again Don Camillo touched the handle of his rapier; then moving aside, in a manner to give himself an equal advantage from the light of the moon, he drew near the stranger. His footstep was heard, for the other paused, regarded the approaching cavalier, and folding his arms, as it might be in sign of neutrality, awaited his nearer approach.|$|E

50|$|The screw has a multi-start thread. The rollers and {{encapsulating}} {{rotating ring}} are identically grooved, <b>not</b> <b>threaded,</b> {{so there is}} no axial movement between the two. The nut assembly includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings.

50|$|Initial {{problems}} with this lug cracking drove further development of the M1922 resulting in the final M2 version. the main distinguishing change in the M2 variant was the incorporation of an adjustable headspace mechanism in the locking lug. This mechanism consisted of an Allen key screw that passed through the locking lug bearing against the right rear receiver wall. This headspace screw was locked in place, after adjustment, by a brass pin that bore against headspace screws' threads. the brass pin was <b>not</b> <b>threaded</b> but {{held in place by}} a lead plug. The lead plug shows a small eagle that was pressed into the plug by the special tool used by the armourer. If the eagle was disturbed the armourer would know that an attempt had been made to change the headspace by unauthorised personnel.|$|E
50|$|The {{order of}} {{installation}} of a typical headset follows. The steerer tube is cut to the appropriate length by the bicycle fork manufacturer and the top 1-2 inch cm of the steerer is threaded using a rolling process. This process assures that no material is lost and the steerer would not be weakened as with a die or lathe cutting. Threaded forks necessitate that the threads on the steerer only use the top 1-2 inches, therefore the forks are sold in varying lengths. If {{there is a need}} to use a fork that is too long, meaning the fork steerer is <b>not</b> <b>threaded</b> down far enough, a bicycle mechanic can use a die to extend the threads. This is not recommended if the threads need to be cut farther than an inch or so. As a side note, one should never try to thread an unthreaded steerer after manufacturing as this will weaken the steerer tube. The threads are normally of the ISO standard, 1 in by 24 tpi, but other standards exist. The headtube may be faced and then the cups are pressed into the headtube using a special press that ensures they are square and true. The fork crown may be faced and then the crown race is pressed on to the fork crown with a special press that also makes sure that it is square and true. Then the bearings are placed on top of the crown race, after which the steerer tube is inserted into the headtube. The upper bearings are placed in the upper cup, and the upper race is screwed onto the steerer. A washer, frequently a keyed washer, is placed on top of the upper race and a locknut is screwed on top of that.|$|E

40|$|Most {{multitasking}} models {{make use}} of executive processes to assign resources to tasks (Kieras et al., 2000). An alternative is to have no executive, but constrain individual processes so that they share resources in a plausible way. Salvucci and Taatgen (under revision) in their theory of threaded cognition have shown how peripheral resources and declarative memory are shared between processes without an executive. In this paper we will extend this work by showing how two tasks share a resource to store the problem representation in a dualtask paradigm where either task sometimes needs a problem representation and sometimes <b>not.</b> <b>Threaded</b> cognition predicts extra interference when both tasks need a problem representation, {{which is what we}} found in the experiment...|$|E

The chapter {{examines the}} claims that the framework is not about a staged notion of development, and relates this to its vision of what education is for and how parents should be involved. As well as challenging the norm based notions of development and assessment underpinning the EYFS, the chapter questions why difference is <b>not</b> <b>threaded</b> through the document but emerges as an occasional add on. It also highlights the challenges which emerge in relation to equitable access to support {{at a time when}} there is a shift away from centralised systems towards an increasing diversification of provision. It questions whether the processes the framework encourages practitioners to undertake will result in more effective practice which is genuinely responsive to the learning needs of children and relevant to practitioners...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} was to establish the nature of choice in cognitive multitasking. Background: Laboratory studies of multitasking suggest people are rational in their switch choices regarding multitasking, whereas observational studies suggest they are <b>not.</b> <b>Threaded</b> cognition theory predicts that switching is opportunistic and depends on availability of cognitive resources. Method: A total of 21 participants answered e-mails by looking up information (similar to customer service employees) while being interrupted by chat messages. They were free to choose when to switch to the chat message. We analyzed the switching behavior and the time they needed to complete the primary mail task. Results: When participants {{are faced with a}} delay in the e-mail task, they switch more often to the chat task at high-workload points. Choosing to switch to the secondary task instead of waiting makes them slower. It also makes them forget the information in the e-mail task half of the time, which slows them down even more. Conclusion: When many cognitive resources are available, the probability of switching from one task to another is high. This does not necessarily lead to optimal switching behavior. Application: Potential applications of this research include the minimization of delays in task design and the inability or discouragement of switching in high-workload moments...|$|E

40|$|Human Exo 1 is {{a member}} of the RAD 2 {{nuclease}} family with roles in replication, repair and recombination. Despite sharing significant amino acid sequence homology, the RAD 2 proteins exhibit disparate nuclease properties and biological functions. In order to identify elements that dictate substrate selectivity within the RAD 2 family, we sought to identify residues key to Exo 1 nuclease activity and to characterize the molecular details of the human Exo 1 –DNA interaction. Site-specific mutagenesis studies demonstrate that amino acids D 78, D 173 and D 225 are critical for Exo 1 nuclease function. In addition, we show that the chemical nature of the 5 ′-terminus has a major impact on Exo 1 nuclease efficiency, with a 5 ′-phosphate group stimulating degradation 10 -fold and a 5 ′-biotin inhibiting degradation 10 -fold (relative to a 5 ′-hydroxyl moiety). An abasic lesion located within a substrate DNA strand impedes Exo 1 nucleolytic degradation, and a 5 ′-terminal abasic residue reduces nuclease efficiency 2 -fold. Hydroxyl radical footprinting indicates that Exo 1 binds predominantly along the minor groove of flap DNA, downstream of the junction. As will be discussed, our results favor the notion that the single-stranded DNA structure is pinched by the helical arch of the protein and <b>not</b> <b>threaded</b> through this key recognition loop. Furthermore, our studies indicate that significant, presumably biologically relevant, differences exist between the active site dynamics of Exo 1 and Fen 1...|$|E
40|$|Schools {{of nursing}} {{educators}} {{are faced with}} redesigning nursing education to meet the complexity of implementing communication and patient- centered care to improve patient safety. This qualitative case study addressed the problem that teaching communication and patient- centered care were <b>not</b> <b>threaded</b> throughout curriculum, which left many new graduates nurses unprepared. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand classroom experiences of new graduate nurses to meet performance outcomes. The research questions focused on understanding the classroom experiences of new graduates 2 ̆ 7 of a nursing program by assessing the two concepts and how to address preparatory practices. The target populations were new graduates 2 ̆ 7 of nursing programs who had been working in a hospital for less than 1 year and are registered nurses. Emergent themes regarding the new graduates classroom experiences strengths and areas of improvements were extracted from the 10 participants interview questions, and practice experiences from the journal recordings were manually coded, validated, triangulated, and member checked with eight themes that emerged from face-to-face interviews, theoretical frameworks, and the current literature. The researcher determined that the new graduates 2 ̆ 7 nurses were self-motivated to implement communication and patient centered care, however incorporating the two concepts in the class instructions would be a safer preparatory experience. This study may contribute to positive social change through raising awareness regarding the overall standard of nursing education, which may lead to a reevaluation of nursing curricula and teaching strategies so that new graduate nurses may master the complexity of clinical practices resulting in positive performance outcome...|$|E
40|$|Silicon-carbide- (SiC-) based power devices {{could enable}} {{substantial}} aerospace electronics benefits over today's silicon-based electronics. However, present-day SiC wafers contain electrically harmful dislocations (including micropipes) that are unpredictably distributed in high densities across all commercial 4 H- and 6 H-SiC wafers. The NASA Glenn Research Center recently demonstrated a crystal growth process that moves SiC wafer dislocations to predetermined lateral positions in epitaxial layers {{so that they}} can be reproducibly avoided during subsequent SiC electronic device fabrication. The process starts by reactive ion etching mesa patterns with enclosed trench regions into commercial on-axis (0001) 4 H- or 6 H-SiC substrates. An example of a pregrowth mesa geometry with six enclosed triangular-shaped trench regions is shown. After the etch mask is stripped, homoepitaxial growth is carried out in pure stepflow conditions that enable thin cantilevers to grow laterally from the tops of mesas whose pregrowth top surfaces are <b>not</b> <b>threaded</b> by substrate screw dislocations. The image in the bottom figure shows the postgrowth structure that forms after the lateral cantilevers expand to coalesce and completely roof over each of the six triangular trench regions. Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements of the roof revealed that three elementary screw dislocation growth spirals, each shown in the AFM insets of the bottom image on the previous page, formed in the film roof at three respective points of cantilever film coalescence. The image above shows the structure following an etch in molten potassium hydroxide (KOH) that produced surface etch pits at the dislocation defects. The larger KOH etch pits [...] S 1, S 2, and S 3 [...] shown in this image correspond to screw dislocations relocated to the final points of cantilever coalescence. The smaller KOH etch pits are consistent with epilayer threading edge dislocations from the pregrowth substrate mesa (P 1, P 3, and P 4) and a final cantilever coalescence point (P 2). No defects (i. e., no etch pits) are observed in other cantilevered portions of the film surface. On the basis of the principle of dislocation Burgers vector conservation, we hypothesize that all vertically propagating substrate dislocations in an enclosed trench region become combined into a single dislocation in the webbed film roof at the point of final roof coalescence. The point of final roof coalescence, and therefore the lateral location of a webbed roof dislocation, can be designed into the pregrowth mesa pattern. Screw dislocations with predetermined lateral positions can then be used to provide the new growth steps necessary for growing a 4 H/ 6 H-SiC epilayer with a lower dislocation density than the substrate. Devices fabricated on top of such films can be positioned to avoid the preplaced dislocations...|$|E
