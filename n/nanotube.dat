The method utilizes separation agents that preferentially associate with semiconducting <b>nanotubes</b> {{due to the}} electrical nature of the <b>nanotubes.</b> The separation agents are those that have a planar orientation,. pi. -electrons available for association with {{the surface of the}} <b>nanotubes,</b> and also include a soluble portion of the molecule.

5|$|The {{spectral}} range of PL is rather wide. Emission wavelength can vary between 0.8 and 2.1 micrometers {{depending on the}} <b>nanotube</b> structure.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and <b>nanotube</b> — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon <b>nanotube</b> can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E

30|$|In summary, the {{symmetry}} properties of BC 2 N <b>nanotubes</b> were discussed based on line group. All BC 2 N <b>nanotubes</b> possess nonsymmorphic line groups, just like carbon <b>nanotubes</b> [8] and boron nitride <b>nanotubes</b> [11]. Contrary to carbon and boron nitride <b>nanotubes,</b> armchair and zigzag BC 2 N <b>nanotubes</b> belong to different line groups, {{depending on the}} index n (even or odd) and the vector chosen. By utilizing the symmetries of the factor groups of the line groups, {{it was found that}} all ZZ- 1 BC 2 N <b>nanotubes</b> have 30 Raman- and 18 IR- active phonon modes; all AC- 1 BC 2 N <b>nanotubes</b> have 19 Raman- and 10 IR-active phonon modes; all ZZ- 2, AC- 2, and other chiral BC 2 N <b>nanotubes</b> have 33 Raman- and 21 IR-active phonon modes. It is noticed that the numbers of Raman- and IR- active phonon modes in ZZ- 1 BC 2 N <b>nanotubes</b> are almost twice as in AC- 1 BC 2 N <b>nanotubes,</b> but which is almost the same as those in chiral, ZZ- 2, and AC- 2 BC 2 N <b>nanotubes.</b> The situation in BC 2 N <b>nanotubes</b> is different from that in carbon or boron nitride <b>nanotubes</b> [8, 11].|$|R
40|$|AbstractCommunication between {{cells is}} crucial for proper {{functioning}} of multicellular organisms. The recently discovered membranous tubes, named tunneling <b>nanotubes,</b> that directly bridge neighboring cells may offer a very specific and effective way of intercellular communication. Our experiments on RT 4 and T 24 urothelial cell lines show that <b>nanotubes</b> that bridge neighboring cells {{can be divided into}} two types. The <b>nanotubes</b> of type I are shorter and more dynamic than those of type II, and they contain actin filaments. They are formed when cells explore their surroundings to make contact with another cell. The <b>nanotubes</b> of type II are longer and more stable than type I, and they have cytokeratin filaments. They are formed when two already connected cells start to move apart. On the <b>nanotubes</b> of both types, small vesicles were found {{as an integral part of}} the <b>nanotubes</b> (that is, dilatations of the <b>nanotubes).</b> The dilatations of type II <b>nanotubes</b> do not move along the <b>nanotubes,</b> whereas the <b>nanotubes</b> of type I frequently have dilatations (gondolas) that move along the <b>nanotubes</b> in both directions.

These technologies include magnetic alignment of nanotubes, fabrication of <b>nanotube</b> membranes or buckypapers, production of <b>nanotube</b> composites, modeling of nanotube-epoxy interaction at the molecular level, and characterization of SWNT nanocomposites for mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, thermal management, radiation shielding and EMI attenuation.

5|$|Position of the (S22,S11) PL peaks depends {{slightly}} (within 2%) on the <b>nanotube</b> environment (air, dispersant, etc.). However, {{the shift}} {{depends on the}} (n,m) index, and thus the whole PL map not only shifts, but also warps upon changing the CNT medium.|$|E
5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single <b>nanotube</b> have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the <b>nanotube</b> structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E

5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} {{are attached to}} a <b>nanotube,</b> electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies.

5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon <b>nanotube</b> characterization.

Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Semiconducting single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually {{occurs as}} follows: an electron in a <b>nanotube</b> absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a c1−v1 transition resulting in light emission.|$|E

For the same deposition charge density, PPy films and <b>nanotubes</b> grow relatively faster vertically, while PEDOT films and <b>nanotubes</b> grow more laterally. For the same deposition charge density (1. 44 [*]C cm − 2), PPy <b>nanotubes</b> and PEDOT <b>nanotubes</b> have lower impedance (19. 5 [*]±[*] 2. 1 [*]kΩ for PPy <b>nanotubes</b> and 2. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 4 [*]kΩ for PEDOT <b>nanotubes</b> at 1 [*]kHz) and higher CCD (184 [*]±[*] 5. 3 [*]mC cm − 2 for PPy <b>nanotubes</b> and 392 [*]±[*] 6. 2 [*]mC cm − 2 for PEDOT <b>nanotubes)</b> compared to their film counterparts. However, PEDOT <b>nanotubes</b> decrease the impedance of neural-electrode sites by about two orders of magnitude (bare iridium 468. 8 [*]±[*] 13. 3 [*]kΩ at 1 [*]kHz) and increase capacity of charge density by about three orders of magnitude (bare iridium 0. 1 [*]±[*] 0. 5 [*]mC cm − 2).

Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices.

However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.|$|E
5|$|Interaction between {{nanotubes}} {{or between}} a <b>nanotube</b> and another material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes.

However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only from the outer shells. Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only. Detachment of the tubes from the substrate drastically increases PL.|$|E

A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the <b>nanotube</b> diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter.

One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{absorption}} {{in carbon}} nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify <b>nanotube</b> types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E
