25|$|The Soviet Union was {{the other}} ally of the Viet Minh, {{supplying}} GAZ trucks, truck engines, fuel, tires, arms (thousands of Skoda light machine guns), all kind of ammunitions, anti-aircraft guns (4 x 37mm type) and cigarettes. During Operation Hirondelle, the French Union paratroopers captured and destroyed tons of Soviet supplies in the Ky Lua area. According to General Giap, the Viet Minh used 400 GAZ-51 soviet-built trucks {{at the battle of}} Dien Bien Phu. Because the trucks were using highly effective camouflage, the French Union reconnaissance planes were not able to <b>notice</b> <b>them.</b> On May 6, 1954, during the siege, Katyusha were successfully used against the outpost. Together with China, the Soviet Union sent 2,000 military advisors to train the Viet Minh {{and turn it into a}} fully organized army.|$|E
25|$|Centaur was {{anchored}} in Fort Royal Bay, Martinique, when {{on the morning}} of 1 December she sighted a schooner towing a sloop. The pair were about six miles away and Hood believed that {{they were on their way}} to St. Pierre. He therefore instructed Maxwell to take Centaur in pursuit. Their prey did not initially <b>notice</b> <b>them,</b> but when they did, the schooner let go her tow and the vessels separated. After a pursuit that extended over 24 leagues, Centaur captured the schooner. She turned out to be the privateer Ma Sophie, out of Guadeloupe. She had a crew of 46 men and had had eight guns that she had thrown overboard during the chase in an attempt to increase her speed. When Ma Sophie and the sloop separated, Centaur sent the Sarah, an advice boat, after the sloop, which she captured..|$|E

25|$|Characters {{have five}} characteristics, Strength, Dexterity, Willpower, Perception, and Intelligence, ranging from 5 to 15, and bought at {{creation}} time with Generation Points. Remaining Generation Points {{are used to}} buy skill levels, and the physical aspects of height, weight and appearance (attractiveness). As characters {{are supposed to be}} secret agents, the less unusual a character's appearance is, the more generation points it costs; distinctive appearances stand out, and earn a character Fame Points which make others, especially villains, <b>notice</b> <b>them</b> more. There are optional rules for character Weaknesses, which gain generation points at the expense of disadvantages, usually psychological (such as Fear of , Superstition, or James Bond's own Attraction to Members of the Opposite Sex), and Fields of Experience, which gains Generation Points simulating a specific prior character history before becoming an operative, at the expense of greater age, and Fame points.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene of}} the battle, Rossbach, lay [...] {{southwest}} of Merseburg on a wide plateau dotted by hillocks with elevations up to [...] [...] The locale was a wide plain largely without trees or hedges. The ground was sandy in some areas, and marshy in others; a small stream ran between Rossbach and Merseburg, south of which rose two low hills, the Janus and the Pölzen. Thomas Carlyle later described these as unimpressive, although certainly horses dragging cannons would <b>notice</b> <b>them,</b> as the animals slipped in loose stones and sand. To the west, the Saale flowed past a small town of Weissenfels, a few miles southeast of Rossbach.|$|E
500|$|The album's sound also {{incorporates}} diverse musical {{elements from}} various genres such as funk, soul, rock, dubstep, and electro music. Houston Press writer Shea Serrano describes the album as a [...] "new {{take on the}} traditional Southern rap sound. It's slow and fast, wonky and flimsy, lyrical and hook-driven". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives [...] "1980s synth-funk" [...] as its predominant musical element, but also finds each track musically varied, stating [...] "New melodic elements flit {{in and out of}} tracks just as you start to <b>notice</b> <b>them,</b> and there's a lot going on at any given moment". Big Boi has called the music [...] "basically what you been getting from Outkast. Raw lyricism and the funkiest grooves you can lay your ears on." ...|$|E

500|$|If danger threatens, {{the chicks}} crouch under a plant or any cover that offers, their dappled brown down merging {{into the desert}} scene. The parents are very {{vigilant}} in defence of their family. If a jackal approaches, an adult gives a warning cry and all crouch down and freeze. Usually the enemy fails to <b>notice</b> <b>them</b> and passes by. If it gets too close, one of the parents tries to lure it away by flapping along the ground, pretending to be injured and helpless. When the jackal has been led far enough away, the adult [...] "recovers" [...] and flies off. After three or four days, the chicks can be left alone while both parents visit the water hole, and the chicks can guide them back with their [...] "queet - queet" [...] cries.|$|E
500|$|Before {{principal}} photography, {{the cast}} and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts. Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention. [...] "At one point, I even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," [...] says Moore. Despite the actors wearing the same clothes for days on end, Moore told the Los Angeles Times, park personnel never appeared to <b>notice</b> <b>them,</b> save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were paparazzi harassing a celebrity family.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} Mermaid Ball concert tour's setlist, [...] "Jumanji" [...] was {{performed}} several times on the aforementioned tour. Banks performed the song at the Bowery Ballroom on June 4, 2012, {{as part of her}} Mermaid Ball tour's setlist, with a pair of athletic backup dancers. Corban Goble of Stereogum criticized the use of dancers, inferring Banks [...] them, citing, [...] " [...] it was hard to <b>notice</b> <b>them</b> when they flanked Banks, such was the magnetism of Banks's onstage exercise". Goble also noted the crowd's reaction to the song, stating it [...] "elicited the a satisfied sigh of recognition from the audience when the first bars dropped". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly praised the performance, saying, [...] "Things jumped off when she ripped into her Internet hit 'Jumanji'". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard opined that the performance [...] "thumped like a wild animal". Another time the song {{was performed}} was, again, a part of the Mermaid Ball, at the Fonda Theatre on July 14, 2012. Ernest Hardy of the Los Angeles Times lauded the performance, comparing Banks's vocal delivery on both [...] "Jumanji" [...] and [...] "Esta Noche" [...] to that of Lil' Kim's. Hardy continued with his praise, citing, Banks was [...] "owning the crowd", and that her [...] "breath control was impeccable". Another performance of [...] "Jumanji" [...] was on October 13, 2012, at the Sea Life Centre London Aquarium in London. In an article about the show written for MTV UK's website, Emma Knock called the lyrics to the performance a [...] "real crowd pleaser", and noticed the crowd [...] "did their best to sing along to the likes of 'Jumanji'".|$|E

500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even <b>notice</b> <b>them.</b> But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of their}} large scale, forest rings are not {{apparent}} from the ground, {{and it was}} not until aerial photography became a common surveying tool in the 1950s that geologists began to <b>notice</b> <b>them.</b> The term [...] "forest ring" [...] was coined by The Ontario Geological Survey to differentiate the phenomenon from fairy rings.|$|E

[...] Jackson asked Carthy in a more direct and pleading tone, noted in its distinct nature by witnesses, to drop the weapon. [...] Jackson reluctantly drew his SIG Sauer pistol and attempted to bring Carthy down without killing him, with two shots to his legs. [...] These shots did not bring him down and he appeared not to <b>notice</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Cherryh uses {{a writing}} {{technique}} she has variously labeled [...] "very tight limited third person", [...] "intense third person", and [...] "intense internal" [...] voice. In this approach, {{the only things}} the writer narrates are those that the viewpoint character specifically notices or thinks about. If a starship captain arrives at a space station, for example, the narration may not mention important features of the station with which the captain is already familiar, even though these things might {{be of interest to}} the reader, because the captain does not <b>notice</b> <b>them</b> or think about them due to their familiarity. This technique can offer a similar experience to that of reading the viewpoint character's mind—sometimes at great length—and thus it can resemble stream of consciousness narrative.|$|E
2500|$|Portkeys {{are used}} if witches or wizards {{are unable to}} Apparate, whether that be because {{they are unable to}} or because they have an underage witch or wizard in their company. Portkeys can be almost anything, usually a mundane, {{everyday}} object that would easily be overlooked by a muggle. Using the charm [...] "Portus," [...] they are able to carry the user to their destination, so long as the user has hold of the object upon leaving. Portkeys are able to carry multiple people at once, an example being in [...] "The Goblet of Fire" [...] when Harry, Hermione Granger, the Weasleys and the Diggorys travel to the Quidditch World Cup. Portkeys are usually disguised as trash like a tin can or old sock so Muggles won't <b>notice</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common forms of herpes {{are caused by}} {{infection}} with herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores, HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals, however either strain may affect either site. Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually <b>notice</b> <b>them</b> 2 to 20 days after exposure which last 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, Flu like symptoms, swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms, however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact. The primary attack is the most severe because the body {{does not have any}} antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission (Valtrex). Although HSV-1 is typically the [...] "oral" [...] version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the [...] "genital" [...] version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally CAN transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will settle into a nerve bundle either {{at the top of the}} spine, producing the [...] "oral" [...] outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.|$|E
