25|$|No single {{treatment}} {{works for}} all cases, probably {{because there is}} no single cause for all cases. The degenerative changes are usually quite advanced by the time the horse is consistently lame, and these changes are believed to be <b>non-reversible.</b> At this time, it is best to manage the condition and focus on alleviating pain and slowing the degeneration.|$|E
25|$|A {{booster engine}} for steam {{locomotives}} {{is a small}} two-cylinder steam engine back-gear-connected to the trailing truck axle on the locomotive or, if none, the lead truck on the tender. A rocking idler gear permits it {{to be put into}} operation by the engineer. It would drive one axle only and could be <b>non-reversible</b> with one idler gear or reversible with two idler gears.|$|E
25|$|A yield {{strength}} or yield stress is the material property {{defined as the}} stress at which a material begins to deform plastically whereas yield point is the point where nonlinear (elastic + plastic) deformation begins. Prior to the yield point the material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed. Once the yield point is passed, some fraction of the deformation will be permanent and <b>non-reversible.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the reactive species generated by the radiation can take part in following reactions, this is similar to the idea of the non-electrochemical reactions which follow the electrochemical event which is observed in cyclic voltammetry when a <b>non-reversible</b> event occurs. For example, the SF5 radical formed by the reaction of solvated electrons and SF6 undergo further reactions which lead to the formation of hydrogen fluoride and sulfuric acid.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{degree of}} sclerotisation or {{mineralisation}} determines how the cuticle responds to deformation. [...] Below {{a certain degree}} of deformation changes of shape or dimension of the cuticle are elastic and the original shape returns after the stress is removed. [...] Beyond that level of deformation, <b>non-reversible,</b> plastic deformation occurs until finally the cuticle cracks or splits. Generally, the less sclerotised the cuticle, the greater the deformation required to damage the cuticle irreversibly. On the other hand, the more heavily the cuticle is armoured, the greater the stress required to deform it harmfully.|$|E

This symbolises the calls of Allahu Akbar {{on the night of}} 22 Bahman (11 February 1979) when the national radio of Iran broadcast: [...] "From Tehran, the voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran" [...] and marked the unofficial beginning of the Islamic Republic (with the official day being 2 May). This writing renders the flag <b>non-reversible.</b>|$|E
2500|$|High {{frequency}} {{stimulation of}} a neuron {{over a long}} period of time causes two resulting neuronal changes. [...] Initially, the neuron responds as it would during short-term stimulation, with an increase in excitability. [...] Continuing the high frequency stimulation after this point, results in a drastic, <b>non-reversible</b> change in excitability. [...] When sodium concentrations reach a high enough level in the axon, sodium/calcium pumps reverse their direction of flow, causing calcium to be imported into the cell as sodium is exported out. [...] The increased calcium concentration (and subsequent depolarization of the membrane) inactivates sodium channels and targets them for endocytosis and lysosomal hydrolysis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resistive}} element {{is made from}} a mixture of finely powdered carbon and an insulating material, usually ceramic. [...] A resin holds the mixture together. [...] The resistance {{is determined by the}} ratio of the fill material (the powdered ceramic) to the carbon. [...] Higher concentrations of carbon, which is a good conductor, result in lower resistance. Carbon composition resistors were commonly used in the 1960s and earlier, but are not popular for general use now as other types have better specifications, such as tolerance, voltage dependence, and stress. Carbon composition resistors change value when stressed with over-voltages. Moreover, if internal moisture content, from exposure for some length of time to a humid environment, is significant, soldering heat creates a <b>non-reversible</b> change in resistance value. [...] Carbon composition resistors have poor stability with time and were consequently factory sorted to, at best, only 5% tolerance.|$|E

It also features a manual-override stop-button. Using programs running on the host computer, the user could create stationary programmable robotic Lego inventions using the older 4.5V system.
