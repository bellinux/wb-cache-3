50|$|In {{all cases}} the King ('mir' or 'shah') {{is always the}} strongest card in each suit, {{followed}} by the Vizier. However, in half the suits the <b>numerical</b> <b>cards</b> rank in logical order from 10 strongest (just below the Vizier), down to 1 (weakest), and the other suits {{the order of the}} <b>numerical</b> <b>cards</b> is reversed, with the ace strongest (just below the Vizier), and the 10 weakest, thus giving the order K,V,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. If playing with a Moghul type pack, the suits with the 'reverse order' <b>numerical</b> <b>cards</b> are barat, zar-e zorkh, qomash, and chang (bills, red gold coins, cloth, and harps) in India; in Iran, zar-e safīd (white coins) were inverted instead of the red coins. In Dashavtar packs the suits with reversed cards are the first avatars, Matsya, Kutchha, Varaha, Nrusinha and Waman (fish, turtle, boar, lion and round vessel symbols).|$|R

5000|$|Due to the German {{influence}} the Russian standard deck contains only 36 cards from 6 to the ace.

50|$|The cards {{used by the}} Mamluks {{most likely}} entered Italy and Spain during the 1370s. As early as 1895, William Henry Wilkinson pointed out the {{similarities}} between Spanish and Italian playing cards and Chinese money-suited cards. He {{was unaware of the}} existence of the Mamluk cards since Mayer did not make his discovery until 1939. The similarities between the Latin European cards and Chinese money-suited cards become more apparent when the Mamluk Kanjifa is described. Looking at the actual games played with Ganjifa cards, Andrew Leibs points out that the cards are divided into strong and weak suits, and in one set the order of the <b>numerical</b> <b>cards</b> is reversed, so that the order runs King, Vizier, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 the weakest. This feature can also be found in the old games of Tarot, Ombre, and Maw played in Europe, and the Chinese money-suited card game of 'Madiao'. He suggests these games may have a common ancestor.|$|R

25|$|If {{the best}} hand {{is shared by}} more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in {{clockwise}} order. It is common for players to have closely valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be careful in determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as two pair or three of a kind), then kickers are used to settle ties (see the second example below). The <b>card's</b> <b>numerical</b> rank is of sole importance; suit values are irrelevant in hold 'em.|$|R

The designated shooter can be identified by palm or fingerprint, <b>numerical</b> code, swipe <b>card</b> or voice recognition. The gun is capable of firing multiple projectiles which can include traditional bullets as well as pesticides, fertilisers, fireworks, fire-retardants and other rapid-delivery packages. The gun also features an electronic voice that tells the shooter which firing mode the gun is in.|$|R

Then turn top card on right stack, and see if it can be used. If not, place face up in discard pile (center stack). Opponent gets his turn. If opponent's card is of the same suit and color (or any card on table except for cards on the Aces in the center) he can give that card to the other players either pile {{as long as it is}} still in numerical order up or down.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the standard bilinear finite element method (FEM) and the corresponding streamline diffusion FEM for the singularly perturbed elliptic boundary value problem-e(O 2 u/Ox 2 + O 2 u/Oy 2) -b(x, y). Vu + a(x, y) u =f(x, y) in the two space dimen- sions. By using the asymptotic expansion method of ishik and Lyustemik [36] and the technique we used in [21, 22], we prove that the standard bilinear FEM on a Shishkin type mesh achieves first-order uniform convergence rate globally in L 2 norm for both the ordinary exponential boundary layer case and the parabolic boundary layer case. Extensive <b>numerical</b> results are <b>carded</b> out for both cases. The results show that our methods perform much better than either the classical standard or streamline diffusion FEM. 1998 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The hands {{numerical}} score, taem (แต้ม), {{is determined}} by the numerical values of the cards in hand. In terms of each <b>cards</b> <b>numerical</b> values, each ace has a value of one. 2 through 9 have corresponding values of two through nine. 10, jack, queen, and king each have a value of zero or ten. Taem, the numerical value of the overall hand, is simply the ones digit of the sum of the cards, which is why it does not matter whether the 10, jack, queen, and king count as zero or ten. For example, a hand consisting of a 3 and a 2 has a value of five taem. Likewise, a hand consisting of a 7 and an 8 has a value of five taem because the sum, fifteen, has a ones digit of five. A hand with a jack and a 5 also has a value of five taem because the sum, either five or fifteen, has a ones digit of five.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} exposes an analytical, numerical, and {{experimental}} investigation on the failure mechanism, {{pertaining to the}} stable mode of collapse (Mode I), of thin-walled composite truncated conical tubes subjected to axial loading in order to predict the mean loads and total displacements during collapse. The analysis is based on previous research results with the attempt to eliminate some simplifications dictated by experimental evidence and improve the modeling from the mathematical point of view. The theoretical modeling identifies the main internal absorbing energy contributions and equals their sum to the work done by the external load. From this {{it is possible to}} explicit the average load, that is a function of several variables. From a minimization process it is possible to obtain the values of the variables that identify the crushing behavior. Together with the theoretical analysis, a finite element modeling is conducted through an explicit dynamic code, such as LS-DYNA. It is possible to capture also numerically the crushing phenomenon with a particular attention during the setting of the <b>numerical</b> parameters and <b>card</b> definitions. The model’s accuracy can be estimated only through an experimental campaign; therefore circular frusta in CFRP material varying some geometrical parameters, such as wall thickness, mean radius, and slope, were tested under axial dynamic loadings. Comparison between analytical, numerical, and experimental investigation as regards mean load and final crushing is good, indicating that the proposed strategy can be a valid approach to predict the energy-absorbing capability of the axially collapsing composite shells, despite the complexity of the phenomenon...|$|R
6000|$|In {{addition}} {{the child}} {{should be able to}} count, [Footnote: There {{can be little doubt that}} many of us were taught to count very badly, and that we were hampered in our arithmetic throughout life by this defect. Counting should be taught be means of small cubes, which the child can arrange and rearrange in groups. It should have at least over a hundred of these cubes--if possible a thousand; they will be useful as toy bricks, and for innumerable purposes. Our civilization is now wedded to a decimal system of counting, and, to begin with, it will be well to teach the child to count up to ten and to stop there for a time. It is suggested by Mrs. Mary Everest Boole that it is very confusing to have distinctive names for eleven and twelve, which the child is apt to class with the single numbers and contrast with the teens, and she proposes at the beginning (The Cultivation of the Mathematical Imagination, Colchester: Benham & Co.) to use the words [...] "one-ten," [...] "two-ten," [...] thirteen, fourteen, etc., for the second decade in counting. Her proposal is entirely in harmony with the general drift of the admirably suggestive diagrams of number order collected by Mr. Francis Gallon. Diagram after diagram displays the same hitch at twelve, the predominance in the mind of an individualized series over quantitatively equal spaces until the twenties are attained. Many diagrams also display the mental scar of the clock face, the early counting is overmuch associated with a dial. One might perhaps head off the establishment of that image, and supply a more serviceable foundation for memories by equipping the nursery with a vertical scale of numbers divided into equal parts up to two or three hundred, with each decade tinted. When the child has learnt to count up to a hundred with cubes, it should be given an abacus, and it should also be encouraged to count and check quantities with all sorts of things, marbles, apples, bricks in a wall, pebbles, spots on dominoes, and so on; taught to play guessing games with marbles in a hand, and the like. The abacus, the hundred square and the thousand cube, will then in all probability become its cardinal <b>numerical</b> memories. Playing <b>cards</b> (without corner indices) and dominoes supply good recognizable arrangements of numbers, and train a child to grasp a number at a glance. The child should not be taught the Arabic numerals until it has counted for a year or more. Experience speaks here. I know one case only too well of a man who learnt his Arabic numerals prematurely, before he had acquired any sound experimental knowledge of numerical quantity, and, as a consequence, his numerical ideas are incurably associated with the peculiarities of the figures. When he hears the word seven he does not really think of seven or seven-ness at all, even now, he thinks of a number rather like four and very unlike six. Then again, six and nine are mysteriously and unreasonably linked in his mind, and so are three and five. He confuses numbers like sixty-three and sixty-five, and finds it hard to keep seventy-four distinct from forty-seven. Consequently, when it came to the multiplication table, he learnt each table as an arbitrary arrangement of relationships, and with an extraordinary amount of needless labour and punishment. But obviously with cubes or abacus at hand, it would be the easiest thing in the world for a child to construct and learn its own multiplication table whenever the need arose.] it should be capable of some mental and experimental arithmetic, and I am told that a child of five should be able to give the sol-fa names to notes, and sing these names at their proper pitch. Possibly in social intercourse the child will have picked up names for some of the letters of the alphabet, but there is no great hurry for that before five certainly, or even later. There is still a vast amount of things immediately about the child that need to be thoroughly learnt, and a premature attack on letters divides attention from these more appropriate and educational objects. It should, for the reason given in the footnote, be still ignorant of the Arabic numerals. It should be able to handle a pencil and amuse itself with freehand of this sort:--and its mind should be quite uncontaminated by that imbecile drawing upon squared paper by means of which ignorant teachers destroy both the desire and the capacity to sketch in so many little children. Such sketching could be enormously benefited by a really intelligent teacher who would watch the child's efforts, and draw with the child just a little above its level. For example, the teacher might stimulate effort by rejoining to such a sketch as the above, something in this vein:-- ...|$|R
