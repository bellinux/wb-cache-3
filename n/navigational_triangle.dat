5000|$|This only calculates a {{longitude}} at {{the assumed}} latitude though a position {{line can be}} drawn. The observer is somewhere along the position line.Time sight is a general method for determining longitude by celestial observations using a chronometer; these observations are reduced by solving the <b>navigational</b> <b>triangle</b> for meridian angle and require known values for altitude, latitude, and declination; the meridian angle is converted to local hour angle and compared with Greenwich hour angle.|$|E
50|$|Heading is a {{term used}} in {{navigation}} that refers to the direction a vehicle is pointing. This {{may or may not}} be the direction that the vehicle actually travels, which is known as its course or track. Any difference between course and heading is due to the motion of the underlying medium, the air or water, or other effects like skidding or slipping. The difference between heading and course is known as drift, and can be determined by the <b>navigational</b> <b>triangle.</b>|$|E
40|$|Proposals of {{algorithms}} {{for solving}} Navigation faculty’s problems regarding navigation along rhumb line (loxodrome), for officer trainees and civil students of Faculty of Navigation and Naval Weapons and for deck seamen on operational level, {{are presented in}} this paper. Proposals of calculation algorithms given in the article cover simple mathematical totting based on plane sailing (<b>navigational)</b> <b>triangle</b> and Mercator triangle (Mercator sailing). The algorithms refer to traditional methods of solving problems {{and they do not}} cover solutions applicable in automated (integrated) navigational systems. The formulas enable to solve the tasks with a use of electronic calculator and application of traditional methods on plane and sphere, and they also take the Earth’s ellipsoidal shape into consideration...|$|E
50|$|All {{lines of}} {{constant}} bearing (rhumbs or loxodromes—those making constant angles with the meridians) {{are represented by}} straight segments on a Mercator map. The two properties, conformality and straight rhumb lines, make this projection uniquely suited to marine navigation: courses and bearings are measured using wind roses or protractors, and the corresponding directions are easily transferred from point to point, on the map, {{with the help of}} a parallel ruler or a pair of <b>navigational</b> protractor <b>triangles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>navigational</b> or PZX <b>triangle</b> is a {{term used}} in Astro-Navigation, or Celestial Navigation, and its {{solution}} can give you your position anywhere (more or less) on the globe. The sky {{is described as a}} Celestial Sphere with a North and South Pole corresponding to our own North and South Pole. Conveniently, the 'Pole Star' lies (more or less) at the North Pole of the Celestial Sphere.|$|R

This strategy makes use of an instructional aid called MAAPCNIA (MAAP Celestial Navigation Instructional Aid), conceptualized and designed by Capt. Daniel S. Torres, Jr. MAAPCNIA encompasses color-coded spheres that depict <b>navigational</b> <b>triangle.</b> This triangle is composed of a blue celestial sphere representing horizon system of coordinates and a white sphere enclosing a globe characterizing time diagram and celestial equator and terrestrial systems of coordinates. With this instrument, celestial spheres can be easily visualized compared when using one-dimensional drawing. Hence, understanding of orthographic projection, which is essentially the core of appreciation and mastery of this tough subject, is enhanced. This paper focuses on the development and impact of MAAPCNIA since its conception in 2004, towards authentic teaching-learnin...|$|E
