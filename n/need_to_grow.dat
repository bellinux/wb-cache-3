5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst fans in the host countries. During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> up and mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of algae that are intentionally cultivated {{fall into the}} category of microalgae (also referred to as phytoplankton, microphytes, or planktonic algae). Macroalgae, commonly known as seaweed, also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and the specific requirements of the environment in which they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow,</b> they do not lend themselves as readily to cultivation (this may change, however, with the advent of newer seaweed cultivators, which are basically algae scrubbers using upflowing air bubbles in small containers).|$|E
25|$|Even for bonsai {{specimens}} {{that are}} {{native to the}} grower's location, outdoor cultivation requires specific cultivation practices to ensure successful long-term survival of the bonsai. The trees used in bonsai are constrained by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> in a relatively small pot. This state greatly reduces the volume of roots and soil normally available to a freely grown tree, and brings the roots {{much closer to the}} surface of the soil than would occur in the wild. Trees in bonsai pots have much less access to water and to nutrients than they do natively, and physically confining roots changes their growth pattern and indirectly the growth pattern of the tree above the soil.|$|E
25|$|A ribbon {{either side}} of the route from Spalding to Sutton Bridge was {{populated}} in Roman times, and was again evident in the Domesday Book. Enclosing and reclamation of the salt marsh to the north of this area took place from the seventeenth century, and drainage was overseen by the Court of Sewers. In 1793, the South Holland Drainage District was set up by Act of Parliament, and carried out extensive drainage work, but the schemes were hampered by the state of the River Nene outfall. This was replaced in 1832, and allowed the district to lower their own sluice in 1852, to provide better gravity discharge. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> more food during and after the Second World War resulted in large areas of grassland being ploughed up for agriculture, and the drains were made deeper and wider to improve the soil conditions. The main outfall sluice was again rebuilt in 1937, and its construction involved the first use of well point dewatering equipment in England.|$|E

25|$|Neoteny is {{commonly}} seen in flightless insects like the {{females in the}} order Strepsiptera. The flightless trait in insects has evolved many separate times; environments that {{may have contributed to}} the separate evolution of this trait are: high altitudes, isolation on islands, and insects that reside in colder climates. These environmental factors may be responsible for the flightless trait, because in these situations it would be disadvantageous to have a population that is more dispersed, so flightlessness would be favored due to the boundaries it poses to dispersal. Also, in cooler temperatures heat is lost more rapidly through wings, thus the circumstance favors flightlessness. Another couple of main points to note about insects are that the females in certain groups become sexually mature without metamorphosing into adulthood, and some insects which grow up in certain conditions do not ever develop wings. Flightlessness in some female insects has been linked to higher fecundity, this would increase the fitness of the individual because the female is producing more offspring and therefore passing on more of her genes. In those instances, neoteny occurs because it is more advantageous for the females to remain flightless in order to conserve energy which thereby increases their fecundity. Aphids are a great example of insects that may never develop wings due to their environmental setting. If resources are abundant there is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> wings and disperse. When the nutrition of a host plant is abundant, aphids may not grow wings, remaining on the host plant for the duration of their lives; however, if the resources become diminished, their offspring may develop wings in order to disperse to other host plants.|$|E
2500|$|These {{successful}} {{attempts were}} met with enthusiasm in southern France, which possessed the sweet limestone soils and dry, hot weather that truffles <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow.</b> In the late 19th century, an epidemic of phylloxera destroyed many of the vineyards in southern France. Another epidemic killed most of the silkworms there, too, making the fields of mulberry trees useless. Thus, large tracts of land were set free for the cultivation of truffles. Thousands of truffle-producing trees were planted, and production reached peaks of hundreds of tonnes {{at the end of}} the 19th century. In 1890, there were [...] of truffle-producing trees.|$|E

In order to cope with the silty sub-soil in which the foundations had to be built, well point dewatering equipment was used {{for the first time in}} England. This consists of inserting small tubes into the ground and pumping them with a high-efficiency vacuum pump to lower the ground water levels, creating a dry and stable working environment. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> more food during the Second World War led to large areas of low-lying grassland being ploughed up for crops, and this required improved drainage. The Main Drain Improvement Scheme was drawn up in 1942, and widening and deeping of the Main Drain and other channels was carried out. Ten new bridges were required, to accommodate the wider channels, and old brick structures were demolished and replaced by open span bridges. Feeder drains were improved, and the area served by the drainage board increased to [...]|$|E
