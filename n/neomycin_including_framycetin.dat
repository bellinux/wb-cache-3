The data were collected by on-farm interview with owners of 54 case and 54 control herds. Logistic regression was used to study risk factors. The use of dry cow products containing <b>neomycin,</b> <b>including</b> 2 specific dry cow products, was strongly associated with Nocardia mastitis in a herd. Other factors which increased the risk were higher levels of production, larger herd size, and a large percentage of cows treated with dry cow products.

50|$|Aminoglycosides such as {{neomycin}} {{are known}} for their ability to bind to duplex RNA with high affinity. The association constant for neomycin with A-site RNA {{has been found to be}} in the 109 M−1 range. However, more than 50 years after its discovery, its DNA-binding properties were still unknown. Neomycin has been shown to induce thermal stabilization of triplex DNA, while having little or almost no effect on the B-DNA duplex stabilization. Neomycin was also shown to bind to structures that adopt A-form structure, triplex DNA being one of them. <b>Neomycin</b> also <b>includes</b> DNA:RNA hybrid triplex formation.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} among transcription, recombination, DNA damage, and repair in mammalian cells were investigated. We monitored {{the effects of}} transcription on UV-induced intrachromosomal recombination between <b>neomycin</b> repeats <b>including</b> a promoterless allele and an inducible heteroallele regulated by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Although transcription and UV light separately stimulated recombination, increasing transcription levels reduced UV-induced recombination. Preferential repair of UV damage in transcribed strands was shown in highly transcribed DNA, suggesting that recombination is stimulated by unrepaired UV damage and that increased DNA repair in highly transcribed alleles removes recombinogenic lesions. This study indicates that the genetic consequences of DNA damage depend on transcriptional states and provides a basis for understanding tissue- and gene-specific responses to DNA-damaging agents...|$|R
50|$|Neomycin is {{typically}} {{used as a}} topical preparation, such as Neosporin. It can also be given orally, where it is usually combined with other antibiotics. Neomycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and {{has been used as}} a preventive measure for hepatic encephalopathy and hypercholesterolemia. By killing bacteria in the intestinal tract, it keeps ammonia levels low and prevents hepatic encephalopathy, especially prior to GI surgery. It has also been used to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. It is not given via injection, as neomycin is extremely nephrotoxic (causes kidney damage), even when compared to other aminoglycosides. The exception is when <b>neomycin</b> is <b>included,</b> in very small quantities, as a preservative in some vaccines - typically 25 mg per dose.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of transcription on homologous intrachromosomal recombination between direct and inverted repeats has been examined by using Chinese hamster ovary cells. Recombination was monitored between two integrated <b>neomycin</b> (neo) genes, <b>including</b> one silent allele {{and a second}} allele regulated by the inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Transcription of mouse mammary tumor virus neo alleles was regulated with the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone. Alleles transcribed at high levels recombined about two- to sevenfold more frequently than identical alleles transcribed at low levels. Direct repeats recombined primarily by a gene conversion mechanism; inverted repeats produced a variety of rearranged products. These results are discussed in relation to recombinational processes that regulate gene expression, influence gene family structures, and mediate genomic instability associated with cellular transformation and tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|My project {{explored}} the biosynthesis of teicoplanin and neomycin {{as representatives of}} glycopeptides and aminoglycosides respectively, {{with a focus on}} the characterisation of the biosynthetic enzymes and the development of methods for targeted gene disruption in the producer strains. Both Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121, the teicoplanin producer, and Streptomyces fradiae NCIMB 8233, the neomycin producer, were successfully conjugated. This allowed in vivo study of specific enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway. Several aspects of teicoplanin biosynthesis were studied: first, the timing and the mechanism of β-hydroxylation of the tyrosine monomer in the backbone of teicoplanin; secondly, the role of the uncharacterised X-domain in the last module of NRPS; and finally, the enzyme responsible for deacetylation of the N -acetyl-glucosaminyl moiety attached to the fourth amino acid of the heptapeptide. Late-stage <b>neomycin</b> biosynthesis, <b>including</b> steps of glycosylation, deacetylation and O -ribosylation, was studied using both in vivo and in vitro approaches. Two glycosyltransferases and one deacetylase were characterised through heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and gene inactivation in S. fradiae.

40|$|MCF- 7 {{cells were}} co-transfected {{with the human}} HSP 27 {{antisense}} cDNA and the <b>neomycin</b> resistance gene, <b>included</b> in the constitutive expression vector pSVL, and the phenotypical changes associated with decreased expression of the HSP 27 protein were analysed. Three out of 10 neomycin-resistant clones obtained proliferated normally and showed a normal HSP 27 content (Western blot). The seven other clones (designated as alpha HSP 27 clones) were characterized by a dramatic growth inhibition associated with alterations in cellular morphology. Cells became progressively hypertrophied, exhibited lamellar protrusions and tended to lose contact with each other. They also acquired characteristics of secretory cells, namely the presence of numerous refractile granules and secretory canaliculi. Among the alpha HSP 27 clones, two were immunocytochemically analysed for HSP 27 content. Both clones were immunonegative for HSP 27, contrary to parental cells and neo-transfectants. Actin immunostaining {{in one of these}} HSP 27 negative clones revealed that microfilament organization changed from diffuse to punctate distribution. Our data support the current concept of a role for HSP 27 in cell growth and differentiation and further suggests that this might occur through a control on actin polymerization-depolymerization...|$|R
40|$|A broad-specific ELISA {{using one}} {{antibody}} {{preparation for the}} detection of gentamicin, kanamycin, and neomycin in milk is reported for the first time. For the immunization of rabbits, neamin was used as the generic hapten {{on the basis of the}} facts that it is a two-ring fragment of neomycin and, in shape and charge, it resembles parts of kanamycin and gentamicin. Neamin was linked to the preactivated carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin by EDC coupling. The specificity and sensitivity of the polyclonal antibodies for the aminoglycoside antibiotics were tested in a competitive assay using homologous and heterologous conjugates coupled by various conjugation procedures as the ELISA solid phase. In contrast to the homologous assay recognizing only neomycin, the heterologous assay could be used {{for the detection of}} the whole subclass of deoxystreptamin antibiotics in buffer and raw milk. Gentamicin, kanamycin, and neomcyin were detected in artificially contaminated undiluted raw milk (without sample pretreatment) with 50 % inhibition levels at 9, 21, and 113 ng mL- 1, respectively. Neomycin levels were also measured in milk samples obtained from a cow suffering from mastitis and treated with an antibiotic cocktail <b>including</b> <b>neomycin.</b> Levels below the EU maximum residue levels for deoxystreptamin antibiotics could readily be measured in this generic ELISA...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a multiple-aminoglycoside-resistant Escherichia coli strain, strain ARS 3, {{and have}} been the first to identify a novel plasmid-mediated 16 S rRNA methyltransferase, NpmA. This new enzyme shared a relatively low level of identity (30 %) to the chromosomally encoded 16 S rRNA methyltransferase (KamA) of Streptomyces tenjimariensis, an actinomycete aminoglycoside producer. The introduction of a recombinant plasmid carrying npmA could confer on E. coli consistent resistance to both 4, 6 -disubstituted 2 -deoxystreptamines, such as amikacin and gentamicin, and 4, 5 -disubstituted 2 -deoxystreptamines, <b>including</b> <b>neomycin</b> and ribostamycin. The histidine-tagged NpmA elucidated methyltransferase activity against 30 S ribosomal subunits but not against 50 S subunits and the naked 16 S rRNA molecule in vitro. We further confirmed that NpmA is an adenine N- 1 methyltransferase specific for the A 1408 position at the A site of 16 S rRNA. Drug footprinting data indicated that binding of aminoglycosides to the target site was apparently interrupted by methylation at the A 1408 position. These observations demonstrate that NpmA is a novel plasmid-mediated 16 S rRNA methyltransferase that provides a panaminoglycoside-resistant nature through interference with the binding of aminoglycosides toward the A site of 16 S rRNA through N- 1 methylation at position A 1408...|$|R
40|$|Mechanoreceptive {{hair cells}} are {{extremely}} sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics, <b>including</b> <b>neomycin.</b> Hair cell survival was assessed in larval wild-type zebrafish lateral line neuromasts 4 h after initial {{exposure to a}} range of neomycin concentrations for 1 h. Each of the lateral line neuromasts was scored in live fish for {{the presence or absence of}} hair cells using the fluorescent vital dye DASPEI to selectively label hair cells. All neuromasts were devoid of DASPEI-labeled hair cells 4 h after 500 µM neomycin exposure. Vital DASPEI staining was proportional to the number of hair cells per neuromast identified in fixed larvae using immunocytochemistry for acetylated tubulin and phalloidin labeling. The time course of hair cell regeneration in the lateral line neuromasts was also analyzed following neomycin-induced damage. Regenerated hair cells were first observed using live DASPEI staining 12 and 24 h following neomycin treatment. The potential role of proliferation in regenerating hair cells was analyzed. A 1 h pulse-fix protocol using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was used to identify S-phase cells in neuromasts. BrdU incorporation in neomycin-damaged neuromasts did not differ from control neuromasts 4 h after drug exposure but was dramatically upregulated after 12 h. The proliferative cells identified during a 1 h period at 12 h after neomycin treatment were able to give rise to new hair cells by 24 – 48 h after drug treatment. The results presented here provide a standardized preparation for studying and identifying genes that influence vertebrate hair cell death, survival, and regeneration following ototoxic insults...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Anthrax is a {{human disease}} that results from {{infection}} by the bacteria, Bacillus anthracis and has recently {{been used as a}} bioterrorist agent. Historically, this disease was associated with Bacillus spore exposure from wool or animal carcasses. While current vaccine approaches (targeted against the protective antigen) are effective for prophylaxis, multiple doses must be injected. Common antibiotics that block the germination process are effective but must be administered early in the infection cycle. In addition, new therapeutics are needed to specifically target the proteolytic activity of lethal factor (LF) associated with this bacterial infection. Results Using a fluorescence-based assay to identify and characterize inhibitors of anthrax lethal factor protease activity, we identified several chemically-distinct classes of inhibitory molecules including polyamines, aminoglycosides and cationic peptides. In these studies, spermine was demonstrated {{for the first time to}} inhibit anthrax LF with a K i value of 0. 9 ± 0. 09 μM (mean ± SEM; n = 3). Additional linear polyamines were also active as LF inhibitors with lower potencies. Conclusion Based upon the studies reported herein, we chose linear polyamines related to spermine as potential lead optimization candidates and additional testing in cell-based models where cell penetration could be studied. During our screening process, we reproducibly demonstrated that the potencies of certain compounds, <b>including</b> <b>neomycin</b> but not neamine or spermine, were different depending upon the presence or absence of nucleic acids. Differential sensitivity to the presence/absence of nucleic acids may be an additional point to consider when comparing various classes of active compounds for lead optimization. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aminoglycosides bind to rRNA in {{the small}} subunit of the {{bacterial}} ribosome. Mutations in the decoding region of 16 S rRNA confer resistance to specific subsets of aminoglycoside antibiotics. The two major classes of 2 -deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides are the 4, 5 - and the 4, 6 -disubstituted antibiotics. Antibiotics of the 4, 5 -disubstituted class <b>include</b> <b>neomycin,</b> paromomycin, and ribostamycin. Gentamicins and kanamycins belong to the 4, 6 -disubstituted class of aminoglycosides. Structural studies indicated the potential importance of position 1406 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the binding of ring III of the 4, 6 -disubstituted class of aminoglycosides to 16 S rRNA. We have introduced a U 1406 -to-A mutation in a plasmid-encoded copy of E. coli 16 S rRNA which has been expressed either in a mixture with wild-type ribosomes or in a strain in which all rRNA is transcribed from the plasmid-encoded rrn operon. High-level resistance {{to many of the}} 4, 6 -disubstituted aminoglycosides is observed only when all the rRNA contains the U 1406 -to-A mutation. In contrast to the partial dominance of resistance observed with other mutations in the decoding region, there is a dominance of sensitivity with the 1406 A mutation. Chemical footprinting experiments indicate that resistance arises from a reduced affinity of the antibiotic for the rRNA target. These results demonstrate that although position 1406 is an important determinant in the binding and action of the 4, 6 -disubstituted aminoglycosides, other rRNA mutations that perturb the binding of ring I of both classes of 2 -deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides confer higher levels of resistance as well as a partial dominance of resistance...|$|R
40|$|Studies on Coding Region Determinant-Binding Protein (CRD-BP) and its {{orthologs}} {{have confirmed}} their functional role in mRNA stability and localization. CRD-BP {{is present in}} extremely low levels in normal adult tissues, but it is over-expressed in many types of aggressive human cancers and in neonatal tissues. Although the exact role of CRD-BP in tumour progression is unclear, cumulative evidence suggests that its ability to physically associate with target mRNAs is an important criterion for its oncogenic role. CRD-BP has high affinity for the 3 'UTR of the oncogenic CD 44 mRNA and depletion of CRD-BP in cells led to destabilization of CD 44 mRNA, decreased CD 44 expression, reduced adhesion and disruption of invadopodia formation. Here, we further characterize the CRD-BP-CD 44 RNA interaction and assess specific antisense oligonucleotides and small molecule antibiotics {{for their ability to}} inhibit the CRD-BP-CD 44 RNA interaction. CRD-BP has a high affinity for binding to CD 44 RNA nts 2862 - 3055 with a Kd of 645 nM. Out of ten antisense oligonucleotides spanning nts 2862 - 3055, only three antisense oligonucleotides (DD 4, DD 7 and DD 10) were effective in competing with CRD-BP for binding to 32 P-labeled CD 44 RNA. The potency of DD 4, DD 7 and DD 10 in inhibiting the CRD-BP-CD 44 RNA interaction in vitro correlated with their ability to specifically reduce the steady-state level of CD 44 mRNA in cells. The aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin, paramomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin effectively inhibited the CRD-BP-CD 44 RNA interaction in vitro. Assessing the potential inhibitory effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics <b>including</b> <b>neomycin</b> on the CRD-BP-CD 44 mRNA interaction in cells proved difficult, likely due to their propensity to non-specifically bind nucleic acids. Our results have important implications for future studies in finding small molecules and nucleic acid-based inhibitors that interfere with protein-RNA interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} is {{a valuable}} model for studying hair cell development, structure, genetics, and behavior. Zebrafish and other aquatic vertebrates have hair cells on their body surface organized into a sensory system called the lateral line. These hair cells are highly accessible and easily visualized using fluorescent dyes. Morphological and functional similarities to mammalian hair cells of the inner ear make the zebrafish a powerful preparation for studying hair cell toxicity. The ototoxic potential of drugs has historically been uncovered by anecdotal reports {{that have led to}} more formal investigation. Currently, no standard screen for ototoxicity exists in drug development. Thus, {{for the vast majority of}} Food and Drug Association (FDA) -approved drugs, the ototoxic potential remains unknown. In this study, we used 5 -day-old zebrafish larvae to screen a library of 1, 040 FDA-approved drugs and bioactives (NINDS Custom Collection II) for ototoxic effects in hair cells of the lateral line. Hair cell nuclei were selectively labeled using a fluorescent vital dye. For the initial screen, fish were exposed to drugs from the library at a 100 -μM concentration for 1  h in 96 -well tissue culture plates. Hair cell viability was assessed in vivo using fluorescence microscopy. One thousand forty drugs were rapidly screened for ototoxic effects. Seven known ototoxic drugs included in the library, <b>including</b> <b>neomycin</b> and cisplatin, were positively identified using these methods, as proof of concept. Fourteen compounds without previously known ototoxicity were discovered to be selectively toxic to hair cells. Dose–response curves for all 21 ototoxic compounds were determined by quantifying hair cell survival as a function of drug concentration. Dose–response relationships in the mammalian inner ear for two of the compounds without known ototoxicity, pentamidine isethionate and propantheline bromide, were then examined using in vitro preparations of the adult mouse utricle. Significant dose-dependent hair cell loss in the mouse utricle was demonstrated for both compounds. This study represents an important step in validating the use of the zebrafish lateral line as a screening tool for the identification of potentially ototoxic drugs...|$|R
