50|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>size</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} parameter among others. It affects the screening technique directly. For a screening system, the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> can be summarized as oversize particles, which is particles larger than the screen opening; undersized particles, also called fine particles, which is smaller than the screen opening. The undersized particles will be produced as product streams in screening operation. Another important <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> is the near-mesh <b>size</b> <b>particles.</b> The near-size particles often are close {{to the size of the}} screening opening. The increasing number of <b>near</b> <b>size</b> <b>particles</b> will cause blinding effect. This phenomenon will decrease the travelling velocity of the processed materials and hence reduce the efficiency of the screening. It has been shown that near-size particles which will cause the blind of the screen have a maximum size of 1.1 times opening. Feed stream should be treated to decrease the existence of <b>near</b> <b>size</b> <b>particles</b> before screening.|$|R
50|$|To {{maximize}} screen life most manufacturers {{build their}} screens with {{multiple layers of}} mesh over a very sturdy backing cloth to further protect the cloth against solids loading and wear. The multiple layers of mesh act as a de-blinding mechanism pushing <b>near</b> <b>sized</b> <b>particles,</b> which may get stuck in the openings, out of the mesh reducing blinding issues and keeping the screen surface available for use.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} sizing {{process is}} screening, or passing the <b>particles</b> to be <b>sized</b> through a screen or number of screens. Screening equipment can include grizzlies, bar screens, wedge wire screens, radial sieves, banana screens, multi-deck screens, vibratory screen, fine screens, flip flop screens and wire mesh screens. Screens can be static (typically {{the case for}} very coarse material), or they can incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen. Some considerations in this process include the screen material, the aperture size, shape and orientation, the amount of <b>near</b> <b>sized</b> <b>particles,</b> the addition of water, the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, the angle of inclination, the presence of harmful materials, like steel and wood, and the size distribution of the particles.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Filtration and Separation [© Elsevier]. Of the various fine particle/liquid separation techniques available to the process engineer the most commonly used are variants of filtration, expression and sedimentation. Their simple concept and apparent ease of operation enable the efficient separation of many solid/liquid systems. However, the separation of finer, <b>near</b> colloidal <b>sized,</b> <b>particle</b> suspensions using these techniques frequently poses problems which have undesirable consequences. For example, on occasions the wetness of filter cakes can be inexplicably high, with the result that thermal drying is the only viable method by which the required moisture removal can be achieved. With cost increases of energy forever pending, and demands for improved separation technologies, there is a growing interest in developing alternative and more cost effective methods of separation. To meet this goal it is necessary for both engineers and scientists to work together and to have a basic understanding of how the technology of one affects the science of the other (and vice-versa). This paper considers some of the implications of the work of colloid scientists for the separations technologist, with particular reference to sedimentation and filtration processes...|$|R

The effect of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> on the percent demineralization of coal was depicted in Fig.  2. The ash content of the raw coal varies with the <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> The extent of demineralization increases with the decrease of <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> In the present investigation, 180  µm coal particle has been found maximum percent demineralization as compared to 375 and 230  µm mesh <b>size</b> <b>particle.</b> This {{may be due to the}} finer <b>size</b> <b>particle</b> were contains large surface area leads to increase the demineralization. The ash content of raw coals were decreased with increase in <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> while these were increased in the leached coal. Therefore, the percent demineralization were increased with decrease <b>size</b> of <b>particles.</b> From the experimental results, the finer (180  µm) <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> were obtained highest percent demineralization, about 46 % and 34 % from coal A, 42 % and 32 % from coal B by the leaching solvent concentration of 30 % NaOH and 30 % H 2 SO 4 solution respectively. The decreased <b>size</b> of the <b>particles</b> caused higher the exposed surface area, which enhances the interaction between the leachant and coal-bearing minerals. This may because the ash-bearing minerals were easily dissolute in the chemical solvent. The dissolution of minerals were more accessible for finer <b>size</b> <b>particles</b> which may the less diffusion gap, and more contact between the finer <b>size</b> <b>particles</b> and the leachant caused the higher rate of minerals were leached out.|$|R

The effect of DPC 963 drug substance <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{on the characteristics}} of granules manufactured by high-shear wet granulation was evaluated. The wet granulation process was used to manufacture a DPC 963 formulation with high drug loading. The formulation was manufactured using drug substance lots with different <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions. Granulation <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution, porosity, and compressibility were determined. A uniaxial compression test was also performed on moist compacts of the formulation prepared with different <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions. <b>Particle</b> agglomeration behavior was affected by drug substance <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> Granulation geometric mean diameter and fraction with <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> greater than 250 μm was inversely proportional to the drug substance <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> Mercury intrusion porosimetry revealed higher pore volumes for the granules manufactured using the drug substance with the smaller <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> suggesting lower tendency for granule densification than for that manufactured with the larger drug substance <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> Granulation compressibility was also sensitive to changes in drug substance <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> A decreased drug substance <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> led to increased granulation compressibility.

40|$|Magnetorheological fluids (MRF), {{known for}} their {{variable}} shear stress contain magnetisable micrometer-sized particles (few micrometer to 200 micrometers) in a nonmagnetic carrier liquid. To avoid settling of <b>particles,</b> smaller <b>sized</b> (3 - 10 micrometers) particles are preferred, while larger <b>sized</b> <b>particles</b> {{can be used in}} MR brakes, MR clutches, etc. as mechanical stirring action in those mechanisms does not allow particles to settle down. Ideally larger <b>sized</b> <b>particles</b> provide higher shear stress compared to smaller <b>sized</b> <b>particles.</b> However there is need to explore the effect of <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> on the shear stress.
