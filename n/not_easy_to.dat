5|$|Blue {{whales are}} <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> catch or kill. Their {{speed and power}} meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established {{on the coast of}} Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{declaration}} by the Dean, {{demolition of}} {{the remains of the}} old cathedral began in 1668. Demolition of the Old Cathedral proved unexpectedly difficult as the stonework had been bonded together by molten lead. Wren initially used the then-new technique of using gunpowder to bring down the surviving stone walls. Like many experimental techniques, the use of gunpowder was <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> control; several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about noise and damage. Eventually, Wren resorted to using a battering ram instead. Building work on the new cathedral began in June 1675.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E

5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period.|$|E
5|$|Of {{eukaryotic}} groups, the protists {{are most}} commonly unicellular and microscopic. This {{is a highly}} diverse group of organisms that are <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> classify. Several algae species are multicellular protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Llanbadarn tithes were <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> collect: {{both the}} {{fishermen}} and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments {{they had to}} make in goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> collect and had to be sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. It was easy for agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and {{to take advantage of the}} now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her final journey to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county: a slate memorial to her is still to be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.|$|E

5|$|Academic jobs {{in history}} were <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find in 1941, so Elliott joined the Civil Service, {{working in the}} Prices and Statistics Section of the Iron and Steel Control {{directorate}} in the Ministry of Supply. She subsequently moved to the Board of Trade, and the Directorate of Housing Fitments, where she rose {{to the rank of}} Assistant Principal, before moving to the Cabinet Office in 1945. There she became involved with the Official History of the Second World War, as assistant to Keith Hancock who was overall editor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of books within the Official History. As an official historian of the History of the Second World War: United Kingdom Civil Series, Gowing had access to unpublished official papers and files. She came to know personally many of the politicians and senior civil servants involved.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem because it is <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps {{have been used to}} monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It is <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, {{not so much a}} logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness was <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may {{be present in the}} marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{assess the}} {{importance}} of the Byzantine navy to the Empire's history. On one hand, the Empire, throughout its life, had to defend a long coastline, often with little hinterland. In addition, shipping was always the quickest and cheapest way of transport, and the Empire's major urban and commercial centres, as well as most of its fertile areas, lay close to the sea. Coupled with the threat posed by the Arabs in the 7th to 10th centuries, this necessitated the maintenance of a strong fleet. The navy was perhaps at its most significant in the successful defence of Constantinople from the two Arab sieges, which ultimately saved the Empire. Throughout the period however, naval operations were {{an essential part of the}} Byzantine effort against the Arabs in a game of raids and counter-raids that continued up to the late 10th century.|$|E

5|$|Wigner {{received}} {{a request from}} Arnold Sommerfeld {{to work at the}} University of Göttingen as an assistant to the great mathematician David Hilbert. This proved a disappointment, as the aged Hilbert's abilities were failing, and his interests had shifted to logic. Wigner nonetheless studied independently. He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the Wigner D-matrix. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into quantum mechanics. The latter had written a standard text, Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics (1928), but it was <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> understand, especially for younger physicists. Wigner's Group Theory and Its Application to the Quantum Mechanics of Atomic Spectra (1931) made group theory accessible to a wider audience.|$|E
