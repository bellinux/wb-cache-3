25|$|Soldiers with a {{knowledge}} of both the emotional and physical {{signs and symptoms of}} CSR are much less likely to have a critical event that reduces them below fighting capability. Instrumental information, such as breathing exercises that can reduce stress and suggestions <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the faces of enemy dead, is also effective at reducing the chance of a breakdown.|$|E
25|$|Further, Justice Chan, {{relying on}} the English case of Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Department; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ("Khawaja", 1983), took the view that in cases of this nature, the court's role was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at whether the {{decision-maker}} {{could have made a}} reasonable decision, but to decide whether the decision made could have been justified by the evidence present.|$|E
25|$|After Elisabeth's disappearance, {{her mother}} filed a missing-persons report. Almost a month later, her father handed over {{a letter to}} the police, the first of several that he had forced Elisabeth to write while in captivity. The letter, postmarked Braunau, stated that she was tired of living with her family and was staying with a friend; she warned her parents <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for her or she would leave the country. Her father told police that she had most likely joined some {{religious}} cult.|$|E

25|$|Leslie and Tyler both {{struggle}} {{to reconnect with}} Gus, even after he moves in with Leslie. She later finds a box of Gus' which he asked her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in, but disobeys her father's wishes and finds letters from a mystery women named Rose Turner. Gus then suffers {{a heart attack and}} dies, unable to tell Leslie who Rose was. Afterward, Avery asks Leslie to become her partner in a law firm together, which she accepts. After Gus' death, Leslie looks into who Rose was, and finds out that she supposedly died in 2007, and has a daughter, Anne, who lives in Europe. She also realizes that Gus was unaware of her death, leading to more confusion.|$|E
25|$|After Voldemort's death, Harry {{uses the}} Elder Wand to repair his own damaged wand, then decides {{to return it}} to Dumbledore's tomb, {{so that when he}} has a natural death, the Elder Wand's power will die with him. In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too {{powerful}} to fall into the wrong hands again, so he snaps it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest but decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for it in the hope that no wizard or witch {{will ever be able to}} own all three Hallows. He keeps the Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he might pass it on to his children someday.|$|E
25|$|There is a Noh play by {{the name}} of Kurozuka that tells the story of two priests who stop by the hut of the Onibaba in Adachi. The Onibaba, in her human form, kindly lets them in and speaks to them about her {{loneliness}} while spinning thread. Later, she leaves to gather firewood, but tells the priests <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into the inner room of the house. Curious, the servant disobeys and the priests find that the inner room is filled with the bones and rotting corpses of people. They realize that the woman is the goblin of Adachi. As they are about to run away, the Onibaba returned, outraged, and in her demon form. They were able to escape through the power of their Buddhist prayers.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened {{screening}} room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E
25|$|Other {{actions were}} {{believed}} to offend fairies. Brownies {{were known to be}} driven off by being given clothing, though some folktales recounted that they were offended by inferior quality of the garments given, and others merely stated it, some even recounting that the brownie was delighted with the gift and left with it. Other brownies left households or farms because they heard a complaint, or a compliment. People who saw the fairies were advised <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> closely, because they resented infringements on their privacy. The need to not offend them could lead to problems: one farmer found that fairies threshed his corn, but the threshing continued after all his corn was gone, and he concluded that they were stealing from his neighbors, leaving him the choice between offending them, dangerous in itself, and profiting by the theft.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a massive}} junior and youth {{contingent}} of rugby league players in St Helens. Clubs such as Thatto Heath and Blackbrook Royals have produced many of the former and current superstars in St Helens' squads over the years, and continue to do so. Clubs in the St Helens area also include Bold Miners, Portico Vine, Pilkington Recs, Haydock Warriors, Newton Storm, Eccleston Lions and Haresfinch Hawks which provide players for St Helens through the junior years and the scholarship schemes at the club, before eventually signing professionally at 16. But St Helens' youth roots do not stop in the St Helens area. Indeed, club legend Keiron Cunningham signed for the club from Wigan St Judes, and Saints also look to clubs like Wigan St Patricks and Orrell St James in the Wigan area, and Halton Farnworth Hornets in the Widnes area for youth talent. However, a criticism of the St Helens scouting system is that they tend <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at players beyond the junior ages (6–16 years old), and talented players who continue into amateur rugby tend to be signed very rarely.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the band}} had {{historically}} been well-used to line-up changes, Cardiacs were profoundly {{affected by the}} multiple departures taking place between 1989 and 1991. A particular blow had been the departure of Drake, whose virtuoso keyboard skills and compositional input had {{made him one of}} the backbones of the band. Drake was considered irreplaceable and Cardiacs opted <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a new keyboard player, remaining as a quartet of two guitars, bass and drums (with Christian Hayes being replaced as second guitarist by Jon Poole who had previously played with the Cardiacs-inspired Milton Keynes band Ad Nauseam). While Cardiacs was still able to record more fully orchestrated music in the studio, a lack of suitable personnel (or the budget to keep them in place) meant that the live band had to change drastically. Abandoning several signature musical features (saxophone, assorted percussion and virtuoso keyboards), Cardiacs' live music shifted away from the wider instrumentation of the past and moved towards a more guitar-heavy, power-rock sound in line with the remaining quartet lineup. However, the music remained complex, if narrower in focus, and Smith recorded additional keyboard and percussion parts onto backing tapes for the band to play over.|$|E
500|$|At age 18, {{interested}} in pursuing {{some kind of}} performing career, Guy Laliberté quit college and left home. He toured Europe as a folk musician and busker. By the time he returned home to Canada in 1979, he had learned the art of fire breathing. Although he became [...] "employed" [...] at a hydroelectric power plant in James Bay, his job ended after only three days due to a labour strike. He decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for another job, instead supporting himself on his unemployment insurance. He helped organize a summer fair in Baie-Saint-Paul {{with the help of}} a pair of friends named Daniel Gauthier and Gilles Ste-Croix.|$|E

For the performance, Moore asked that she be provided with a [...] "showstopping" [...] dress, specifically requesting that it not resemble a Disney costume. To comply, fashion designer Monique Lhuillier [...] "incorporated elements of three dresses Moore loved" [...] into the final dress, resulting in a full-skirted cobalt blue gown. Moore revealed that she was feeling confident about the performance [...] "until about two minutes before the show". Moore also said of the performance, [...] "It was the most intimidating audience I performed for ... I made a point <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at anyone … because I was nervous." ...|$|E

500|$|The brick chapel {{is built}} in an Italianate style with a stuccoed facade and a slate roof. According to Nikolaus Pevsner, the Methodists chose {{this style of}} {{architecture}} [...] "in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> Anglican." [...] Its ground floor is rusticated and has a single-storey portico, extending along {{the full length of}} the chapel frontage. This consists of a heavy cornice supported on pairs of fluted Corinthian columns. Over the portico, in the centre of the upper storey, is a Venetian window, with two sash windows on each side. At the summit of the frontage is a central pedimented gable. On each side of this is a massive decorated cornice. The building extends back for five bays, and at the rear is a shallow curved apse. The rear of the building is built in Flemish bond brickwork.|$|E
500|$|Other critics found {{a variety}} of Judeo-Christian analogies. Devils Tower {{parallels}} Mount Sinai, the aliens as God and Roy Neary as Moses. Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments is seen on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between Elijah and Roy; Elijah was taken into a [...] "chariot of fire", akin to Roy going in the UFO. Climbing Devils Tower behind the faltering Jillian, Neary exhorts Jillian to keep moving and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back, similar to Lot's wife who looked back at Sodom {{and turned into a}} pillar of salt. Spielberg explained, [...] "I wanted to make Close Encounters a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Sévérine greets Bond on {{his arrival}} at the casino. They share a drink {{at the bar and}} discuss the {{subjects}} of death and fear. Bond presses her for more information about her boss Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) to which she responds fearfully and cautions him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for further information. Identifying her wrist tattoo as the mark of the Macau sex trade, Bond deduces that she was once a sex slave and was taken in by Silva to work as his representative under the guise of being [...] "rescued". Promising to help her escape from Silva and to kill him, Bond asks for Sévérine to arrange a meeting with her boss. Sévérine trusts him and warns him about her guards' intentions to assassinate him by throwing him into a pit with komodo dragons. She tells Bond that if he survives, he can find her on her yacht, the Chimera.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene of}} the crime was visited by Father Michael Lewis of the Stella Maris Church, who was {{accompanied}} by Williamson's sister Gradryn Williams; she was convinced <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the body by Williamson's friends. Crowds assembled outside the apartment block, made up of individuals who were laughing and celebrating Williamson's death. Some of the assembled people shouted out statements such as [...] "This is long overdue", [...] "Battyman he get killed", [...] "Let's get them one at a time", [...] "That's what you get for sin", and [...] "Batty man fi dead!" [...] ("Faggots should die!"). Others sang [...] "Boom Bye Bye", a line from a dancehall song by Buju Banton that discusses shooting and burning gay men. Rebecca Schleifer, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher, had a meeting with Williamson planned for that day, and arrived at his home to find the assembled crowd; she noted that [...] "It was like a parade. They were basically partying".|$|E
500|$|Historically {{the rocky}} outcrop was known locally by the Malays {{in earlier times}} as [...] "Batu Berlayar" [...] ("Sailing Rock") near the present site of Labrador Park, off Pasir Panjang Road. Another rock outcrop used {{to stand on the}} {{opposite}} shore of Tanjong Rimau on Sentosa Island. These two rock outcrops once formed a gateway at the western entrance to Keppel Harbour. British sailors named the more prominent Batu Berlayar, [...] "Lot's Wife" [...] in reference to the biblical story of the wife of Abraham's nephew. She was transformed into a pillar of salt when she disobeyed divine orders <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back at the destruction of Sodom while fleeing from the city. It is argued that the two rocky outcrops are the two hills of Temasek named in Yuan sources as Long Ya Men (Dragon's Teeth Gate) since they resembled two dragon's teeth between which a passage of water runs. [...] Another name Ling Ya Men (...) is recorded in the Song dynasty work Zhu Fan Zhi, however it is usually considered to be a different place.|$|E
500|$|The {{wedding was}} {{described}} by Friedrich Christian Weber, the ambassador of Hanover, as [...] "solemnized by the court in masks". Guests were instructed to pre-register in groups of three with their costumes so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> too similar to other guests. Witnesses described the event, which took place on 27 and 28 January 1715, and which had been prepared for three months, as a [...] "world turned upside-down". The Jolly Company dressed in ridiculous regalia, and many people behaved exactly opposite to the norm; [...] "invitations to the guests were delivered by stammerers, the bridesmen were cripples, the runners were fat men with gout, the priest was allegedly one hundred years old" [...] (and blind). Hughes notes that the event {{may have been a}} [...] "variation on the Western charivari or shaming ceremonies", through which the Tsar could demonstrate how much power he had over his subjects' lives. During the wedding, the Drunken Synod routinely sang carols in the streets of Moscow and demanded money, which became a New Year tax for the wealthy.|$|E
