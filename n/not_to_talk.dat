5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{disaster}} nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention was only two months. Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E

25|$|Davis alleges {{the founders}} conspired to give {{themselves}} illicit distributions through a tax fraud scheme {{and that the}} founders also formed various competing companies with XanGo assets. He is also claiming that the founders took steps to freeze {{him out of the}} company — ignoring Davis’ objections to wrongful conduct, falsifying board minutes to reflect unanimous consent to actions to which he had voiced objections, XanGo employees were told <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Davis under penalty of termination, that founders also falsely claimed to XanGo employees that he had resigned his position at XanGo and disparaged him. As a result, Davis said XanGo withheld bonus/distribution payments to Davis as well as discontinuing employee benefits.|$|E

25|$|Genie was the last, {{and second}} surviving, of four {{children}} of parents living in Arcadia, California, and was born in 1957 without any noted complications at a normal, healthy weight and size. Around {{the time of her}} birth, her father began to isolate himself and his family from other people. Her father decided that she was severely mentally retarded because she was late to walk due to treatment for a congenital hip dislocation, a view which intensified as she got older, and consequently disliked her. He tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to or pay attention to her and discouraged his wife and son, who was five years older than Genie, from doing so.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the attack, Vladmir Markin, {{spokesman}} for the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor (SKP) of the Russian Federation, stated that the Central Investigation Department of the North Caucasus and the Southern Federal District would investigate the attacks. On 2 September, Ramzan Kadyrov announced a reward of more than $300,000 for information about each of the insurgency leaders involved in the operation, which Chechen commentators interpreted {{as an indicator of}} the government's weakness. Kadyrov also tightened his control over information coming from Tsentoroy by not allowing any of the village's 5,000 inhabitants to leave {{in the days after the}} attack; the citizenry were also allegedly under the threat of death <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the siege or the damage inflicted by the rebels.|$|E
25|$|When {{the detectives}} are certain {{they have the}} right suspect(s), the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a search and/or arrest warrant (though {{sometimes}} the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office to see if the case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an armed tactical team) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask for a lawyer, their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> anymore, or the Assistant District Attorney from the D.A.'s office decides they have enough to press charges.|$|E

25|$|Genie {{was born}} {{about five years}} after her brother, around the time that her father began to isolate {{himself and his family}} from others. At birth she was in the 50th {{percentile}} for weight. The following day she showed signs of Rh incompatibility and required a blood transfusion, but had no sequelae and was otherwise described as healthy. A medical appointment at three months showed that she was gaining weight normally, but found a congenital hip dislocation which required her to wear a highly restrictive Frejka splint from the age of 4½ to 11 months. The splint caused Genie to be late to walk, and researchers believed this led her father to start speculating that she was mentally retarded. As a result, he made a concerted effort <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to or pay attention to her, and strongly discouraged his wife and son from doing so.|$|E

Jason, in turn, helps Sam and Spinelli set up a private investigation firm. When Kristina and Michael run away to Mexico, Sam and Jason go after them. Sam is kidnapped by Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roché), {{who is trying to}} lure Jason into a trap. Jason ends up shot by Jerry, who leaves him to die. Sam escapes and rescues Jason. Jason starts hallucinating that he is in Hawaii with Sam. They grow closer as Sam nurses him back to health and end up making love, but decide <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it.

And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of that situation, but tell a frivolous story.

[...] Shortly after the article was published, an agent suggested that Ortved write a full book. The producers again decided not to participate, and, according to Ortved, Brooks asked current and former Simpsons employees <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Ortved. However, the book does include portions of interviews that several figures did with other sources.

500|$|Swift {{uses her}} life {{experiences}} as an inspiration in her work. In her songs, Swift often addresses the [...] "anonymous crushes of {{her high school}} years" [...] and celebrities. Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends, an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: [...] "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic." [...] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to [...] "mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers". The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual {{and that they are}} sometimes based on observations. Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about song subjects specifically [...] "because these are real people.

500|$|Chung {{speaks to}} a science fiction and Dungeons & Dragons fanatic, Blaine, who {{frequently}} roams the woods of Klass County at night looking for UFOs. As Blaine tells Chung, one night he found an alien body that was subsequently recovered by Mulder, Scully and Detective Manners. Blaine thinks that Mulder and Scully {{are a couple of}} men in black. He claims that Mulder was emotionless, but shrieked when he saw the alien, and that Scully, whom Blaine believed was a man dressed like a woman, threatened him and told him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to anyone about the alien body. Mulder allows Blaine to videotape Scully performing an autopsy on the alien, which is quickly released as a video [...] "documentary" [...] labeled [...] "Dead Alien! Truth or Humbug?" [...] that is narrated by the Stupendous Yappi (from [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"). The autopsy reveals that the alien is actually a dead Air Force pilot in an alien costume. His superiors arrive to claim the body, but find it missing. Mulder tricks the military officers into revealing the identity of a second missing Air Force pilot, Lieutenant Jack Schaefer.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and mourners, and criticized her music. Stern said, [...] "This music does {{absolutely}} nothing for me. Alvin and the Chipmunks have more soul... Spanish {{people have the}} worst taste in music. They have no depth." [...] He then played Selena's songs with gunshot noises in the background. Stern's comments and actions outraged and infuriated the Latino community in Texas. After an arrest warrant for disorderly conduct was issued for him, Stern made an on-air statement, in Spanish, saying his comments were not made to cause [...] "more anguish to her family, friends and those who loved her". The League of United Latin American Citizens found Stern's apology unacceptable and urged a boycott of his show. Texas retailers removed products related to Stern. Sears and McDonald's sent a letter expressing their disapproval of Stern's comments to the media because fans believed they sponsored his show. Within a week, on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers were asked if Stern's remarks about Selena were acceptable. Quivers decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the situation to avoid arguing with Stern. When Linda Ronstadt, a pop singer of Mexican-American heritage, appeared on the show, she and Quivers argued when Ronstadt defended Selena.|$|E
