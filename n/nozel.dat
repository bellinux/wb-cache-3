50|$|Rooms {{under the}} square, below the {{groundwater}} level, provide the hidden infrastructure for lighting, electrical power distribution, and the pumps and control {{systems for the}} fountains. , {{it is the most}} elaborate water feature in Zürich, with individual programmable control to each <b>nozel</b> which can jet fountains up to 8 m in height, and can accompany a piece of music. Each nozzle has a white LED light that can illuminate the water from below at night. Drainage systems receive the fountain water though a series of chambers which collect detritus, filter the water, and process it with chlorine and glass water; the purified water is then returned to the pumps to be reused. In all, 1.5 million Swiss Francs were paid for the design.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comparative {{investigation of the}} properties of two polyamine, namely poly(vinyl amine) (PVAm) and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). Hence, these polymers {{have been used for}} the preparation of devices with potential application in the (bio) medical field. In a first attempt, the preparation of water-insoluble PVAm mats of electrospun nanofibers is reported. The effect of the solution concentration, flow rate, voltage and distance between <b>nozel</b> and collector on the fiber quality, diameter morphology and stability are investigated. Mats with bactericidal activity were obtained and may be interesting for applications such as water filtration, tissue recovery, medical bandaging. Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) vascular grafts modification by means of PEI coverage is also presented in this work. PEI is investigated as precursor for star-poly(ethylene glycol) (star-PEG) grafting, which aims at imparting the surface with resistance to clot formation. Results from the stability, chemical composition and morphology testing of the surface of the grafts before and after coating is presented. Their resistance to protein adsorption, as main factor for clot formation, is studied at in vitro conditions with Bovine Serum Albumin as model protein. Although aside of the main topic of this thesis, the activation of the surface of inert polymers by atmospheric pressure glow plasma jet (APGPJ) is investigated for polypropylene (PP) as model surface. This study is oriented towards investigation of the temperature induced by the plasma {{at the level of the}} PP surface and its effect on the surface topography. Hence, APGPJ is exploited as very mild plasma to which selected chemical compoumds can be added to be pinned to a surfaces without major decomposition or oxidation. Different gas mixtures (argon; argon/nitrogen; argon/ammonia) and forward powers are tested in order to determine the optimal and less aggressive treatment conditions. Later, the APGPJ technique is applied for the coating of PP surface with branched-PEI by (i) standard dip-coating and (ii) solution-activated plasma-spraying. For the first two-steps approach, APGPJ activated PP samples are dip-coated by crosslinked, chemically grafted PEI coating. For the second one, the ability to form a PEI coating on the unmodified PP surface in one step is investigated. Hence, PP-surface activation, PEI spraying and grafting are simultaneously performed. The chemical composition, stability and morphology of the formed coatings are investigated in comparative manner. The bactericidal activity of the formed coatings is tested in comparison with a PP surface modified only by APGPJ...|$|E
