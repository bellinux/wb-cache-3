5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and <b>normal</b> <b>saline,</b> sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E

40|$|Background: Numerous {{studies have}} shown the {{presence}} of capsaicin (CAP) receptors in periaqueductal gray (PAG) area. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the role of CAP receptors in PAG on pain modulation in diabetic neuropathic (NP) rats. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was carried out on 24 male rats in 4 groups (n= 6) : <b>normal</b> - <b>saline</b> <b>normal</b> - capsaicine NP - saline and NP - capsaicine. To investigate the effect of intra-PAG injection of capsaicin (10 nmol/ul) or saline on pain modulation, tail flick (TF), hot plate and Von frey tests were used. To induce NP, a single dose of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg, i. p) was injected. Results: In normal rats, 5 and 15 min after the injection into PAG, CAP showed an analgesic effect in TF test (...|$|R

Rapid partial correction with 3% <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> is only recommended in those with significant symptoms and occasionally those in whom the condition was of rapid onset. Low volume hyponatremia is typically treated with intravenous <b>normal</b> <b>saline.</b> SIADH is typically treated with fluid restriction while high volume hyponatremia is typically treated with both fluid restriction and a diet low in salt. Correction should generally be gradual in those in whom the low levels have been present for more than two days.|$|E
25|$|When an apheresis {{system is}} used for therapy, the system is {{removing}} relatively small amounts of fluid (not more than 10.5 mL/kg body weight). That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a crystalloid like <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> for plasma is needed to keep up oncotic pressure.

In ICU patients, fluid restriction is in fact poorly tolerated and difficult to achieve [17], and increased intake of salt does not address the causative factor, which is free water excess.|$|R

30|$|Sonohysterography or saline {{infusion}} sonohysterography (SIS) is {{an ultrasound}} examination performed after the uterine cavity has {{been filled with}} <b>normal</b> physiological <b>saline</b> solution as a contrast medium. In comparative studies between various methods of intra-uterine diagnostic procedures, SIS {{appears to be more}} reliable than transvaginal ultrasound alone and as predictive as hysteroscopy. The reliability of transvaginal ultrasound increases with the addition of saline solution as a contrast medium [17, 33 – 36]. In a meta-analysis by de Kroon et al. the following data were established in this respect: sensitivity 0.95 (95 % CI 0.93 to 0.97), specificity 0.88 (95 % CI 0.85 to 0.92), likelihood ratios 8.23 (95 % CI 6.2 to 11) and 0.06 (95 % CI 0.04 to 0.09) [37].|$|R
50|$|Isolated {{preparations}} of vascular and visceral {{smooth muscle}} contract with depolarizing high potassium balanced saline generating {{a certain amount}} of contractile force. The same preparation stimulated in <b>normal</b> balanced <b>saline</b> with an agonist such as endothelin or serotonin will generate more contractile force. This increase in force is termed calcium sensitization. The myosin light chain phosphatase is inhibited to increase the gain or sensitivity of myosin light chain kinase to calcium. There are number of cell signalling pathways believed to regulate this decrease in myosin light chain phosphatase: a RhoA-Rock kinase pathway, a Protein kinase C-Protein kinase C potentiation inhibitor protein 17 (CPI-17) pathway, telokin, and a Zip kinase pathway. Further Rock kinase and Zip kinase have been implicated to directly phosphorylate the 20kd myosin light chains.|$|R
40|$|Bath {{application}} of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate or quisqualate to Xenopus embryos depolarized spinal cord motoneurones and reduced their input resistance in both <b>normal</b> <b>salines</b> and salines containing 20 mM-Mn 2 + and 0. 5 mM-Ca 2 +, or 2 X 10 (- 6) M-tetrodotoxin. This suggests that motoneurones possess all {{three types of}} excitatory amino acid receptor. These receptors have similar specificities to excitatory amino acid antagonists as those occurring in adult frog and cat spinal cords. Application of 30 - 40 microM-NMDA or 5 - 6. 5 microM-kainate to the medium bathing spinalized embryos can cause a sustained patterned motor output {{similar to that of}} swimming evoked by natural stimulation of intact animals. At these concentrations NMDA and kainate depolarized motoneurones by 19. 0 +/- 1. 80 (mean +/- S. E. of mean) and 18. 0 +/- 2. 00 mV respectively and decreased their input resistance by 23. 0 +/- 2. 82 % and 24. 0 +/- 3. 46 %. These changes are similar to those associated with the tonic excitation which motoneurones receive during naturally evoked swimming. Bath {{application of}} 5 - 8 microM-quisqualate to spinal embryos can also cause a sustained motor output. However, this was different to that evoked by NMDA and kainate and was inappropriate for swimming. When applied to intact animals during swimming both 2 - 3 mM-cis- 2, 3 -piperidine dicarboxylic acid (PDA) and 0. 5 mM-gamma-D-glutamylglycine (DGG) selectively blocked the tonic excitation of motoneurones and in doing so abolished the motor output of the spinal cord. 50 - 200 microM- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid reduced the tonic excitation but to a lesser extent than either PDA or DGG. The tonic excitation of motoneurones which occurs during swimming therefore appears to be mediated via an endogenous excitatory amino acid transmitter which acts on NMDA and kainate receptors...|$|R

25|$|The placebo {{administration}} {{may prove}} to be a useful treatment in some specific cases where recommended drugs cannot be used.

40|$|Problem statement: The 3 -Hydroxy- 3 -Methyl Glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) {{have been}} {{unequivocally}} shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

30|$|Attention is, therefore, {{focused on}} using {{various forms of}} OMF composts as partial substitutions to mineral fertilizers. These {{practices}} have been recommended (Ojo et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2015) under <b>normal</b> or <b>saline</b> conditions in arid and semi-arid regions as sources of nutrients, because these soils inherently have low organic matter and low mineralization (Okusami et al. 1997), due to high alkalinity and low rains. Because organic manures are characterized by slow release of nutrients, the complementary applications of organic manures with fast nutrient release-characterizing mineral fertilizers have been advocated. The beneficial effects of this practice in terms of improved crop productivity, soil fertility and sustainability, and balanced plant nutrition have been reported (Rady 2011 a; Moyin-Jesu 2015; Riaz et al. 2015; Semida et al. 2015; Dotaniya et al. 2016; Kalaivanan and Hattab 2016; Kumar and Chopra 2016).

25|$|At the hospital, the 99mTc {{that forms}} through 99Mo decay is {{chemically}} {{extracted from the}} technetium-99m generator.

When the 99Mo decays, it forms pertechnetate TcO4−, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling <b>normal</b> <b>saline</b> solution through the column of immobilized 99MoO42− elutes the soluble 99mTcO4−, resulting in a saline solution containing the 99mTc as the dissolved sodium salt of the pertechnetate.
