Defect-induced perturbations in the electronic and magnetic correlations possess characteristically different spatial patterns that can be visualized via their spectroscopic signatures in the local density of states or non-local spin susceptibility. These real space patterns provide insight into the complex electronic structure of heavy-fermion materials, the light or heavy character of the perturbed states, and the hybridization between them.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of a DVB-S 2 communication channel, it is necessary to remove the non-linear interferences induced by the power amplifier. Due to the presence of filters in the channel, this <b>non-linear</b> <b>interference</b> is also interference with memory. One of the most used techniques to cancel out the interferences in this case is the order p compensation. The order p compensation can be mathematically described as a recursive algorithm. The non- linear interference is supposed to be smaller after each step of the algorithm. However this is not always the case and it is necessary to define upper bounds on the system to ensure convergence of the algorithm.

A low power laser is coupled into an optical fiber tip that is used to locally excite the photoluminescence of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) dispersed in their surroundings. Emitted light from these QDs is generating the SPPs that propagate along the metal waveguides. Then, the above-referred propagation lengths were directly extracted from this novel experimental technique by studying the intensity of light decoupled at the output edge of the waveguide. Furthermore, an enhancement of the propagation length up to 0. 4 mm is measured for the 500 -nm-wide metal nanostripe, for which this effect is maximum. For this purpose, a simultaneous excitation of the same QDs dispersed in poly(methyl methacrylate) waveguides integrated with the metal nanostructures is performed by end-fire coupling an excitation laser energy as low as 1 KW/cm 2.

40|$|The {{advent of}} Coherent-detection systems {{supported}} by Digital-Signal-Processing (DSP) {{makes it possible}} to carry out electronic fiber chromatic dispersion and allows us to use multi-level modulation formats. These formats are affected by fiber non-linearity due to small spacing between constellations, especially in the high cardinality number modulation formats. Main disadvantage of <b>Non-Linear</b> <b>Interference</b> (NLI), which is considered as a limiting factor for performance, is to limit the OSNR, which in turn limits the maximum reach of the link. In the novel Uncompensated Transmission (UT) propagation regimes, it is possible to carry out system performance prediction based on relatively simple analytical non-linear propagation models. In this thesis, we use what is called the Gaussian-Noise (GN) model which shows high prediction ability in a single span and multi-span links. The main target of the exploitation of the physical link is optical network optimization. OSNR was previously considered to depend upon the noise produced by the amplifier, the only source of noise; NLI now is considered as additive Gaussian noise as stated in the GN- model and it depends on all the physical link parameters, but independent of the transceiver. This dependency on physical parameters and in-dependency on the transceiver leads us to think of the optimization of the link which will be the target of our work and see how this optimization could be reflected at the network level. The thesis work regards the implementation of the GN-model in optical network, both the standard wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and the Elastic Optical Networks (EONs). We investigate connection provisioning algorithms on optical infrastructures for three different architectures: fixed grid WDM with fixed-rate multilevel modulation, fixed-grid WDM with time-domain hybrid modulation formats and flexible grid. We perform a sensitivity analysis of network and physical layer parameters, such as the link length, the traffic load, different fiber types and the Q margin, to understand how each parameter influences the network design. Besides comparing the two paradigms of flexible and fixed grid networks, including both pure and hybrid modulation formats, in terms of their spectral efficiency and power consumption, we show the importance of integrating a detailed physical layer modelling in the network design phase. Flexible-grid optical networks {{turned out to be the}} most convincing candidate for the evolution of backbone optical networks in order to face the envisioned growth of IP traffic. They combine the maximization of spectral efficiency with the flexibility of traffic load per lightpath allowing a full exploitation of transmission level potentialities joined to the flexibility in satisfying traffic demand. In this network scenario, we propose an original approach to the logical topology design (LTD) problem in the offline planning phase. We deal with the LTD problem using heuristic algorithms incorporating a detailed transmission layer model. Several heuristic algorithms, dealing with traffic demands in different ordering, are considered for lightpath provisioning. Traffic ordering schemes are set based on two parameters: traffic demands capacity and lightpath physical route length. Through simulative analyses, we provide a performance comparison of different heuristics, using parameters like spectral efficiency, amount of blocked traffic and total number of transceivers. Furthermore, a constant need to improve network capacity and reduce power consumption in current fixed- grid WDM networks motivates researchers to find alternative solutions other than replacing the deployed equipment. One of the possible solutions is the use of hybrid EDFA/Raman amplifier, which improves signal- to-noise- ratio in a point to point link. This work aims at quantifying, by means of a detailed power model, the effect of these novel ideas on the power consumption of the network, which is key to build a future green Internet. Results show that hybrid amplification in moderate pumping regime minimizes total network power consumption for networks made up of all three fiber types in particular for non- zero dispersion- shifted fiber. Moreover, we analyze transparent wavelength routed optical networks using three different typical fiber types: NZDSF, SMF and PSCF and verify the effectiveness of Hybrid Raman/EDFA Fiber Amplification (HFA) with incremental pumping levels, up to the moderate pumping regime. Traffic is conveyed and retrieved in nodes by the use of flexible-grid elastic Nyquist Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) transponders able to adapt the modulation format and the occupied bandwidth - and the corresponding delivered rate - to the quality-of-transmission of the available lightpath, using up to five ITU-T prescribed 12. 5 GHz spectral slots. Impact of a detailed physical layer is considered considering both the impact of accumulation of ASE noise introduced by amplifiers and of <b>non-linear</b> <b>interference</b> generated by non-linear fiber propagation. We show that HFAs in moderate pumping regime reduces the spectral occupancy for all three fiber types with evidence in NZDSF. In essence to that, introduction of HFA is also beneficial to avoid blocking for higher traffic loads. Network Simulations considered several networking scenarios, where different heuristics are used to solve Resource and Spectrum Allocation (RSA) problems. Simulations are performed on different randomly generated and real networks to support the argument titling Next-Generation optical networks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{satellite}} communication, Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) {{has become}} one of the most promising techniques that can accommodate continuing increase in the number of users and traffic demands. The technology is based on radio resource sharing that separates communication channels in space. It relies on adaptive and dynamic beam-forming technology and well-designed algorithms for resource allocation among which frequency assignment is considered. This paper studies static Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) in a satellite communication system involving a satellite and a number of users located in a service area. The objective is to maximize the number of users that the system can serve while maintaining the signal to interference plus noise ratio of each user under a predefined threshold. Traditionally, interference is treated as fixed (binary interferences or fixed minimal required separation between frequencies). In this paper, the interference is cumulative and variable. To solve the problem, we work on both discrete and continuous optimizations. Integer linear programming formulations and greedy algorithms are proposed for solving the discrete frequency assignment problem. The solution is further improved by beam decentring algorithm which involves continuous adjustment of satellite beams and deals with <b>non-linear</b> change of <b>interference...</b>|$|R
40|$|Power {{control is}} a {{fundamental}} task accomplished in any wireless cellular network; its aim is to set the transmit power of any mobile terminal, so that each user is able to achieve its own target SINR. While conventional power control algorithms require knowledge {{of a number of}} parameters of the signal of interest and of the multiaccess interference, in this paper it is shown that in a large CDMA system much of this information can be dispensed with, and effective distributed power control algorithms may be implemented with very little information on the user of interest. An uplink CDMA system subject to flat fading is considered with a focus on the cases in which a linear MMSE receiver and a <b>non-linear</b> MMSE serial <b>interference</b> cancellation receiver are adopted; for the latter case new formulas are also given for the system SINR in the large system asymptote. Experimental results show an excellent agreement between the performance and the power profile of the proposed distributed algorithms and that of conventional ones that require much greater prior knowledge.

40|$|Immediate {{detection}} and diagnosis of existing faults and faulty behaviour of electrical motors using electrical signals {{is one of}} the important interests of the power industry. Motor current signature analysis is a modern approach to diagnose faults of induction motors. This thesis investigates the significance of propagated fault signatures through distributed power systems, aiming at explaining and quantifying different observations of faults signals and hence diagnoses machine faults with a higher accuracy. Electrical indicators of faults, unlike other fault indicators, (e. g. vibration signals), propagate all over the network. Therefore fault signals may be manipulated by operation of neighbouring motors and the system‘s environmental noise. Both simulation and practical results clearly demonstrate the signal interference and hence confusion in diagnosis due to presence of a faulty motor nearby. Thus a knowledge based system is necessary to understand the meaning of the signals manifested at various parts of the distributed power system. On another side, taking into account that fault signals are travelling all over the network, several observations can be made for events in the network. In this thesis the idea of cross evaluation of fault signals considering signal propagation will be discussed and analysed. The research attempts to improve diagnosis reliability with a simple and viable framework of decision making. The thesis scope is limited to monitoring behaviour of induction motors in distributed power systems. These types of electrical motors are the main load of most industries. In this thesis, existing formulations of fault signatures would not be significantly disturbed, as distributed diagnosis can fit into an existing framework of current signature analysis. The research takes advantage of multiple areas of study to formulate propagation of fault signals while they are travelling in a scaled down distributed power system. At the beginning, a systematic approach has been employed to estimate influence of fault signals in currents of neighbouring electrical motors. Further analysis in attenuation of electrical signals leads to a technical framework that evaluates propagation of fault signals in power networks. The framework has been developed to estimate origin of fault signal by employing propagation patterns and estimating anticipated fault representatives around the network. An analytical process has been proposed to take advantage of multiple observations in order to diagnose the type and identify origin of fault signals. This can help maximize the number of independent observations and thus improve the accuracy of traditional approaches to current signature analysis. In general, this provides a better monitoring of behaviour of electrical motors at a given site. A rewarding system has been used to identify and track the signals caused by motors and quantify association of current signals with known industrial faults. An example of a scaled down distributed power system has been simulated to describe behaviour of distributed power systems with faulty components. The simulation model is carefully compared with the practical results to validate the simulation results thoroughly. Type and strength of faults and size, speed, load and placement of electrical motors are acting variables in propagation patterns of fault signals. These variables have been simulated in a scaled down industrial power network to examine distributed diagnosis in the new environment. In addition a number of scaled-down experiments have been employed to verify results of simulation models and confirm the accuracy of results. Analytical results demonstrate significant improvement in describing interference amongst electrical motors that work together in an electrical network. This leads to a simple strategy for identifying the ownership of fault signals and hence having more accurate diagnostic results. Further developments in modelling the propagation of fault indicators emerged for improving the reliability and efficiency of fault diagnosis in industrial systems. On the other hand, a number of shortcomings have been observed in implementing strategy of distributed diagnosis including confusion among many similar faults in the power network and malfunctioning of the diagnosis system due to <b>non-linear</b> <b>interferences</b> of noise signals. Some of these problems are believed to be solvable by using a proper numerical solution (e. g. Artificial Neural Network, Bayesian, etc.) to process fault indices and propagation patterns before and after occurrence of each fault. In conclusion, the thesis does not claim to provide a complete solution of fault diagnosis in electrical motors. But it is an attempt to provide a more dependable industry solution for fault diagnosis in induction motors. Distributed diagnosis is a framework which takes advantage of multiple observations of a single fault and hence it is dependent on quality of acquired signals among individual observations...|$|R
