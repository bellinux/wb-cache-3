5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

500|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> left-wing athletes {{prevailed in}} other Cypriot cities. In Larnaca, the Alki Larnaca F.C. {{was founded in}} April 1948. A month later, the Gymnastics Club Zeno (GSZ) banned Alki from using its GSZ Stadium; a similar {{proposal}} to exclude Turks and Catholics was rejected. The GSZ amended its constitution, prohibiting enrollment of new members unless they signed a declaration that [...] "they espouse the Hellenic nationalistic ideals". This excluded left-wing athletes from becoming members or using its stadium. In May, Orfeas Nicosia was founded in Nicosia; that month, APOEL F.C. sent a greeting by telegram to SEGAS ("cordial brotherly greetings to the entire Greek youth athletes"), {{on the occasion of}} national games, and wished for the cessation of inner-nation mutiny. APOEL asked all members and athletes of the club to sign a declaration, supporting the content of the telegram. Leftist members and athletes of APOEL considered [...] "inner-nation mutiny" [...] as a challenge and political statement of the club, thus they distanced themselves from that statement. The Cypriot press encouraged a hostile climate with articles and commentary. This was followed by the indefinite suspension of five APOEL athletes (Lympouris, Tsialis, Gogakis, Xatzivasileiou and Christodoulou), who founded AC Omonia in June 1948 with former members of the APOEL. AS Kyrenia was later founded.|$|E
500|$|Legal {{scholars}} have also identified {{benefits associated with}} circuit splits. For example, Justice Louis Brandeis praised the fact that splits of opinion among courts allow jurisdictions to experiment with new developments in law without risking harm to other jurisdictions. Judge Diane P. Wood has suggested that circuit splits and [...] "disagreements with colleagues force judges to sharpen their writing, push them to defend their positions, {{and from time to}} time persuade them that someone else's perspective is preferable". Amanda Frost has argued that <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> circuit splits may hinder progress and creative problem solving because [...] "ourts of appeals are generally hesitant to depart from precedent set in other jurisdictions, despite being under no obligation to adhere to decisions by sister circuits." [...] Consequently, Frost suggests that uniformity among circuits may be [...] "overvalued." [...] Likewise, Wayne A. Logan suggests that Circuit splits may also be beneficial by virtue of the fact that citizens in different parts of the country have different preferences for how to structure their laws. Additionally, Judge J. Clifford Wallace has argued that there is nothing inherently wrong with different laws existing in different circuits, and [...] "if conflicts were by their very nature unacceptable, the traditional rule denying precedential status to out-of-circuit decisions probably would not have enjoyed its long history." ...|$|E
500|$|Aware {{that some}} {{scholars}} might reject any {{view of the}} development of homosexuality resembling psychoanalytic theory and object to studies that appear to take it seriously, Bell et al. noted that while they gave psychoanalytic theory considerable attention, many of the variables used in their statistical analyses pertained to [...] "experiences occurring outside our respondents′ original households", including relationships with peers, labeling by others, dating experiences, and sexual experiences. They added that it was not easy to answer objections to the use of retrospective data, given the unresolved issue of how accurate their respondents′ recollections of childhood were, and that even a longitudinal study would have been open to question. Bell et al. observed that some gay rights activists might object to their study on principle, and suspect them of being motivated by a desire {{to find a way to}} prevent homosexuality and reduce its incidence, while other critics might regret their involvement in a tradition of inquiry that has so far supported the majority view that homosexuality is a perversion or deviation, and be concerned that their study would be used to reinforce social prejudice against homosexuals. In response to these potential criticisms, Bell et al. argued that ideas about the development of homosexuality contribute to prejudice against homosexuals, and that so long as [...] "the heterosexual majority" [...] accepted largely untested theories that see homosexuality as the result of a bad upbringing, their <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> homosexuals would never change.|$|E

Bergler argues that while homosexual men attribute their sexual promiscuity to their desire for variety and their [...] "insatiable sexual appetites", its actual causes are the inherently unsatisfying nature of male homosexual sex and homosexual men's [...] "constant masochistic craving for danger".

2500|$|One {{hypothesis}} on how {{attitudes are}} formed, first advanced by Abraham Tesser in 1983, is that strong {{likes and dislikes}} are rooted in our genetic make-up. [...] Tesser speculates that individuals are disposed to hold certain strong attitudes {{as a result of}} inborn physical, sensory, and cognitive skills, temperament, and personality traits. Whatever disposition nature elects to give us, our most treasured attitudes are often formed as a result of exposure to attitude objects; our history of rewards and punishments; the attitude that our parents, friends, and enemies express; the social and cultural context in which we live; and other types of experiences we have. Obviously, attitudes are formed through the basic process of learning. Numerous studies have shown that people can form strong positive and <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> neutral objects that are in some way linked to emotionally charged stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|Primarily, {{objectification}} theory {{describes how}} {{women and girls}} are influenced {{as a result of}} expected social and gender roles. Research indicates not all women are influenced equally, due to the anatomical, hormonal, and genetic differences of the female body; however, women’s bodies are often objectified and evaluated more frequently. Self-objectification in girls tends to stem from two main causes: the internalization of traditional beauty standards as translated through media as well as any instances of sexual objectification that they might encounter in their daily lives. It is not uncommon for women to translate their anxieties over their constant sense of objectification into obsessive self-surveillance. This, in turn, can lead to many serious problems in women and girls, including [...] "body shame, anxiety, <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> menstruation, a disrupted flow of consciousness, diminished awareness of internal bodily states, depression, sexual dysfunction, and disordered eating." ...|$|E

Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com stated, [...] "Not the most passionate kiss, but satisfying enough, given {{that most of the}} episode was devoted to showcasing the big event." [...] The kiss represented a change in American culture. Stephen Tropiano of PopMatters said, [...] "In perhaps what could be {{a step in the right}} direction, daytime television has at last included the first on-screen kiss between a same-sex couple." [...] Tropiano, however, criticized shows treating same-sex kisses as [...] "big events". He stated, [...] "Over the years, television has repeatedly made the same point by treating a kiss exchanged between two members of the same sex as something out-of-the-ordinary and unnatural. It's the network brass more than television series writers and producers who have reinforced society's <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> public displays of affection between gay and lesbian couples by treating same-sex kissing as a taboo subject." [...] Tropiano wondered now that Lena and Bianca had kissed if they would kiss again or go beyond that in regards to physical intimacy; he felt that it was not likely until society, or at least, television, began to regard a same-sex kiss as just a kiss.|$|E
