This study examined the relationship between level of depression and student misbehavior for 49 students in grades 3 - 6 in a small, Midwest elementary school. Students were given a self-rated test, the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI), to test for level of depression. ii This study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>detentions</b> received by elementary students who experienced a high level of depression, as indicated by the T-score on the CDI, as compared to those students who experienced a lower level of depression. An unexpected factor in these results was the low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>detentions</b> received overall by the 49 students. Only 49 total detentions were recorded for the 49 students, with 28 of the grades 3 - 6 students receiving zero detentions.
