Their marriage took place before 1266, when Charles I granted {{one third of the}} castle of Sant'Agata Irpina at Solofra, withheld by Giacomo per the <b>nuptial</b> <b>agreement,</b> to Giordana and Aldoino in return for their support. They reinforced the castle during the War of the Sicilian Vespers.|$|E

Jenny starts panicking that the wedding will be over before it's begun. She is reassured by Albert, the wedding planner, that all will be well. He shares stories of all the weddings he's been involved in, pointing out that nothing has ever shocked him or prevented the ceremony from taking place ("Albert's Turn").|$|E

50|$|He {{composed}} two detailed volumes on {{his work}} as a royal bursar, both now in the Royal Library of Turin: Memorie concernenti l'Economato regio, ricavate dagli Archivi del Senato e dai registri della Cancelleria dell'Economato di Milano and Istoria dell'Economato regio o sia Relazione distinta di tutti i successi seguiti pendente l'amministrazione di quest'officio dal 1707 al 1718 inclusivamente. He was a copious collector of documents relating to ecclesiastical benefices: imperial diplomas, papal concessions, <b>nuptial</b> <b>agreements,</b> treaties, most of which found their way into the Royal Library of Turin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{marriage}} bargain {{he struck}} with Charles II of Naples for his youngest daughter, Beatrice, was notorious {{in his day}} and among chroniclers afterwards: Dante asserted that Charles [...] "was seen to sell his own daughter and to bargain over her as corsairs do over slaves." [...] The <b>nuptial</b> <b>agreement</b> survives in the Este archives: Azzo granted his father-in-law 51,000 florins, to be invested in lands in the Regno and in appropriate places in the marquisate of Este, and promised to establish primogeniture in the Este holdings, contrary in fact to Estense traditions, and explicitly disinheriting Azzo's brother Francesco. The wedding was solemnized. Modena and Reggio rebelled in 1306 over an attempt to assign them to Beatrice {{as part of the}} bride price, a custom that had been superseded in Italy by the dowry.|$|E
40|$|The first {{clause in}} the Law Commissionâ��s draft <b>Nuptial</b> <b>Agreement</b> Bill would abolish the common law rule that invalidates {{agreements}} contemplating a future separation. The confusion surrounding {{the current status of}} this rule is evident from the phrase within the clause, â��if it still exists. â�� By tracing the common law rule to its source, this article demonstrates how key cases have misinterpreted the historical development of this rule and that the rule still exists in terms of judicial reasoning. The broader question {{as to whether or not}} the rule should exist is also examined: this needs to be extracted from the confusion and considered afresh, bearing in mind the importance of the rule to the very nature of marriage. The conclusion is that the rule should be abolished by Parliament, but that this decision should be based on the outcome of pertinent deliberations and free from clouded reasoning...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the results}} of a divorce is {{division}} of joint property of a couple. Division of joint property is based on the provision in Article 97 of KHI which mentions that each divorced woman or man is entitled to get half of their joint property as long as it isn’t determined otherwise in <b>nuptial</b> <b>agreement.</b> However, the regulation in Article 97 of KHI isn’t always applied in division of joint property in the society. Sometimes, joint property is controlled by one party, whether the divorced woman or man. In fact, the control over joint property has a great opportunity of being used as collateral in debt agreements. Debt agreement where the obligation isn’t fulfilled may lead to the bankruptcy of a debtor. Debtor’s bankruptcy makes division of joint property difficult. Therefore, the author reviewed the effect of bankruptcy law on joint property post-divorce using legislative approach. This is a library research which reviewed literature sources related with joint property and bankruptcy. This study was descriptive-analytical which presented regulations and legal facts which were then analyzed by theory of law discovery using legal construction method which consists of analogical argument and argumentum a contrario, to get in depth result to draw conclusion. The research result showed that debt agreements which use joint properties which haven’t been divided as collaterals caused bankruptcy, so joint properties which haven’t been divided are boedel pailit. The author used analogical argument on the Jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of RI No. 803 K/Sip/ 1970 dated 5 Mei 1970, so that debt which occurs after divorce in which joint property is involved in it (as collateral) will be attached as joint debt, thus boedel pailit is undivided joint property and personal property of bankrupt debtor. The former spouse of bankrupt debtor may volunteer to be concurrent creditor to get their rights over the joint property which hasn’t been divided. Consequently, the received portion may be smaller than the amount of division of joint property which should be received. Essentially, any legal action to be performed by bankrupt debtor is actually allowed, including division of joint property, as long as the action doesn’t disadvantage boedel pailit...|$|E
40|$|In Serbian {{legislation}} {{notary public}} profession is introduced recently, enacting the Act on Public Notary 2011. Notary public has existed in Serbia before World War II, {{but after the}} War this profession ceased to exist, as it was not regulated by law. In this article author discusses issue of the public notary authority in marital/partnership relations. Public notary has authority in property relations and support. Regarding property relations, according to the Act on Notary Public, agreement on division {{of the community of}} property might be concluded in specific notarial form. In addition, <b>nuptial</b> <b>agreements</b> (pre <b>nuptial</b> or antenuptial) might be concluded in specific notarial form. The same is applied to the partners agreements if partners live in heterosexual nonmarital cohabitation, regulated by Family Act. Regarding support, public notary has authority to issue agreements on support. It is important to stress that in Serbian family law waiving the right to support has no legal bearing...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that in a free society, adults should be {{entitled}} to enter into private contracts without the interference of the state. However, under English law, husband and wife (or a couple in a same-sex marriage) are not free to enter into a legally binding contract in which they can set out their own terms when this right is afforded to other partnerships. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to consider whether such protection can or should be afforded to couples when entering into marriage. Divorce has financial consequences beyond those of the legal fees involved; the law holds that, despite the dissolution of the relationship, the parties retain obligations to support their former spouse. Such ‘needs’ are determined by the courts, with all property considered as appropriate for disposal. The increased number of remarriages and the increased age of first-time marriages have led to a growing desire for parties to protect the assets of each party as they enter into the state of matrimony. The right to autonomy in respect of their assets is therefore a point of contention. At a time when the legal system is trying to move to a more accessible, less court-driven system, to make divorce more accessible for individuals without the need for costly legal intervention, it has been suggested that a new approach is required to enable people to devise fair solutions for themselves. The Supreme Court judgment in Radmacher v Granatino [2010] UKSC 42 supported the freedom of parties to determine their own division of assets, stating that <b>nuptial</b> <b>agreements</b> should be given ‘decisive weight’ unless the agreement itself is unfair – and it is the courts who determine what is considered ‘fair’. One could, therefore, suggest that the apparent power of parties to determine the division of assets is not as it seems, as the final decision remains with the courts if the agreement is challenged by either party. The government has recognised the need for clarity in this area of law, initially through the commissioning of Law Commission Report 208, Matrimonial Property Agreements. Shortly afterwards, this was extended to include the financial provision element of divorce, and Report 343, Matrimonial Property, Needs and Agreements, was commissioned. Unusually, the government commissioned Report 343 before the research on Report 208 was complete, such was the importance placed upon this additional element. Their aim was to discern whether a simple statutory framework could be created to guide couples through the division of assets following the breakdown of their marriage. This paper discusses the impact of this judgment on the development of law in this area while critically analysing the future position following the recommendations of Law Commission Report 343, Matrimonial Property, Needs and Agreements (2014). As an area of law of current interest both in legal practice and academia, this paper looks at the law in practice both before and after Radmacher v Granatino and Law Commission Report 343, and considers whether further reform is needed before the law is readily accessible to the ‘common man’...|$|R
