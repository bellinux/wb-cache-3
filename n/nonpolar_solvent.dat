The mechanism begins with formation of the 2-pyridinethiol ester (scheme 19). Proton-transfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center, providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product.

2500|$|Supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} extraction: Supercritical {{carbon dioxide is}} an {{excellent}} <b>nonpolar</b> <b>solvent</b> for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: [...] is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1°C and pressures above 73 atm. Under these conditions, [...] is in a [...] "supercritical" [...] state: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden [...] is then sprayed with high pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by charcoal adsorption (as above) or by distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis.|$|E

50|$|Solvent often {{influences}} folding.

50|$|Co-solvents (in water solvent) {{are defined}} as kosmotropic (order-making) if they {{contribute}} to the stability and structure of water-water interactions. Kosmotropes cause water molecules to favorably interact, which also (in effect) stabilizes intramolecular interactions in macromolecules such as proteins.

50|$|Analytical chemistry: Often {{there are}} {{chemical}} species present or necessary at one stage of sample processing that will {{interfere with the}} analysis. For example, some air monitoring is performed by drawing air through a small glass tube filled with sorbent particles that have been coated with a chemical to stabilize or derivatize the analyte of interest. The coating may be of such a concentration or characteristics that it would damage the instrumentation or interfere with the analysis. If the sample can be extracted from the sorbent using a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>solvent</b> (such as toluene or carbon disulfide), and the coating is polar (such as HBr or phosphoric acid) the dissolved coating will partition into the aqueous phase. Clearly {{the reverse is true}} as well, using polar extraction solvent and a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>solvent</b> to partition a nonpolar interferent. A small aliquat of the organic phase (or in the latter case, polar phase) can then be injected into the instrument for analysis.|$|E

5000|$|Noncovalent {{solid-phase}} {{organic synthesis}} or NC-SPOS {{is a form}} of Solid-phase synthesis whereby the organic substrate is bonded to the solid phase not by a covalent bond but by other chemical interactions.

50|$|Polystyrene resin is a {{versatile}} resin {{and it is}} quite useful in multi-well, automated peptide synthesis, due to its minimal swelling in dichloromethane. The initial support used by R.

This resin produces a hydrophobic bead that is solvated by a <b>nonpolar</b> <b>solvent</b> such as dichloromethane or dimethylformamide. Since then, new resins have been developed that have the advantages of chemical inertness, and enhanced swelling or rigidity (a property of mechanical strength).
