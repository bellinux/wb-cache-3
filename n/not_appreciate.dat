5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his protest that they would <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky's {{analysis}} {{of each of}} The Five was unsparing. While {{at least some of}} his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{political}} connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon {{his return to the}} United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> the importance of the emergence of rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.|$|E
5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a price to be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Holloman again {{spent the}} season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17–10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an {{invitation}} to spring training. Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> the pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, {{for this reason that}} Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year. In 1951, he spent seven games with Nashville, but spent most of {{the season with}} the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League, where he posted an 11–9 record and a 3.87 ERA.|$|E

5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, {{should have been}} prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. They did so, however, in a manner which indicated it still did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> {{the problems of the}} Command. Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E
5|$|Suu's {{signature}} {{was required}} to pass the ruling, but he referred the matter to the HNC to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. There was speculation the HNC did this {{as many of them}} were old, and therefore did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> the generals' negativity towards seniors—some South Vietnamese mockingly called the HNC the High National Museum. On December 19, a Saturday, the generals moved to dissolve the HNC by arresting some of its members. The HNC had already ceased to function in any meaningful way, as only 9 of the 17 members were still occasionally attending its meetings, and few on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|The {{rejection}} likely {{had several}} causes. The {{people of the}} Grants were tired of the disputes with New York, and they were tired of Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced. Finally, {{the failure of the}} attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> in a regimental leader. Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and was someone that also commanded respect. The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution (notably at Hubbardton and Bennington) may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting. In the end, Allen took the rejection in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.|$|E

5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} on American soil was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They {{were the first}} rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord {{was one of the}} contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act of Cream in their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E
5|$|The premier night fighter aces in the RAF—Cunningham, Braham and Branse Burbridge—did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> press attention. In {{the case}} of Cunningham and Burbridge, this may have stemmed from deeper {{religious}} convictions about combat and killing. Burbridge became a priest {{during the war and}} both he and Cunningham did not cooperate with biographers when approached to have their exploits described in print after the war. During the war, Braham also actively shunned the lime-light. One of the country's best-selling newspapers, the Daily Express, asked to interview him but he declined. Much to Braham's embarrassment, his father gave interviews about his then famous son in 1943. When no stories were forthcoming, the newspapers soon lost interest. Braham and Cunningham were certainly aware of each other {{as a result of the}} press attention, and a competitive rivalry developed. In his book Scramble, Braham mentioned with pride the night he surpassed Cunningham's score permanently.|$|E
5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message {{at the heart of the}} film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> its merits.|$|E

5|$|The {{signature}} of the military-appointed civilian Chief of State Phan Khắc Sửu was required to pass the ruling, but Sửu referred the matter to the High National Council (HNC), a junta-appointed civilian advisory body, to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. This was speculated to be because many HNC members were old, and did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> the generals' negativity towards seniors. On 19 December, the generals dissolved the HNC. The operation was commanded by Thi — who had traveled into Saigon from I Corps — and Kỳ. The national police, which was under the control and command of the military, moved through the streets before dawn, arresting five HNC members and other politicians and student leaders they deemed to be an obstacle to military rule. Minh and the other aging generals were arrested and flown to Pleiku, a Central Highlands town in a Montagnard area and forcibly retired, while other officers were simply imprisoned in the capital. The junta's forces also arrested around 100 members of the National Salvation Council (NSC) of the anti-war Lê Khắc Quyến party. The NSC was a new political party active in the I Corps region that opposed {{the expansion of the}} war and was aligned with Thi and the Buddhist activist monk Thích Trí Quang. As Thi was active in the purge, it was believed that the Quyen had fallen out with Thi.|$|E
25|$|Two changes {{took place}} in the fall of 1979, at the {{beginning}} of the fourth season. The first was the addition of Lana, an older woman who chased Jack around. She liked to pursue him but he did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> her advances. Since Ann Wedgeworth did <b>not</b> <b>appreciate</b> her diminishing role in the series, Lana was dropped from the show without any explanation before the season was half over. The other new addition that fall was the new building manager, Ralph Furley (played by Don Knotts), whose brother Bart bought the building from the Ropers. Mr. Furley pursued Lana unsuccessfully, as she unsuccessfully pursued Jack. Unlike Lana, Mr. Furley appeared until the end of the series.|$|E
