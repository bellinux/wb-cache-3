500|$|Future {{directions}} for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing {{the cognitive and}} linguistic demands of AAC, and the barriers to effective social interaction. AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use. The rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies {{has the potential to}} radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible communication devices; [...] however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users. Android and other open source operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the accessibility features and software required. Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions, or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using speech recognition systems. Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange, are also in development. Similarly, research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions. <b>Natural</b> <b>language</b> <b>generation</b> techniques have been investigated, including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners, data from a user's schedule and from real-time Internet vocabulary searches, as well as information about location from global positioning systems and other sensors. However, despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users: [...] "The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology, but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} {{linguistic}} techniques required for <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> driven knowledge management interfaces. We describe two significant aspects {{of such an}} interface: First, how the user input is handled to provide an unrestricted <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> user interface, and second, how the gathered knowledge should be preprocessed, classified and thus prepared for a <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> interactive retrieval. A framework of grammatical structures (supertags) {{is associated with the}} elements of an ontology (of the respective domain). This combination of ontologies and supertagging describes a novel and very robust way in parsing of nontrivial user utterances and allows <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> feedback <b>generation.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Multilinguality is an {{important}} component of spoken dialogue systems, both because it makes the systems available to a wider audience and because it leads to a more flexible system dialogue strategy. This thesis concerns the development of a Chinese language capability for the ORION system, which is one of many spoken dialogue systems available within the GALAXY-II architecture. This new system, which we call LIESHOU, interacts with Mandarin-speaking users and performs off-line tasks, initiating later contact with a user at a pre-negotiated time. The development and design of LIESHOU closely followed the design of similar multilingual GALAXY-II domains, such as MUXING (Chinese JUPITER), and PHRASEBOOK (Translation Guide for Foreign Travelers). The successful deployment of LIESHOU required the design and implementation of four main components- speech recognition, <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> understanding, <b>language</b> <b>generation,</b> and speech synthesis. These four components were implemented using the SUMMIT speech recognition system, TINA <b>Natural</b> <b>Language</b> understanding system, GENESIS-II language generatio...|$|R
