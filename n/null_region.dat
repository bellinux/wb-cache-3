40|$|A common {{approach}} {{to the design of}} phase II clinical trials in oncology is to conduct a two-stage trial so as to control type I and type II error rates. A number of researchers have proposed methods for the design of such trials when the response can take {{one of a number of}} ordered values such as tumor response, stable disease or progressive disease. In this case. the problem may be formulated as that of testing a complex null hypothesis. Control of the type I error rate thus requires specification of the <b>null</b> <b>region</b> and construction of a test that limits the maximum error rate over this region. In this paper we propose that the <b>null</b> <b>region</b> should be bounded by a line in the two-dimensional parameter space for the setting with a response with three levels and more generally by a plane or hyperplane. We then propose a test based on the likelihood ratio statistic and show how this may be calculated in this case for a three-level response. The method is illustrated using an example of a clinical trial to evaluate a new treatment for breast cancer. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{elimination}} of in-board ohmic heating solenoid {{is required for}} the spherical torus (ST) to function as an attractive fusion power plant. An in-board ohmic solenoid, along with the shielding needed for its insulation, increases the size and, hence, the cost of the plant. Here, we investigate using static as well as dynamic codes in ST geometries a solenoid-free start-up concept utilizing a set of out-board poloidal field coils. By using the static code, an optimization of coil positions as well as coil currents was performed to demonstrate that it is indeed possible to create a high quality multi-pole field <b>null</b> <b>region</b> while retaining significant flux (volt-seconds) needed for the subsequent current ramp-up.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} to viable fusion energy is the exhaust of hot plasma, as future magnetic fusion devices will have unacceptably high heat fluxes on the plasma facing components. Recent research into advanced divertor designs and alternative magnetic configurations attempts to alleviate this issue, however {{the effectiveness of these}} configurations relies on cross field transport in the poloidal magnetic <b>null</b> <b>region,</b> which is currently poorly understood. Simulations of instabilities and turbulence in X-point configurations are challenging due to the limitations of field-aligned coordinate systems: X-point dynamics are often interpolated based on nearby flux surfaces, which could exclude relevant physics. Here we present the results of turbulence and transport simulations relevant to tokamak X-points in various magnetic geometries using coordinate systems which are not aligned to the magnetic field. First, we present results as part of a feasibility study of a university-scale linear plasma device capable of producing azimuthal X-points. The turbulent characteristics of this system are explored and measurements using synthetic diagnostics are proposed. These studies are then extended to toroidal geometries by simulating filament propagation in TORPEX poloidal magnetic null point scenarios and comparison to experiment. It is determined that the <b>null</b> <b>region</b> can cause an acceleration of filaments due to increasing connection length, but this acceleration is small relative to other effects, which we quantify. Experimental measurements are reproduced, and the dominant acceleration mechanism is identified as that of a developing dipole in a moving background. Finally, the implementation of the Flux Coordinate Independent method for parallel derivatives into BOUT++ is investigated by simulating transport and diffusion in nonaxisymmetric geometries. The potential for BOUT++ {{to be used as a}} stellarator turbulence and transport code is also discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Under most conditions, {{increasing}} {{the intensity of}} a flickering light makes the flicker more conspicuous. For a light flickering at 15 times per second, however, {{increasing the}} intensity can cause the flicker to disappear before reappearing again at higher intensities [Vision Res. 29, 1539 (1989) ]. This flicker disappearance or null is also evident in human electrophysiological recordings at the same intensity levels. These results point to a duality within the rod visual pathway, in which flicker signals travel through a slow and a fast pathway and then recombine at a later stage. At 15 Hz the slow rod flicker signals are delayed by half a cycle relative to the fast signals. Thus, when the two signals are recombined, they destructively interfere and diminish the percep-tion of flicker. The dual-pathway interpretation is supported by both electroretinographic and psychophysical evidence showing a phase difference of half a cycle between 15 -Hz rod signals just below and just above the <b>null</b> <b>region.</b> These effects are apparent {{not only in the}} normal observer but also in an achromat observer who lacks functioning cone vision. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the ionized wake of a capsule entering the Martian atmosphere and the circularly polarized radiation emitted by an antenna located on the aft part of the capsule is theoretically investigated in this study. A simplified mathematical model of the atmosphere of Mars, the entry-trajectory of the capsule, and the flow field surrounding the capsule {{are used in the}} analysis. The near wake of the capsule is approximated by a cylindrically stratified plasma shell consisting of n plasma regions. The plasma in each region is assumed to be homogeneous, anisotropic, and conducting, and moving at a uniform velocity relative to the antenna. The antenna is represented by a turnstile antenna located off-axis λ o / 4 above an infinite ground plane and operates at the signal frequencies of 400 MHz and 2. 295 GHz. Integral expressions for the cylindrical components of the field vectors are obtained by a rigorous relativistic formulation of the problem, and are evaluated using the techniques of asymptotic expansions to yield the radiation patterns of the antenna. Radiation patterns for the special case of an on-axis antenna radiating through a uniform, lossless, and isotropic plasma shell are presented and are compared with the free space patterns. The analysis shows that blackout occurs during the entry of a capsule into the Martian atmosphere, Before and after blackout, the radiation patterns of the antenna exhibit an on-axis <b>null</b> <b>region</b> whose angular extent is proportional to the electron concentration of the plasma. Also, sharp peaks which are attributed to leaky wave radiation, are present in the <b>null</b> <b>region</b> of the patterns. For the non-null region of the patterns, the values of the gain function of the antenna oscillate about the free space values. As the electron concentration of the plasma increases, the peaks in the radiation patterns become more numerous and more sharply defined. The effects of the motion of the plasma on the radiation emitted by the antenna are to shift the peaks of the radiation patterns to smaller cone angles and to introduce more peaks into the patterns. For the low velocity case corresponding to an entry into the Martian atmosphere, no serious motional or depolarization effects occur, and communications with the capsule can be satisfactorily carried out when the condition of blackout does not exist. </p...|$|E

In this work, we study the effect of magnetic field on the gravitomagnetic effect in neutron stars with poloidal geometry, which is produced {{as a result of its}} rotation. We show that the magnetic field has a non-negligible impact on frame dragging. The maximum effect of the magnetic field appears along the polar direction, where the frame-dragging frequency decreases with increase in magnetic field, and along the equatorial direction, where its magnitude increases. For intermediate angles, the effect of the magnetic field decreases, and goes through a minimum for a particular angular value at which magnetic field has no effect on gravitomagnetism. Beyond that particular angle gravitomagnetic effect increases with increasing magnetic field.

Our findings indicate that the prior probability values do affect false positives, and this study suggests values to calibrate the prior. Also, the sensitivity of the results to the prior probability values depends on two factors: the linkage disequilibrium between the marker loci examined, and whether this dependence is included in the model.

The results were obtained using single-particle simulations in a fixed magnetic field model. The origin of the ridge is shown to be due to initially earthward going ions which pass through the neutral line region.

40|$|Congenital {{nystagmus}} (CN) is {{an incurable}} pathological spontaneous oscillation {{of the eyes}} with an onset {{in the first few}} months of life. The pathophysiology of CN is mysterious. There is no consistent neurological abnormality, but the majority of patients have a wide range of unrelated congenital visual abnormalities affecting either the cornea, lens, retina or optic nerve. In this theoretical study, we show that these eye oscillations could develop as an adaptive response to maximize visual contrast with poor foveal function in the infant visuomotor system, at a time of peak neural plasticity. We argue that in a visual system with abnormally poor high spatial frequency sensitivity, image contrast is not only maintained by keeping the image on the fovea (or its remnant) but also by some degree of image motion. Using the calculus of variations, we show that the optimal trade-off between these conflicting goals is to generate oscillatory eye movements with increasing velocity waveforms, as seen in real CN. When we include a stochastic component to the start of each epoch (quick-phase inaccuracy) various observed waveforms (including pseudo-cycloid) emerge as optimal strategies. Using the delay embedding technique, we find a low fractional dimension as reported in real data. We further show that, if a velocity command-based pre-motor circuitry (neural integrator) is harnessed to generate these waveforms, the emergence of a <b>null</b> <b>region</b> is inevitable. We conclude that CN could emerge paradoxically as an ‘optimal’ adaptive response in the infant visual system during an early critical period.

However, haplotypes are often not available and cannot be deduced with certainty from the unphased genotypes. One possible two-stage approach is to infer the phase of multilocus genotype data and analyze the resulting haplotypes as if known. Here, haplotypes are inferred using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and the best-guess phase assignment for each individual analyzed. However, inferring haplotypes from phase-unknown data is prone to error and this {{should be taken into}} account in the subsequent analysis. An alternative approach is to analyze the phase-unknown multilocus genotypes themselves. Here we present a generalization of the method for phase-known haplotype data to the case of unphased SNP genotypes. Our approach is designed for high-density SNP data, so we opted to analyze the simulated dataset.
