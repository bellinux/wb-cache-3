He used Lane's friendship with the Jaguar executive and the dinner at Pete Campbell's house as examples. Vincent Kartheiser reasoned that Pete invited them over to show off his wife, home, and success. Jon Hamm elaborated on Don's reluctance to go as his desire to keep his relationship separate from the poisonous influence of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} transport schemes in Salford was constructed by the Salford to Wigan Turnpike trust, by an Act of Parliament of 1753. Turnpike roads had {{a huge impact on}} the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> transport around the region. [...] Packhorses were superseded by wagons, and merchants would no longer accompany their caravans to markets and fairs, instead sending agents with samples, and despatching the goods at a later date. Road transport was not without its problems however and in 1808 the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal was connected to the River Irwell. In the main a coal-carrying canal, it provided a valuable boost to the economies of Salford and Manchester, with a large number of wharves at its terminus in Salford. Sixteen years later John Greenwood started the first bus operation from Pendleton to Market Street, Manchester.|$|E

2500|$|Collaterlie Sisters (alternative spelling: [...] "Collately Sisters") (Doon Mackichan) – {{business}} correspondent. As satire of the incomprehensible <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> {{news to the}} layman, Sisters talks nonsensically {{about the}} world of business, padding out her reports with meaningless jargon ("Trading remained succulent {{for the rest of}} the day.") [...] She uses bewildering graphics, mainly when addressing the currency market, using such aids as the [...] "Currency Cat", the [...] "Currency Kidney", and the [...] "International Finance Arse". Sisters also employs odd syntaxes, reciting strangely arranged sentences in a semi-robotic deadpan fashion (often smirking at seemingly arbitrary points in the monologue) and frequently name-checking Chris in the middle of her reports. During her reports, a news ticker scrolls across the bottom, displaying meaningless symbols, on one occasion containing lots of fours. Chris appears to have a strong dislike for Sisters as he can sometimes be heard making scathing remarks about her. In one episode, Chris asks someone to take Sisters off his monitor as [...] "I don't want to see her face".|$|E
2500|$|Smith's {{statement}} {{about the benefits of}} [...] "an invisible hand" [...] may be meant to answer Mandeville's contention that [...] "Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits". It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive {{for a wide variety of}} goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their [...] "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices". Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> interests, which may form cabals or monopolies, fixing the highest price [...] "which can be squeezed out of the buyers". Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants [...] "...in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public...The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention." [...] Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society: ...|$|E

If it had been our wish to embroil matters, and, {{for the sake of}} distressing ministry, to commit the two kingdoms in a dispute, we had nothing to do but (without at all condemning the propositions) to have gone into the commercial detail of the objects of them. It could not have been refused to us: and you, who know the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> so well, must know that this would have caused such delays, and given rise during that delay to such discussions, as all the wisdom of your favorite minister could never have settled. But, indeed, you mistake your men. We tremble at the idea of a disunion of these two nations. The only thing in which we differ with you is this,--that we do not think your attaching yourselves to the court and quarrelling with the independent part of this people is the way to promote the union of two free countries, or of holding them together by the most natural and salutary ties.|$|E
