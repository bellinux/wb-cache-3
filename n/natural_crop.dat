6000|$|I abstained from {{remarking}} that Charles {{himself had}} not arrived at it even now, until I told him. I thought that {{to say so}} would serve no good purpose. So I merely went on: [...] "Well, {{it seems to me}} likely that when he came as Medhurst, with his hair cut short, he was really wearing his own <b>natural</b> <b>crop,</b> in its simplest form and of its native hue. By now it has had time to grow long and bushy. When he was David Granton, no doubt, he clipped it to an intermediate length, trimmed his beard and moustache, and dyed them all red, to a fine Scotch colour. As the Seer, again, he wore his hair much the same as Elihu's; only, to suit the character, more combed and fluffy. As the little curate, he darkened it and plastered it down. As Von Lebenstein, he shaved close, but cultivated his moustache to its utmost dimensions, and dyed it black after the Tyrolese fashion. He need never have had a wig; his own natural hair would throughout have been sufficient, allowing for intervals." ...|$|E
6000|$|After a {{while we}} turned off the high road into a forest path, which was sound enough, the soil being one sheet of poor sand and white quartz gravel, which would in Scotland, or even Devonshire, have carried nothing taller than heath, but was here covered with impenetrable jungle. The {{luxuriance}} of this jungle, be it remembered, must not delude a stranger, as it has too many ere now, into fancying that the land would be profitable under cultivation. [...] As long as the soil is shaded and kept damp, it will bear an abundant crop of woody fibre, which, composed almost entirely of carbon and water, drains hardly any mineral constituents from the soil. But if that jungle be once cleared off, the slow and careful work of ages has been undone in a moment. The burning sun bakers up everything; and the soil, having no mineral staple wherewith to support a fresh crop if planted, is reduced to aridity and sterility for years to come. Timber, therefore, I believe, and timber only, is the proper crop for these poor soils, unless medicinal or otherwise useful trees should be discovered hereafter worth the planting. To thin out the useless timbers--but cautiously, for fear of letting in the sun's rays--and to replace them by young plants of useful timbers, is all that Government can do with the poorer bits of these Crown lands, beyond protecting (as it does now {{to the best of}} its power) the <b>natural</b> <b>crop</b> of Timit-leaves from waste and destruction. So much it ought to do; and so much it can and will do in Trinidad, which--happily for it--possesses a Government which governs, instead of leaving every man, as in the Irishman's paradise, to 'do what is right in the sight of his own eyes, and what is wrong too, av he likes.' Without such wise regulation, and even restraint, of the ignorant greediness of human toil, intent only (as in the too exclusive cultivation of the sugar-cane and of the cotton-plant) on present profits, without foresight or care for the future, the lands of warmer climates will surely fall under that curse, so well described by the venerable Elias Fries, of Lund. {257a} ...|$|E

60|$|Before {{entering}} on {{the more}} general question involved in these quotations, we must point to the clauses we have marked with italics, where Dr. Cumming appears to express sentiments which, we are happy to think, are not shared {{by the majority of}} his brethren in the faith. Dr. Cumming, it seems, is unable to conceive that the natural man can have any other motive for being just and upright than that it is useless to be otherwise, or that a character for honesty is profitable; according to his experience, between the feelings of ostentation and selfish alarm and the feeling of love to Christ, there lie no sensibilities which can lead a man to relieve want. Granting, as we should prefer to think, that it is Dr. Cumming’s exposition of his sentiments which is deficient rather than his sentiments themselves, still, the fact that the deficiency lies precisely here, and that he can overlook it not only in the haste of oral delivery but in the examination of proof-sheets, is strongly significant of his mental bias—of the faint degree in which he sympathizes with the disinterested elements of human feeling, and of the fact, which we are about to dwell upon, that those feelings are totally absent from his religious theory. Now, Dr. Cumming invariably assumes that, in fulminating against those who differ from him, he is standing on a moral elevation to which they are compelled reluctantly to look up; that his theory of motives and conduct is in its loftiness and purity a perpetual rebuke to their low and vicious desires and practice. It is time he should be told that the reverse is the fact; that there are men who do not merely cast a superficial glance at his doctrine, and fail to see its beauty or justice, but who, after a close consideration of that doctrine, pronounce it to be subversive of true moral development, and therefore positively noxious. Dr. Cumming is fond of showing up the teaching of Romanism, and accusing it of undermining true morality: it is time he should be told that there is a large body, both of thinkers and practical men, who hold precisely the same opinion of his own teaching—with this difference, that they do not regard it as the inspiration of Satan, but as the <b>natural</b> <b>crop</b> of a human mind where the soil is chiefly made up of egoistic passions and dogmatic beliefs.|$|E

This study aims to investigate the evolution of <b>natural</b> and <b>crop</b> vegetation systems in the Heihe River basin (HRB) over the past 2000  years. Archived Landsat images, historical land use maps and hydrological records were introduced to derive the long-term spatial distribution of <b>natural</b> and <b>crop</b> vegetation and the corresponding biomass levels. The major findings are that (1)  both <b>natural</b> and <b>crop</b> vegetation experienced three development stages: a pre-development stage (before the Republic of China), a rapid development stage (Republic of China – 2000), and a post-development stage (after  2000).

For the second stage, warmer temperature and increasing streamflow {{were found to be}} important factors for the increase in both <b>natural</b> and <b>crop</b> vegetation in the middle reaches of the HRB. For the third stage, positive climate and hydrological conditions, together with policy interventions, supported the overall vegetation increase in both the middle and lower HRB; (2)  there was a significantly faster increase in crop biomass than that of native vegetation since  1949, which could be explained by the technological development; and (3)  the ratio of <b>natural</b> vegetation to <b>crop</b> vegetation decreased from  16 during the Yuan Dynasty to about  2. 2 since  2005.

The new edition of <b>Natural</b> <b>Crop</b> Protection in the Tropics bears little resemblance to its 1986 predecessor which came to occupy a well-deserved place on and off the shelves of farmers and their advisors. This is a sturdy and accessible volume with an exemplary presentation of texts and illustrations. The same basic content has been retained and expanded. Having described the pests which afflict various crops it explains various methods of field protection, ranging from intercropping and protecting seedlings to plants which control insect pests, followed by storage protection steps such as prevention and use of animal substances and vegetable oils. New to this edition are a glossary, Internet references, a detailed reading list and eight well-edited case studies which emphasise how to help farmers move to natural pest control. 'Farmers,' the author writes in her conclusion, 'are no different from anybody else. They also strive for benefit and gain.

40|$|Heritable {{variation}} {{is at the}} heart of the process of evolution. However, {{variation is}} restricted in breeding for uniform crop populations using the pedigree line approach. Pedigree lines are successful in agriculture because synthetic inputs are used to raise fertility and control weeds, pests and diseases. An alternative method promoted for exploring the value of variation and evolutionary fitness in crops is to create composite cross populations. Composite cross populations are formed by assembling seed stocks with diverse evolutionary origins, recombination of these stocks by hybridization, the bulking of F 1 progeny, and subsequent natural election for mass sorting of the progeny in successive <b>natural</b> <b>cropping</b> environments. Composite cross populations can provide dynamic gene pools, which in turn provide a means of conserving germplasm resources: they can also allow selection of heterogeneous crop varieties. The value of composite cross populations in achieving these aims is dependent on the outcome of mass trials by artificial and natural selection acting upon the heterogeneous mixture. There is evidence to suggest that composite cross populations may be an efficient way of providing heterogeneous crops and of selecting superior pure lines for low input systems characterized by unpredictable stress conditions...|$|R
