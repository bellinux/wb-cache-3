5|$|His {{second game}} came on 17 March 2004 at the Boleyn Ground; he {{replaced}} Clayton Ince after 86 minutes with the score 4–2 to West Ham United, after Ince was stretchered {{off with a}} knee injury. The eighteen-year-old held his <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> front of over 30,000 spectators and no goals were scored in the brief period {{he was on the}} pitch. Later in the year he had a loan spell at local non-league side Stafford Rangers.|$|E

They'll then use their judgement to predict the outcome or have their powers of observation tested. Either way, the contestants must strike their buzzer and pick either red or black.|$|E

5|$|On July 17 at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, deGrom {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing only one hit and one walk while striking out seven opposing batters. His game score of 97 was tied for second-best in Mets {{history in a}} nine-inning game. DeGrom's final pitching appearance of the season came on September 1, when he faced the Miami Marlins. He underwent season-ending surgery on his ulnar <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> late September in order to relieve discomfort in his elbow and numbness in his fingers which had plagued him during the 2016 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{is one of}} twelve cranial nerves found in amniotes including reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to the nerve or nerve pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or lapping water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, {{and then to the}} affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of the nerve have been explored through studies of the <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> rodents and reptiles. The nerve is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate nerve over the course of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the vagus <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E

Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions. With the injury to the ulnar <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> his right elbow, Robinson did not throw the ball during the game {{and was forced to}} carry the ball in his right hand.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, Greene was {{the captain}} of the Steelers defense, {{although}} his reduced effectiveness over the previous two seasons due to injuries led to rumors that he was washed up. He was never again able to attain the same success as a pass rusher after his pinched <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> 1975. Spurred by the rumors, he returned in 1978 to lead all Pittsburgh linemen in tackles, and he had four sacks and a career-high five fumble recoveries. The Steelers defense allowed a league-low 195 points during the season, en route to a 35–31 victory over the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII. In that contest, Greene had one of Pittsburgh's five sacks of Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Bickford {{was sold}} to the Baltimore Orioles for an {{undisclosed}} amount of cash and catcher Charlie White. The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox were both interested in Bickford's services, but general manager John Quinn decided to go with Baltimore's offer. He only played one game, a start against the Chicago White Sox on April 24. He gave up five runs, four of them earned, in four innings before being credited with the 14–4 loss. A pinched <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> his throwing arm and eventual elbow surgery shortened his career. In 1955, he unsuccessfully tried a brief comeback with the Triple-A Richmond Virginians in the International League. He pitched in nine games before retiring due to complications of his arm injuries.|$|E

5|$|Morrison {{participated in}} a five-man {{gauntlet}} match for the number one contender's spot for the WWE Championship on April 11 episode of Raw, but was eliminated by R-Truth. The next week on Raw, Morrison challenged R-Truth to a match {{later on in the}} night, with the stipulation that if Morrison won, he would take R-Truth's place in the steel cage match at Extreme Rules. Truth accepted, and lost the match, making Morrison the new number one contender. At Extreme Rules, R-Truth interfered in the match, attacking Morrison and preventing him from winning the match. The next night on Raw, Morrison was attacked by Truth again, prior to a scheduled match between the two which did not happen as a result. Morrison then underwent surgery to correct a legitimately pinched <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> his neck.|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a <b>nerve</b> <b>in</b> his arm that blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E
