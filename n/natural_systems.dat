5|$|Wright, {{an author}} of fiction and non-fiction works, uses the fallen civilisations of Easter Island, Sumer, Rome, and Maya, as well as {{examples}} from the Stone Age, to see what conditions led to the downfall of those societies. He examines the meaning of progress {{and its implications for}} civilizations—past and present—arguing that the twentieth century was a time of runaway growth in human population, consumption, and technology that has now placed an unsustainable burden on all <b>natural</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles {{led to the}} realisation {{that there were more}} natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. Adanson (1763), de Jussieu (1789), and Candolle (1819) all proposed various alternative <b>natural</b> <b>systems</b> of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The Candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later classification by Bentham and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.|$|E

5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the <b>natural</b> <b>systems</b> at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and <b>natural</b> <b>systems</b> that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E

5000|$|Laissez-faire, {{a product}} of the Enlightenment, was [...] "conceived as the way to unleash human {{potential}} through the restoration of a <b>natural</b> <b>system,</b> a system unhindered by the restrictions of government." [...] In a similar vein, Adam Smith viewed the economy as a <b>natural</b> <b>system</b> and the market as an organic part of that system. Smith saw laissez-faire as a moral program, and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of natural law. By extension, free markets become a reflection of the <b>natural</b> <b>system</b> of liberty.

25|$|In geology, {{physical}} geography, {{and sediment}} transport, fluvial processes relate to flowing water in <b>natural</b> <b>systems.</b> This encompasses rivers, streams, periglacial flows, flash floods and glacial lake outburst floods. Sediment moved by {{water can be}} larger than sediment moved by air because water has both a higher density and viscosity. In typical rivers the largest carried sediment is of sand and gravel size, but larger floods can carry cobbles and even boulders.|$|E
25|$|Non-equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} is {{a branch}} of thermodynamics that deals with systems {{that are not in}} thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many <b>natural</b> <b>systems</b> still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.|$|E

We argue against the use of negative selection if space is nite and self comprises {{only a small fraction of}} the avail-able space or if space is innite.

25|$|Computer {{simulation}} is {{a computer}} program, or network of computers, that attempts to simulate an abstract model of a particular system.

25|$|Chaotic {{behavior}} {{exists in}} many <b>natural</b> <b>systems,</b> such as weather and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as road traffic.

Chaos theory has applications in several disciplines, including meteorology, anthropology, sociology, physics, environmental science, computer science, engineering, economics, biology, ecology, and philosophy.
