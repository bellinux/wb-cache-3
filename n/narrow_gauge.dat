5|$|A <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> goods railway was {{constructed}} for the transportation of bricks {{to some of}} the major building sites in central Canberra. This linked the brickworks to places such as Parliament House, and the Kingston Power House.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, local {{politicians}} {{proposed that the}} line be built administratively {{as part of the}} Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 1880 the Carson and Colorado Railway was formed, {{with the}} intent of {{extending}} a rail line from the existing Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Hawthorne, Nevada through the Owens Valley towards the Colorado River. Though the rail line was never finished, it did bring economic development to the valley. The railroad was never completed past Keeler on the shores of Owens Lake. This line was acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900. There were plans to connect this <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> line with SP's standard gauge lines in the area, however these plans never materialized and the <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> line was scrapped in 1959.|$|E
50|$|A {{transporter}} wagon, in railway terminology, is a wagon (UIC) or railroad car (US) {{designed to}} carry other railway equipment. Normally, {{it is used}} to transport equipment of a different rail gauge. In most cases, a transporter wagon is a <b>narrower</b> <b>gauge</b> wagon for transporting a wider gauge equipment, allowing freight in a wider gauge wagons to reach destinations on the <b>narrower</b> <b>gauge</b> network without the expense and time of transshipment into a <b>narrower</b> <b>gauge</b> wagons.|$|R
50|$|This is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} one of the primary problems with differing gauge systems - gauge incompatibility. However, it means that the <b>narrower</b> <b>gauge</b> network must be built to a structure gauge large enough to accommodate the loading gauge of the wider gauge equipment, negating one of the cost advantages of a <b>narrower</b> <b>gauge</b> construction. Additionally, a large wider gauge wagon balanced on a <b>narrower</b> <b>gauge</b> transporter wagon is not very stable, and is generally restricted to low speeds of 15 mph or so.|$|R

5|$|Standard gauge {{operations}} {{began in}} 1894 with five locomotives, and the <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> equipment was kept temporarily for commuter runs to Blue Ash. Later acquisitions, {{as well as}} consolidations with other companies, raised the number to 23 in 1920, its final year of independent operation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main Victorian rail network of the Victorian Railways and successors, a number of <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> private railways and tramways have also existed for logging and mining purposes. These included the Yallourn 900mm Railway in the Latrobe Valley open cut coal mines, the Fyansford Cement Works Railway near Geelong, the Tyers Valley Tramway at Mount Baw Baw, and the Powelltown Tramway from Yarra Junction.|$|E
5|$|The Talyllyn Railway {{remains a}} {{successful}} and popular tourist attraction. The original 1860s locomotives and passenger stock still run regularly alongside {{the roster of}} more modern rolling stock. The railway is promoted as one of The Great Little Trains of Wales, a joint marketing scheme launched in 1970 that encompasses ten <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> railways in the country, mostly found in north and mid Wales.|$|E

5|$|The {{coaching}} stock was extremely solidly constructed, and offered levels of accommodation {{far in advance}} of anything else at the time - certainly compared to any other <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> railway. Almost 70 years later, the design {{was used as the}} basis for a new rake of carriages built by the Ffestiniog - testament to the excellence of the original design.|$|E
5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains structurally intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction hoarding. There is a small roundabout directly outside the south tunnel portal. Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four of the cars were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire <b>Narrow</b> <b>Gauge</b> Railway Society. Most of the rails and sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gordon {{became an}} editor and {{reporter}} for the Stockton <b>Narrow</b> <b>Gauge.</b> In 1874, she bought the Stockton Weekly Leader and converted into a daily newspaper, becoming the first female publisher of a paper in the United States. Between 1876 and 1878, she published the Oakland Daily Democrat. During that period, she {{also served as a}} correspondent for the Sacramento Bee and other papers, with a press desk {{on the floor of the}} state Assembly.

In June 2013 the railway was awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service. 2015 was the 150th anniversary of the official opening of the railway, and this was celebrated with a series of events throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|In Pennsylvania, the Peach Bottom Railway was {{incorporated}} in 1871. The railway's Middle Division laid <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> track between York and Red Lion by August 1874 and completed its line southward to Delta in 1876. It went bankrupt in 1881 and was reorganized as the York and Peach Bottom Railway (Y) in 1882. The Y {{merged with the}} Maryland Central Railway (successor to the Maryland Central RR) in 1891, becoming the Baltimore and Lehigh, and the new company operated trains on the combined track between York and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Iron ore {{quarrying}} {{was a major}} {{industry in}} and around Wellingborough from the 1860s until the 1960s. James Rixon and Wiliam Ashwell opened a major ironworks {{on the north side}} of the town in 1870, supplied by the extensive ironstone quarries around Finedon to the east of the town. Three <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> tramways served the iron ore industry, the Wellingborough Tramway, Neilson's Tramway and the Finedonhill Tramway. The Wellingborough Tramway served Rixon's ironworks until 1966.|$|E

5|$|Planning of {{a railway}} to connect Trøndelag and Jämtland, Sweden, started in 1869, {{with one of}} the {{proposals}} being to build a line from Trondheim via Verdal to Sweden. However, surveys along the Verdal alternative deemed it unsuitable, and instead the line was built via Stjørdalen and Meråker. To conform with Swedish standards, the line was built with standard gauge instead of the more common <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge.</b> The Meråker Line opened on 22 July 1882.|$|E
5|$|Since preservation, {{the railway}} has {{operated}} {{as a tourist}} attraction, expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary, and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place, including a much-expanded facility for the <b>Narrow</b> <b>Gauge</b> Railway Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{line has}} been {{suggested}} preserved as a cultural heritage, since it represents one of very few railways with the original <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> profile intact. However, all stations have been demolished; Flekkefjord in 1970, Sirnes in 1977 and Flikkeid in 1988. The organization Friends of the Flekkefjord Line offer rental of draisines for tourists since {{the closure of the}} line, and a round trip from Flekkefjord to Bakkekleivi just outside Sira takes about three hours. However, the Norwegian National Rail Administration have since banned the operation of draisines until the line is fully fenced in.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} {{presented}} {{as part of the}} original proposal of the Bergen Line when approved by Parliament in 1894, but due to the <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> on the Drammen Line at the time, a temporary solution via Roa was chosen instead. Later proposals have been launched, and parliament has voted over it in 1954, 1978, 1984 and 1992; only the last being passed, but not followed up by funding, and the Norwegian National Rail Administration has not allocated any date to start construction; detailed plans have however been produced.|$|E
5|$|Tyler did {{not approve}} the opening until his listed {{improvements}} were completed, although slate trains and unofficial passenger trains were running in 1865. During November of that 1866, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved its formal opening for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866, and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> public railway in Britain opened for service.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 18th century, slate was {{extracted}} on a {{small scale}} by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on a larger scale. After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of <b>narrow</b> <b>gauge</b> railways to transport the slates to the ports.|$|E
5000|$|On {{decreasing}} routes, the [...] and [...] and [...] <b>narrow</b> <b>gauges</b> are present.
