5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I <b>never</b> <b>think</b> that, never...|$|E

25|$|The {{composition}} pedagogy {{of moderate}} expressivism {{is characterized by}} a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for less grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during {{the early stages of the}} writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should <b>never</b> <b>think</b> about their audience. It’s a question of when.” Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.|$|E
500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} I will ever be. If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would <b>never</b> <b>think</b> of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello {{during the first week}} of September. Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Democratic-Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas that: [...] "From [...] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [...] judgment but because as we should <b>never</b> <b>think</b> of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves." [...] Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role [...] "in softening Jefferson's more extreme views." ...|$|E

500|$|Jones commended Virgil's {{portrayal}} as an everyman teenager, while Ashby appreciated Virgil's [...] "relatable" [...] character. Colby Lanham of Comic Book Resources said Virgil [...] "was {{perhaps the}} most human of many superheroes on television at the time" [...] and considered the series was canceled too soon. Ashby was also positive {{to the fact that}} Virgil usually counted on dialogues before going into action; this action was also praised by John Sinnott of DVD Talk, who said it is [...] "something that most animated heroes <b>never</b> <b>think</b> to do." [...] Ashby also applauded Virgil's [...] "surprising depth of character" [...] to not follow a gang but to use his powers for good. In addition to describing it as [...] "a surprising and sometimes rewarding success", Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club considered it to be [...] "the most kid-oriented of all the [...] franchise's shows." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Eleanor {{encountered}} her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to Tivoli, New York. The two began a secret correspondence and romance, and became engaged on November 22, 1903. Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, opposed the union, and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year. [...] "I know what pain I must have caused you," [...] he wrote his mother of his decision. But, he added, [...] "I know my own mind, and known {{it for a long}} time, and know that I could <b>never</b> <b>think</b> otherwise." [...] Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904, hoping that a separation would squelch the romance, but Franklin remained determined. The wedding date was set to accommodate President Theodore Roosevelt, who was scheduled to be in New York City for the St. Patrick's Day parade, and who agreed to give the bride away.|$|E
500|$|In Ved Vejen, Bang has masterfully {{developed}} his impressionistic style. While recognizing that impressionism was {{first and foremost}} a trend in painting, he explained in a letter sent to Peter Nansen from Prague {{that he was trying to}} achieve the same style in literature: [...] "Impressionistic is indeed the word. I am frantically striving to make every single impression clear and precise and distinctive, and so I <b>never</b> <b>think</b> about the whole" [...] Jean-Claude Polet adds that while he owes much to Zola, Daudet and Maupassant, he channels naturalism into a quite unexpected direction, that of impressionism. His characters are revealed through their responses or a slight turn of phrase along the lines of the Norwegian Jonas Lie or the Russian Turgenev. He does not explain, he merely presents a picture, providing the reader with impressions, allowing him to read between the lines, interpreting what lies behind the words. On meeting Claude Monet, he was told, [...] "You are the first impressionist writer." [...] A recognized example of his mastery of impressionism is the novel's opening scene where all the characters meet at the station.|$|E

500|$|The package {{illustration}} for Fate of Atlantis {{was inspired}} by the Indiana Jones movie posters of Drew Struzan. It was drawn by Eaken within three days, following disagreements with the marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use. Clint Bajakian, Peter McConnell and Michael Land created the soundtrack for the game, arranging John Williams' main theme [...] "The Raiders March" [...] for a variety of compositions. The DOS version uses sequenced music played back by either an internal speaker, the FM synthesis of an AdLib or Sound Blaster sound card, or the sample-based synthesis of a Roland MT-32 sound module. During development of the game, William Messner-Loebs and Dan Barry wrote a Dark Horse Comics series based on Barwood's and Falstein's story, then titled Indiana Jones and the Keys to Atlantis. In an interview, Eaken mentioned hour-long meetings of the development team {{trying to come up with}} a better title than Fate of Atlantis, though the staff members could <b>never</b> <b>think</b> of one and always ended up with names such as [...] "Indiana Jones Does Atlantis". The final title was Barwood's idea, who first had to convince the company's management and the marketing team not to simply call the game [...] "Indy's Next Adventure".|$|E
500|$|Production Designer Allan Cameron found a {{dormant volcano}} near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the {{location}} because, [...] "A city {{hidden in the}} crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out {{in the middle of}} the desert you would never see it. You would <b>never</b> <b>think</b> of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano." [...] A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was [...] in length and featured [...] "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing for the New Statesman and Nation, Raymond Mortimer {{wrote that}} the panels [...] "seems served from Picasso's Crucifixion , but further distorted, with ostrich necks and button heads {{protruding}} from bags—the whole effect gloomily phallic, like Bosch without the humour. These objects are perched on stools, and depicted {{as if they were}} sculpture, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I <b>never</b> <b>think</b> about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror. But that is the horror {{in the sense that it}} is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies? People came out as though purged into happiness, into a fuller reality of existence." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Work" [...] {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. In a Billboard publication, Robert Christgau called the song [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "something [...] {{wants us to}} remember", and commented: [...] "You want authentic? Iggy Azalea has all the lineaments of a risk-taking young rebel without a well-off family to back her up." [...] Christgau went on to praise the track's hooks, and explained: [...] "The hooks, of course, are one reason hard die-hards put her down—in the truimpant Dirty South manner, her hip-hop is radio-friendly {{as a matter of}} principle. The cumulative weight of the long-player they <b>never</b> <b>think</b> about." [...] Monica Herrera of Rolling Stone called the song [...] "a bombshell-next-door move that demands attention". Matt Orkine of Triple J listed it as the year's ninth best single, and viewed it as a [...] "straight-up banger" [...] and his [...] "guiltiest music pleasure of 2013". Kellan Miller of XXL deemed it [...] "the song that made the world fall in love with Iggy all over again". Justin Monroe of Complex called it the album's [...] "infectious and decidedly less weird first single", and complimented its ability to provide listeners with a sense of Azalea's background. While Sam Weiss of the same publication described the song [...] "as wild and eccentric as anything she's done so far".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1982/83, England's winning Ashes team {{travelled}} to Australia under Willis' captaincy. Willis took two three-wicket hauls in two warm-up first-class matches; however, he was absent from two others and Botham took over the captaincy. By now, continuing injury problems were beginning to plague the ageing bowler's body. He took 3/95 in the first Test as Australia reached 424 in reply to England's first innings 411, of which Willis had made 26. Derek Randall's century in England's second innings took them to 358, and Australia reached 73 {{at the close of}} play on the final day for the loss of two wickets, both of which were taken by Willis, leaving the match drawn. Willis picked up 5/66 in the second Test; however, Australia easily reached a low fourth innings target to go 1–0 up. The third Test followed a similar pattern, with England replying with two low scores in the face of Australia's first innings 438, and Australia taking an eight-wicket win to take a 2–0 lead in the series, despite Willis' three wickets. England achieved what was then the narrowest Ashes victory margin of three runs in the fourth Test at Melbourne, with Willis taking three wickets. Wills commentated on the game that [...] "You never give up and you <b>never</b> <b>think</b> it has gone." [...] The fifth match ended in a draw, so Australia won the series 2–1. Across the entire tour, Willis took 28 first-class wickets. In the following World Series Cup between England, Australia and New Zealand, England were knocked out despite 14 wickets for Willis at 21.14.|$|E
