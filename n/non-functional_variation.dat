40|$|Both {{functional}} and <b>non-functional</b> <b>variation</b> exist {{on a large}} scale. A typically non-functional phenomenon is subject/verb concord,where plural markers are used more often precisely in thoseenvironments {{in which they are}} unnecessary from the point ofview of communicating meaning, such as when the subject andverb are adjacent. On the other hand, the use of realized versuszero subject pronouns is fully functional: such pronouns tend tobe used more frequently in environments in which their absencewould lead to ambiguity in interpretation on the discourse level. <b>Non-functional</b> <b>variation</b> is a characteristic of phenomena that arein an advanced stage of diachronic evolution, near the end of thefunctional cycle. Functional variation can be found near thebeginning of the cycle. In this regard, variable agreement has beenoccurring for several centuries, while the marked increase infrequency of use of subject pronouns is very recent...|$|E
40|$|Cancer is {{characterized}} by the accumulation of large numbers of genetic variations and alterations of multiple biological phenomena. Cancer genomics has largely focused on the identification of such genetic alterations and the genes containing them, known as 'cancer genes'. However, the <b>non-functional</b> somatic <b>variations</b> out-number functional variations and remain as a major challenge. Recurrent somatic variations are thought to be cancer drivers but they are present in {{only a small fraction of}} patients...|$|R
40|$|Given a {{long string}} of {{characters}} from a constant size (w. l. o. g. binary) alphabet we present an algorithm to determine whether its characters have been generated by a single i. i. d. random source. More specifically, consider all possible k-coin models for generating a binary string S, where each bit of S is generated via an independent toss of one of the k coins in the model. The choice of which coin to toss is decided by a random walk on the set of coins where the probability of a coin change is much lower than the probability of using the same coin repeatedly. We present a statistical test procedure which, for any given S, determines whether the a posteriori probability for k = 1 is higher than for any other k > 1. Our algorithm runs in time O(l(4) log l), where e is the length of S, through a dynamic programming approach which exploits the convexity of the a posteriori probability for k. The problem we consider arises from two critical applications in analyzing long alignments between pairs of genomic sequences. A high alignment score between two DNA sequences usually indicates an evolutionary relationship, i. e. that the sequences have been generated as a result of one or more copy events followed by random point mutations. Such sequences may include functional regions (e. g. exons) as well as nonfunctional ones (e. g. introns). Functional regions with critical importance exhibit much lower mutation rates than non-functional DNA (or DNA with non-critical functionality) due to selective pressures for conserving such regions. As a result, given an alignment between two highly similar genome sequences, {{it may be possible to}} distinguish functional regions from <b>non-functional</b> ones using <b>variations</b> in the mutation rate. Our test provides means for determining variations in the mutation rate and thus checking the existence of DNA regions of varying degrees of functionality. A second application for our test is in determining whether two highly similar, thus evolutionarily related, genome segments are the result of a single copy event or of a complex series of copies. This is particularly an issue in evolutionary studies of genome regions rich with repeat segments (especially non-functional tandemly repeated DNA). Our approach can be used to distinguish simple copies from complex repeats again by exploiting variations in mutation rates...|$|R
