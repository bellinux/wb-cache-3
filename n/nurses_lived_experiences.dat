40|$|Background: A {{nurse who}} is working {{in the health care}} is {{expected}} to show the best side for other people. An emotional work demands a lot of the role of a nurse, when she has to deal with her feelings after the given situation to satisfy the patient. Aim: The purpose of the study is to seek understanding of what nurses perceive to be the essence of the emotional work in health care. The study also wants to understand what factors could affect the meeting both positively and negatively between nurse and patient in social interaction Method: The study’s methodology is qualitative with phenomenological-hermeneutical approach to seek understanding of the six interviewed <b>nurses</b> <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> and the experiences of the emotional work. Results: The result has four main themes developed: Emotional management, to consider the patients existential needs, meeting the patient and to do something meaningful. Conclusion: The essence of the perceived emotional work for nurses is emotional transformation where the nurse changes her feelings by acting according to the situation in the meeting with the patient. It is important that nurses reflect in the work so they do not take their work home and become exhausted and burn out.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a year-long study seeking to explore Learning Disability (LD) nurses lived {{experience}} of promoting autonomy for adults with profound and multiple learning disabilities (PMLD) who live in England. Promoting autonomy constitutes {{a key component of}} LD nurses’ role within the current service provision for this client group. The question of how much autonomy is allowable while ensuring the safety of this client group remains an ethical problem and one for which no ultimate solution exist. Exploring LD <b>nurses</b> <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> produces a special kind of ‘practical’ knowledge that is beyond the dominance of medical knowledge and well-grounded in their day to day experiences. Findings will therefore be more meaningful to LD nurses regarding promoting autonomy for adults with PMLD as their experiences are explicated and illuminated. Consequently, potential exists for findings of this study to contribute to LD nursing discipline’s knowledge base and evidence-based-practice. A Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenological framework of inquiry was used to guide the inquiry. Data were gathered from LD nurses using individual face-to-face unstructured interviews. Broad open ended questions were used to obtain participants’ concrete descriptions of their experiences in relation to promoting autonomy for adults with PMLD. Nine LD nurses from the north of England were interviewed and interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim to create textual basis for data analysis. Data were analysed following a discursive and iterative seven step procedure as described by Diekelmann, Allen, and Tanner (1989). Analysis of participants’ interviews revealed three themes: (1) taking responsibility, (2) care delivery and (3) personhood. The findings illustrate how participants take pride in their role as learning disability nurses and the value they place on collaborative team working as well as the importance of knowing the person as an individual with own personality, behaviours and character in promoting autonomy for adults with PMLD. The results are relevant to LD nursing practice and also to cares and other health and social care professionals who work with adults needing support in most aspects of their lives such as those with progressed dementia and brain injury...|$|E

Though this has been widely accepted {{there have been no}} studies, looking at student <b>nurses</b> <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> in this area of care. With the increasing advancements in technology and nurses autonomy, day case TOPs are set to increase. With student regularly placed on day surgery units {{there is a need to}} explore how this will affect student nurses while on placement. Aim - To investigate student nurses’ <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> of caring for women undergoing a termination of pregnancy. Methodology and methods - A qualitative hermeneutic phenomenology research approach was used. Obtaining the data through phenomenological semi- structured interviews of four student nurses retrospective accounts of TOP care. They were then analysis using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Findings - During student <b>nurses</b> <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of TOP care they suffered an emotional burden. Within this emotional burden, various stressors made them elicit closed-off, withdrawn or emotionally attached coping response. These stressors include; the 'Termination of life', 'Apprehension of the unknown', 'Challenging patients' and the 'Care environment'. There were certain mediators of these stressors this included support. There were some predicaments of accessing this support while on placement. Conclusion - TOP care affected the emotional attributes of the student nurses. The stressors they experienced on placement caused them to elicit negative coping responses. These findings provide a different perspective to the existing literature. Abstract 2 Recommendations - Following the Lazarus Transactional Model of Stress and Coping recommendations on extra mentorship and information throughout the students placement were made at different organisational levels...|$|R

40|$|Person-centred is now {{a widely}} used term to {{describe}} much dementia care in the UK and Jersey. This existential hermeneutic phenomenological research seeks to discover the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of person-centred dementia care for nurses in Jersey and through this, the essences and meanings of person-centred care. It is grounded in Merleau-Ponty’s ideas of embodiment for {{being in the world}} and Buber’s primacy of relationships and includes complimentary ideas within Lévinas, Gendlin and Vanier’s philosophies. Its methodology is inspired predominantly by van Manen, it is hermeneutic in its interpretive and poetic stance and is existential in its focus on <b>nurse’s</b> <b>lived</b> <b>experiences.</b> Eight <b>nurses,</b> working in care homes and specialist dementia care units, took part in semi-structured interviews which were recorded and transcribed. Deep immersion into these texts followed using the six existentials of corporeality, relationality, temporality, spatiality, materiality and mood, proposed by van Manen and Todres, as lenses to get closer to the participants’ <b>lived</b> <b>experiences,</b> essences and meaning of person-centred dementia care. This research has been amongst the first to use six existentials for data analysis; it demonstrates the accessibility of this methodology for counsellors from its parallels with therapy; it demonstrates the potential of poetry and metaphor images to uncover the essences and meanings of phenomena; and its enhanced focus on the experience of person-centred care reveals considerable rhetoric {{in the use of the}} term in mission statements and care philosophies. This research shows that the term, and the models and frameworks associated with it, are not well understood, indicating the need to embrace a new understanding of person-centred care from the macro context to individual practitioners; the need for more effective training, education and practice development together with new support structures for nurses and better communication throughout the services. It also proposes a new vision focussed more on ‘caring’ than ‘care’ and for a uniting Jersey Dementia Strategy to help refine and define systems, policy, practice and care...|$|R

40|$|Aims The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effects of a pilot {{clinical}} community mental health placement on general <b>nursing</b> students' <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> throughout that placement. Method A qualitative thematic analysis was undertaken on general nursing students' reflective journals during their clinical mental health course. A two-stage process involving independent analysis and a dependent analysis of the journals was carried out to identify themes. Results Four themes were identified: preconceived notions; learning outcomes/experiences; atmosphere of the workplace; and holistic client-centered care. Conclusions The students in this community clinical rotation gained more compassion and understanding towards those with mental illness and positively transformed negative opinions. They encountered a warmer and more welcoming atmosphere than they had previously experienced in other clinical settings, acquired an appreciation for holistic and client-centered approaches to nursing care and achieved positive learning outcomes and experiences. Factors that may have contributed to positive learning outcomes included the process of reflective journaling and the supportive learning environment for students. Existing knowledge about pedagogical approaches to nursing education in clinical mental health was supported and extended, and recommendations made for avenues of future inquiry.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Intensive care nurses’ {{experiences}} {{of death in}} the ICU and the implications for a postgraduate nursing pedagogy: A Heideggerian phenomenological study. The study sought to understand the phenomenon of the {{experiences of}} ICU nurses dealing with the deaths of patients under their care who die in the ICU. Hedeggerian hermeneutic phenomenology was used as the philosophical underpinning of the study. Methodologically, van Manen’s (1990) six research stages in searching for the essence of a <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> offered opportunities to inquire further about pedagogical issues. Information gathering was in the form of phenomenological conversations with a sample of ICU <b>nurses</b> and <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> themes emerged during the unravelling of the ICU nurses’ narratives. Using Heidegger’s concept of the three modes of being: authenticity, inauthenticity and undifferentiatedness, five <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> themes were recognised: 1. Care- authenticity; 2. Suffering, Disenfranchisement and Cultural/religious unpreparedness-inauthenticity; 3. Living with dying-undifferentiatedness Based on an analysis of the phenomenological conversations, motivation is made for the inclusion of death education into the current Postgraduate Critical Care Nursing curriculum to meet the need for improving, not only the professional nursing care for patients dying in the ICU, but also facilitating and supporting the self-care of the ICU student him/herself. Barnett and Coate’s (2005) concept of the ‘Engaged Curriculum in Higher Education’, utilising the schema of knowing, acting and being, was used as the educational framework within which to identify pedagogical offerings for introducing death education. Such pedagogical offerings would include the teaching and learning of the theories of death and dying; aspects of the dying process; cultural/spiritual/religious issues such as post-mortem care and bereavement self-care. The study contributes new knowledge about ICU nurses’ <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> of the deaths of patients under their care in the ICU resulting in the recognition of the need for the inclusion of death education into a Postgraduate Critical Care Nursing curriculu...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 7559 Societal and {{scientific}} changes are shaping {{expectations of the}} future direction of healthcare delivery. These changes impinge on nursing, forcing it to study itself, to identify {{its place in the}} present and future healthcare arena. The {{purpose of this study was}} to contribute to the study of nursing by exploring, from their own perspectives, the experiences of top-level nurses holding the formal position of director of nursing. As little research exists to explain or give an understanding of those experiences and the effects of those experiences on top-level nurses, a grounded theory study of this area of nursing was applicable. It was the contention of this study that top-level nursing cannot be studied in isolation from the context in which it functions. Therefore the aim of the study was to examine the experiences of top-level nurses in the context of nursing and the healthcare system, with the objective of discovering and understanding top-level <b>nursing</b> through the <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> of directors of nursing...|$|R
40|$|The {{experience}} of primary professional socialization {{is crucial for}} neophytes to learn to become a nurse. These early nursing encounters may also have long-term effects on professional development of individual nurses. However, research into the early experiences of nurses has been poorly documented. This study endeavours to reveal the early <b>lived</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>experience</b> amongst a group of nurses in Hong Kong. This study adopts a phenomenological approach which involves the thematic analysis of the critical incidents provided by 77 subjects. Findings revealed that incidents associated with death and dying, and clinical learning embracing interpersonal relations and professional development, were the most memorable events. Nurses were in general not equipped adequately {{to communicate with the}} dying and the grieving relatives. The subjects disclosed that positive clinical encounters confirmed their value of nursing work and motivated them to stay in the profession. Conversely, the negative experiences made them seriously consider leaving nursing. A number of implications for nursing education have been drawn from the research findings. School of Nursin...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explored}} the question “In what ways are nurses’ sense making and meaning making affected by culture and context on a medical mission in Kakamega, Kenya?” A qualitative inquiry {{took place during}} a nurse-led medical mission in Kakamega, Kenya. Eight nurses’ journals, including the researcher, were examined for themes around the cultural and contextual factors upon which nurses reflected. A subsequent focus group was conducted with 5 of these nurses following the mission to confirm and clarify the data and explore any new themes identified. Findings demonstrated that as <b>nurses</b> compared their <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> in Canada to the conditions they were encountering in Kenya, they became increasingly aware of gaps in their understandings. As they attempted to bridge the gaps of their inexperience, coping emerged as a significant theme by which nurses dealt with these unique cultural and contextual circumstances. The results imply {{the need for a}} stringent recruitment and interview process when considering participants for a mission and the necessity of comprehensive premission education for nurses. Primarily, it is essential to provide emotional support for nurses during and following the mission. It can be inferred from the implications of this study how organizations must be diligent in preparing nurses for all aspects of the mission including the significance of a unified team process...|$|R

40|$|Service users {{expect to}} be cared for by a nurse who is both {{competent}} and professional, a particularly pertinent point following the Francis and Keogh reports (DH 2013 a, DH 2013 b). Nursing students’ experience of education in practice strongly shapes their behaviour and knowledge but the ways in which this influences development of their professionalism is not yet fully understood. This study explored <b>nursing</b> students’ <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of role modelling aiming to understand the impact on their development as professional practitioners. In June 2013 twelve student nurses (4 first years, 4 second years, 4 third years) participated in in-depth interviews which were non-structured to allow exploration of the phenomenon that were most important to the participant. Using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis, the information gathered from participants underwent several stages of thematic analysis. The influence of peers and service users on students’ professional development expands upon previously reported research. This is directly related to how students perceive their role model status and although not generalizable participants in this study found that reflecting on experiences with peers and observing the reaction by service users to care delivery had a positive influence on their professional development. Other principal findings include the importance to students of feeling valued as part of the team within their clinical placements and the potentially deleterious impact on students working with nurses who are displaying signs of burnout. Consequent to these findings, it would appear important for student nurse education to include acknowledgement of how clinical nurse observed behaviour may influence student development, facilitation of peer-to-peer interaction as appropriate to the clinical situation and the potential impact of fostering a ‘personal yet professional’ relationship with the student. A number of other issues are also identified. Given the potential influence of peers in enhancing students’ education, one way of optimising the effect of this novel finding could be to include a formal peer to peer mentoring system across all three years of a pre-registration programme. The findings indicate a limited awareness of the potential influence of academic staff as professional role models. This is a possible area for development. Students should also be guided to work with a number of staff in order to ensure exposure to a variety of practice behaviours...|$|R

40|$|Background <b>Lived</b> <b>experience</b> {{of mental}} health {{conditions}} is becoming valued within mainstream mental health service delivery. This {{is reflected in the}} rising employment of Peer Support Workers (PSWs) to support and enhance clients’ recovery. However, the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> {{of mental health}} professionals has been spuriously overlooked in the literature. To date, no studies have explored the influence of <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> on professionals’ roles, identity, work relationships, or its potential clinical utility to enhance clients’ recovery. Methodology This study uses Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to explore the views and reflections of mental health professionals with their own <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of mental health challenges. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted on NHS premises. Data was transcribed and subject to in-depth interpretative analysis by the researcher. Results Five superordinate themes emerged from the data: “Lived Experience Informs Practice” reveals how having a greater understanding, empathy, and limited self-disclosure enriches the therapeutic relationship; “Stigma” shows that all participants have experienced stigma from others, and some, self-stigma. Half of the participants spoke about the “them and us” between professionals and clients, and one participant, between professionals and PSWs; “Towards a Culture of Openness” captures participants’ concerns around social acceptability of their <b>lived</b> <b>experience,</b> and their hopes for greater openness and less shame, akin to that in recovery settings; “Changed Identity” highlights the impact of <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> on professionals’ roles and vice versa; and finally, “Experiencing the Organisation as Unsupportive” reveals that participants feel under pressure to prove wellness, that staff wellbeing is not prioritised, and there exists an ironic lack of understanding and support.
