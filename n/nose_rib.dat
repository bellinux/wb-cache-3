5000|$|The PA-24-400 Comanche 400, while {{identical}} in planform to other single-engined Comanches, is structurally strengthened, {{primarily in the}} tail. The aircraft has an extra <b>nose</b> <b>rib</b> in the stabilator and in the vertical fin. The stabilator, vertical fin, and rudder of the 400 share virtually no common parts with the 180, 250, or [...] Comanches. In addition, the 400's rudder is aerodynamically balanced {{in a manner similar}} to that of the Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche and does not have the lead external balance weights of the lower-powered single-engined Comanches.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is predominantly}} made from wood {{and covered in}} doped Ceconite. The wing leading edge is made from poplar plywood and supported by <b>nose</b> <b>ribs</b> made from marine-grade plywood. The wing spar cap strips and tail ribs are fashioned from spruce. The tailboom is an aluminium tube. Its wing is cantilevered and tapered from wing root to wing tip. The VJ-23 lands and takes off on foot, but the aircraft is equipped with small wheels {{to allow it to}} be pulled up a hill. The aircraft's rigid wing structure requires that it be transported in a trailer, rather than rolled up and carried on a roof rack like a hang glider.|$|R
50|$|The Banjo {{sailplane}} is {{of mixed}} construction. Its 13.3 m span wing is strut-braced with one lift strut per side {{and uses a}} plywood box spar and spruce wing ribs, with {{the leading edge of}} the wing covered in plywood and the rear portion covered in aircraft fabric covering. The <b>nose</b> <b>ribs</b> are expanded polystyrene while the ailerons are made of wood and covered in fabric. The wing airfoil is an SM701 at the wing root transitioning to a Wortmann FX-60-126 at the wing tip, while the tailplane uses a Wortmann FX-71-L-150/30 airfoil. The fuselage is of fibreglass monocoque construction, while its one-piece bubble canopy is made from polycarbonate. The aircraft has fixed monowheel landing gear with a wheel brake and upper wing surface air brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Poison began {{recording}} {{its sixth}} album, Crack a Smile, in early 1994. Recording {{was brought to}} an abrupt halt in May 1994, when Michaels was involved in a car accident where he lost control of his Ferrari. Michaels suffered a broken <b>nose,</b> <b>ribs,</b> jaw, and fingers and lost four teeth. After his recovery in 1995, the band continued recording the album. The album became shelved shortly after this, with no release date anywhere in sight. Instead, the label opted for a Greatest Hits compilation, which featured two new tracks with Saraceno on guitar, [...] "Sexual Thing" [...] and [...] "Lay Your Body Down". The first Greatest Hits album was released on November 26, 1996 and sold extremely well going on to reach double platinum status.|$|R

On {{the way to}} a foreign country they were all starved, including Dmitry's grandfather, who was 9 years old. Dmitry often quotes his grandfather in his television programs and attributes to him funny quotes when he jokes. Dmitry engaged in Sambo and sport gymnastics in school. He received the title of Junior Champion of the USSR Championships in the 1980s. After graduating from the Electrotechnical Institute Im. Ulyanov in 1989, he served in the army (air defense forces). He returned from the army with a broken <b>nose,</b> <b>ribs</b> and a problem with a nerve. As a result, the upper right side of his face was paralyzed - an accident which has given Nagiyev squint of an eye. He uses it in comedic scenes.|$|R

Castro and Figueroa lived with both sets of parents, but moved into their own home at 2207 Seymour Avenue in 1992. Their home was a two-story, 1400 ft2 m2, four-bedroom, one-bathroom house with a 760 ft2 m2 {{unfinished}} basement built in 1890 and remodeled in 1956. According to Figueroa's sister, Elida Caraballo, when Figueroa and Castro moved into their new home, [...] "all hell started breaking loose".

50|$|The JDM-8 wing is {{constructed}} with an aluminum D-cell leading edge incorporating a 9 in high C-channel main spar made from 6061-T6 grade aluminum. The rear spar {{is a similar}} C-channel that is 5 in high {{and there is a}} third nose spar that is 3 in in height. The wing aft of the D-cell is covered in aircraft fabric and has a modified NACA 4415 airfoil with a drooped trailing edge. The 11 <b>nose</b> <b>ribs</b> and nine aft wing ribs are made from hydroformed aluminum. The ailerons were adapted from the Murphy Rebel design and are 69 in long with a 15 in chord. The ultralight version has a 4 ft greater wingspan to lower its stall speed to below the US ultralight category limit of 28 mph. With the wings folded the homebuilt version is 8.75 ft high and the ultralight version with its longer wings is 10.9 ft high.|$|R
5000|$|The Bagshot {{was built}} to Air Ministry Specification F.4/24 in December 1924. This called for a large twin-engined fighter {{aircraft}} with a crew of three (pilot and two gunners), a maximum speed of 125 mph and a landing speed of 50 mph. [...] Initially {{the details of the}} required armament were not specified. Frank Barnwell's design to meet this requirement, the Bagshot, was a high-wing all-metal monoplane with an unusual triangular-section fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage with two upper longerons and a single lower member. The pilot sat in line with the wing's leading edge, with one gun position in the nose and another just behind the wing. The two-spar wing had a steel primary structure and duralumin <b>nose</b> <b>ribs</b> and end-members, and was a semi-cantilever, being braced by a pair of diagonal struts on each side. The legs of the fixed undercarriage met the wing at the same place as the struts and had an axle fairing of airfoil section, contributing some lift. Power was provided by two wing-mounted [...] Bristol Jupiter VI engines.|$|R

5000|$|Ferengi {{also have}} lobed foreheads, large, ridged <b>noses,</b> {{ascending}} <b>ribs,</b> {{upper and lower}} lungs, and a four-lobed brain that cannot be read by the telepathic powers of Betazoids or Vulcans, although half-Betazoid Deanna Troi, herself incapable of telepathic contact with non-Betazoids, could empathically sense their emotions, as seen in The Price and other episodes. Data once mentioned Ferengi being [...] "stronger than they appear"; however, in later episodes they are usually shown as being significantly weaker than the average human (or at least as having a disdain for physical combat that gives that illusion). As shown in [...] "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places" [...] Ferengi have a great disdain for fair combat which causes them to appear physically weaker than they are (they give up if they have no clear advantage). When mentally controlled by Worf, Quark's body was naturally as powerful {{as that of a}} Klingon, enabling him to easily subdue multiple enemy combatants (due in part to Worf's skill), yet when Quark controlled his own body he appeared too weak to beat even a single enemy. Ferengi teeth resemble jagged spikes, and they use a hand-held [...] "tooth sharpener" [...] to maintain them. Generally, whenever Ferengi (at least males) are assaulted, injured, or in some kind of general distress, they emit a shrill scream. Ferengi physiology is also such that they seem to have an immunity to certain drugs, especially drugs like the truth serum used on Quark in the DS9 episode [...] "Little Green Men". Even after several injections, it was shown that Quark was completely unaffected by the truth serum.|$|R

Police described the crime scene as [...] "resembling a massacre". Wicklund's body was nude, {{and she had been}} severely beaten, strangled, and raped with a blunt instrument in addition to having her throat slit (the murder weapon and the object used to rape her were never found). She was covered with bruises, and had a broken <b>nose,</b> jaw, and <b>ribs,</b> a testament to her attacker's rage. Wicklund also had bruising on her knuckles, suggesting that she'd not gone down without a fight. Barbara Hendrickson had been attacked and her throat cut after going over to the house to check on Wicklund, who had been ill with the flu that week. Shannah suffered the same fate when she came home from school. She had been choked and her throat cut so deep that she was nearly decapitated.

25|$|UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy {{and a team}} {{of lawyers}} were in court until 4:30p.m. {{on the day of the}} fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An {{ultimatum}} was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind that he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken <b>nose,</b> and cracked <b>ribs.</b> His injuries combined with the rule change, he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.|$|R
40|$|Background: Cartilage grafts is one {{integral}} {{component in}} the various fields of plastic surgery particular rhinoplasty. Surgeons usually use from various sources, including the septum of the <b>nose,</b> ears and <b>rib.</b> Complications such deformity and reabsorbtion may be created with use of the cartilage. Area of the removal of cartilage can prevent these complications. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the absorption rate and viability of cartilage autograft between two common donor site, the rib and the concha. 			Methods: This experimental study was performed on October 2014 in animal laboratory of Hazrat Fatima Hospital, Tehran, Iran. In this study, 15 New Zealand white male rabbits, weighing 2000 - 2500 g, approximately 12 to 16 weeks of age were used. In each rabbit, a piece of one ear and one cartilage was excised. After careful weighting of grafts, we implanted the rib cartilage graft into the left pocket and the conchal cartilage graft into the right one. After 8 weeks, the grafts were removed and weighed precisely and photography was carried out. The specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin solution for histologic examination was. An example of hematoxylin and eosin staining and cut (H&E) were performed and samples of live chondrocytes and fibrosis were examined by a pathologist. 			Results: We lost 3 rabbits during our study. The results showed that the average weight of a graft from the ear within 2 months, but this increase was not statistically significant (P= 0. 152). In the rib graft weight loss over 2 months, and this reduction was statistically significant (P= 0. 009). The resorption between two group was not significant but the amount of fibrosis was more in conchal cartilage graft. 			Conclusion: According to the study it can be concluded that absorption rib cartilage is somewhat better results than the cartilage of the ear. More studies, in addition to cartilage implants longer human studies can contribute to more accurate conclusions...|$|R
