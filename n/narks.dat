40|$|Uptake of nitrate {{into the}} {{cytoplasm}} {{is the first}} but least well understood step of denitrification; no gene has previously been identified to be necessary for this process. Upstream from the structural genes of the membrane-bound nitrate reductase (narGHJI) in Paracoccus pantotrophus there is a fusion of two genes, each homologous {{to members of the}} <b>narK</b> family. The single open reading frame is predicted to encode 24 transmembrane helices, comprising two domains, <b>NarK</b> 1 and <b>NarK</b> 2. Analysis of both the accumulation of intracellular nitrite and electron transport through the nitrate reductase enzyme in <b>narK</b> mutants reveals that <b>NarK</b> 1 and <b>NarK</b> 2 are both involved in nitrate uptake. Maximal rate of nitrate transport via <b>NarK</b> 2 was dependent upon nitrite, indicating that <b>NarK</b> 2 encodes a nitrate/nitrite antiporter. The uncouplers S 13 and dinitrophenol showed that <b>NarK</b> 2 was not dependent on the proton motive force for maximal nitrate transport activity. Nitrate transport via <b>NarK</b> 1 was dependent on proton motive force, indicating that {{it is likely to be}} a nitrate/proton symporter. Low expression of membrane-bound nitrate reductase in <b>narK</b> mutants was counteracted by azide, which induced nitrate reductase expression only if the transcriptional activator NarR was present. ...|$|R

The putative catalytic domain of <b>NARK</b> was expressed and purified as a maltose-binding or a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant <b>NARK</b> proteins showed autophosphorylation activity in vitro. Several regions of the <b>NARK</b> kinase domain were shown by mass spectrometry to possess phosphoresidues. The kinase-inactive protein K 724 E failed to autophosphorylate, as did three other proteins corresponding to phenotypically detected mutants defective in whole plant autoregulation of nodulation. A wild-type <b>NARK</b> fusion protein transphosphorylated a kinase-inactive mutant <b>NARK</b> fusion protein, suggesting that {{it is capable of}} intermolecular autophosphorylation in vitro. In addition, Ser- 861 and Thr- 963 in the <b>NARK</b> kinase catalytic domain were identified as phosphorylation sites through site-directed mutagenesis. The genes coding for the kinase-associated protein phosphatases KAPP 1 and KAPP 2, two putative interacting components of <b>NARK,</b> were isolated. <b>NARK</b> kinase domain phosphorylated recombinant KAPP proteins in vitro. Autophosphorylated <b>NARK</b> kinase domain was, in turn, dephosphorylated by both KAPP 1 and KAPP 2.

40|$|Two transmembrane {{proteins}} were tentatively {{classified as}} <b>NarK</b> 1 and <b>NarK</b> 2 in the Pseudomonas genome project and hypothesized {{to play an}} important physiological role in nitrate/nitrite transport in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The <b>narK</b> 1 and <b>narK</b> 2 genes are located in a cluster along with the structural genes for the nitrate reductase complex. Our studies indicate that the transcription of all these genes is initiated from a single promoter and that the gene complex <b>narK</b> 1 K 2 GHJI constitutes an operon. Utilizing an isogenic <b>narK</b> 1 mutant, a <b>narK</b> 2 mutant, and a <b>narK</b> 1 K 2 double mutant, we explored their effect on growth under denitrifying conditions. While the ΔnarK 1 ::Gm mutant was only slightly affected in its ability to grow under denitrification conditions, both the ΔnarK 2 ::Gm and ΔnarK 1 K 2 ::Gm mutants were found to be severely restricted in nitrate-dependent, anaerobic growth. All three strains demonstrated wild-type levels of nitrate reductase activity. Nitrate uptake by whole-cell suspensions demonstrated both the ΔnarK 2 ::Gm and ΔnarK 1 K 2 ::Gm mutants to have very low yet different nitrate uptake rates, while the ΔnarK 1 ::Gm mutant exhibited wild-type levels of nitrate uptake. Finally, Escherichia coli <b>narK</b> rescued both the ΔnarK 2 ::Gm and ΔnarK 1 K 2 ::Gm mutants with respect to anaerobic respiratory growth.

40|$|Nitrate and nitrite {{transport}} across biological mem branes {{is often}} facilitated by protein transporters that {{are members of}} the major facilita tor superfamily. Paracoccus denitrificans contains an unusual arrangement whereby two of the se transporters, <b>NarK</b> 1 and <b>NarK</b> 2, are fused into a single protein, N arK, which delivers nitrate to the respiratory nitrate reductase and transfers the pro duct, nitrite, to the periplasm. Our complementation studies, using a mutant lacking the nitrate/proton symporter NasA from the assimilatory nitrate reductase pathway, su pport that <b>NarK</b> 1 functions as a nitrate/proton symporter while <b>NarK</b> 2 is a nitrate/n itrite antiporter. Through the same experimental system, we find that Escherichia coli <b>NarK</b> and NarU can complement deletions in both <b>narK</b> and nasA in P. denitrificans, suggesting that, while these proteins are most likely nitrate/nitrite antiporters, they c an also act in the net uptake of nitrate. Finally, we argue that primary sequence analysis an d structural modelling do not readily explain why NasA, <b>NarK</b> 1 and <b>NarK</b> 2, as well as other transporters from this protein family, have such different functions, ranging from net nitrate uptake to nitrate/nitrite exchange...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of the <b>narK</b> gene in Escherichia coli was studied by constructing narK-lacZ gene and operon fusions and analyzing their expression in various mutant strains in response to changes in cell growth conditions. Expression of narK-lacZ was induced 110 -fold by a shift to anaerobic growth and a further 8 -fold {{by the presence of}} nitrate. The fnr gene product mediates this anaerobic response, while nitrate control is mediated by the narL, narX, and narQ gene products. The narX and narQ gene products were shown to sense nitrate independently of one another and could each activate <b>narK</b> expression in a NarL-dependent manner. We provide the first evidence that NarL and FNR interact to ensure optimal expression of <b>narK.</b> IHF and Fis proteins are also required for full activation of <b>narK</b> expression, and their roles in DNA bending are discussed. Finally, the availability of molybdate and iron ions is necessary for optimal <b>narK</b> expression, whereas the availability of nitrite is not.

40|$|Background: Similarly to the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, the arbuscular {{mycorrhiza}} {{interaction is}} controlled by autoregulation representing a feedback inhibition involving the CLAVATA 1 -like receptor kinase <b>NARK</b> in shoots. However, {{little is known about}} signals and targets down-stream of <b>NARK.</b> To find NARK-related transcriptional changes in mycorrhizal soybean (Glycine max) plants, we analyzed wild-type and two <b>nark</b> mutant lines interacting with the arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Results: Affymetrix GeneChip analysis of non-inoculated and partially inoculated plants in a split-root system identified genes with potential regulation by arbuscular mycorrhiza or <b>NARK.</b> Most transcriptional changes occur locally during arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis and independently of <b>NARK.</b> RT-qPCR analysis verified nine genes as NARK-dependently regulated. Most of them have lower expression in roots or shoots of wild type compared to <b>nark</b> mutants, including genes encoding the receptor kinase GmSIK 1, proteins with putative function as ornithine acetyl transferase, and a DEAD box RNA helicase. A predicted annexin named GmAnnx 1 a is differentially regulated by <b>NARK</b> and arbuscular mycorrhiza in distinct plant organs. Two putative CCAAT-binding transcription factor genes named GmNF-YA 1 a and GmNF-YA 1 b are down-regulated NARK-dependently in non-infected roots of mycorrhizal wild-type plants and functional gene analysis confirmed a positive role for these genes in the development of an arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. Conclusions: Our results indicate GmNF-YA 1 a/b as positive regulators in arbuscular mycorrhiza establishment, whose expression is down-regulated by <b>NARK</b> in the autoregulated root tissue thereby diminishing subsequent infections. Genes regulated independently of arbuscular mycorrhization by <b>NARK</b> support an additional function of <b>NARK</b> in symbioses-independent mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} Escherichia coli <b>narK</b> gene, which {{is located in the}} upstream region of the narCHJI operon, was determined. The <b>narK</b> gene encodes a very hydrophobic protein with 463 amino acid residues (Mr 49 693). A <b>narK</b> deletion mutant, under conditions for the induction of nitrate respiration, was unable to perform nitrate transport. Loss of transport activity was recovered by transforming the mutant with a narK+ plasmid. Thus, we conclude that the <b>narK</b> gene encodes a transmembrane protein participating in nitrate transport. In the <b>narK</b> promoter region, we defined a unique sequence that we designate as a ‘nitrate box’, functioning as a putative NarL-binding site, in addition to the consensus sequence of the ‘anaero-box’...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate uptake is {{essential}} for various bacterial processes and combines with nitrite export to form the usual initial steps of denitrification, a process that reduces nitrate to dinitrogen gas. Although many bacterial species contain NarK-like transporters that are proposed to function as either nitrate/proton symporters or nitrate/nitrite antiporters based on sequence homology, these transporters remain, in general, poorly characterized. Several bacteria appear to contain a transporter that is a fusion of two NarK-like proteins, although {{the significance of this}} arrangement remains elusive. We demonstrate that <b>NarK</b> from Paracoccus denitrificans is expressed as a fusion of two NarK-like transporters. <b>NarK</b> 1 and <b>NarK</b> 2 are separately capable of supporting anaerobic denitrifying growth but with growth defects that are partially mitigated by coexpression of the two domains. <b>NarK</b> 1 appears to be a nitrate/proton symporter with high affinity for nitrate and <b>NarK</b> 2 a nitrate/nitrite antiporter with lower affinity for nitrate. Each transporter requires two conserved arginine residues for activity. A transporter consisting of inactivated <b>NarK</b> 1 fused to active <b>NarK</b> 2 has a dramatically increased affinity for nitrate compared with <b>NarK</b> 2 alone, implying a functional interaction between the two domains. A potential model for nitrate and nitrite transport in P. denitrificans is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} induces {{nitrate reductase}} activity {{in response to}} decreasing oxygen levels. This is due to regulation of both the transcription and {{the activity of the}} nitrate transporter <b>NarK</b> 2. A model of <b>NarK</b> 2 structure is proposed containing 12 membrane spanning regions consistent {{with other members of the}} major facilitator superfamily. The role of the proton gradient was determined by exposing M. tuberculosis to uncouplers. Nitrite production decreased indicating that the importation of nitrate involved an H(+) /nitrate symporter. The addition of nitrite before nitrate had no effect, suggesting no role for a nitrate/nitrite antiporter. In addition the <b>NarK</b> 2 knockout mutant showed no defect in nitrite export. <b>NarK</b> 2 is proposed to be a Type I H(+) /nitrate symporter. Site directed mutagenesis was performed changing 23 amino acids of <b>NarK</b> 2. This allowed the identification of important regions and amino acids of this transporter. Five of these mutants were inactive for nitrate transport, seven produced reduced activity and eleven mutants retained wild type activity. <b>NarK</b> 2 is inactivated in the presence of oxygen by an unknown mechanism. However none of the mutants, including those with mutated cysteines, were altered in their response to oxygen levels. The assimilatory nitrate transporter NasA of Bacillus subtilis was expressed in the M. tuberculosis <b>NarK</b> 2 mutant.

40|$|Thermus thermophilus HB 8 {{can grow}} anaerobically {{by using a}} membrane-bound nitrate reductase to {{catalyze}} the reduction of nitrate as a final electron acceptor in respiration. In contrast to other denitrifiers, the nitrite produced does not continue the reduction pathway but accumulates in the growth medium after its active extrusion from the cell. We describe the presence of two genes, <b>narK</b> 1 and <b>narK</b> 2, downstream of the nitrate reductase-encoding gene cluster (nar) that code for two homologues to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. The sequences of <b>NarK</b> 1 and <b>NarK</b> 2 are 30 % identical to each other, but whereas <b>NarK</b> 1 clusters in an average-distance tree with putative nitrate transporters, <b>NarK</b> 2 does so with putative nitrite exporters. To analyze whether this differential clustering was actually related to functional differences, we isolated derivatives with mutations of one or both genes. Analysis revealed that single mutations had minor effects on growth by nitrate respiration, whereas a double <b>narK</b> 1 <b>narK</b> 2 mutation abolished this capability. Further analysis allowed us {{to confirm that the}} double mutant is completely unable to excrete nitrite, while single mutants have a limitation in the excretion rates compared with the wild type. These data allow us to propose that both proteins are implicated in the transport of nitrate and nitrite, probably acting as nitrate/nitrite antiporters.

40|$|Mineral {{nitrogen}} in nature is {{often found in}} the form of nitrate (NO 3 -). Numerous microorganisms evolved to assimilate nitrate {{and use it as a}} major source of mineral nitrogen uptake 1. Nitrate, which is central in nitrogen metabolism, is first reduced to nitrite (NO 2 -) through a two-electron reduction reaction 2, 3. The accumulation of cellular nitrite can be harmful because nitrite can be reduced to the cytotoxic nitric oxide. Instead, nitrite is rapidly removed from the cell by channels and transporters, or reduced to ammonium or dinitrogen through the action of assimilatory enzymes 3. Despite decades of effort no structure is currently available for any nitrate transport protein and the mechanism by which nitrate is transported remains largely obscure. Here we report the structure of a bacterial nitrate/nitrite transport protein, <b>NarK,</b> from Escherichia coli, with and without substrate. The structures reveal a positively charged substrate-translocation pathway lacking protonatable residues, suggesting that <b>NarK</b> functions as a nitrate/nitrite exchanger and that H+s are unlikely to be co-transported. Conserved arginine residues form the substrate-binding pocket, which is formed by association of helices from the two halves of <b>NarK.</b> Key residues that are important for substrate recognition and transport are identified and related to extensive mutagenesis and functional studies.

Under microaerobic conditions, whole cells exhibit upregulation of activity, producing approximately eightfold more nitrite than those of aerobic cultures of the same age. Assays of cell extracts from aerobic cultures and hypoxic cultures yielded comparable nitrate reductase activities. Mycobacterium bovis produced only low levels of nitrite, and this activity was not induced by hypoxia. M. tuberculosis has two sets of genes, narGHJI and narX of the <b>narK</b> 2 X operon, that exhibit some degree of homology to prokaryotic dissimilatory nitrate reductases. Each of these were knocked out by insertional inactivation.

A knockout of the putative nitrite transporter <b>narK</b> 2 gene produced a strain that had aerobic levels of nitrate reductase activity but failed to show hypoxic upregulation. Insertion of the M. tuberculosis narGHJI into a nitrate reductase Escherichia coli mutant allowed anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate. Under aerobic and hypoxic conditions, transcription of narGHJI was constitutive, while the <b>narK</b> 2 X operon was induced under hypoxia, as measured with a lacZ reporter system and by quantitative real-time reverse PCR.
