5000|$|VCAT {{helps in}} {{providing}} services {{at a lower}} cost and more quickly than contiguous concatenation. However, it creates differential delay whereby each path that is created, represented by a VT has a different propagational delay across the network. The difference in these delays is called [...] "differential delay" [...] (D). The major problem with differential delay is the requirement for high speed buffers at the receiving node to store incoming information while all paths converge. This buffer space, (B) can be equated to the bandwidth delay product such that B = n * D. Thus, each Virtually Concatenated connection requires B bits of buffer space. This need for buffer space eventually increases the <b>network</b> <b>cost,</b> so {{it is very important to}} select paths that minimize the differential delay, which is directly proportional to the buffer space required.|$|E

On the transmission side, he demonstrated why marginal prices fail to recover the total incurred network costs.Later on, he added major contributions to the security of supply debate, formulating {{in the context of}} the redesign of the Colombian capacity payments mechanism in 1999 the reliability options mechanism, the base of the capacity auction mechanisms later implemented in Colombia and New England.

40|$|When {{a content}} {{provider}} (CP) provides peer-topeer live streaming service, routing decisions {{with the knowledge}} of underlay traffic can often lead to much better performance (such as user delay). On the other hand, if the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide underlay traffic information to the CP, their overall <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> due to routing inefficiencies can be reduced. There is hence incentive for ISP-CP collaboration. In this paper, we study protocol design to reduce <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> for such collaboration. We consider two ways of collaboration: one on complete information sharing (i. e., the case of ISPs playing the role of CP), and the other one on limited information sharing by means of peer ranking (i. e., the case of P 4 P framework through Oracle/iTracker). We first formulate the problem of minimizing <b>network</b> <b>cost</b> with a certain delay target, and show that it is NP-hard. For complete information sharing, we propose a centralized heuristic which achieves low <b>network</b> <b>cost.</b> For limited information sharing, we present a simple distributed algorithm called Coppice (Collaborative ISP-CP live streaming service) which achieves low <b>network</b> <b>cost.</b> Simulation results show that indeed there is a strong benefit for ISP-CP collaboration, and substantial performance can be gained if ISPs can share complete network information with CP. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a concerted effort {{in recent years to}} {{undertake}} more strategic, long-term, and cross-sector assessment of national infrastructure. This paper reflects on the assessment of fixed broadband within the recent National Needs Assessment, which aims to identify options for meeting the UK's infrastructure 2 ̆ 018 needs' up to 2050. It establishes the future 2 ̆ 018 need' for different levels of fixed broadband connectivity and how much investment is required to rollout infrastructure to meet different regional coverage and capacity levels. Two key technologies are initially assessed here using a cost modelling approach, including Fibre-To-The-Premises (FTTP) utilising a Gigabit Passive Optical Network and FTTP utilising a Point-To-Point fibre connection. The results show the aggregate investment required to deliver different levels of fixed broadband access to different proportions of the population. The costs raise linearly for delivery to premises in urban areas, with total urban coverage by FTTP using a Gigabit Passive Optical <b>Network</b> <b>costing</b> 314. 1 billion and FTTP using a Point-To-Point <b>network</b> <b>costing</b> 317 billion. The costs for rural and remote areas begin to rise sharply, to the extent that deployment of these technologies to the final third of premises could cost almost the same amount as deployment to the first two thirds of premises in urban areas. Deployment to rural and remote areas was estimated to cost 313. 7 billion for FTTP using a Gigabit Passive Optical Network and 315. 8 billion for FTTP using a Point-To-Point network. Total FTTP coverage using a Gigabit Passive Optical <b>Network</b> <b>costs</b> 327. 7 billion, whereas FTTP coverage using a Point-To-Point <b>network</b> <b>costs</b> 332. 8 billion.
