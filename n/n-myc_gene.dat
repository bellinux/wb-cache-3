40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{expression}} of the <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 protein in benign and malignant lesions of the thyroid gland by immunohistochemistry. INTRODUCTION: <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 encodes a protein whose expression is induced by various stimuli, including cell differentiation, exposure to heavy metals, hypoxia, and DNA damage. Increased <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 expression has been detected in various types of tumors, but the role of <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 expression in thyroid lesions remains to be determined. METHODS: A tissue microarray paraffin block containing 265 tissue fragments corresponding to normal thyroid, nodular goiter, follicular adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (classical pattern and follicular variant), follicular carcinoma, and metastases of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal anti- <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 antibody. RESULTS: The immunohistochemical expression of <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 was higher in carcinomas compared to normal thyroid glands and nodular goiters, with higher expression in classical papillary thyroid carcinomas and metastases of thyroid carcinomas (P < 0. 001). A combined analysis showed higher immunohistochemical expression of NDRG 1 in malignant lesions (classical pattern and follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas, follicular carcinomas, and metastases of thyroid carcinomas) compared to benign thyroid lesions (goiter and follicular adenomas) (P = 0. 043). In thyroid carcinomas, <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 expression was significantly correlated with a more advanced TNM stage (P = 0. 007) and age, metastasis, tumor extent, and size (AMES) high-risk group (P = 0. 012). CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid carcinomas showed increased immunohistochemical <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 expression compared to normal and benign thyroid lesions and is correlated with more advanced tumor stages...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} {{difficult to predict}} the positions of mutations in genomic DNA at the nucleotide level. Retroviral DNA insertion is one mode of mutation, resulting in host infections {{that are difficult to}} treat. This mutation process involves the integration of retroviral DNA into the host-infected cellular genomic DNA following the interaction between host DNA and a pre-integration complex consisting of retroviral DNA and integrase. Here, we report that retroviral insertion sites around a hotspot within the Zfp 521 and <b>N-myc</b> <b>genes</b> can be predicted by a periodic function that is deduced using the diffraction lattice model.

40|$|Murine {{knockouts}} (KO) of myc genes {{have provided}} substantial insight into {{not only their}} normal functions during development, but also shed light on their tumorigenic functions when they are misregulated. c-myc and <b>N-myc</b> <b>genes</b> both are essential in neural stem and precursor cells (NSC) for normal mouse brain growth[1, 2]. The fact that mutation of N-myc also causes microcephaly in humans in Feingold Syndrome[3], suggests common Myc-regulated pathways are at work during mouse and human brain growth. Earlier studies indicate that N-Myc drives brain growth by maintaining widespread domains of euchromatin [4] required for NSC proliferation and pluripotency.

40|$|Amplification of the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> is {{correlated}} with increased metastatic ability of human neuroblastomas. We show here that overexpression of the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> in a rat neuroblastoma cell line following gene transfer causes down-modulation of class I histocompatibility antigen expression {{and increases in}} the in vivo growth rate and metastatic ability of these cells. N-myc-mediated down-modulation of MHC class I antigen expression could be reversed by treatment with interferon without affecting the steady state level of N-myc mRNA. No effect on MHC class I antigen expression was found when the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> was expressed in rat fibroblasts, indicating {{that some of the}} effects caused by <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> amplification are cell-type-specific...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} {{and distribution of}} <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> product were studied in 13 neuroblastomas and five ganglioneuroblastomas, using immunohistochemical techniques. Nine tumors (eight neuroblastomas and one ganglioneuroblastoma of composite type) contained neuroblastoma cells with positive nuclei for N-myc protein. Microscopic examination showed {{that most of the}} positive neuroblastoma cells seemed to be immature, with no apparent neuronal differentiation. Nine of 11 tumours with amplified <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> copies exhibited tumour cells with positive immunostaining for the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> product, while none of the seven non-N-myc amplified cases contained immunoreactive tumour cells.

40|$|We {{detected}} a rearrangement in the inyc gene region in a neuro blastoma from a 9 -month-old girl. In this case, the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> was amplified 50 -fold {{in the primary}} tumor, the lymph node metastasis, and the hepatic metastasis. The rearrangement was detected only in the primary tumor and the lymph node metastasis, whereas N-myc RNA and protein expression were detected only in the primary tumor and the hepatic metastasis. Both the rearranged <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> and the normal V myc gene were amplified 25 -fold, and the rearrangement occurred 723 nucleotides downstream from the 3 ' end of exon 3. The cell line (NH- 6) derived from the primary tumor showed my<- gene amplification with out this rearrangement. These results suggest the following: (a) the primary tumor had at least two clones; (b) the rearrangement interrupted <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> expression; and (c) oncogenesis preceded <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> amplification...|$|E
40|$|N-Myc is a {{transcription}} factor that forms heterodimers with the protein Max and binds gene promoters by recognizing a DNA sequence, CACGTG, called E-box. The identification of <b>N-myc</b> target <b>genes</b> {{is an important}} step for understanding N-Myc biological functions in both physiological and pathological contexts. In this study, we describe the identification of N-Myc-responsive genes through chromatin immunoprecipitation and methylation-sensitive restriction analysis. Results show that N-Myc is a direct regulator of several identified genes, and that methylation of the CpG dinucleotide within the E-box prevents the access of <b>N-Myc</b> to <b>gene</b> promoters in vivo. Furthermore, methylation profile of the E-box within the promoters of EGFR and CASP 8, two genes directly controlled by Myc, is cell type-specific, suggesting that differential E-box methylation may contribute to generating unique patterns of Myc-dependent transcription.

40|$|SummaryUnderstanding the {{regulation}} of human gene expression requires knowledge of the “second genetic code,” which consists of the binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) and the combinatorial code by which TF binding sites are assembled to form tissue-specific enhancer elements. Using a novel high-throughput method, we determined the DNA binding specificities of GLIs 1 – 3, Tcf 4, and c-Ets 1, which mediate transcriptional responses to the Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways. To identify mammalian enhancer elements regulated by these pathways on a genomic scale, we developed a computational tool, enhancer element locator (EEL). We show that EEL {{can be used to}} identify Hh and Wnt target genes and to predict activated TFs based on changes in gene expression. Predictions validated in transgenic mouse embryos revealed the presence of multiple tissue-specific enhancers in mouse c-Myc and <b>N-Myc</b> <b>genes,</b> which has implications for organ-specific growth control and tumor-type specificity of oncogenes...|$|R
40|$|The woodchuck intronless {{proto-oncogene}} N-myc 2 {{was initially}} discovered as a frequent target site for hepadnavirus integration in hepatoceliular carcinoma. N-myc 2 possesses {{characteristics of a}} functional retroposon derived from the woodchuck <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene.</b> We have investigated the regulatory signals governing N-myc 2 expression and found that a short promoter, including a variant TATA box and potential binding sites for several transcription factors, is localized in the N-myc 2 sequences homologous to the 5 ' untranslated region of the second N-myc exon. The corresponding region in the intron-containing woodchuck <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> also exhibited promoter activity in transient transfection assays. The high evolutionary conservation of these sequences in mammalian N-myc genes suggests that they contain a cryptic N-myc promoter which may be unmasked in the particular context provided by the N-myc 2 retroposon. Although N-myc 2, like the woodchuck <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene,</b> contributes to an extended CpG island and was found constitutively hypomethylated, it presents a highly restricted expression pattern in adult animals. Whereas the intron-containing <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> is expressed at low levels in different tissues, N-myc 2 mRNA was detected only in brain tissue, raising questions about the functional significance of {{the maintenance of a}} second <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> in the woodchuck genome.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the initiation of}} the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> amplification, we have analyzed the original structures of the N-myc amplicons among 38 human neuroblastomas. Nineteen DNAs isolated from the N-myc amplicons recognized a continuous stretch totally encompassing a 5. 5 megabase region spanning the normal <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene.</b> The co-amplification profiles with these DNAs showed that two of them, which mapped into a 300 kb region flanking the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene,</b> were commonly amplified in most specimens, while others were differentially amplified among various subsets. These profiles enabled us to divide the N-myc amplicons into several groups and outline their original domains as a continuous stretches, pointing {{to the existence of}} 'consensus sites' for the ends of the initial domains in the original region. In one cell line, the domain was found to be several times larger than that of the derivative amplicon; and the rearranged sites identified within the amplicons, which showed no site specificity, were consistent with those deduced from the domain structure. These results lead to a model in which <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> amplification is initiated at some consensus sites by a preferential mechanism and followed by a random loss of the domain structures during subsequent stages...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{characterized}} <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> amplification {{in three}} human neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR- 32, TGW, GOTO). Rearrangements in long-range regions surrounding amplified N-myc genes were examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Since rare-cutting enzymes completely digested DNA {{at the middle}} of the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene,</b> we were able to construct a physical map upstream and downstream of the germline <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene,</b> and to obtain information on restriction sites surrounding amplified N-myc genes. This method enables us to envisage the organization of amplified units over a long range. Digestion patterns differed considerably among the germline and the three cell lines, but were simple in each case. We estimated that the minimal distance between neighboring N-myc genes is at least several hundred kilobases. Our data suggest that amplification units contain several DNA fragments derived from ditterent loci, but that they are homogeneous...|$|E

40|$|Precisely {{regulated}} {{expression of}} oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes {{is essential for}} normal development, and deregulated expression can lead to cancer. The human <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> normally is expressed in only a subset of fetal epithelial tissues, and its expression is extinguished in all adult tissues except transiently in pre-B lymphocytes. The <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> is overexpressed due to genomic amplification in the childhood tumor neuroblastoma. In previous work to investigate mechanisms of regulation of human <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> expression, we observed that N-myc promoter–chloramphemicol acelyltransferase reporter constructs containing sequences 5 ′ to exon 1 were active in all cell types examined, regardless of whether endogenous N-myc RNA was detected. In contrast, inclusion of the first exon and {{a portion of the}} first intron allowed expression only in those cell types with detectable endogenous N-myc transcripts. We investigated further the mechanisms by which this tissue-specific control of N-myc expression is achieved. Using nuclear run-on analyses, we determined that the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> is actively transcribed in all cell types examined, indicating a posttranscriptional mode of regulation. Using a series of N-myc intron 1 deletion constructs, we localized a 116 -bp element (tissue-specific element [TSE]) within the first intron that directs tissue-specific N-myc expression. The TSE can function independently to regulate expression of a heterologous promoter-reporter minigene in a cell-specific pattern that mirrors the expression pattern of the endogenous <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene.</b> Surprisingly, the TSE can function in both sense and antisense orientations to regulate gene expression.

All integrated proviruses have the same transcriptional orientation as the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene.</b> As a consequence of proviral insertion, the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> becomes transcriptionally active, producing an abnormal mRNA.

In human normal primary keratinocytes and in colon and ovary carcinoma cells we obtained evidences for: (i) a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation without toxicity or apoptosis; (ii) a transition from a proliferative mesenchymal morphology to cell-specific differentiated structures; (iii) a noticeable increase in cell-cell and cell-substratum junctions; (iv) a relocation of the oncogenic beta-catenin at the cell-cell junctions; (v) inhibition of microtubules aggregation; (vi) upregulation of differentiation-related genes including p 53, heat shock protein 27 <b>gene,</b> <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1, E-cadherin, and downregulation of cyclooxygenase- 2; (vii) inhibition of c-Src tyrosine kinase.

40|$|Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy Lom (HMSNL) is {{a severe}} {{autosomal}} recessive peripheral neuropathy, {{the most common}} form of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease in the Roma (Gypsy) population. The mutated <b>gene,</b> <b>N-myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 1 (NDRG 1), is widely expressed and has been implicated in a range of processes and pathways. To gain an insight into NDRG 1 function we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and identified interacting proteins whose known functions suggest involvement in cellular trafficking. Further analyses, focusing on apolipoproteins A-I and A-II, confirmed their interaction with NDRG 1 in mammalian cells and suggest a defect in Schwann cell lipid trafficking as a major pathogenetic mechanism in HMSNL. At the same time, the chromosomal location of NDRG 1 coincides with a reported HDL-C QTL in humans and in mice.

40|$|The <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> is {{expressed}} {{specifically in the}} early developmental stages of numerous cell lineages. To assay for sequences that could potentially regulate N-myc expression, we transfected constructs that contained murine N-myc genomic sequences linked to a reporter gene and genomic clones that contained the complete human or murine N-myc genes into cell lines that either express or do not express the endogenous <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene.</b> Following either transient or stable transfection, the introduced N-myc sequences were expressed regardless of the expression status of the endogenous gene. In contrast, when the clones containing the complete human <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> were introduced into the germline of transgenic mice, expression in some transgenic lines paralleled the tissue- and stage-specific expression of the endogenous murine gene.

40|$|We have {{generated}} transgenic mouse lines that carry {{one of three}} different constructs in which the murine <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> is expressed {{under the control of}} the immunoglobulin heavy chain transcriptional enhancer element (E mu-N-myc genes). High-level expression of the E mu-N-myc transgenes occurred in lymphoid tissues; correspondingly, many of these E mu-N-myc lines reproducibly developed pre-B- and B-lymphoid malignancies. The E mu-N-myc transgene also appeared to participate in the generation of a T cell malignancy that developed in one E mu-N-myc mouse. These tumors and cell lines adapted from them expressed exceptionally high levels of the E mu-N-myc transgene; the levels were comparable to those observed in human neuroblastomas with highly amplified N-myc genes. In contrast, all of the E mu-N-myc cell lines had exceptionally low or undetectable levels of the c-myc RNA sequences, consistent with the possibility that high-level N-myc expression can participate in the negative 'cross-regulation' of c-myc gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that deregulated expression of the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> has potent oncogenic potential within the B-lymphoid lineage despite the fact that the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> has never been implicated in naturally occurring B-lymphoid malignancies. Our results also are discussed in the context of differential myc gene activity in normal and transformed cells...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic {{constructs}} {{containing the}} murine L-myc gene {{under the control}} of the immunoglobulin transcriptional enhancer element (Emu) are expressed at unexpectedly high levels in thymocytes and proliferating T cells compared with cells from bone marrow and proliferating B cells. In contrast, double transgenic animals bearing constructs containing the L- and <b>N-myc</b> <b>genes</b> similarly linked to the Emu element maintain preferential L-myc expression in T cells but express the N-myc transgene preferentially in B cells. These results indicate that the L-myc gene contains elements that act in concert with the Emu element to allow preferential expression in T lineage cells. In correspondence to the expression pattern, Emu-L-myc transgenic mice show expanded thymic cortices and irregularly formed splenic follicles with expanded T cell areas. Moreover, the percentage of thymocytes positive for the surface marker 1 C 11, which defines thymic progenitor cells, activated T cells and preleukemic T cells, is dramatically raised in transgenic mice compared with normal littermates. Emu-L-myc transgenic animals are predisposed to clonal lymphoid tumors, most of which are T cell lymphomas. The relative incidence, latency period, and degree of malignancy of Emu-L-myc tumors compared with Emu-N- or c-myc tumors is consistent with a lower oncogenic potential of the L-myc gene. However, the Emu-L-myc tumors do not express detectable levels of endogenous myc family genes indicating that the L-myc protein can substitute for c- or N-myc in the generation and growth of lymphoid neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b), a {{pluripotent}} cytokine {{expressed in}} the colon, has a crucial but paradoxical role in colorectal cancer (CRC). TGF-b is a potent proliferation inhibitor of normal colon epithelial cells and acts as a tumor suppressor. However, TGF-b also promotes invasion and metastasis during late-stage CRC, thereby acting as an oncogene. Thus, understanding the factors behind the paradoxical roles of TGF-b and elucidating the mechanisms by which TGF-b-induced proliferation inhibition is impaired in CRC are necessary. Here, {{we found that the}} <b>N-Myc</b> tumor suppressor <b>gene</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> NDRG 2 (<b>N-Myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 2), which is a TGF-b-responsive gene, abrogated TGF-b-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and further inhibited the invasion and migration of CRC cells. TGF-b positively induced NDRG 2 expression through direct transactivation mediated by Sp 1 and by abrogation of the repressive c-Myc/Miz- 1 complex on NDRG 2 promoter in normal epithelial cells. Aberrant hypermethylation of NDRG 2, which could respond to TGF-b growth inhibition signaling, abrogated the inhibitory effect of NDRG 2 in TGF-b-induced EMT in CRCs. Reduced NDRG 2 expression was highly correlated with the invasion stage and metastasis of CRC. Our study establishes that NDRG 2 is a new tumor suppressor gene that responds to TGF-b anti-proliferative signaling and tips the balance of oncogenic TGF-b during late-stage CRC...|$|R
40|$|Separate murine {{knockout}} (KO) {{of either}} c- or <b>N-myc</b> <b>genes</b> in neural stem and precursor cells (NSC) driven by nestin-cre causes microcephaly. The cerebellum is particularly affected in the N-myc KO, {{leading to a}} strong reduction in cerebellar granule neural progenitors (CGNP) and mature granule neurons. In humans, mutation of N-myc also causes microcephaly in Feingold Syndrome. We created a double KO (DKO) of c- and N-myc using nestin-cre, which strongly impairs brain growth, particularly that of the cerebellum. Granule neurons were almost absent from the Myc DKO cerebellum, and other cell types were relatively overrepresented, including astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and Purkinje neurons. These findings are indicative of a profound disruption of cell fate of cerebellar stem and precursors. DKO Purkinje neurons were strikingly lacking in normal arborization. Inhibitory neurons were ectopic and exhibited very abnormal GAD 67 staining patterns. Also consistent with altered cell fate, the adult DKO cerebellum still retained a residual external germinal layer (EGL). CGNP in the DKO EGL were almost uniformly NeuN and p 27 KIP 1 positive as well as negative for Math 1 and BrdU {{at the peak of}} normal cerebellar proliferation at P 6. The presence of some mitotic CGNP in the absence of S phase cells suggests a possible arrest in M phase. CGNP and NSC metabolism also was affected by loss of Myc as DKO cells exhibited weak nucleolin staining. Together these findings indicate that c- and N-Myc direct cerebellar development by maintaining CGNP and NSC populations through inhibiting differentiation as well as directing rapid cell cycling and active cellular metabolism...|$|R

Moreover, overexpression of N-myc {{is not sufficient to}} cause cellular transformation. These data suggest that other genetic factors are important for neuroblastoma development. We investigated the expression of the, bcl- 2 proto-oncogene in untreated cases of neuroblastoma. bcl- 2 is a novel proto-oncogene that promotes cell growth by inhibiting programmed cell death (apoptosis), a form of cellular demise common during normal neurogenesis. Immunocytochemical localization using a monoclonal anti-bcl- 2 antibody revealed that 16 of 40 patient specimens stained positive for bcl- 2. bcl- 2 was strongly associated with unfavorable histology (P = 0. 002) and <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> amplification (P = 0. 002) and marginally associated with poor stage disease (P = 0. 06). A logistic regression model evaluating the simultaneous association of stage, histology, and N-myc revealed that bcl- 2 was most associated with unfavorable histology and <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> amplification.

40|$|ROR alpha 1 and RVR are orphan {{members of}} the {{superfamily}} of nuclear hormone receptors which constitutively activate and repress, respectively, gene transcription by binding to a common DNA sequence.

We have identified a consensus binding site for ROR alpha 1 and RVR in the first intron of the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> that we designated N-myc RORE (ROR response element). Unlike most of the intronic sequence, the region encompassing the N-myc RORE is highly conserved between human and mouse, underscoring its importance. Our studies revealed that ROR alpha 1 and RVR specifically bind to the human and mouse N-myc ROREs and transactivate and transrepress, respectively, reporter constructs containing the ROREs. Moreover, Northern blot analysis demonstrated a direct modulation of an exogenously introduced <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> by ROR alpha 1 and RVR in COS- 1 cells. This effect is mediated through the N-myc RORE, since mutation of this site abolished the regulatory effects of both receptors. While transfection of ROR alpha 1 in P 19 embryonic carcinoma cells {{had no effect on}} the levels of endogenous N-myc mRNA, RVR down-regulated its expression. The regulatory function of the N-myc RORE was further demonstrated by the rat embryonic fibroblast (REF) transformation assay. Mutation of the RORE increased the oncogenic potential of the <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene</b> in the REF assay. The foci were more numerous and significantly larger with the mutated than with the wild-type <b>N-myc</b> <b>gene,</b> regardless of ROR alpha 1 or RVR expression. Moreover, concomitant expression of ROR alpha 1 and wild-type N-myc resulted in a twofold {{increase in the number of}} transformed foci. In contrast, RVR expression resulted in the formation of foci that could be established as permanent clones with a very low frequency compared to foci transformed in its absence. These observations show that ablation of the RORE results in a more oncogenic form of N-myc and suggest that deregulation of the activity of the ROR alpha 1 and RVR could contribute to the initiation and progression of certain neoplasias...|$|E

In the present study, the methylation levels of the secreted frizzled-related protein gene 2 (SFRP 2), GATA binding protein 4 / 5 (GATA 4 / 5), <b>N-Myc</b> downstream-regulated <b>gene</b> 4 (NDRG 4) and vimentin (VIM) promoters were evalu-ated for their use as markers in the noninvasive detection of CRC. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze promoter CpG methylation of SFRP 2, GATA 4 / 5, NDRG 4 and VIM in the fecal DNA of 56 patients with CRC and 40 individuals exhibiting normal colonoscopy results. Promoter methylation levels of SFRP 2, GATA 4 / 5...|$|R
50|$|CCDC113, {{located between}} {{nucleotides}} 58283840 and 58317740 on chromosome 16, is surrounded between antisense genes PRSS54 and CSNK2A2 and downstream from GINS3 and NDRG4 on the sense strand. PRSS54 is a trypsin-like serine protease which codes for the inactive serine protease 54 precursor. CSNK2A2 the casein kinase 2, alpha prime polypeptide contains a protein kinase domain and a catalytic domain. GINS3 {{is essential for}} the initiation of DNA replication and replisome progression in eukaryotes. NDRG4 a member of the <b>N-myc</b> downregulated <b>gene</b> family belonging to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily which encodes a cytoplasmic protein responsible for cell cycle progression and survival in primary astrocytes and may be involved in regulation of mitogenic signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells.|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Separate murine knockout (KO) of either c- or <b>N-myc</b> <b>genes</b> in neural stem and precursor cells (NSC) driven by nestin-cre causes microcephaly. The cerebellum is particularly affected in the N-myc KO, {{leading to a}} strong reduction in cerebellar granule neural progenitors (CGNP) and mature granule neurons. In humans, mutation of N-myc also causes microcephaly in Feingold Syndrome. We created a double KO (DKO) of c- and N-myc using nestin-cre, which strongly impairs brain growth, particu-larly that of the cerebellum. Granule neurons were almost absent from the Myc DKO cerebellum, and other cell types were relatively overrepresented, including astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and Purkinje neurons. These findings are indicative of a profound disruption of cell fate of cerebellar stem and precursors. DKO Purkinje neurons were strikingly lacking in normal arborization. Inhibitory neurons were ectopic and exhibited very abnormal GAD 67 staining patterns. Also consistent with altered cell fate, the adult DKO cerebellum still retained a residual external germinal layer (EGL). CGNP in the DKO EGL were almost uniformly NeuN and p 27 KIP 1 positive as well as negative for Math 1 and BrdU {{at the peak of}} normal cerebellar proliferation at P 6. The presence of some mitotic CGNP in the absence of S phase cells suggests a possible arrest in M phase. CGNP and NSC metabolism also was affected by loss of Myc as DKO cells exhibited weak nucleolin staining. Together these findings indicate that c- and N-Myc direct cerebellar development by maintaining CGNP and NSC populations through inhibiting differentiation as well as directing rapid cell cycling and active cellular metabolism...|$|R
