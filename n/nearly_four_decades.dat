He has been praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped to free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism, and white minority rule.

5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.|$|E
5|$|Described as the {{definitive}} deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, {{and contributed to}} long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched Operation PBHISTORY, which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure.

40|$|This article {{challenges}} orthodox Marxist conceptualisations of {{the revolutionary}} subject by building on the <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> <b>decade</b> tradition of autonomist Marxist feminism. It argues that by expanding our conceptualisation of capitalist relations to include the sphere of social reproduction, {{the creation of a}} gendered division of labour and the construction of alienated subjectivities, we open a window on the multiple subjects that {{are at the heart of}} contemporary anti-capitalist struggles and render visible an increasing feminisation of resistance in Latin America. Through an analysis of the narratives of three women participants in the Urban Land Committees (CTUs) in Venezuela we see that women are at the heart of struggles to re-define the practice of politics, create new democratic subjectivities, and re-invent social transformation, processes in which woman, family and community are renegotiated and re-imagined. This analysis demonstrates the urgent need to reinvigorate a Marxist feminist praxis that can make visible, contribute to and theorise in solidarity with contemporary forms of anti-capitalist struggle...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} contribution of developing countries in world trade, an important question is whether trade {{can be used as}} an instrument to stimulate higher participation of women in the labour market? Trade and industrial liberalization undertaken during the 1990 s and 2000 s marked the end of India's <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> <b>decade</b> experiment with state directed, heavy industry based, and import substituting industrialization. In this context, we analyse the role of various trade and technology related factors in determining female employment intensity (FEI), in a panel of India's manufacturing industries for the period 1998 - 2008. We find that import tariff rates exert a negative effect on FEI, supporting the hypothesis that firms, when exposed to international competition, tend to reduce costs by substituting male with female workers. Further, the relative demand for female workers increases to the extent that trade liberalization leads to resource reallocation in favour of unskilled labour intensive industries where India holds comparative advantage. By contrast, greater use of new technology and capital intensive production biases the gender composition of workforce against females. Liberalization has not led to large growth of female employment in India's organized manufacturing sector because th...|$|R

5|$|Japanese rule of Taiwan {{ended in}} 1945, {{following}} the armistice with the allies on September 2 {{and the subsequent}} appropriation of the island by the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, or KMT) on October 25. In 1949, on losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek led the Kuomintang in a retreat from Mainland China, withdrawing its government and 1.3 million refugees to Taiwan. The KMT installed an authoritarian form of government and shortly thereafter inaugurated a number of political socialization programs aimed at nationalizing Taiwanese people as citizens of a Chinese nation and eradicating Japanese influence. The KMT pursued highly centralized political and cultural policies rooted in the party's decades-long history of fighting warlordism in China and opposing competing concepts of a loose federation following {{the demise of the}} imperial Qing. The project was designed to create a strong national Chinese cultural identity (as defined by the state) at the expense of local cultures. Following the February 28 Incident, the Kuomintang placed Taiwan under martial law, which was to last for <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E

The action also ended the threat to British merchant ships, especially the large East Indiamen, from attack in the Indian Ocean and the requirement for a significant Royal Navy presence in the region.
