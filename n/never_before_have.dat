In your case I am making an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the full}} Curtis opus N. Scott Momaday wrote, [...] "Taken as a whole, {{the work of}} Edward S.

2500|$|A.K.Tolstoy {{entered the}} 1870s {{as a very}} sick man, {{suffering}} from asthma, angina pectoris, neuralgias and severe headaches. Regular visits to European medics only temporarily alleviated his conditions. In the spring of 1875 Tolstoy started taking morphine. [...] "Now I'm feeling much better, at least the neuralgia's gone. But <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>have</b> I been so short of breath. Asthma fits are continuous," [...] he complained {{in a letter to}} poet Karolina Pavlova (who was also a translator of his dramas) on 8 July 1875.|$|E

2500|$|In 1904, Pierce {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} football coach at Carlisle under head coach Edward Rodgers. [...] The 1904 season {{marked the first time}} the Carlisle school had a Native American coaching staff:"For {{the first time in its}} history, this season the Carlisle Indian football team will have full-blooded Indians as head coach and assistant coaches, with full authority to plan their own campaigns against the products of the white men's universities in the persons of Edward Rodgers, head coach, Frank Hudson and Bemus Pierce, assistants. [...] <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>have</b> the redskins been trusted to do the brainwork incident to the planning for a football season ... Assistant Coach Bemus Pierce is a former Carlisle pupil, and for the past two years has had charge of the Sherman Institute team, of California." ...|$|E
2500|$|William James Sidis ( [...] ; April 1, 1898 – July 17, 1944) was an American child prodigy with {{exceptional}} mathematical {{abilities and}} a claimed mastery of many languages. After his death, his sister made the unverifiable claim that his IQ was [...] "the very highest {{that had ever}} been obtained", but any records of any IQ testing that Sidis actually took have been lost to history. He entered Harvard at age 11 and, as an adult, was claimed to be conversant in over 40 languages and dialects. It was later acknowledged, however, {{that some of the}} claims made were exaggerations, with a researcher stating [...] "I have been researching the veracity of primary sources of various subjects for about twenty-eight years, and <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>have</b> I found a topic so satiated with lies, myths, half-truths, exaggerations, and other forms of misinformation as is in the history behind William Sidis". Sidis became famous first for his precocity and later for his eccentricity and withdrawal from public life. Eventually, he avoided mathematics altogether, writing on other subjects under a number of pseudonyms.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Will Tuttle and Sal Accardo also {{praised the}} {{graphics}} and online mode, but they too criticized the single player campaign. [...] "Historical Campaign [...] gets very confusing because you frequently switch sides from battle to battle", stated Tuttle. He added that {{it felt like}} the game's campaign was [...] "tacked on to allow people without PS2 online to have fun." [...] 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister followed suit, also praising the graphics. [...] "Visually, Battlefront is exceptional. <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>have</b> the Star Wars battles been so well recreated and detailed". He criticized the game's AI, however. He felt that it was too easy to defeat them, and that they often did not follow commands issued by the player. As with other reviewers, Pfister felt the single player mode was the weak point of the game, citing the PlayStation 2 version specifically for players without online access. Overall, he felt the problems with the game were outweighed by its qualities. [...] "Battlefront manages to stand tall as a great game that does the best job we've yet seen of playing out the battles of the Star Wars movies." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 7, Vatican City warned Israel {{to respect}} {{religious}} sites {{in line with}} its international obligations. Spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said that the Vatican was following events [...] "with extreme apprehension". A spokesman for Catholic monks in the Holy Land accused the Israelis of [...] "indescribable act of barbarity". The Vatican's top foreign policy expert Archbishop Jean-Louis Taura stated that while the Palestinians have joined the Vatican in bilateral agreements where they have undertaken to respect and {{maintain the status quo}} regarding Christian holy places and the rights of Christian communities, [...] "to explain the gravity of the current situation, let me begin {{with the fact that the}} occupation of the holy places by armed men is a violation of a long tradition of law that dates back to the Ottoman era. <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>have</b> they been occupied – for such a lengthy time – by armed men." [...] Pope John Paul II urged people to pray for peace in the Middle East and described the violence as having reached [...] "unimaginable and intolerable" [...] levels. Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, said the Israeli soldiers would not [...] "defile the holiness of the site as the [...] have". He also said that the troops would remain in place until the militants inside were captured. British Foreign Office Minister, Ben Bradshaw described Israeli actions in the area as [...] "totally unacceptable".|$|E
