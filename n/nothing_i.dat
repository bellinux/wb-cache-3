5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing <b>nothing.</b> <b>I</b> neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|Early on, Han felt {{neglected}} and misunderstood {{by his father}}, as the elder van Meegeren strictly forbade his artistic development and constantly derided him. He was often forced by his father to write a hundred times, [...] "I know <b>nothing,</b> <b>I</b> am <b>nothing,</b> <b>I</b> am capable of nothing." [...] While attending the Higher Burger School, he met teacher and painter Bartus Korteling (1853–1930) who became his mentor. Korteling had been inspired by Johannes Vermeer and showed the young van Meegeren how Vermeer had manufactured and mixed his colours. Korteling had rejected the Impressionist movement and other modern trends as decadent, degenerate art, and his strong personal influence probably later led van Meegeren to rebuff contemporary styles and paint exclusively {{in the style of}} the Dutch Golden Age.|$|E

500|$|... "I Will Be" [...] is a {{piano and}} guitar led song, which lasts for a {{duration}} of 3 minutes, 58 seconds. The song was composed {{in the key}} of G major using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis's vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of B3 to the high note of B5, on the song. The song opens with the lyrics [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could say to you, <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could ever do to make you {{see what you mean}} to me." [...] Chad Grischow for IGN described the song's piano led instrumental to be [...] "overblown", but noted that Lewis has enough [...] "vocal strength to prevent her from being overshadowed by the drowningly lush sound." [...] Eric R. Danton wrote on his review of Spirit for the Hartford Courant daily that [...] "I Will Be" [...] begins with a [...] "spare piano introduction" [...] that [...] "blossoms into an arrangement buoyed by strings and then drums and guitar". Danton described Lewis's vocals as [...] "delicate" [...] and that [...] "take flight on the chorus".|$|E

500|$|Vanity Fair {{commented that}} [...] "it's {{hard to imagine}} that there was a time before Meryl Streep was the greatest-living actress". Emma Brockes of The Guardian notes that despite Streep's being [...] "one of the most famous actresses in the world", it is [...] "strangely hard to pin an image on Streep", in a career where she has [...] "laboured to {{establish}} herself as an actor whose roots lie in ordinary life". Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, [...] "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now which one would you like?' <b>Nothing</b> <b>I</b> can count on and that makes it more dangerous. But then the danger makes it more exciting." [...] She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.|$|E

[...] The composer sought a mix between the scores of the science fiction film [...] (1968) and the military-based comedy 1941 (1979) to create an [...] "otherworldly pastiche".

500|$|The song created {{controversy}} over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now {{know for a fact}} that you wrote [...] But there's <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> can do about it. That's all I can say about it." [...] The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer didn't steal the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} the episode was {{influenced}} by the film Casablanca, and was affected by the timing of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Because of the strike, the script was written in five days and it was only when it was filmed that it was discovered to be incomplete. Shearer was not happy with the result and felt that the on-screen chemistry of Stewart and Phillips was lacking. Reviews of the episode have been mixed, with one reviewer summing it up by saying [...] "there’s <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> can point to at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, {{when asked if}} she had been too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, [...] "We all have our standards.

[...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen, {{reviewing}} the episode for The A.V.

He also felt that there wasn't much follow up on Manheim's experiments and that he seemed to be left to cause a more serious accident in the future. Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He thought that Michele Phillips was [...] "incredibly radiant", and said, [...] "there’s <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> can point to at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes", giving it a score of four out of ten.|$|E
500|$|Francesco Algarotti's Essay on the Opera (1755) {{was a major}} {{influence}} {{in the development of}} Gluck's reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of opera seria, with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music or ballet or staging. The drama itself should [...] "delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist, Calzabigi. Calzabigi was himself a prominent advocate of reform, and he stated: [...] "If Mr Gluck was the creator of dramatic music, he did not create it from <b>nothing.</b> <b>I</b> provided him with the material or the chaos, if you like. We therefore share the honour of that creation." ...|$|E
