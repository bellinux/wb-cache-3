5000|$|Microcrystalline waxes when {{produced}} by wax refiners are typically produced {{to meet a}} number of ASTM specifications. These include congeal point (ASTM D938), <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> (D1321), color (ASTM D6045), and viscosity (ASTM D445). Microcrystalline waxes can generally be put into two categories: [...] "laminating" [...] grades and [...] "hardening" [...] grades. The laminating grades typically have a melt point of 140-175 F (60 - 80 oC) and <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> of 25 or above. The hardening grades will range from about 175-200 F (80 - 93 oC), and have a <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> of 25 or below.

50|$|A modern-day {{subcategory}} of {{this art}} form used primarily in production embroidery on automated embroidery machines {{is referred to}} as puff embroidery. The process involves putting down, typically, a layer of foam rubber larger than the intended shape on top of the target material to be decorated. The shape is then embroidered on top of the foam rubber {{in such a way that}} the <b>needle</b> <b>penetrations</b> cut the foam rubber around the periphery of the shape. When the embroidery is finished the excess foam rubber is weeded (pulled away or cleaned off) from the design area, leaving the underlying foam rubber shape trapped under the embroidery stitches resulting in a stumpwork effect.|$|R
40|$|Low {{cellular}} {{activity and}} slow tissue turnover in human tendon may prolong resolution of tendinopathy. This may be stimulated by moderate localized traumas such as <b>needle</b> <b>penetrations,</b> but whether {{this results in}} a widespread cellular response in tendons is unknown. In an initial hypothesis-generating study, a trauma-induced tendon cell activity (increased total RNA and collagen I mRNA) was observed after repeated patellar tendon biopsies in young men. In a subsequent controlled study, 25 young men were treated with two 0. 8 -mm-diameter <b>needle</b> <b>penetrations</b> [n = 13, needle-group (NG) ] or one 2. 1 -mm-diameter needle biopsy [n = 12, biopsy-group (BG) ] in one patellar tendon. Four weeks later biopsies were taken from treated (5 mm lateral from trauma site) and contralateral tendons for analyses of RNA content (ribogreen assay), DNA content (PCR based), and gene expression for relevant target genes (Real-time RT-PCR) (NG, n = 11 and BG, n = 8). Intervention increased RNA content, and mRNA expression of collagen I and III and TGF-β 1 (P < 0. 05), with biopsy treatment having greatest effect (tendency for RNA and collagen I). Results for DNA content were inconclusive, and no changes were detected in expression of insulin-like growth factor-I, connective tissue growth factor, scleraxis, decorin, fibromodulin, tenascin-C, tenomodulin, VEGFa, CD 68, IL- 6, MMP 12, and MMP 13. In conclusion, a moderate trauma to a healthy human tendon (e. g., biopsy sampling) results in a widespread upregulation of tendon cell activity and their matrix protein expression. The findings have implications for design of studies on human tendon and may provide perspectives in future treatment strategies in tendinopathy...|$|R
50|$|A quicker {{form of the}} dry enema {{utilizes}} {{the injection}} of {{a small amount of}} water-based lubricant such as KY Jelly into the rectum via a non-hypodermic syringe, such as an oral syringe, or from some other source. Then again since the glycerin itself is an effective producer of the desired contraction of the colonic muscles it is simpler - and more easily controlled - to introduce 5 - 10 cc of glycerin directly into the rectum. Specialist syringes are available for this purpose but are hard to find. An alternative is to use an enema nozzle which has an intake end which is compatible with a standard hypodermic syringe. This allows the immediate injection of the 5-10 ccs. required, and results can be expected in 2-4 minutes. Another alternative is to use a normal 5 or 10cc syringe inserted directly into the anus. This needs to be done carefully to avoid scratching the anal passage. The passage should be lubricated with sorbolene cream or any water-based lubricant. Only a syringe with a Luer-slip should be used, not a Luer-lock tip (a syringe end molded to take a screw-on <b>needle).</b> <b>Penetration</b> is better performed by the patient to eliminate any pain. The patient should be encouraged to wait at least 15 minutes in order that peristalsis can reach the full length of the rectum, but many will find this impossible and this treatment should therefore be applied only when the facilities to evacuate are nearby.|$|E
50|$|Physicians are {{frequently}} exposed to people experiencing pain due to injury or illness, or have to inflict pain {{during the course}} of treatment. Physicians have to regulate their emotional response to this stimuli in order to effectively help the patient and maintain their own personal well being. Pain empathy can motivate an individual to help someone who is in pain, but repeated exposure to individuals in pain with no ability to regulate emotional arousal can cause distress. One study sought to determine if physicians had an altered response to viewing painful stimuli. Physicians and control subjects watched video clips of a stranger being poked with a needle into the hands or feet. fMRI was used to measure the hemodynamic activity within the brain while viewing the painful stimuli. The fMRI revealed that brain areas involved in the pain matrix: somatosensory cortex, anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulated nucleus (dACC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) were activated in the control subject population when viewing the <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> videos. The physicians had activation of higher order executive functioning in the brain as shown by activation of the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, both involved in self-regulation, and activation of the precentral, superior parietal, and temporoparietal junction, involved with executive attention. The physicians did not have activation of the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulated nucleus (dACC), or the periaqueductal gray (PAG). The study concluded that physicians adapt to the healthcare environment by down regulating their automatic empathetic response to patient’s pain.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to predict the <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> force in denim fabrics based on sewing {{parameters}} by using the fuzzy logic (FL) model. Moreover, the performance of fuzzy logic model is compared with that of the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> force was measured on the Instron tensile tester. In order to plan the fuzzy logic model, the sewing needle size, number of fabric layers and fabric weight were taken into account as input parameters. The output parameter is <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> force. In addition, the same parameters and data are used in artificial neural network model. The results indicate that the <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> force can be predicted in terms of sewing parameters by using the fuzzy logic model. The difference between performance of fuzzy logic and neural network models is not meaningful (RFL= 0. 971 and RANN= 0. 982). It is concluded that soft computing models such as fuzzy logic and artificial neural network can be utilized to forecast the <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> force in denim fabrics. Using the fuzzy logic model for predicting the <b>needle</b> <b>penetration</b> force in denim fabrics can help the garment manufacturer to acquire better knowledge about the sewing process.

40|$|Our {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that needling in Baihui, Shuigou and Shenmen enhances glucose metabolism in the frontal lobes, thalamus, temporal lobe, and the lentiform nucleus in vascular dementia. This study examined the effect of true, sham and overt needling in Waiguan (TE 5) on cerebral changes by positron emission tomography (PET) technique. Eighteen healthy volunteers were randomized to receive overt control, true or sham needling therapy. To manipulate true needling, a needle was inserted into 15 +/- 2 mm into Waiguan and "deqi" was achieved by proper needle manipulation. For sham needling, needles with a blunt tip were pushed against the skin as the shaft moved into the handle, giving an illusion of insertion. For overt placebo, blunt needles were used and subjects did not receive any <b>needling</b> <b>penetration.</b> The tracer used was (18) fluoride-deoxygluocse. PET images obtained were processed and analyzed by the SPM 2 software. Compared with overt needling, brain areas BA 7, 13, 18, 19, 21, 22, 27, 38, 40, 42 and 45 in Waiguan true needling group were significantly activated and areas BA 4, 6, 7, 19, 22 and 41 in sham needling group showed obvious activation.
