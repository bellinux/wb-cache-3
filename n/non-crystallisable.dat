40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was carried}} out regarding the structure and properties of segmented block copolymers with either <b>non-crystallisable</b> or crystallisable rigid segments. The flexible segment in the block copolymers was a linear poly(propylene oxide) end capped with poly(ethylene oxide), with a segment molecular weight of 2300 g/mol. The rigid segments were either <b>non-crystallisable</b> or monodisperse crystallisable polyamides of varying lengths. The morphologies were studied by TEM and AFM, the thermal mechanical properties by DMA and the elastic properties by compression set and tensile measurements. A direct comparison was made of segmented block copolymers with either liquid–liquid demixed or crystallised structures. The crystallised amide segments were more efficient in increasing the modulus and improving the elastic properties than the <b>non-crystallisable</b> ones. The copolymers with crystallised structures were transparent, had a low glass transition temperature of the polyether phase and a modulus that was independent of temperature between Tg and Tm. These copolymers also displayed a very low loss factor (tan δ), suggesting excellent dynamic properties. The hard phase in segmented block copolymers should thus preferably be crystalline...|$|E
40|$|Poly(propylene oxide) based polyether(ester-amide) s (PEEA) with <b>non-crystallisable</b> amide {{segments}} were synthesized {{and their}} structure–property relations studied. These model segmented block copolymers {{were used to}} gain insight in the structure–property relations of block copolymers with liquid–liquid demixed morphologies, also present in segmented polyurethanes. The poly(propylene oxide) used had a molecular weight of 2300 g/mol and was end capped with 20 wt% ethylene oxide. The <b>non-crystallisable</b> amide segments are based on an amorphous polyamide: poly(m-xylylene isophthalamide) and the repetitive length (x) of the amide segment was varied from 1 to 10. Phase separation in these PEEA's occurred by liquid–liquid demixing when the length (x) of the <b>non-crystallisable</b> amide segment was higher than 2 (x> 2). TEM experiments showed spherical structures at two size scales, 5 – 10 nm domains (nano-domains) and 30 – 500 nm domains (sub-micron domains), both dispersed in a polyether matrix. The size and volume fraction of these spherical domains were found to increase with increasing the amide segment length. The modulus of the materials increased moderately with increasing amide segment content (increasing amide segment length x). The compression and tensile sets values of these PEEA's were found to decrease with increasing amide segment length, thus these PEEA's behave also more elastic at longer amide contents (thus also at higher modulus). Giving time these liquid–liquid demixed segmented block copolymers recovered completely...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of montmorillonite (MMT) silicate layers on the semicrystalline morphology {{development of the}} poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),matrix of PEO/MMT nanocomposites has been investigated by using X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, light microscopy and time-resolved simultaneous small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. The silicate layers act as nucleating agents for the crystallization of PEO, but at high content, also have a retarding effect oil the crystal growth. In that case they are <b>non-crystallisable</b> barriers in the crystallization of the PEO matrix. The lamellar semicrystalline structures of pure PEO and the PEO/MMT nanocomposites, are, however, identical. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} the fatigue crack growth in a carbon black-filled styrene {{butadiene}} rubber (CB-SBR) under fully relaxing loading conditions. More precisely, it {{is devoted to the}} determination of the scenario of crack growth. For that purpose, an original ‘microcutting’ technique, previously applied by the authors on natural rubber (NR), is used to observe microscopic phenomena involved in fatigue crack growth thanks to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results show that the crack tip grows following a tearing line by generating ligaments; it explains the differences between fatigue responses of crystallisable and <b>non-crystallisable</b> rubbers during crack propagation. So, contrary to crystallisable elastomers such as NR, the microstructure of SBR is similar at crack tip and in the bulk material, and the crack tip does not resist crack propagation. Moreover, the morphology of fracture surfaces only depends on particles encountered by the fatigue crack during its propagation...|$|E
40|$|Relationships {{between the}} {{macroscopic}} deformation behaviour and microstructure of a pure (PBT-b-PTMO) block copolymer and a polymer nanocomposite (PBT-b-PTMO + 0. 2 wt% SWCNT) were investigated by simultaneous small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) during tensile deformation using synchrotron radiation. The Young's modulus {{was found to}} be 15 % higher for the nanocomposite than for the pure block copolymer as well as the yield strength, while the elongation-to-break was less than a half. This different behaviour can be explained by taking into account the different structural features revealed by SAXS and WAXS and thus considering that SWCNT act as anchors in the nanocomposite, sharing the applied stress with the PBT crystals and partially preventing the flexible, <b>non-crystallisable</b> PTMO chains to elongate. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
