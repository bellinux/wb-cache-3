The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify probation officers' ideologies of crime and to describe the aims and factors which are associated with the different recommendations probation officers make in their social inquiry reports. Main Topics : Variables a) Structured Questionnaire Probation officers' role in the courts, functions in social inquiry reports and observations about punishment and treatment in sentencing. Aims and factors in different recommendations. Likert scale, including statements about explanations for offence behaviour. b) Standardised Social Inquiry Reports Six 'mock' social inquiry reports were given to respondents.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{domestic}} violence shelter workers ’ per-ceptions of child maltreatment reporting. A sample of 82 professionals from domestic violence shelters across the United States participated in a survey focusing on a variety of different types of reports and the frequency of both positive and negative outcomes arising from these reports. Possible outcomes included in the study are damage to the relationship between the worker and the battered woman, disempowerment of the battered woman, discouragement from seeking further help, protection of the child, further traumatization of the child, further disruption to the family, and damage to the woman’s likelihood of main-taining custody. Significant differences in perceived impact are found based on identity of abuser (spousal batterer vs. battered woman) and <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>report</b> (child as witness to domestic violence vs. child as victim of abuse). These results point to the complexity of perceptions regarding the impact of reporting...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} on the {{influence}} of mass communication on social change: a study of press reports on child labour and women trafficking. The study is aimed at addressing the problem of child labour and women trafficking in Rivers State. A total of 16 press reports were collected through purposive sampling from Rivers State University of Science and Technology Library and Newspaper morgues. These press reports on child labour and women trafficking were studied for 10 months at an interval of 2 months from September 2003 – June 2004. The press reports collected was content analyzed to determine their <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>report.</b> All the press reports analyzed were favourable, they were in support of the fight against child labour and women trafficking; that government agencies, non-governmental organizations and the media {{have a role to play}} in putting an end to child labour and women trafficking; that child labour and women trafficking persist because parents and children are not adequately educated on the dangers of child labour and women trafficking;. From the summary of the finding, it was discovered that, some parents see their children as source of income because of poverty and ignorance, that majority of victims of child labour and women trafficking are born to parents of lower class. The researcher then recommends that the government agencies, non-governmental organizations and the media should join forces to educate the masses on the dangers of engaging in child labour and women trafficking and the suffering of trafficked children...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the distorted <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> press <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> English and Welsh homicides. We investigated the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> 2, 685 homicides in England and Wales in three national newspapers: The Times, the Mail and the Mirror {{in the period}} 1993 – 97. By systematically charting the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> distortions, we explore the contribution of newspapers to {{the social construction of}} homicide. The study analysed a wide range of variables to explain homicide story salience: the circumstance of the killing was found to {{play a crucial role in}} whether a homicide is reported, with sexual homicides and motiveless acts being more likely to be reported. Homicides involving young children are highly likely to be reported, but infant homicides are not. These public narratives construct homicide differently to the reality of illegal killing, highlighting particular versions of ‘otherness’ and danger. Such distorted contributions to framing criminological problems may, we argue, foster political and social responses to homicide that are not based on statistical reality but media representations of reality...|$|R

Findings indicate that one fourth {{of the participants in}} the sample were sexually harassed, assaulted students are extremely unlikely to officially report incidents, and measures of routine activities theory are important predictors of sexual harassment. Prevention and education policies should focus on increased reporting to university authorities and helping students understand the situa-tional contexts in which these behaviors are likely to occur...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Fetuin-A is a {{circulating}} inhibitor of ectopic calcification. Low plasma {{levels have}} been associated in some studies with increased vascular calcification, aortic stiffness and mortality in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). However, there are other studies examining the association of fetuin-A with vascular parameters and mortality, which do not show these associations. These conflicting data {{may be explained by}} methodological differences. METHODS We compared plasma fetuin-A measurements made with two widely-used commercial fetuin-A ELISA kits (Biovendor, Modrice, Czech Republic; Epitope Diagnostics Inc., San Diego, US) in samples from patients with and without CKD. We evaluated the effect of differences in fetuin-A glycosylation status on assay specificity. RESULTS Deming regression analysis showed poor agreement between methods (for CKD cohort: y=- 0. 05 + 2. 52 x, S(y|x) = 0. 099 g/L, R(2) = 0. 694). The Epitope Diagnostics kit demonstrated significant positive bias and greater specificity for deglycosylated fetuin-A relative to the Biovendor assay. CONCLUSION The apparently contradictory <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> the association of fetuin-A with biological variables may reflect differences in the specificity of different ELISA methods for glycosylated plasma fetuin-A...|$|R
