5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces of lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried cheesecloth yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated {{failure to do so}} with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in {{the last part of the}} game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Dispatched to France in February 1915, the Canadian Division {{was briefly}} {{initiated}} to trench warfare {{on the periphery}} of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle before being attached to the British 2nd Army under Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien in the Belgian town of Ypres. It was in front of Ypres on 22 April that the Canadians bore the brunt of the most furious German attack of the year. In the afternoon at 5.00 pm the Germans began heavy shelling of the French trenches and the Canadians and the French Algerian troops stationed <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> saw a fog traveling across no-mans land, covering the advance of German forces. The fog was chlorine gas, the first occasion in which this substance had been used in warfare. The Algerians broke and fled, suffering over 6,000 casualties in a matter of minutes and the Canadians were consequently forced to defend twice the length of their front line in the face of a new and deadly weapon. Although the Canadian Division held on for more than two days, much ground was lost and the division had themselves suffered over 50% casualties, nearly 6,000 men.|$|E

25|$|Civil {{inattention}} {{is defined}} as the polite way to manage interaction with strangers by not engaging in any interpersonal communication or needing to respond to a stranger’s touch. Goffman uses an elevator study to explain this phenomenon.

In fact, prefixed prepositions and proclitics {{are separated from}} the nouns <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> to improve the tokenization of the dialects, the word beginning with il and the il- determinant are differentiated by adding a hyphen to the determinant, all emphatic letters are represented to avoid difficulties in vowel transcription, the suffix of the conjugation of verbs in present in plural and the singular third person direct object pronouns are differentiated by transcribing them differently, and the transcriptions of glottal stop and of Ta Marbūṭa are simplified.|$|E
25|$|Gloom (Blue Heart) - Peach will cry, {{causing a}} cartoonish amount of tears to {{steadily}} stream out {{in both directions}} around her as she dashes forward. The stream of tears that gets scattered while she is crying {{can also be used}} to water certain obstacles, such as helping a small sprout grow into a long tall plant which she can use to climb and reach higher places. When the tears hit the ground, ceiling or walls, sparkles appear beneath, above or <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> This power can defeat the Nipper Plants and Cheep-Cheeps, extinguish flames, strike all blocks at once, wash away Blooper's ink on the ground, push heavy chained balls and inflicted enemies.|$|E

25|$|Kupcinet {{apparently}} {{went straight}} home after dining with her friends. She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward. The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9:30 pm. They told detectives they watched TV, including The Danny Kaye Show, with Kupcinet. They all drank coffee until she fell asleep, sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> on the couch. She awoke {{and went to}} her room. The men either turned the TV set off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume), and made sure {{the door was locked}} behind them before departing at about 11:15 pm. Hathaway said Rubin and he returned to his place and were later joined by Kupcinet's boyfriend, Andrew Prine, who was also Hathaway's neighbor. The three young men watched television and talked until around 3:00 am.|$|E
25|$|More residences were built, {{primarily}} to be rented to lawyers and legislators {{working in the}} capitol and the courts. The city began to expand and annex surrounding land to handle its growth. The opening of the Erie Canal in the 1820s {{and the development of}} railroads in later decades made the city a transportation hub, and as its commercial power and the state's grew it assumed more political importance. Smaller buildings remained the norm along the side streets, with churches springing up <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Richard Upjohn's French Gothic St. Peter's Episcopal Church on State, finished in 1860, is considered one of his best churches. Another church, St. Mary's, by the local firm of Nicholls and Brown, became the focal point of a neighborhbood of small houses on and near Lodge Street. Richard Upjohn's French Gothic St. Peter's Episcopal Church on State, finished in 1860, is considered one of his best churches.|$|E
25|$|Images of {{children}} {{on the path to}} destruction also litter the scene: aside from the dead baby on the spike and the child falling to its death, a baby is quieted by its mother with a cup of gin, and in the background of the scene an orphaned infant bawls naked on the floor as the body of its mother is loaded into a coffin on orders of the beadle. Two young girls who are wards of the parish of St Giles—indicated by the badge on the arm of one of the girls—each take a glass. Hogarth also chose the slum of St Giles as setting for the first scene of The Four Stages of Cruelty, which he issued almost simultaneously with Beer Street and Gin Lane. Tom Nero, the central character of the Cruelty series wears an identical arm badge. In front of the pawnbroker's door a starving boy and a dog fight over a bone, while <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> a girl has fallen asleep; approaching her is a snail, emblematic of the sin of sloth.|$|E
