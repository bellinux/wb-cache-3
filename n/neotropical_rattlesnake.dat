40|$|The black-tailed {{rattlesnake}} (Crotalus molossus Baird and Girard, 1853) is {{a wide-ranging}} species complex {{with representatives from}} the southwestern United States through the highlands of central and southern Mexico. The systematics of this group has received little attention {{and in the past}} six decades only two taxonomic revisions have been proposed (the transfer of C. basiliscus oaxacus to C. molossus and the elevation of C. m. estebanensis to full species). However, a recent revision of the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (C. durissus and C. simus) recovered a polyphyletic C. molossus. Sequenced data were obtained from three mitochondrial genes (ATPases 8 and 6, cyt b and ND 4) and three nuclear genes (c-mos, EXPH 5 and RAG 1) to examine phylogenetic relationships among C. molossus lineages and the closely related species C. basiliscus and C. totonacus. Results recovered strong support for two deeply divergent and polyphyletic northern C. molossus lineages that are morphologically distinct. Biogeographical patterns and divergence dates inferred from mitochondrial data suggest the diversification of C. molossus {{is the result of a}} Neogene vicariance event associated with uplift of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Population-level analyses suggested that major lineages of C. molossus have been stable since their initial divergence. On the basis of morphological and molecular evidence I propose that the synonym Crotalus ornatus Hallowell, 1854 be resurrected and applied to populations in the Chihuahuan Desert and central Texas. This thesis represents the most complete phylogenetic analysis of any member of the C. molossus group and demonstrates discordance between the contemporary taxonomy of the group and its true diversity. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{comparative}} venomic and antivenomic {{characterization of the}} venoms of newborn and adult specimens of the Central American rattlesnake, Crotalus simus, and of the subspecies cumanensis, durissus, ruruima, and terrificus of South American Crotalus durissus. Neonate and adult C. simus share about 50 % of their venom proteome. The venom proteome of 6 -week-old C. simus is predominantly made of the neurotoxic heterodimeric phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 crotoxin) (55. 9 %) and serine proteinases (36 %), whereas snake venom Zn 2 +-metalloproteinases (SVMPs), exclusively of class PIII, represent only 2 % of the total venom proteins. In marked contrast, venom from adult C. simus comprises toxins from 7 protein families. A large proportion (71. 7 %) of these toxins are SVMPs, two-thirds of which belong to the PIII class. These toxin profiles correlate well with the overall biochemical and pharmacological features of venoms from adult (hemorrhagic) and newborn (neurotoxic) C. simus specimens. The venoms of the South American Crotalus subspecies belong {{to one of two}} distinct phenotypes. C. d. cumanensis exhibits high levels of SVMPs and low lethal potency (LD 50), whereas C. d. subspecies terrificus, ruruima, and durissus have low SVMP activity and high neurotoxicity to mice. Their overall toxin compositions explain the outcome of envenomation by these species. Further, in all C. simus and C. durissus venoms, the concentration of neurotoxins (crotoxin and crotamine) is directly related with lethal activity, whereas lethality and metalloproteinase activity show an inverse relationship. The similar venom toxin profiles of newborn C. simus and adult C. durissus terrificus, ruruima, and durissus subspecies strongly suggests that the South American taxa have retained juvenile venom characteristics in the adult form (paedomorphism) along their North−South stepping-stone dispersal. The driving force behind paedomorphism is often competition or predation pressure. The increased concentration of the neurotoxins crotoxin and crotamine in South American rattlesnake venoms strongly argues that the gain of neurotoxicity and lethal venom activities to mammals may have represented the key axis along which overall venom toxicity has evolved during Crotalus durissus invasion of South America. The paedomorphic trend is supported by a decreasing LNC (lethal neurotoxicity coefficient, defined as the ratio between the average LD 50 of the venom and the crotoxin + crotamine concentration) along the North−South axis, coincident with the evolutionary dispersal pattern of the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>rattlesnakes.</b> The indistinguisable immunoreactivity patterns of Costa Rican and Venezuelan polyvalent antivenoms toward C. simus and C. durissus venoms strongly suggest the possibility of using these antivenoms indistinctly for the management of snakebites by adult C. simus and by certain C. d. cumanensis populations exhibiting a hemorrhagic venom phenotype. The antivenomic results also explain why the antivenoms effectively neutralize the hemorrhagic activity of adult C. simus venoms but does not protect against adult C. durissus sp. and newborn C. simus envenomations. The identification of evolutionary trends among tropical Crotalus, as reported here, may have an impact in defining the mixture of venoms for immunization to produce an effective pan-American anti-Crotalus antivenom.

50|$|The venomous snakes in Belize can {{be split}} into two {{different}} categorical families: the Viperidae, and the Elapidae. The Viperidae of Belize contains pit vipers such as rattlesnakes, lanceheads, and the cantils. Most of the venomous snakes in Belize are in this family. Some of the specific species found in Belize are the Fer-de-Lance, (Bothrops asper) which can grow up to 2.5 m (8 ft) in length, the Eyelash Viper (Bothriechis shlegelii), which can grow up to 1 m (3 ft), and the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus durissus), with can reach a length of 1.5 m (5 ft).|$|E
40|$|Two disjunct {{distributional}} {{areas of}} Crotalus durissus (<b>Neotropical</b> <b>rattlesnake)</b> are in open habitats {{north and south}} of the Amazon Basin and are presently separated by humid rainforest habitats. We used ecological niche modeling to identify and investigate potential dispersal pathways for this species between the two areas during the late Pleistocene. Niches estimated for the two populations did not differ significantly. Our analyses indicated two possible, but a single most likely, potential routes of dispersal during the last glacial cycle. These results are important to understanding the history of Amazon Basin humid forest biotas, as they suggest agents of isolation among putative humid forest refugia in the form of dry forest and scrub, and associated biotas...|$|E
40|$|Pleistocene {{fragmentation}} of the Amazonian rainforest has been hypothesized {{to be a major}} cause of Neotropical speciation and diversity. However, the role and even the reality of Pleistocene forest refugia have attracted much scepticism. In Amazonia, previous phylo-geographical studies have focused mostly on organisms found in the forests themselves, and generally found speciation events to have predated the Pleistocene. However, molecular studies of open-formation taxa found both north and south of the Amazonian forests, prob-ably because of vicariance resulting from expansion of the rainforests, may provide novel insights into the age of continuous forest cover across the Amazon basin. Here, we analyse three mitochondrial genes to infer the phylogeography of one such trans-Amazonian vicar-iant, the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus durissus), which occupies primarily seasonal formations from Mexico to Argentina, but avoids the rainforests of Central and tropical South America. The phylogeographical pattern is consistent with gradual dispersal along the Central American Isthmus, followed by more rapid dispersal into and across Sout...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{quantitative}} {{patterns of}} acid (APA), basic (APB), puromycin-sensitive (APN-PS) and puromycin-insensitive neutral (APN-PI), cystyl (CAP), dipeptidyl IV (DPPIV), type- 1 pyroglutamyl (PAP-I) and prolylimino (PIP) aminopeptidases and prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) activities in soluble (SF) and solubilized membrane-bound (MF) fractions from ductus deferens, vagina and uterus were studied {{to evaluate their}} relationships with the reproductive cycle and the extensive long-term spermatozoa storage (LTSS) of the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> Crotalus durissus terrificus. APB, PIP and POP were detected only in SF, while other peptidases were detected in SF and MF. APB, APN-PI and APN-PS were predominant in most tissues in all seasons. Peptidase activities had a common pattern of increment {{during the dry season}} (winter/autumn), which coincides with the mating period (autumn) and LTSS in the female (winter), as well as the reduction of spermatozoa motility and maintenance of fertilization capacity of spermatozoa. The high CAP activity in the soluble fraction of the vagina during winter, compared to summer (time of parturition) and spring, coincides with the relaxation of this tissue. In the soluble fraction, the low PAP- 1 activity of the ductus deferens coincided with its high activity in the vagina during the winter; and the inverse occurred in summer, which is consistent with the physiological process of preserving spermatozoon viability. In conclusion, the studied peptidase activities had seasonal and tissue-specific characteristics, which suggest a relevant role in the reproductive physiology of C. d. terrificus.

40|$|Due to {{the extreme}} {{variation}} of venom, which consequently results in drastically variable degrees of neutralization by CroFab antivenom, the management and treatment of envenoming by Crotalus oreganus helleri (the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake), {{one of the most}} medically significant snake species in all of North America, has been a clinician 2 ̆ 7 s nightmare. This snake has also been the subject of sensational news stories regarding supposed rapid (within the last few decades) evolution of its venom. This research demonstrates {{for the first time that}} variable evolutionary selection pressures sculpt the intraspecific molecular diversity of venom components in C. o. helleri. We show that myotoxic beta-defensin peptides (aka: crotamines/small basic myotoxic peptides) are secreted in large amounts by all populations. However, the mature toxin-encoding nucleotide regions evolve under the constraints of negative selection, likely as a result of their non-specific mode of action which doesn 2 ̆ 7 t enforce them to follow the regime of the classic predator prey chemical arms race. The hemorrhagic and tissue destroying snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) were secreted in larger amounts by the Catalina Island and Phelan rattlesnake populations, in moderate amounts in the Loma Linda population and in only trace levels by the Idyllwild population. Only the Idyllwild population in the San Jacinto Mountains contained potent presynaptic neurotoxic phospholipase A(2) complex characteristic of Mohave Rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus) and <b>Neotropical</b> <b>Rattlesnake</b> (Crotalus durissus terrificus). The derived heterodimeric lectin toxins characteristic of viper venoms, which exhibit a diversity of biological activities, including anticoagulation, agonism/antagonism of platelet activation, or procoagulation, appear to have evolved under extremely variable selection pressures. While most lectin alpha- and beta-chains evolved rapidly under the influence of positive Darwinian selection, the beta-chain lectin of the Catalina Island population appears to have evolved under the constraint of negative selection. Both lectin chains were conspicuously absent in both the proteomics and transcriptomics of the Idyllwild population. Thus, we not only highlight the tremendous biochemical diversity in C. o. venom-arsenal, but we also show that they experience remarkably variable strengths of evolutionary selection pressures, within each toxin class among populations and among toxin classes within each population. The mapping of geographical venom variation not only provides additional information regarding venom evolution, but also has direct medical implications by allowing prediction of the clinical effects of rattlesnake bites from different regions. Such information, however, also points to these highly variable venoms as being a rich source of novel toxins which may ultimately prove to be useful in drug design and development...|$|E
