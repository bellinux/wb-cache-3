25|$|There are ten {{cervical}} vertebrae in {{the neck}} of Xingxiulong. The proatlas, an atrophied vertebra positioned {{in front of the}} atlas, is bounded in front by top sides of the foramen magnum. While it is difficult to say much about the atlas itself due to damage, the immediately following axis has a relatively short centrum, which is slightly compressed on its sides and bottom. Overall, the remainder of the cervical vertebrae are relatively short, being only 2.5 to 3 times {{as long as they are}} tall; they become increasingly shorter towards the back of the <b>neck,</b> <b>like</b> Lufengosaurus. Other basal sauropodomorphs, including Jingshanosaurus, have cervical vertebrae that are generally 3 to 4 times as long as they are tall. On the bottom of the centra of cervical vertebrae 4-9, there is a prominent keel as in Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, and other basal sauropodomorphs. Near the back of the neck, the neural spines become somewhat table-like.|$|E
500|$|Horned dinosaurs mainly {{differ from}} each other in their horns, which are located on the snout and above the eyes, and in the large skull frill, which covers the <b>neck</b> <b>like</b> a shield. Achelousaurus {{exhibited}} the build of derived ("advanced") centrosaurines, which are typified by short brow horns or bosses, combined with elaborate frill spikes. The general frill proportions are typically centrosaurine, with a wide rounded squamosal bone at the side, which expanded towards the rear. It also shares the typical frill curvature with a top surface that is [...] from side to side and concave from front to rear.|$|E
500|$|His son William {{took over}} {{the running of the}} Eday estate in due course, but it became {{burdened}} with debt. In 1601 when Edward was [...] "an auld decrepit man... aged 100 or thereby" [...] William attempted to sell the family interest to George Sinclair the Earl of Caithness. The new proprietor sent half a dozen boatloads of [...] "vagabondis, broken Highland men of Caithness" [...] to Eday, much to the alarm of the notorious Earl Patrick of Orkney. Earl Patrick was able to use the poor relationship between the elderly father Edward and his son, (the former claiming William fired muskets at him and grabbed him by the <b>neck</b> <b>like</b> a dog) to take action. Acting, so he alleged, on behalf of Edward, Earl Patrick evicted William, took the Eday the rents for himself and profited from the extraction of building stone from Towback quarry.|$|E

2500|$|First attested in English in 1785, {{the word}} camelopardalis comes from Latin, {{and it is}} the romanization of the Greek [...] "καμηλοπάρδαλις" [...] meaning [...] "giraffe", from [...] "κάμηλος" [...] (kamēlos), [...] "camel" [...] + [...] "πάρδαλις" [...] (pardalis), [...] "leopard", due to its having a long <b>neck</b> <b>like</b> a camel and spots like a leopard.|$|E
2500|$|The Mexicans, naturally, were {{fearful of}} the ever-encroaching Americans, and on several {{occasions}} feelings ran high between the suspicious neighbors. In 1828, for example, when the Miller County militia was called out to remove the Shawnees from Pecan Point, Mexican officials reminded the Arkansans that the area was claimed by Mexico. Arkansas Adjutant General Rector warned the Mexicans not to interfere. Rector threatened to hang the Mexicans officials [...] "on a tree by the <b>neck</b> <b>like</b> a dog." [...] Two years later the Mexicans rubbed salt in the wounded pride of the Arkansans by threatening to move Mexicans settlers into the disputed Miller County area.|$|E
2500|$|The mob {{led them}} into woods {{and stopped at}} a spring. It does not appear {{that it was the}} {{intention}} of all in the mob to kill them. James Faucett told them; [...] "I want you men to understand that I am the captain of this party, and that if we ever again find you {{in this part of the}} country we will hang you by the <b>neck</b> <b>like</b> dogs." [...] According to Clawson, after an hour of [...] "desultory conversation… of which the vilest accusations were laid against the [...] "Mormons," [...] the beastly talk of the mobbers," [...] three men who had left on horseback returned and directed Standing and Clawson to go with them.|$|E

The mikoshi-nyūdō that has been depicted under the title [...] "Mikoshi" [...] in the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō by Sekien Toriyama (refer to image) is depicted covered by the shadow of a large tree, and its neck has become long, but since this is its appearance to people looking from behind, {{it does not mean that}} it is emphasizing the length of its <b>neck</b> <b>like</b> that of a rokurokubi.|$|E

2500|$|Zupaysaurus was a {{medium-sized}} theropod. An adult skull, measured approximately [...] in length, suggesting a body length of approximately [...] from its snout {{to the tip}} of its tail. Other estimates suggest that Zupaysaurus was at best [...] long and weighed [...] at most. Like all theropods, Zupaysaurus walked only on its hindlegs, leaving its forelimbs free to grasp its prey. The length of the neck bones recovered suggests that this genus has a rather long <b>neck.</b> <b>Like</b> the coelophysoids, Zupaysaurus has a kink in its snout, between the premaxillary and maxillary bones of the upper jaw. It is estimated that Zupaysaurus had 24 teeth and an intermandibular hinge is present in the lower jaw. Only one specimen of Zupaysaurus is known to science. The holotype specimen was designated PULR-076, which consists of a nearly complete skull which was very well preserved, the right shoulder girdle, the lower right leg and ankle, and twelve vertebrae from the neck, back, and hips. Additional material of a smaller individual found at the same site may or may not belong to Zupaysaurus.|$|E
50|$|Their necks {{were also}} {{extremely}} long. According to recent computer simulations, {{they may not}} have been able to lift their <b>necks</b> <b>like</b> other sauropods. However, these simulations do not take vertebral cartilage into account, which would likely allow a greater range of motion. Instead of reaching up into trees, they may have used their necks to graze over a broad area. They may also have used their necks to reach into dense stands of conifers, or over marshy ground.|$|R

2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a <b>neck</b> <b>like</b> a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out and presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. [...] Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun in his hand, in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. [...] Eleven were killed in the hole. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, “but you would not have thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. [...] He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. [...] Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.” [...] When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. [...] The Indian replied in Lakota, “American Horse.” [...] Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, “No quarter!’, but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said,‘Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. [...] I can yet use them to good advantage. [...] "Tell the chief,“ he said turning to Grouard, [...] "that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.” [...] “This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. [...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} {{of the origin of}} the city, but the most likely is a version by Tamilla Khalilova. Since the 7th century, conquest of the South Caucasus by Arabs began. According to historical data the Arabs reached a territory of present Qusar Rayon. According to the historians version name of the river is originated from Arabian Al-Qausar. In translation from the Quran into English “Al Qausar - in translation means a river of abundance, that is a heaven river, water of which is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its fragrance is nicer than musk and birds with beautiful long <b>necks</b> <b>like</b> <b>necks</b> of camels fly around it.” The settlement got its name from the river - Qusar. Modern historians believe that the name Qusar derives from khisar.|$|R
