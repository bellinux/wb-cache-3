5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's <b>not</b> <b>cool</b> or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
25|$|Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} {{occurred within}} the first three minutes {{of the beginning of}} the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of 1H (protium), 2H (D, deuterium), 3He (helium-3), and 4He (helium-4). Although 4He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and alpha decays and trace amounts of 1H continue to be produced by spallation and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The nuclei of these elements, along with some 7Li and 7Be are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial quark–gluon plasma froze out to form protons and neutrons. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than beryllium (or possibly boron) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did <b>not</b> <b>cool</b> to the state of neutral atoms until much later.|$|E

At one point, while trying to persuade Leslie to include Twilight in the capsule, Kelly Larson begins telling the entire story of the Twilight series, including Meyer's birth and life story and shot-for-shot descriptions of the film adaptations. The stories are told from the perspective of high school student and outsider Bella Swan, who is pursued romantically by a vampire named Edward Cullen and a werewolf named Jacob Black. Elements of the story are raised in various scenes of [...] "Time Capsule", including when Tom tries to ask Lucy why she broke up with him: [...] "Is it because I'm <b>not</b> <b>cool</b> enough, like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward-Bella-Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more?" [...] Leslie claims to favor Harry Potter, the popular fantasy series by author J.K.

He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] a nice little touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, <b>not</b> <b>cool</b> enough", and felt her inclusion {{was an attempt to}} trade on the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason {{of the quality of the}} show. Closing, he said [...] "it split [...] sides".|$|E

[...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's <b>not</b> <b>cool</b> to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable.

500|$|The {{licensing}} arm of Paramount {{took the}} step of significantly expanding retail distribution beyond specialty stores (Hot Topic, Spencer's) to big chains (Target, J.C. Penney), which involved carefully stripping T-shirts of racy slogans {{from the television}} show. Licensing industry observers credited Comedy Central with carving out a profitable niche in an industry dominated by powerful partnerships that link fast-food chains and Hollywood movie studios, which was particularly tough for South Park, as no fast-food chains wanted to ally themselves with the show's racy content. Eventually, J.C. Penney ended the tie-ins with the show in April 1999 {{as a result of}} customer complaints. On July 7, 1999, Parker and Stone appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote the film's release. During the interview, Parker and Stone showed a clip of the film in which a caricature of O'Brien, played by Brett Spiner, hands over Terrence and Phillip to the US government and jumps to his death from the set of Late Night. Upon seeing the clip, a bemused O'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was [...] "really funny", but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as {{on the top floor of}} the GE Building, when it was really on the sixth floor. The film also suffered negative publicity before release. It was initially reported that on the day of the Columbine High School massacre, a friend of the killers (Chris Morris) was seen wearing a black T-shirt depicting characters from South Park. Both Parker and Stone come from Colorado, and Stone went to Heritage High School, not far from Columbine High. He proceeded to take three days off from work following the shootings. [...] "Nothing seemed funny after that," [...] he said. South Park was, at the time, generally waning in popularity: ratings dropped nearly 40 percent with the premiere of the series' third season and, according to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "it [...] the pop-culture behemoth it was last year [...]" [...] In response to the decline, Parker commented, [...] "Suddenly we suck and we're <b>not</b> <b>cool</b> anymore.
