5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E

25|$|A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration {{study showed}} that rider lean has a larger {{influence}} on a lighter motorcycle than a heavier one, which helps explain why no-hands steering is less effective on heavy motorcycles. Leaning the torso {{with respect to the}} bike does not cause the bike to lean far enough to generate anything but the shallowest turns. No-hands riders may be able to keep a heavy bike centered in a lane and negotiate shallow highway turns, but <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Melville's {{paternal}} grandfather died on September 16, 1832, {{it emerged}} that Allan had borrowed {{more than his}} share of the inheritance, and Maria Melville consequently received only $20. The grandmother died on April 12, 1833. Melville did his job well at the bank; though he was only fourteen in 1834, the bank considered him competent enough to be sent to Schenectady on an errand. <b>Not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> is known from this period, except that he was very fond of drawing. The visual arts became a lifelong interest.|$|E

On 14 May 2009, BT said it was cutting up to 15,000 jobs {{in the coming year}} after it announced its results for the year to 31 March 2009. Then in July 2009, BT offered workers a long holiday for an up front sum of 25% of their annual wage or a one-off payment of £1000 if they agree to go part-time.|$|E

25|$|Rundstedt {{believed}} even at {{this stage}} that an effective defensive line could only be established on the Rhine, but this would have meant giving up large areas of German territory, and Hitler would not countenance it. He insisted that a stand {{be made on the}} West Wall (known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line), a defensive system built along Germany's western frontiers in 1938–40, but partly dismantled in 1943–44 to provide materials for the Atlantic Wall. Model told OKW that this would require 25 divisions of fresh troops, but these were no longer to be had. Instead the line was held by patched-up divisions escaping from the debacle in France, and Volksgrenadier divisions made up from transferred Navy and Air Force personnel, older men and teenagers: these units were fit for static defence, but <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a 6 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this is not}} nearly as bad an episode as many people are making it out to be, but it’s not exactly a sterling piece of work, either. It feels like they were shooting for a 'Momento Mori' , and wound up with a 'Zero Sum'. This episode is interesting in the information it provides, and <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else.</b> But in my opinion, it’s better than 'Lord of the Flies'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{technical}} aspects of the game, such as the graphics and animation, received acclaim. IGN's Douglass C. Perry felt that the graphics and motion capture are [...] "exceptional", and the animation is [...] "beautiful", as well as praising the stable frame rate. Ryan Davis of GameSpot wrote that the characters were designed with [...] "phenomenal detail", though felt that [...] "there's <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> to look at". GamesRadar's Dan Amrich commended the game's player models and lighting effects, stating that they [...] "put the hardware to impressive yet playful use". Tom Orry of VideoGamer.com felt that the visuals improve the gameplay, particularly applauding smaller details such as the player models and ball physics.|$|E

5000|$|..... Wolf Hall succeeds on its {{own terms}} and then some, both as a non-frothy {{historical}} novel and as a display of Mantel's extraordinary talent. Lyrically yet cleanly and tightly written, solidly imagined yet filled with spooky resonances, and very funny at times, it's <b>not</b> like <b>much</b> <b>else</b> in contemporary British fiction. A sequel is apparently in the works, and it's not the least of Mantel's achievements that the reader finishes this 650-page book wanting more. Christopher Tayler in The Guardian ...|$|R

The brothers began working for Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), the same promotion for which their father worked.

500|$|Theron Martin of Anime News Network {{considered}} Gamma to be {{a typical}} [...] "bad-ass anti-hero," [...] good at creating mayhem and <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else.</b> IGN's {{review of the}} series treated him similarly, saying his role of [...] "protagonist who wields {{a lot of power}} and hides a dark secret" [...] was done effectively but not remarkably, and was typical of shōnen action manga. Alexander Gorban of the Russian Animemaniacs Magazine believed Gamma's typical nature as a hero with an inner demon was offset by the character's [...] "devilish charm" [...] and portrayed willingness to fight to the last breath to not lose his humanity. He noted that aspects of this personality were reused for Bleach protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki, who would also bear some similarities in physical appearance to Gamma. Gorban felt, however, that these same strengths of character made Gamma dominate the cast, and that Zombiepowder. would have been improved if he had simply been its sole protagonist.|$|E
500|$|Neither Carter nor Duchovny were {{contracted}} {{to work on}} the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After the airing of [...] "Requiem", Duchovny expressed his intentions to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to me, there was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> to do in terms of the character.

[...] Rumors began spreading—and were eventually confirmed—that, since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season, that another character would take Mulder's place. Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, would take the role; Pileggi later called this guess [...] "ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{there was}} still a chance that the seventh season may have been the show's last, the {{character}} of Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode, was brought back in and featured in [...] "Requiem" [...] to bring the series full-circle. Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well. After the conclusion of the episode, David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series.

25|$|The {{appointment}} of new Queen's Counsel was suspended in 2003, {{and it was}} widely expected that the system would be abolished. However, a vigorous campaign was mounted in defence of the system. Supporters included those who considered it as an independent indication of excellence of value to those (especially foreign commercial litigants) who did <b>not</b> have <b>much</b> <b>else</b> to go on, and those who contended {{that it was a}} means whereby the most able barristers from ethnic minorities could advance and overcome prejudice, as well as better represent members of an increasingly diverse society.|$|R
500|$|In October 2008, Schwimmer {{made his}} Off-Broadway directorial debut in Fault Lines at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York. The {{production}} won a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times, which wrote: [...] "Based on Fault Lines... we can't really tell whether Schwimmer has much talent as a director. We're surprised he didn't try something more challenging for his debut. If <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else,</b> Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs". The New York Post, however, noted that Schwimmer [...] "knows {{a thing or}} two about freewheeling banter... and for a good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered". In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder's three-act play Our Town as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre. [...] "Schwimmer... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs. I've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer's post-Friends stage work in London and New York, and I've never seen him better", commented the Chicago Tribune.|$|E

60|$|I do <b>not</b> {{remember}} <b>much</b> <b>else</b> that Browning said, {{except a}} playful abuse {{of a little}} King Charles spaniel, named Frolic, Miss Blagden's lap-dog, whose venerable age (he is eleven years old) ought to have pleaded in his behalf. Browning's nonsense is of very genuine and excellent quality, the true babble and effervescence of a bright and powerful mind; and he lets it play among his friends with the faith and simplicity of a child. He must be an amiable man. I should like him much, and should make him like me, if opportunities were favorable.|$|R
50|$|The Allies argued {{and fought}} each other, {{severely}} criticizing each other's fighting ability. Some British Royal Welsh Fusiliers killed four Germans in a fight.

60|$|A {{little later}} the legends of Arthur and his table, {{and of the}} Holy Grail, once it seems the {{cauldron}} of an Irish God, changed the literature of Europe, {{and it may be}} changed, as it were, the very roots of man's emotions by their influence on the spirit of chivalry and on the spirit of romance; and later still Shakespeare found his Mab, and probably his Puck, and one knows <b>not</b> how <b>much</b> <b>else</b> of his faery kingdom, in Celtic legend; while at the beginning of our own day Sir Walter Scott gave Highland legends and Highland excitability so great a mastery over all romance that they seem romance herself.|$|R

Ramanujan: [...] "In their antiquity and {{in their}} contemporaneity, there is <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>else</b> in any Indian {{literature}} equal to these quiet and dramatic Tamil poems. In their values and stances, they represent a mature classical poetry: passion is balanced by courtesy, transparency by ironies and nuances of design, impersonality by vivid detail, austerity of line by richness of implication. These poems are not just the earliest evidence of the Tamil genius." ...|$|E
2500|$|As far as Led Zeppelin's studio {{recordings}} went, {{every single}} one of them has a certain ambiance, certain atmospherics that made them special.

60|$|The {{invitation}} {{to join the}} yacht was the culminating point of many exchanged civilities, and was mainly prompted by Mr. Travers' desire to have somebody to talk to.

Certainly the prospect of listening to long monologues on commerce, administration, and politics did <b>not</b> promise <b>much</b> alleviation to his sorrow; and he could <b>not</b> expect <b>much</b> <b>else</b> from Mr. Travers, whose life and thought, ignorant of human passion, were devoted to extracting the greatest possible amount of personal advantage from human institutions.
