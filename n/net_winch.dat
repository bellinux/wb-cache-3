5000|$|... #Caption: The {{foundations}} of the anti-submarine <b>net</b> <b>winch</b> house ...|$|E
50|$|The vessel {{is fully}} {{equipped}} for fisheries and marine biological studies. Some {{of the major}} equipment for these investigations are a Norlau hydraulic trawl winch of 7.5 tons and 2 X 1500 m wire capacity, a hydraulic <b>net</b> <b>winch</b> of 6 ton capacity.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was {{constructed}} on Georges Head and {{was designed to}} prevent enemy submarines from entering into Sydney Harbour. The boom net spanned the entire width of Port Jackson and a boom <b>net</b> <b>winch</b> house was located on Liangs Point, Watsons Bay.|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of case {{examples}} of Pomerania and Southern Denmark, the article discusses the important role (established for the Baltic region since the Hanse era) played by the specialised trade of anchor or ship smithery in the motorisation of fishery and coastal shipping. This was a cultural upheaval with far-reaching consequences that got {{under way in the}} region in question around 1900. For the harbour smiths’ occupation it brought about an interesting development, as the members of this trade now became involved in the construction and repair of mechanical aids for operations on board, for example producing small boat engines and <b>net</b> <b>winches,</b> casting boat propellers and repairing steam engines and internal combustion engines...|$|R
50|$|The seine netting method {{developed}} in Denmark. Scottish seining ("fly dragging") was a later modification. The original procedure {{is much the}} same as fly dragging except for the use of an anchored marker buoy when hauling, and closing the net and warps and <b>net</b> by <b>winch.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of steam and motor power, fishing gear became more complex. An advertising pamphlet from 1967 has {{a list of the}} gear that Miller's made, including <b>net</b> <b>winches,</b> trawl winches and rope coilers. Willie retired to New Zealand, leaving Jimmy and Jessie to carry on, but with no sons, {{it was the end of}} the Miller line. In 1972, Jimmy constructed a steel-hulled fishing boat for George Moodie of Port Seton. James McBurney of McTay Marine built the hull and Millers fitted the engine and steering gear and completed fitting out at St Monans. This was followed by the Ocean Herald for John McBain of Pittenweem, Ocean Triumph a 76 footer, for Ian Murray of Anstruther and another 76 footer for Robert Clark of North Berwick.|$|R
50|$|Bilim-2 is {{equipped}} with a hydraulic trawl winch of 7.5 tonnes and 2 x 1500 m wire capacity and a hydraulic <b>net</b> <b>winch</b> of 6-tonne capacity for fisheries and marine biological investigations. Marine geological studies are conducted using a shallow seismic system of type EG&G Uniboom, side-scan sonars, and various corers. A remotely operated underwater camera (Mini Rover Benthos MK II) is also utilized in seafloor surveys.|$|E
50|$|The anti-submarine boom net was {{demolished}} {{soon after}} World War II, {{and all that}} remains are {{the foundations of the}} old boom <b>net</b> <b>winch</b> house, which can be viewed on Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay. Today, the Australian War Memorial has on display a composite of the two midget submarines salvaged from Sydney Harbour. The conning tower of one of the midget submarines is on display at the RAN Heritage Centre, Garden Island, Sydney.|$|E
5000|$|Lamberton Skerrs is {{the southernmost}} {{point on the}} east coast of Scotland. It was the scene of a {{building}} known as the [...] "Smuggler's Bothy" [...] which was built by the famous smuggler John Robertson in about 1760 and stands on the cliffs overlooking the North Sea. He smuggled tea and was in partnership with a Swedish shipping line. The cover for the operation was fishing but the building was actually later used as a fishery cottage. It was eventually destroyed by vandals who set it alight. A rusted <b>net</b> <b>winch</b> and storage caves built into the rocks are all that remains of the fishery.|$|E
50|$|Mechanised hauling {{devices are}} used on modern trawlers. Trawl winches, such as Gilson <b>winches,</b> <b>net</b> drums and other {{auxiliary}} winches are installed on deck {{to control the}} towing warps (trawling wires) and store them when not in use.|$|R
40|$|The term {{electronic}} monitoring (EM) is very broad and can include {{a wide range}} of technologies such as Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS); electronic logbooks; video (including cameras, digital recording systems and monitors); and the integration of video with other data sources such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tag readers, <b>net</b> pinger hydrophones, <b>winch</b> sensors, and hydraulic pressur...|$|R
25|$|Chapman had a 4-foot (1.2-meter) fixed-length boom with a lifting {{capacity}} of 7,500 pounds (3,402 kg) and an A-frame with a {{safe working load}} of 1,000 pounds (454kg). She also had two hydraulic trawl winches, each with a drum capacity of 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) of 3/4-inch (19-mm) line and a maximum pull of 20,000 pounds (9,072kg), a hydraulic <b>net</b> sonde <b>winch</b> with a drum capacity of 3,937 feet (1,200 meters) and a maximum pull of 500 pounds (227kg), and a hydraulic oceanographic winch with a drum capacity of 3,250 feet (991 meters) of 3/16-inch (4.8-mm) steel cable and a maximum pull of 84 pounds (38.1kg).|$|R
5000|$|In 1942 {{during the}} Second World War the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was {{constructed}} on Georges Head and {{was designed to}} prevent enemy submarines from entering into Sydney Harbour. The boom net spanned the entire width of Port Jackson and a boom <b>net</b> <b>winch</b> house was located on Liangs Point, Watsons Bay. On the night of 31 May 1942, three Japanese midget submarines attempted to enter Sydney Harbour in {{what became known as}} the Attack on Sydney Harbour. One of the Japanese midget submarines became entangled in the boom net and after unsuccessful attempts by the crew to free the submarine they detonated charges within the sub, killing themselves and destroying their sub in the process.Chowder Bay was used in the late 1820s as an anchorage for visiting American whaling ships. [...] In 1831 Archibald Mosman and John Bell were allotted grants of land in Mosman Bay to establish a whaling station. The only remaining building of the original whaling station is The Barn in Avenue Road. The Barn was a store and sail drying house. It is now the home of the 1st Mosman 1908 Scout Group.|$|E
2500|$|Townsend Cromwell had a 40-foot (12.2-meter) {{telescoping}} boom with a {{lifting capacity}} of 2,000 pounds (907 kg), a 25-foot (7.6-meter) articulated boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (305kg), a plankton boom, and a movable A-frame.

5000|$|In 1920, though, the {{government}} {{changed the rules}} by removing the guaranteed price for the herring and prices dropped dramatically. In 1921, some Lossiemouth skippers noticed that the Danish seine net boats were landing huge quantities of plaice and other white fish at the English east coast ports. Their interest resulted in a few buying some seine <b>nets</b> and <b>winches</b> and trying this form of fishing. As they perfected seine net fishing, more of the Lossiemouth fleet converted to seine net. But boat design {{for this type of}} fishing was still proving to be an obstacle. That, and the cost of the majority steam boats prompted a new style of fishing boat. John Campbell, nephew of William Campbell who designed the first Zulu boat built a wooden boat that resembled, to some extent, the [...] "Fifie" [...] but had a broad beam. His boat, the Marigold, did very well and over a relatively short period the entire Lossiemouth fleet (the first in Scotland) converted to the seine net. Other east coast ports followed on very quickly.|$|R
40|$|The Fishery and Oceanographic Monitoring System (FOMS) or Sistema de Monitoreo Pesquero y Oceanográfico (SiMPO) in Spanish, was {{recently}} established in San Matías Gulf (Argentina) {{with the objective}} of monitoring fishing fleet operations. FOMS was also conceived as a fundamental tool for supporting research activities {{in the context of the}} Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries. A detailed description of the system is offered. An on line satellite transceiver (Inmarsat D+) supplies data about position, bearing and speed of the vessels, and alarms are automatically triggered whenever vessels are detected fishing in forbidden areas. The off line module integrating one on board CPU with other components: an electronic logbook allowing to the skipper load data on species catches and effort per haul. An electronic scale integrated to the <b>net</b> bag <b>winch,</b> records gross catch weights and allow calculate by catch and discards. A digital camera records images for control mesh sizes when it is hauled on board, and probes gather data of water temperature and salinity. Sensors in the hold record fish storage temperature in order to certifying quality and traceability chain. All information is stored in a Control Center where ad hoc tools are available for a complete data analysi...|$|R
50|$|Reuben Lasker has a traction-type oceanographic winch with {{a maximum}} pull weight of 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) which can deploy up to 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 17.3-mm (0..681-inch) {{electromechanical}} cable. She also has two CTD winches {{with a maximum}} pull weight of 7,700 pounds (3,493 kg), each of which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 9.5-mm (.375-inch) electromechanical cable, two trawl winches with a maximum pull weight of 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg), each of which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 25.4-mm (1-inch) wire, and a <b>net</b> sonde <b>winch</b> with a maximum pull weight of 8,100 pounds (3,674 kg) which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 11.4-mm (.450-inch) electromechanical wire. She has a 65-foot (19.8-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454 kg) at full extension and of 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) when extended 23 feet (7 meters) and a 23-foot (7-meter) telescopic boom with a 1,000-pound (454 kg) lifting capacity. She has a movable A-frame on her starboard side with a maximum safe working load of 2,000 pounds (907 kg) and a large A-frame aft with a maximum safe working load of 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) {{that serves as a}} stern gantry. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while two winches work with the starboard-side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and Reuben Laskers configuration allows her to have three scientific packages ready for sequential operations. One of her winches also can deploy lines and equipment over her stern. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. Her winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Reuben Lasker also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays. While trawling, Reuben Lasker uses wireless and hard-wired systems to monitor the shape of the trawl net and to work in conjunction with an autotrawl system that sets trawl depth and trawl wire tension and adjusts the net configuration.|$|R
