5|$|The treaty {{ensures that}} all {{citizens}} and companies from signatory countries receive equal {{rights of access}} and residence. Norway may not discriminate—based on nationality—the rights to fish, hunt and conduct mining, trade, industry and maritime activity. However, these activities may be limited by <b>non-discriminatory</b> legislation. Thus Norway is permitted to place regulations and prohibitions on basis of other objective criteria, or ban certain activities altogether or in certain geographic areas. The non-discrimination clause also does not ban nationality discrimination elsewhere than in economic activity. Specifically, research and scientific activities do not fall under the non-discrimination clause.|$|E
5|$|Recruitment centers were {{established}} by the American Hospital Association in all 1,125 participating nursing schools. Using recruiting booths, volunteers disseminated information about the opportunities offered by the Corps to potential candidates. State and local nursing councils, and many other organizations, associations, and volunteers aided the recruitment effort. 65,521 nursing students—521 more than projected—registered for the program {{in the fiscal year}} 1943, the first year of enrollment. In the 1944 enrollment period, 61,471 registered, exceeding the estimate by 1,471. In the 1945 enrollment period, 3,000 students were admitted to what would be the final class of the program. As a result of the <b>non-discriminatory</b> provision, by 1945, over 3,000 African Americans, 40 Native Americans, and 400 Japanese Americans had enrolled in the Corps.|$|E

25|$|Hydro-Québec's {{expertise}} {{at building}} and operating {{a very high}} voltage electrical grid spreading over long distances has long been recognized in the electrical industry. TransÉnergie, Hydro-Québec's transmission division, operates the largest electricity transmission network in North America. It acts as the independent system operator and reliability coordinator for the Québec interconnection of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation system, and {{is part of the}} Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC). TransÉnergie manages the flow of energy on the Quebec network and ensures <b>non-discriminatory</b> access to all participants involved in the wholesale market.

25|$|California {{justified}} the statute solely on fiscal grounds, and Stevens held that this justification was insufficient. The state {{could have found}} another <b>non-discriminatory</b> way to reduce welfare costs, other than conditioning the welfare benefit amounts of new residents by reference to their length of stay within the state, or their state of prior residence. Moreover, the fact that PRWORA authorized states to set their own benefit levels did not assist in the determining {{the constitutionality of the}} state statute because Congress cannot authorize states to violate the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the genetic}} {{inheritance}} patterns of RP, many isolate populations exhibit higher disease frequencies or increased prevalence {{of a specific}} RP mutation. Pre-existing or emerging mutations that contribute to rod photoreceptor degeneration in Retinitis Pigmentosa are passed down through familial lines; thus, allowing certain RP cases to be concentrated to specific geographical regions with an ancestral history of the disease. Several hereditary studies have been performed to determine the varying prevalence rates in Maine (USA), Birmingham (England), Switzerland (affects 1/7000), Denmark (affects 1/2500), and Norway. Navajo Indians display an elevated rate of RP inheritance as well, which is estimated as affecting 1 in 1878 individuals. Despite the increased frequency of RP within specific familial lines, the disease is considered <b>non-discriminatory</b> and tends to equally affect all world populations.|$|E
25|$|On 4 January 1974, Harry Schwarz met and had {{discussions with}} Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) Buthelezi, Chief Executive Councillor {{of the black}} {{homeland}} of KwaZulu. They agreed on a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa that {{became known as the}} Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith. The declaration's purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa for racial peace in South Africa. It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all with a Bill of Rights to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. The concept of a <b>non-discriminatory</b> society had been outlined in the 'Act of Dedication' of 1973 that Schwarz had written, while Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal. Schwarz had called for the Transvaal and South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the act. While the United Party Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused for it to come to debate. The principles of the act were adopted at the 1973 National United Party Congress.|$|E
25|$|Employment {{rights for}} women include <b>non-discriminatory</b> access {{of women to}} jobs and equal pay. The rights {{of women and men}} to have equal pay and equal {{benefits}} for equal work were openly denied by the British Hong Kong Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會 (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession. In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until a few decades ago, for example in France until 1965 and in Spain until 1975. In addition, marriage bars, a practice adopted from the late 19th century to the 1970s across many countries, including Austria, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Switzerland, restricted married women from employment in many professions.|$|E

It also recognises the right of parents to [...] "ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions". This is interpreted as requiring public schools {{to respect the}} freedom of religion and conscience of their students, and as forbidding instruction in a particular religion or belief system unless <b>non-discriminatory</b> exemptions and alternatives are available.|$|E
500|$|Svalbard lies {{under the}} {{sovereignty}} of Norway, but the Svalbard Treaty places several restrictions. Norway cannot use the archipelago for warlike purposes, cannot discriminate economic activity based on nationality and is required to conserve the natural environment. Uniquely, Svalbard is entirely visa-free zone. Everybody may {{live and work in}} Svalbard indefinitely regardless country of citizenship. Svalbard Treaty grants treaty nationals equal right of abode as Norwegian nationals. Non-treaty nationals may live and work indefinitely visa-free as well.

500|$|The United States Cadet Nurse Corps was {{established}} by the U.S. Congress on June 15, 1943, and {{signed into law by}} president Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 1, 1943. [...] Its purpose was to ensure the country had enough nurses to care for its citizens at home and abroad during World War II. [...] It was a <b>non-discriminatory</b> program that allowed Native Americans, African Americans, and relocated Japanese Americans to participate. The Corps was supervised by the United States Public Health Service (USPHS), whose duty was to train young women as nurses during the war.|$|E

[...] She claimed that the fees were contrary to Section 26-04 of the Airport Use Agreement with the City of Chicago, which is the contract that permits American Airlines to be a carrier in Chicago airports. [...] The initial plan exempted Platinum and Executive card holders who were generally business travelers and placed an inordinate burden of new fees on the common traveler in contravention of the <b>non-discriminatory</b> price agreement in the agreement. She expressed interest in a City Council forum on the issue. [...] She wrote directly to American Airlines and then wrote {{an article in the}} Chicago Sun-Times on the issue.|$|E
500|$|During {{construction}} {{the underground}} parking garage remained open. An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating {{two levels of}} underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a T-bar grid to absorb weight with about 150"outriggers", or [...] "tiebacks", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads. This design allows {{for the removal of}} individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning. [...] Crown Fountains design not only included interior access for technical repairs, but also incorporated exemplary, <b>non-discriminatory,</b> barrier-free accessibility, because its interactivity {{is not limited to the}} able-bodied. [...] The force of the water accounts for the entire range of possible interactive visitors.|$|E
500|$|Norway {{established}} a fisheries protection area surrounding Svalbard on 15 June 1977, which strictly regulates fisheries, {{but on a}} <b>non-discriminatory</b> basis. The zone extends [...] beyond the territorial waters. Norway maintains that the treaty's non-discrimination-policy only applies to land and the territorial waters and that Norway is free to establish an economic zone beyond that. Fishing vessels from Norway, Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, Russian and the European Union are awarded quotas for cod and herring; these and Greenland and Canada have been issued quotas for shrimp. Norway and the Soviet Union, later Russia, disagreed regarding {{the border between the}} two counties' exclusive economic zones in the Barents Sea. Norway claimed the internationally recognized equidistance principle should apply, while Russia claimed that the unilateral meridian line be used. The issue was resolved with a compromise in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Discussions to {{establish}} {{the sovereignty of the}} archipelago commenced in the 1910s, but were interrupted by World War I. On 9 February 1920, following the Paris Peace Conference, the Svalbard Treaty was signed, granting full sovereignty to Norway. However, all signatory countries were granted <b>non-discriminatory</b> rights to fishing, hunting and mineral resources. The treaty took effect on 14 August 1925, {{at the same time as}} the Svalbard Act regulated the archipelago and the first governor, Johannes Gerckens Bassøe, took office. The archipelago has traditionally been known as Spitsbergen, and the main island as West Spitsbergen. From the 1920s, Norway renamed the archipelago Svalbard, and the main island became Spitsbergen. Kvitøya, Kong Karls Land, Hopen and Bjørnøya were not regarded as part of the Spitsbergen archipelago. Russians have traditionally called the archipelago Grumant (...) [...] The Soviet Union retained the name Spitsbergen (...) to support undocumented claims that Russians were the first to discover the island. In 1928, Italian explorer Umberto Nobile and the crew of the airship Italia crashed on the icepack off the coast of Foyn Island. The subsequent rescue attempts were covered extensively in the press and Svalbard received short-lived fame as a result.|$|E
