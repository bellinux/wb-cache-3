50|$|One {{problem with}} {{conventional}} Addressability systems {{is that the}} information received by the Addressability server has already been packaged for a specific controller. Controllers are limited {{in the number of}} hardware links they can support. Because packaged information received by the Addressability server is controller specific, and due to hardware limitations, a dedicated link is required between the Addressability server and the controller. Since the number of links for a controller are limited, the Addressability system can only support a limited number of controller types. The limit on the supportable controller links, together with the hardware limitations, also results in limits on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> levels which can be accepted by a given controller. Therefore, prior Addressability systems are limited in their hardware and software scalability.|$|E

5000|$|The Government (the Prime Minister and the Minister of {{relationships}} with Parliament) {{used to set}} the priorities of {{the agenda for the}} Assembly's sessions, except for a single day each month. In practice, given the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> items, it meant that the schedule of the Assembly was almost entirely set by the executive; bills generally only have a chance to be examined if proposed or supported by the executive.

Another week is designated for the Assembly's [...] "control" [...] prerogatives (consisting mainly of verbal questions addressed to the government). And the fourth one is set by the Assembly.

Geopolitical competition, the uncertain future of economic and political developments in key states such as Russia, and the increasingly important roles that China and India play in international politics require renewed assessments of how best to deploy U.S. resources in order to achieve strategic objectives around the globe. The Foundation also seeks to support projects on key transnational issues such as proliferation, terrorism, democratization, and global political change. Within the academic community, the international program supports policy-relevant strategic studies and underwrites historical research with implications or lessons for current policy.|$|E

At this occasion, the EAEPE Constitution was adopted and a Steering Committee was elected, changed later into the EAEPE Council. In November 1990, the association formed a charity, the Foundation for European Economic Development (FEED) under the Charities Act (England and Wales), {{with the objective of}} providing financial assistance for the EAEPE annual conferences and other EAEPE projects. In 1991, the association adopted a Scientific Development Plan in order to designate a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> Research Areas and to appoint Research Area Coordinators to act as network-builders. Since 1991, in collaboration with Edward Elgar Publishing, EAEPE has published a series of conference volumes and other focused volumes. In the mid-1990s, EAEPE organized several summer schools, with the financial support of FEED and the European Commission. EAEPE has resumed organizing annual summer schools since 2010.

40|$|International audienceDistributed priority-based mutual {{exclusion}} algorithms may present starvation for low priority requests if the shared resource is continuously asked by high priority requests. To address this problem, several existing algorithms dynamically increment {{the priority of}} pending low-priority requests. The drawback {{of this approach is}} that it may lead to a great <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> inversions, i. e., a pending request p is satisfied before another one whose priority is higher than p's. One solution to reduce this number, as we have proposed in [7], is to both postpone priority increments and prevent low priorities from increasing too fast. However, in this case, the response time of low priorities may considerably increase. Therefore, in this article, we propose a new algorithm, denoted "Awareness", which aims at reducing the maximum response time whereas the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> violations remains low. To this end, a global view of pending requests of the system is necessary. Performance evaluation results confirm that our new algorithm provides a good tradeoff between response time and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> inversions...|$|E

40|$|Parity {{games are}} {{abstract}} infinite-round games {{that take an}} important role in formal verification. In the basic setting, these games are two-player, turn-based, and played under perfect information on directed graphs, whose nodes are labeled with <b>priorities.</b> The winner <b>of</b> a play is determined according to the parities (even or odd) <b>of</b> the minimal <b>priority</b> occurring infinitely often in that play. The problem of finding a winning strategy in parity games is known to be in UPTime ∩ CoUPTime and deciding whether a polynomial time solution exists is a longstanding open question. In the last two decades, a variety of algorithms have been proposed. Many of them have been also implemented in a platform named PGSolver. This has enabled an empirical evaluation of these algorithms and a better understanding of their relative merits. In this paper, we further contribute to this subject by implementing, for the first time, an algorithm based on alternating automata. More precisely, we consider an algorithm introduced by Kupferman and Vardi that solves a parity game by solving the emptiness problem of a corresponding alternating parity automaton. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that this algorithm outperforms other algorithms when the game has a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> relative {{to the size of the}} game. In many concrete applications, we do indeed end up with parity games where the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> is relatively small.
