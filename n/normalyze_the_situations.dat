40|$|Abstract: From ‘Operation Cast Lead’ to ‘Operation Protective Edge’, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine {{has been}} one of <b>the</b> most {{controversial}} <b>situations</b> to come before the International Criminal Court. In January 2015, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda agreed to engage in a preliminary examination of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine pursuant to a declaration by the State of Palestine granting the ICC jurisdiction in terms of article 12 (3) of the Rome Statute. Considering the various requirements underlying the preliminary examination of a <b>situation</b> state, <b>the</b> author concludes that the ICC has jurisdiction over <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine, that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> is admissible before the ICC, that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> is of sufficient gravity to warrant further attention by the ICC and that it will be in the interests of justice for the ICC to investigate <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> further. <b>The</b> author argues that the ICC Prosecutor should find that the preliminary examination of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine results in a proper investigation of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and <b>the</b> potential prosecution of members of both the Palestinian armed groups and Israeli Defence Force. The failure of the ICC Office of the Prosecutor to conduct further investigations of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Palestine will have far-reaching implications and significant consequences for Palestinians, Israelis and the ICC alike.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, we {{presented}} a new logic called ES for reasoning about the knowledge, action, and perception of an agent.

This allowed us to develop a clean and workable semantics for the language without piggybacking on the generic Tarski semantics for first-order logic. In this paper, we reconsider the relation between ES and <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus and show how to map sentences of ES into <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus. We argue that the fragment of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus represented by ES is rich enough to handle the basic action theories defined by Reiter as well as Golog.

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus, {{plans and}} legal {{situations}} are isomorphic: a situation is legal iff {{it is the}} result of executing a plan in <b>the</b> initial <b>situation.</b> This isomorphism is important. It provides a basis on which certain control information in planning can be formalized in <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus. As an application of this isomorphism, we investigate thoroughly a notion of goal ordering, and show its usefulness by applying it in a provably correct way to both linear and nonlinear planning. Introduction One of the features of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus (McCarthy [14]) is that a situation carries information about its history. For example, from looking at the syntax of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> do(move(B); do(move(A); S 0)), we know that it {{is the result of}} executing move(B) after move(A) in <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> S 0.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> {{calculus}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied formalisms for reasoning about action. The main goal of this paper is twofold: to study the notion of state within <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus; and to compare <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus with several temporal logics. Traditionally, the state (of a situation) is completely characterised by the set of fluents that hold (in that situation). This notion of state is shown to have some limitations and a solution to overcome them is proposed, by introducing states as individuals of <b>the</b> language (like <b>situations,</b> actions and fluents). A set of axioms relating these new individuals with the already existing ones is also introduced. This extension of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> calculus is called <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and state calculus. The comparison of this calculus with linear temporal logic is based on already existing work in the literature. But it is further extended to embody also the semantics. A similar idea is then used in comparing <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and state calculus w [...] ...|$|R
