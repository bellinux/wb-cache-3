It was implemented as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.|$|E
5|$|This {{allows the}} host to perform bus {{management}} action like enumerating new USB devices via retrieving the <b>new</b> <b>device</b> device descriptors. Retrieval {{of the device}} descriptors would especially allow for determining the USB Class, VID, and PID, which are often used for determining the correct USB driver for the device.|$|E
5|$|Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg {{served a}} three-place grid penalty {{following}} qualifying after being deemed at-fault for {{a collision with}} Williams driver Felipe Massa at the previous event in Singapore. Red Bull equipped both of their cars with new turning vanes for the Grand Prix {{in order to improve}} the airflow underneath the car and therefore create more downforce. The <b>new</b> <b>device</b> had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a poor performance in Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing endplate, while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.|$|E

25|$|Since a {{pacemaker}} uses batteries, {{the device}} itself will need replacement as the batteries lose power. Device replacement {{is usually a}} simpler procedure than the original insertion as it does not normally require leads to be implanted. The typical replacement requires a surgery in which an incision is made to remove the existing device, the leads are removed from the existing device, the leads {{are attached to the}} <b>new</b> <b>device,</b> and the <b>new</b> <b>device</b> is inserted into the patient's body replacing the previous device.|$|E

25|$|The first {{clinical}} {{use of the}} Drinker respirator on a human was on October 12, 1928, at the Boston Children's Hospital.

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of hermetic compressors {{is that the}} motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced. Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared {{to the value of}} the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a <b>new</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
25|$|Coppola {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} {{for the film}} with Hinton on his days off from shooting The Outsiders. He made the films back-to-back, retaining {{much of the same}} cast and crew. The film is notable for its avant-garde style with a film noir feel, shot on stark high-contrast black-and-white film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema and German Expressionism.

Its bulk is actually implemented in user mode, in the Plug and Play Service, which handles the often complex tasks of installing the appropriate drivers, notifying services and applications of the arrival of new devices, and displaying GUI to the user.|$|E

25|$|Fuses {{have the}} {{advantages}} of often being less costly and simpler than a circuit breaker for similar ratings. The blown fuse must be replaced with a <b>new</b> <b>device</b> which is less convenient than simply resetting a breaker and therefore likely to discourage people from ignoring faults. On the other hand, replacing a fuse without isolating the circuit first (most building wiring designs do not provide individual isolation switches for each fuse) can be dangerous in itself, particularly if the fault is a short circuit.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Commander John A. Howell, USN, George S. Blake {{immediately}} began innovative deep ocean work in 1874. Attached to the ship in the Gulf of Mexico was Lieutenant Commander D. Sigsbee to test his <b>new</b> <b>device</b> for releasing the heavy shot weights used in deep soundings. With development and installation of Sigsbee's sounding machine George S. Blake became the primary deep ocean sounding ship alternating between the Gulf of Maine and northern waters in summer and southern waters in winter.
