500|$|The tour {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Jason Stratley from The Philadelphia Inquirer said that [...] "On stage, wiggling and writhing, a rock-video vision of messy, bleached- blond hair, bare skin, sequined paisley and dime store diamonds was the flash-and-trash rock queen Madonna. Behold the Madonna clones—she {{is turning into}} one fine legend." [...] Jeff Sewald from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "the modus operandi [...] was clear. Madonna was not only selling her music to throngs of teen-agers and adults alike, but she was selling herself and the entire package {{proved to be a}} joy for the 14,500 screaming fans. [...] Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' had torn the cover off Pittsburgh's sexuality." [...] Rachel Lee from The Sacramento Bee felt that [...] "more than any pop star in recent memory, even Boy George and Prince, Madonna is an image. Her hour-long concert here Tuesday night, as professionally performed and well-choreographed as it was, did nothing to give her more dimension than the two already bestowed on her." [...] Arthur Daniels from Lexington Herald-Leader felt that [...] "Madonna looked grim, but the fans were delighted when the blond rock star made her first major concert appearance to kick off her 'Virgin Tour'. [...] She looked blank and did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> as she passed fans who gathered by the stage door before the show." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and I {{made up my mind}} to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life. I have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E
60|$|The face of Professor de Worms darkened, {{and he did}} <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{read the}} {{sentence}} through three times, and then recollected {{that he had}} <b>not</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> the Draconian reforms.|$|R
60|$|He {{went away}} without another word, and Babbie watched {{him from the}} window. Nanny had <b>not</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> from the ring.|$|R
60|$|At the {{threshold}} he paused. She had <b>not</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at him. She {{was still sitting}} there with bowed head and hidden face. He closed the door softly, and went out.|$|R
60|$|The man did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> {{but held}} out the paper with a drowsy grunt.|$|E
60|$|Daddy {{began to}} snivel. Agnes could <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> for shame. Will felt sick. Ed laughed.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{glanced at}} Ida, and {{imagined}} {{that she was}} interested, though she did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|He edged away at once, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> even; and Razumov saw his gaunt, shabby, famine-stricken figure {{cross the}} street obliquely with lowered head and that {{peculiar}} exact motion of the feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why {{you should}} pity her," [...] said Joyce, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> from her embroidery. There was just the merest tremor in her voice. Miss Sally looked at her sharply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rose {{will do as}} she pleases," [...] said Martin, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> {{from the}} book which, {{according}} to his custom then and in after-life, he was studying over his bread and milk.|$|R
60|$|MacIan {{lifted his}} head and looked at the Master steadily, but Turnbull did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|Philippa {{had taken}} up her work. Her fingers ceased their labours, but she did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sheila {{took a deep}} breath, but did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> 'I am {{entirely in}} your hands,' she replied.|$|E
6000|$|Regardless of her brother, who had <b>not</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> {{from his}} book, Jane began reading her list of poor Phyllis's misadventures. 'On Monday she tore her frock by {{climbing}} a laurel-tree, {{to look at}} a blackbird's nest.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am the {{youngest}} in residence, and consequently am <b>not</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to. But when Mrs. Quinch makes a happy release, {{there will be}} one below me. Nor is it to be expected that Mrs. Saggers will prove herself immortal.' ...|$|R
60|$|Gudrun, {{absorbed in}} a stupor of {{apprehension}} of surging water-plants, sat crouched on the shoal, drawing, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> {{for a long}} time, and then staring unconsciously, absorbedly at the rigid, naked, succulent stems. Her feet were bare, her hat lay on the bank opposite.|$|R
60|$|Tess again {{shook her}} head, her throat {{swelling}} with complicated emotion. She could <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at d'Urberville.|$|E
60|$|Blood did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> {{from his}} task. There {{was not the}} need. He knew the voice, as I have said.|$|E
60|$|Concho shuddered. Could it be {{that the}} devil was really going to fly away with his mule? He dared <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|But, angrily {{resolved}} not {{to betray}} herself, she seized her work, {{and went on}} making false stitches and pricking her fingers with much perseverance, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> or taking notice {{of what was going}} forward, until all the three voices united in [...] "Let us take the road." ...|$|R
60|$|Durade's {{eyes seemed}} glued to that dully glistening heap. He could <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at the coldly passionate Hough.|$|R
60|$|This {{consolation}} seldom {{failed to}} gladden her, but her disappointment was so sharp to-day {{that she would}} <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|She stirred {{her coffee}} absently. At first {{he thought that}} she might be offended, for she did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> for several moments.|$|E
60|$|The door of {{the blue}} room opened. Jims did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> It was Aunt Augusta, of course--and she had heard the whole story.|$|E
60|$|She {{heard him}} moving towards her, {{but she did}} <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> The next moment his arms were round her, and he was babbling.|$|E
60|$|He gave a low {{whistle and}} turned thoughtfully away, {{and the young}} artist was so absorbed that he did <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|He spoke so seriously, {{in a tone}} of such {{deep and}} bitter feeling, that Miss Temple could <b>not</b> resist <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> at her companion. His countenance was gloomy.|$|R
60|$|Blakeney paid no heed {{seemingly}} to the other's hesitation. He did <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at him, but quietly drew pen {{and paper}} towards him, and made ready to write.|$|R
60|$|The {{voice that}} put the {{question}} was so very kind, that Polly dared <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> because she knew what the eyes were silently saying.|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't disturb {{your friends}} on my account," [...] she said quietly. She did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> but Trent felt keenly the {{alteration}} in her manner.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused at}} the door, but Mrs. Bowman did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> A second later the front door closed and she heard him walk rapidly away.|$|E
60|$|He {{took a step}} nearer {{that brought}} him close to her. She did <b>not</b> shrink--only <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> into his face with wide eyes filled with wonder. He seized her roughly in his arms.|$|R
60|$|Betty {{was very}} pale and silent. She did <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up</b> from the pistol she was loading when Tom entered. The boy Tolly, however, {{looked at his}} tall, strong figure with evident satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|The boys shrank {{back out}} of countenance; and Sam, who alone had <b>not</b> spoken, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> into her face with a merry air, {{as if he were}} gratified by her {{spirited}} way of discomfiting them.|$|R
