5|$|<b>Never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> shy from violent conflicts, Haywood was {{frequently}} {{the target of}} prosecutors. His trial {{for the murder of}} Frank Steunenberg in 1907 (of which he was acquitted) drew national attention; in 1918, he was one of 101 IWW members convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 during the First Red Scare. In 1921, while out of prison during an appeal of his conviction, Haywood fled to Bolshevik Russia, where he spent the remaining years of his life.|$|E
5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. <b>Never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E

He was also a superb negotiator with a grasp of detail. <b>Never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> suffer fools, by middle age his disability made him very short-tempered and impatient with people.|$|E
25|$|His {{praise of}} the poet Thomas Campbell has been cited as one major {{instance}} where Hazlitt's critical judgement proved wrong. Hazlitt can scarcely conceal his enthusiasm for such poems as Gertrude of Wyoming, but neither the poems nor Hazlitt's judgement of them have withstood the test of time. His friends Hunt and Lamb get briefer coverage, and—Hazlitt was <b>never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> mince words—they come in for some relatively gentle chiding amid the praise. One American author makes an appearance, Washington Irving, under his pen name of Geoffrey Crayon.|$|E
25|$|After the Aloha special, Parker made a {{deal that}} would later be used in court {{to prove that he}} had not acted in the best {{interests}} of Presley. He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million. At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973. To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement. Presley, who was <b>never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> know the full ins and outs of the music business, would have probably had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could have never known how valuable the catalog would become.|$|E

A loose concept album about technology, it contained the dance hit [...] "TV-Show," [...] with vocals by Scharfschwerdt. It closed with a German cover of Dave Morgan's [...] "Hiroshima", which had already been a hit in Germany in 1978 for the British band Wishful Thinking. Tilgner translated the lyrics.|$|R

In Massachusetts he was to blame for much of the temper and spirit which he displayed, when [...] "by a more moderate carriage he might have mitigated the bitterness of the strife..." [...] However, Bell found him to be neither intractable nor unforgiving, and called him notably energetic, industrious and courageous. His sincere piety was never called into question, even by those with whom he differed most widely.|$|E
500|$|The {{fertile soil}} and {{temperate}} {{climate of the}} valley proved ideal for hops. Not only did the plants thrive, farmers were able to obtain {{four or five times}} the usual yield. Meeker, <b>never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> miss an opportunity, formed his own hop brokerage business. In 1870, he penned an 80-page pamphlet, Washington Territory West of the Cascades, to promote investment in the region. He took ship for San Francisco, then journeyed east by the new transcontinental railroad, hoping to get the railroads to expand to his region. He met with newspaper editor Horace Greeley (known for his famous advice, [...] "Go West, young man") and with railroad mogul Jay Cooke as part of his promotional blitz. [...] Cooke, who was building the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the northern tier of the country, not only bought up Meeker's pamphlets to give away to potential investors, but hired Meeker to drum up interest in his railroad. [...] While working from a Manhattan office, Meeker dressed like city dwellers, but did not entirely lose his frontier habits, often stirring a lump of butter into his coffee.|$|E

500|$|After the tour, Bradman {{was full}} of praise for Miller, {{although}} somewhat critical of his aggressive batting, which the Australian captain thought to be reckless: [...] Bradman criticised Miller's hitting of sixes (26), feeling that his mercurial all rounder lacked restraint and concentration. In contrast, Fingleton praised Miller's attitude to cricket, saying [...] "He is <b>never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> accept runs when they are there for the taking...I acknowledge myself the supreme believer in Miller as a cricketer. He had given me joy in the game approached by others." [...] With respect to his persistent bouncing of Hutton and Compton, Fingleton {{said that it was}} up to England to develop bowlers of express pace—which they lacked at the time—to retaliate against or deter the Australians from pursuing such tactics. Miller's persistent disagreements with Bradman soon caught up with him, despite the latter's retirement after the tour. During Bradman's testimonial match, Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at his retired captain, dismissing him with the last of these and drawing an angry look. Bradman was one of three members of the national selection panel, and Miller was dropped for the next series against South Africa in 1949–50. Although Bradman denied voting for the omission, most of the players in the team did not believe this.|$|E
500|$|Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, which {{required}} using her fashion advice and expertise {{in order to}} reform participants' appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits which {{has become something of}} a trademark. <b>Never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> hold back, a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with. Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know." [...] She also stated [...] "Ultimately, what we're doing is giving people confidence. We're probably the only people who have an opinion, who care how ordinary people dress. No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it's more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful. But they don't care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do!" [...] The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as [...] "the one with 'big tits'." [...] Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen, although Constantine was against the move.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, Increase Mather {{recorded}} his {{one and only}} diary entry for all of 1683: [...] "Randolph arrived at Boston." [...] Phips quickly began to provide {{a show of force}} for Randolph by insisting other ships strike their colors and firing across their bows if they did not. [...] Knepp claims that Narborough did not condone this, and many historians have followed his lead in treating Phips' activities in Boston harbor as arrogant showboating, but it seems clear from the letters of Randolph and Blathwayt [...] that Phips was not doing this merely for some explosive fun. Phips cites personal instructions from the King and indeed Charles II was known to have insisted on a salute to his flag. As Phips was creating chaos for the Massachusetts government, he continued to pursue his original intention of gathering diving equipment and divers to take to the Bahamas. Phips later followed the same procedures of requiring ships to strike in the West Indies and with a new crew in Bermuda. Phips lack of experience in the Royal Navy would suggest he likely made mistakes and did not always go about this procedure in the best way. It must have been a strange and uncomfortable chore for someone whose loyalties were with Boston (in '76 the records show initiated the building of a house in Boston). Randolph was <b>never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> withhold criticism, but he did not complain of Phips activities in Boston harbor that winter and Randolph even seems to have assisted Phips by searching a ship for him. [...] But choosing a threatening posture showed Randolph's inability to understand the New England character and it did not produce the effect Randolph intended. The magistrates voted to submit to the crown, but the deputies resisted. [...] Phips and the Rose became a focal point for the resistance, as Knepp dutifully recorded without understanding the subtext: [...] "Phips crew say that they would as soon fire against this town as against Algiers and called us rebels," [...] is one deposition Knepp records though Knepp seems to believe he is merely recording a barroom brawl. [...] "...one of the constables in particular told him that he thought Capt. Phips had been a town born child, Captain Phips answering him, 'Let him be what he would, he had been sworn at sixteen years of age to be true to the King and his government." [...] (As if in an act of delayed vengeance, HMS Rose would be boarded and de-masted, and its captain John George imprisoned, less than six years later during the Boston Revolution.) ...|$|E

Flagler became particularly interested in linking Key West to the mainland after the United States announced in 1905 the construction of the Panama Canal. Key West, the United States' closest deep-water port to the canal, could not only take advantage of Cuban and Latin America trade, but the opening of the canal would allow significant trade possibilities with the west.|$|E
2500|$|Union {{soldiers}} sang many songs {{during the}} March, {{but it is}} one written afterward that has come to symbolize the campaign: [...] "Marching Through Georgia", written by Henry Clay Work in 1865. Sung {{from the point of view}} of a Union soldier, the lyrics detail the freeing of slaves and punishing the Confederacy for starting the war. Sherman came to dislike the song, in part because he was <b>never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> rejoice over a fallen foe, and in part because it was played at almost every public appearance that he attended.

He was <b>never</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> kowtow; team-mates and observers detected the chip that was reluctant to leave his shoulder. He was in the modern idiom, his own man.
