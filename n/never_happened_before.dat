He represented the Portland Place ward from 1856 until his retirement from politics in 1874. Mason quickly made an impression and was elected mayor for three consecutive years between 1857 and 1860, which had <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before.</b> He supported progressive measures such as opening a public park, providing public libraries, and addressing unsanitary conditions in parts of Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E

25|$|The Udmurt native {{religion}} {{became the}} basis of the national movement, and in 1994 a group of Izhevsk intellectuals, artists, writers, scholars and entrepreneurs founded the Udmurt Vos as an institution and mass association. Genuine high priests were sought, and Vasili Maksimov, a simple peasant from an Udmurt village in Tatarstan, became the head of the new church. National worship services were organised (a thing that <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before),</b> and since then they are held yearly in different regions of the republic.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} received Reeves' resignation {{from his}} ministerial posts and his electorate upon {{his arrival in}} Lyttelton on 13 January, but the following day, Scott resigned from the campaign. On 16 January, the Seddon Ministry gazetted Reeves' resignation from his ministerial posts, but not his resignation from the City of Christchurch electorate. On 23 January, Liberal Party organisers met and confirmed Richard Molesworth Taylor as the official government candidate. The following day, Reeves' resignation was finally gazetted. The writ was issued on 31 January and the election advertised by the returning officer, John Whitelaw, on 3 February. The nomination date was set for 5 February, and the election date set for Thursday, 13 February. Polling was from 9am to 7pm, and 11 polling booths were provided throughout the central city, Waltham, Phillipstown, Richmond, Sydenham, Addington, Edgeware (then called Knightstown), and St Albans. Three ministers of the crown travelled from Wellington to Christchurch to support Richard Molesworth Taylor; The Press commented that this had <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, {{nineteen}} men hijacked four airliners all bound for California. Once the hijackers assumed control of the airliners, they told the passengers {{that they had a}} bomb on board and would spare the lives of passengers and crew once their demands were met – no passenger and crew actually suspected that they would use the airliners as suicide weapons since it had <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> in history, and many previous hijacking attempts had been resolved with the passengers and crew escaping unharmed after obeying the hijackers. The hijackers – members of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell – intentionally crashed two airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just outside Washington D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington D.C., to target the White House or the U.S. Capitol. None of the flights had any survivors. A total of 2,977 victims and the 19 hijackers perished in the attacks. Fifteen of the nineteen were citizens of Saudi Arabia, and the others were from the United Arab Emirates (2), Egypt, and Lebanon.|$|E

Any human who may unknowingly possess a werewolf heritage could undergo a First Change {{at some time in}} their life, though what triggers the change is unknown. It is known that it almost <b>never</b> <b>happens</b> <b>before</b> puberty or after the age of 60.

Unlike traditional fictional werewolves, Uratha may change at any time into various forms between man and wolf, though they do find this easier when the phase of the moon matches their Auspice.|$|R
500|$|Since its {{original}} release, The Big Lebowski {{has become a}} cult classic. Ardent fans of the film call themselves [...] "achievers". Steve Palopoli wrote about the film's emerging cult status in July 2002. He first realized that the film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and witnessed people quoting dialogue from the film to each other. Soon after the article appeared, the programmer for a local midnight film series in Santa Cruz decided to screen The Big Lebowski and on the first weekend they had to turn away several hundred people. The theater held the film over for six weeks, which had <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

A dance number was added immediately afterwards in order to end the show on a lighter note. He also cut two scenes from this segment featuring Sherri and Terri being cooked as [...] "Teriyaki" [...] steak with a [...] "Sherry" [...] sauce and Homer regaling Lisa about his dream of eating Milhouse. Regardless, a book from this scene was featured in this segment. As a result of this scene being cut, Homer does not appear in the third segment, something Cohen thought <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before.</b> The [...] "grade F meat" [...] joke was written by Mirkin, inspired by his cousin once seeing a box of hot dogs labeled [...] "grade C, approved for human consumption".|$|E

[...] A German exhibitor said of crowds of people lining up for tickets to the film, that: [...] "Something like this [...] <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> in Germany." [...] Among other countries, [...] "record sales" [...] and [...] "sell-outs" [...] were also reported in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and New Zealand.

500|$|Musician Harry Connick Jr., {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Leo. He {{received}} a call from co-creators Kohan and Max Mutchnick asking him to appear on Will & Grace, and agreed to do it after learning that it was his wife's favorite show. According to Debra Messing, who plays Grace, Kohan and Mutchnick had a specific vision of Grace's husband from the start. They thought it was important that Grace meet a [...] "menschy, nice Jewish man who happens to be a hottie, and that's what we got with Harry Connick Jr," [...] she said. According to The Nation magazine, {{this was the first time}} that a prime-time sitcom showed a Jewish protagonist (Grace) marrying inside the faith. Connick, who is part-Jewish, said he enjoyed the fact that he was not asked to sing on the show, because [...] "it throws you out of character a little bit when that stuff happens. It's been great just doing the acting thing." [...] Messing, in discussing Grace and Leo's relationship, commented that it is [...] "unlike anything that Grace has ever been a part of before and just the little that we've done so far, it feels wonderful to be playing with Harry." [...] In another interview, also discussing the characters' relationship, she explained, [...] "...bringing Leo into it and making it a viable and potent relationship for Grace, that's <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before.</b> I think she's a little less frenetic and neurotic, and I think that really being in love markedly changes Grace. That sexual energy in a great way has shaken things up, because it is the greatest threat to the friendship of Will and Grace to date." ...|$|E
500|$|Jordan Farley from SFX {{magazine}} {{named the}} episode the eighth of the [...] "Top Groundhog Days" [...] episodes. Farley applauded the show's gall to seemingly kill {{one of the}} leads in the teaser and appreciated the entry's mix of humor—during the scenes with Mulder and his water bed—and its alternative scenarios in the bank. Natalie Prado from Just Press Play gave the episode an A– and wrote, [...] "The episode is well-written and tense. As an audience, we become increasingly frustrated that the two people that we know can solve the problem are unaware that it exists, which makes the payoff when they finally {{find a way out}} much more satisfying. There are a few leaps in logic, especially towards the end, but overall it’s solid and enjoyable." [...] Jamie Jeffords, writing for the Dallas Morning News, awarded the episode four out of five stars and praised Hamilton's performance, saying, [...] "What makes 'Monday’ is the performance of Hamilton [...] When she is killed in the end, she almost possesses a quiet glee when she realizes her death <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before,</b> so maybe it is over now. Her performance is haunting. Very powerful." [...] Michigan Daily writer Melissa Runstrom, in a review of the sixth season, said [...] "Monday" [...] was [...] "well made and entertaining." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris called the episode [...] "ingenious and heart-wrenching," [...] and noted that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson's acting was the best of the season. Furthermore, she praised Kim Manners' directing style, calling the same scenes shot in different ways [...] "new".

2500|$|According to most scientists, massive die offs {{of animals}} are not unusual {{in nature and}} happen {{for a variety of}} reasons {{including}} bad weather, disease outbreaks and poisonings, with pollution and climate change adding to the stresses on wildlife. The U.S. Geological Service's website listed about 90 mass deaths of birds and other wildlife from June through December 12. For instance, Louisiana's State Wildlife Veterinarian Jim LaCour has stated that there have been 16 similar mass blackbird deaths in the past 30 years. According to Italy's WWF president Giorgio Tramonti, mass dove deaths like the ones that occurred in Italy have <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> 2010. The event in Arkansas was attributed primarily to an unexpected temperature change causing turbulence, visible on NEXRAD Doppler weather radar images, above their roosting areas which disoriented them. In addition other [...] have reported more masses of dead animals in the year 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Another unusual aspect was the {{configuration}} of the third rail. Unlike other American commuter-rail agencies that operate trains powered by third rails, which have a contact shoe on top of their third rail, Metro-North trains' contact shoes draws current {{from the bottom of the}} third rail during operation. The Metro-North's under-running third rails are designed in order to prevent ice from building up on top during winter months and reduce the possibility of inadvertent contact with the high-voltage rail; as a consequence, the Metro-North third rails are much safer than the traditional over-running third rails. To facilitate this, the ends of the third rails adjacent to grade crossings have a slight upturn. [...] "This has <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before,</b> and this is a rare configuration of a third rail," [...] U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, said. [...] "Do those two add up to the explanation for this terrible, terrible tragedy? Very possibly." [...] But Steve Ditmeyer, a former Federal Railroad Administration official, told the Associated Press it would be impossible to be sure that an under-running shoe lifted the rail without also doing tests to see if the same thing would happen in the more common over-running configuration.|$|E
