40|$|Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) drying {{is a novel}} {{method of}} non-thermal processing. In this drying method, drying {{can be carried out}} using either AC or DC high voltages. The {{thermodynamic}} considerations regarding the lowering of temperature under EHD drying include rapid rates of evaporation and exothermic interaction of the electric field with a dielectric material. Multi-point and plate electrode systems are efficient in accelerating drying of agricultural materials. The electrode produces corona wind, which resembles a round jet, impinges and removes moisture from the surface. The enhancement of drying rate by corona discharge from needle electrodes has been experimentally evaluated in this study. Effects of three different categories, one needle, nine needles and seventeen needles on drying rate of kiwi fruit were studied, moreover in each category, Experiments were carried out using DC voltage levels of 6, 10. 5 and 15 kV and field intensities 4. 5 kV/cm.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these maps is to delimit the {{geographic}} distribution of one and two-needled pinyon pines {{in order to determine}} their climatic tolerances. The two-needled variety, Pinus edulis, is usually accepted as a valid species. P. monophylla has traditionally been easily distinguished from P. edulis by having a single needle in each fascicle rather than a pair. This easy dichotomy breaks down in most regions between populations, where individual trees usually have a variable <b>number</b> of <b>needles</b> per fascicle, likely due to hybridization between the one and two-needled species (Lanner, 1974; Lanner and Phillips, 1992). Microhabitat has been suggested as an influence on <b>needle</b> <b>number</b> (Welsh et al., 1993) and <b>needle</b> <b>number</b> has been shown in at least one population in Nevada to reflect precipitation during the previous year with a greater <b>number</b> of single <b>needles</b> developing following a dry year (Tausch and West, 1986). Populations in central Arizona also seem to have variable ratios of one to two-needle fascicles from year to year (K. Cole, unpublished data).

50|$|Pinus johannis is a {{recently}} described pinyon pine, discovered by Elbert L.

Further research by the French botanist Marie-Françoise Robert-Passini, the American botanists Dana K. Bailey and Frank G. Hawksworth and others, has shown that it is better treated as a distinct species. Although often occurring together with Mexican pinyon, it is reproductively isolated from that by its pollination being a month to two months later in summer, rather than in spring, thereby preventing hybridisation.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Net {{photosynthesis}} {{was measured}} for photosynthetic light efficiency and capacity on two-year-old plants from eight different seed sources in three measurement periods. The measurement periods {{corresponded to the}} physiological periods 1) prior to bud swelling, 2) after needle elongation, and 3) predormancy. Measurement period differences in both photosynthetic efficiency and capacity were apparent. The pre-bud swelling period had the lowest capacity and efficiency, the pre-dormancy period had the highest capacity and efficiency, and the intermediate period was between the two other periods in capacity and efficiency. Seven seed sources from regions within the Rocky Mountains and one hybrid of Coastal X Arizona origin represented populations from which seedlings were raised and measured. There were no apparent differences with respect to seed-source photosynthetic capacity. There were seed source related differences in photosynthetic light efficiency. The seedlings from the northern Rocky Mountain seed sources had a greater light efficiency than those from the southern-Rocky Mountains.

Shoot extension, <b>needle</b> <b>number,</b> {{and the size}} and <b>number</b> of <b>needle</b> cells were observed throughout the season. Beginning with bud burst in early May, needle growth continued for nine weeks in the control treatment. Needle growth in the mineral deficiency treatments terminated {{at the same time}} as in the controls, although it did not begin until up to three weeks later than in the control trees. Needles developed acropetally along the shoot, with basal needles completing their development fist. Cell division in needles of control trees lasted about 3 weeks, with cell expansion continuing for a further 3 weeks. Initial mean cell cycle times were shortest for proximal needles following bud burst, but lengthened as the season progressed. Cell number increased from 6600 in the primordia to 200 000 in mature needles. Final needle dimensions and cell number varied according to the position of the needle on the shoot. The largest needles with the most cells were near the middle of the shoot.

40|$|Background: Cosmetic {{deformities}} {{can result}} from various types of alopecia or even post hair transplantation procedures. Patients with such deformities seek aesthetically appealing longer-lasting options. Scalp concealers are commonly used {{by men and women}} to camouflage these deformities. Scalp micropigmentation (SMP) is one of the concealers recently gaining popularity. Objectives: SMP is a novel technique wherein microdot tattoos are placed in a stippling pattern to mimic hair follicles that are cut close to the scalp and various variables affecting its outcome were evaluated. Methods: Forty-five subjects were recruited for the study. The various factors affecting outcome of SMP—angle of needle against the scalp, depth of needle into the scalp, time of the needle contact in scalp, speed of the rotor, resistance of scalp, color of pigment, viscosity of dye, <b>needle</b> <b>number,</b> <b>needle</b> thickness, and pattern of dot placement—were systematically studied in 15 patients through clinical photographs and trichoscopy. Ideal depth of pigment deposition was assessed through histopathological examination. After using these optimum variables, standardized SMP was performed in 30 patients with hair loss (3 patients with cicatricial and 27 patients with diffuse non-cicatricial alopecia). SMP was also used to create an aesthetically denser hairline. The outcome of the procedure was evaluated using standardized global photographs. Results: The ideal parameters were established to achieve standard reproducible results. There were great patient satisfaction and acceptance of the procedure. All the patients showed moderate to great improvement after the procedure with satisfactory scalp coverage. Adverse events were transient which were seen in the form of edema and redness.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} effect of lobe selection, <b>needle</b> gauge, and <b>number</b> of passes on {{procedure}} outcomes in terms of specimen length and post-procedure complications. METHODS: In this HIPAA-compliant, IRB-approved retrospective study, the data from 771 ultrasound-guided adult parenchymal liver biopsies were analyzed. Post-procedure complications were assigned a 3 -point rating scale. Associations between specimen length and post-procedure complications with lobe laterality, <b>needle</b> gauge, and <b>number</b> of passes were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression models were {{used to analyze the}} likelihood for achieving a specimen length of at least 2 cm. RESULTS: Post-procedure complications were not associated with lobe laterality, <b>needle</b> gauge, and <b>number</b> of passes (p 3 ̆e 0. 3). Specimen length was associated with the number of passes dichotomized at the study mean (p = 0. 007), but not with lobe laterality or needle gauge (p 3 ̆e 0. 2). After adjusting for lobe laterality and needle gauge, procedures with 1 or 2 passes were associated with a higher likelihood of obtaining a 2 cm or longer specimen (OR 2. 469; CI 1. 08 - 5. 63, p = 0. 0315) than procedures with 3 or more passes, possibly due to poorer sample quality.

Liming is widely used as a measure to alleviate soil acidification and its damage to trees, but little is known about long-term effects of liming on the health and growth of declining Masson pine forests. Soil chemical properties, health condition (defoliation and discoloration), and growth were evaluated following application of limestone powder (0 (unlimed control), 1, 2, 3, and 4 t ha 21) in an acidified and declining Masson pine stand at Tieshanping (TSP) of Chongqing. Eight years after liming, in the 0 – 20 cm and 20 – 40 cm mineral soil layers, soil pH values, exchangeable calcium (Ca) contents, and Ca/Al molar ratios increased, but exchangeable aluminum (Al) levels decreased, and as a result, length densities of living fine roots of Masson pine increased, with increasing dose. Mean crown defoliation of Masson pines (dominant, codominant and subdominant pines, according to Kraft classes 1 – 3) decreased with increasing dose, and it linearly decreased with length densities of living fine roots. However, Masson pines (Kraft classes 1 – 3) in all treatments showed no symptoms of discoloration. Mean current-year twig length, twig dry weight, <b>needle</b> <b>number</b> per twig, <b>needle</b> length per twig, and needle dry weight per twig increased with increasing dose. Over 8 years, mean height increment of Masson pines (Kraft classes 1 – 3) increased from 5. 5 m in the control to 5. 8, 6. 9, 8. 3, and 9. 5 m in the 1, 2, 3, and 4 t ha 21 lime treatments, and their mean DBH (diameter at breast height) increment increased from 3. 1 to 3. 2, 3. 8, 4. 9, an...|$|R
40|$|In xeric environments, an {{increase}} in drought is related to reduced forest productivity and to enhanced mortality. However, predictions of future forest development remain difficult as the mechanisms underlying the responses of mature trees to long-term variations in water availability are not well understood. Here, we aimed to compare the adjustments in radial growth and morphological needle and shoot traits of mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing along open water channels with those of control trees growing under naturally dry conditions at three sites in Valais, an inner-Alpine dry valley of Switzerland. The trees growing along two channels had been irrigated since germination (> 70 years), whereas those along another previously drained channel had been irrigated only from 2010 to 2012, when the channel was re-established, and could thus be used to quantify the short-term effects of re-irrigation. Linear mixed models revealed that needle and shoot lengths as well as early-and late-wood basal area increments (BAIs) were most responsive to short-term and long-term irrigation. However, {{the magnitude of the}} response to the short-term irrigation exceeded that of the long-term irrigation. An extreme drought {{during the first half of}} 2011 led to an immediate decrease in the needle length, needle width, and early-and late-wood BAIs of the control trees, whereas the shoot length and <b>needle</b> <b>numbers</b> of control trees reacted with a 1 -year delay to the extreme drought, as the shoots were responding to water availability of previous year's summer. Such negative responses to dry climatic conditions were even found in irrigated trees at one of our sites, which might be linked to tree growth becoming more sensitive to drought with increasing tree height and leaf area. In order to improve predictions of future forest development, long-term studies are necessary that consider lagged responses and adjustment processes of trees to changes in water availability. </p...|$|R
