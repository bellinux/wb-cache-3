500|$|As a {{scientific}} {{member of the}} Board, Lax was one of eighteen men who were, according to Edmund Dews, [...] "ultimately responsible for the form and contents of the Nautical Almanac. It {{would have been difficult}} in these years to select another group equally eminent in their field." [...] Lax was notable for his strong attendance record at the quarterly meetings, not missing a single meeting between 1822 – 25, a record equalled by only three other members, although non-attendance of meetings would have resulted in his not being paid his annual salary of £100. In 1828 Lax appended An easy method of correcting the lunar distance, on account of the spheroidal figure of the earth to the Nautical Almanac. After the Board was dissolved in 1828 Lax unsuccessfully attempted to convince George Biddell Airy to aid in a campaign for its restoration. In 1834 a new edition of his <b>nautical</b> <b>tables</b> was published posthumously. Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor later concluded that all of Lax's works were [...] "of value to the art of navigation".|$|E
500|$|Samuel {{saved the}} captain's journal, {{commission}} papers and purser's documents, but {{was forced to}} leave behind Bligh's maps and charts—15 years of navigational work. The launch was supplied with about five days' food and water, a sextant, compass and <b>nautical</b> <b>tables,</b> and Purcell's tool chest. At the last minute the mutineers threw four cutlasses down into the boat. Of Bountys complement—44 [...] after the deaths of Huggan and Valentine—19 men [...] were [...] crowded into the launch, leaving it dangerously low in the water with only seven inches of freeboard. The 25 men remaining on Bounty included the committed mutineers who had [...] taken up arms, the loyalists detained against their will, and [...] others for whom there was no room in the launch. [...] At around 10:00 the line holding the launch to the ship was cut; a little later, Bligh ordered a sail to be raised. Their immediate destination was the nearby island of Tofua, clearly marked on the horizon by the plume of smoke rising from its volcano.|$|E

40|$|After thirty years' labouring, {{the author}} {{accomplished}} to exchange the spheric trigonomical equation as follows: log 2 (cos S+ 1) / 2 (cos S+cos Z) =log 2 / 1 +cos H+log 2 (cos S+ 1) / 2 (cos S+cos D) ∫Z 0 sin z/cos S+cos z・dx・log e=∫H 0 sin H/ 1 +cos H・dx・log e+∫D 0 sin D/cos S+cos D・dx・log e It is confidently hoped that this table {{will be used}} to finish the nautical culculations within sufficient accuracy and the least time. Moreover, this new <b>nautical</b> <b>table,</b> conveniently, is well adapted for extending through the astronomical and the geometrical sailings, namely the calulation on the high altitude, the Ex-meridian altitude, the great circle sailing etc., at the same openning of a table...|$|R
50|$|Cook {{gathered}} accurate longitude measurements {{during his}} first voyage {{with the help of}} astronomer Charles Green and by using the newly published <b>Nautical</b> Almanac <b>tables,</b> via the lunar distance method — measuring the angular distance from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and comparing that to his local time determined via the altitude of the sun, moon, or stars. On his second voyage Cook used the K1 chronometer made by Larcum Kendall. It was a copy of the H4 clock made by John Harrison, which proved {{to be the first to}} keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship Deptford's journey to Jamaica, 1761-1762.|$|R

50|$|James Inman (1776-1859), an English {{mathematician}} and astronomer, was {{professor of}} mathematics at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, {{and author of}} Inman's <b>Nautical</b> <b>Tables.</b>|$|E
50|$|Andrew was {{the author}} of Astronomical and <b>Nautical</b> <b>Tables</b> (1805); Institutes of Grammar and Chronological Tables (1817); Key to Scriptural Chronology (1822); and Hebrew Grammar and Dictionary without Points (1823).

50|$|Professional navigators {{are divided}} in usage between sight {{reduction}} tables {{on the one}} hand, and handheld computers or scientific calculators on the other. The methods are equally accurate. It is {{simply a matter of}} personal preference which method is used. An experienced navigator can reduce a sight from start to finish in about 5 minutes using <b>nautical</b> <b>tables</b> or a scientific calculator.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} causes for the error of LOP by astronomical {{navigation}} is miscalculation. The authors investigated {{the percentage of the}} occurrence of miscalculation and the steps of such miscalculation. The subjects of this study were the cadets of the trainning ship Nagasaki-maru, consisting of 11 juniors (A class) and 7 postgraduate students (B class) of Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University. The data were obtained from their practice note of astronomical navigation on their trainning cruise from August to October in 1974. As the result, although there are some differences between the two classes and by the observed celestial spheres, sun and stars, the average percentage of their miscalculation was unexpectedly as high as 40 ～ 50 %, and considerable discrepancies were noted among individuals in the same class. More than about 60 % of miscalculation occurred in the step of altitude calculation where the <b>nautical</b> astronomical <b>table</b> is used frequently. Generally, they showed a tendency to try only to reduce the time of calculation and to neglect its exactness. 手計算における誤りは当然予想されることではあるが,その発生率が意外に高い。それは練習を重ねるにつれ減少する一方,慣れに伴う慎重性の欠如も生ずる。天測船位は,他の諸原因による誤差が加わるから,その精度が一層低下する。精度向上のために,高度測定技術の習熟と平行して,計算の面では時間短縮を図る前に正確さ,特に表値の比例部分の取扱いや簡単な加減算における慎重性をもっと重視すべきである...|$|R

Three {{years later he}} received an appointment as Professor of Nautical Mathematics at the Royal Naval College. In 1821 he published Navigation and Nautical Astronomy for Seamen; these nautical mathematical tables, known as Inman's <b>Nautical</b> <b>Tables,</b> remained in use for many years. In the third edition (1835) he introduced a new table of haversines (the term was his coinage) to simplify the calculation of distances between two points {{on the surface of}} the earth using spherical trigonometry.
