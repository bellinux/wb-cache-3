She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: [...] "I loved it. I <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me." [...] Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she [...] "believe in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie", and added: [...] "You can support art even if it's {{not going to make}} a zillion dollars." [...] It premiered on April 4, 2009 at the Phoenix Film Festival.|$|E

[...] According to Rappaport, Flocabulary has made [...] "social responsibility a core value [...] and never [...] it get overshadowed by our revenue goals," [...] and, [...] "we're trying to make this as affordable as possible, because unfortunately the schools with money aren't necessarily the schools that need Flocabulary. So we're {{trying to work with}} some government organizations and other charities to really get these into the schools that need them." [...] Flocabulary's non-profitable social projects have included charitable donations and outreach to underprivileged schools. In 2016, Flocabulary partnered with the United Nations to produce a video promoting the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals for improving the world by 2030.|$|E
500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> play these songs again." ...|$|E
500|$|The comic book's initial cancellation, and the {{introduction}} of the character to DC led to many negative feedback and reception. I, Vampire writer Joshua Hale Fialkov expressed sadness he would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> write [...] "the 'real' John Constantine", noted crime author and former Hellblazer writer Ian Rankin stated that Constantine was the only comic book character he ever wanted to write for, and Alan Moore's daughter, Leah Moore expressing doubt that Constantine could replace Hellblazer, among others. As a result, DC co-publisher Dan Didio issued a statement defending this decision, stating that, [...] "Hellblazer's had a long and incredibly successful run and that's a tip of the hat to all the great creators that have worked on the book over the years. The new Constantine series will return him back to his roots in the DCU and hopefully be the start of another incredible run." [...] Comic Alliance described Hellblazer's cancellation as marking [...] "the end of an era for Vertigo" [...] while adding it to be [...] "one of a handful of comics from the late eighties that helped comic books and their readers grow up." ...|$|E

She also interacted with soldiers based at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Naval Base San Diego, Fort Polk, and Lackland Air Force Base. The special won an Emmy for Outstanding Technical Direction on the 2002 ceremony. In January 2002, Jive Records released the DVD Live from Las Vegas; it was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 200,000 copies in units.

500|$|Billboard critic Keith Claufield {{singled out}} the song as a {{highlight}} from the album {{and called it}} [...] "a cousin of Justin Timberlake's 'Cry Me a River'." [...] Also from Billboard, Michael Paoletta called it a [...] "sexy, skittery, beat-driven hip-pop number {{that sounds like a}} Timbaland production". He concluded that [...] " [...] definitely deserves a shot at mainstream top 40 and rhythmic success". Like Paoletta, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine too compared the production of the song to that of Timbaland. The [...] "Boy! Boy" [...] hook of the song and its synthpop style were praised by Spin magazine, who felt that they [...] "demonstrate that even in the 21st century, Kylie wears the 1980s well." [...] Writing for NME, John Robinson found [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] to be better than [...] "Slow", the lead single from the album, and called it [...] "excellent cutting edge pop in a great single by the Justin Timberlake or Sugababes way." [...] Adrien Begrand from PopMatters favoured its [...] "almost garage-like beat" [...] and appreciated the lyric [...] "You'll <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Heaven if you're scared of getting high." [...] Louis Vartel from the LGBT oriented website NewNownext, ranked it at number 46 on his list of the singer's 48 greatest songs, in honor of her 48th birthday. He hailed it a [...] "sweaty dip in self-possession and sex appeal". A reviewer from Sputnikmusic called it [...] "equally as strong as (if not stronger than)" [...] lead single [...] "Slow".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 2009, xx had {{appeared}} on several critics' lists of the year's best albums. It was ranked second by NME, sixth by Uncut, third by Pitchfork, ninth by Rolling Stone, and fourth by Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot. The Guardian named it the year's best record in their annual critics poll and Tim Jonze, the newspaper's editor, hailed it as not only [...] "the sound of 2009, [...] a distinctive musical statement of the like we may <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> hear again". It also finished seventh in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop poll of American critics and third in HMV's Poll of Polls, an annual list compiled by British music retailer HMV and collated from best-album nominations made by journalists in the English and Irish music press. In decade-end lists of the greatest records from the 2000s, The Sunday Times and its sister paper, The Times, ranked xx seventy-seventh and thirtieth, respectively. The record was {{also included in the}} 2010 edition of Robert Dimery's music reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In September of that year, xx won the Mercury Prize, an annual award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland. Before the nominations shortlist had been announced, bookmakers and critics considered the xx as favorites and predicted they would win over the more high-profile artists Corinne Bailey Rae, Paul Weller, and Dizzee Rascal. McCormick, one of the critics who predicted its victory, explained that it [...] "seemed the record that most represented Britain" [...] with its charmingly intimate style and unique take on modern pop tastes.|$|E
