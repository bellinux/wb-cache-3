Periphyton {{was subject to}} grazing by 1 - 6 individuals of juvenile Littorina littorea. Periphyton biomass was higher in the replacement aquaria than in the batch aquaria and higher in the full and the -Si medium than in the -NP medium. The N:C ratio of the periphyton increased with Littorina <b>number</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>batch</b> aquaria and was unaffected by Littorina number in the replacement aquaria. Diatoms were most dominant in the -NP treatments and rarest in the -Si treatments. Chlorophytes were dominant in the -Si and the fully enriched treatments, but also Cyanobacteria contributed significantly to periphyton biomass in those treatments under nutrient replacement. Somatic growth of Littorina was negatively correlated to Littorina density in the replacement aquaria and positively density dependent in the batch aquaria. The latter is explained by improved food quality under stronger grazing pressure...|$|E

40|$|In many {{practical}} applications of active learning, {{it is more}} cost-effective to request labels in large batches, rather than one-at-a-time. This is because the cost of labeling a large batch of examples at once is often sublinear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of examples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>batch.</b> <b>In</b> this work, we study the label complexity of active learning algorithms that request labels <b>in</b> a given <b>number</b> of batches, {{as well as the}} tradeoff between the total number of queries and the number of rounds allowed. We additionally study the total cost sufficient for learning, for an abstract notion of the cost of requesting the labels of a given number of examples at once. In particular, we find that for sublinear cost functions, it is often desirable to request labels in large batches (i. e., buying in bulk); although this may increase the total number of labels requested, it reduces the total cost required for learning...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a batch delivery single-machine scheduling problem in which jobs have an assignable common due window. Each job will incur an early (tardy) penalty {{if it is}} early (tardy) {{with respect to the}} common due window under a given schedule. There is no capacity limit on each delivery <b>batch,</b> and <b>the</b> cost per <b>batch</b> delivery is fixed and independent of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>batch.</b> <b>The</b> objective is to find the optimal size and location of the window, the optimal dispatch date for each job, as well as an optimal job sequence to minimize a cost function based on earliness, tardiness, holding time, window location, window size, and batch delivery. We show that the problem can be optimally solved in O(n 8) time by a dynamic programming algorithm under a reasonable assumption on the relationships among the cost parameters. A computational experiment is also conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. We also show that some special cases of the problem can be optimally solved by lower order algorithms. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
40|$|Scheduling and {{resource}} allocation to optimize performance criteria in multi-cluster heterogeneous environments {{is known as}} an NP-hard problem, {{not only for the}} resource heterogeneity, but also for the possibility of applying co-allocation to take advantage of idle resources across clusters. A common practice is to use basic heuristics to attempt to optimize some performance criteria by treating <b>the</b> jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waiting queue individually. More recent works proposed new optimization strategies based on Linear Programming techniques dealing with the scheduling of multiple jobs simultaneously. However, the time cost of these techniques makes them impractical for large-scale environments. Population-based meta-heuristics have proved their effectiveness for finding <b>the</b> optimal schedules <b>in</b> large-scale distributed environments with high resource diversification and large <b>numbers</b> of jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>batches.</b> <b>The</b> algorithm proposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present work packages <b>the</b> jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>batch</b> to obtain better optimization opportunities. It includes a multi-objective function to optimize not only the Makespan of <b>the</b> <b>batches</b> but also <b>the</b> Flowtime, thus ensuring a certain level of QoS from the users’ point of view. The algorithm also incorporates heterogeneity and bandwidth awareness issues, and is useful for scheduling jobs in large-scale heterogeneous environments. The proposed meta-heuristic was evaluated with a real workload trace. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing solutions that improve the performance with respect to other well-known techniques <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature.
