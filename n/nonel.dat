40|$|Takibi" is {{evaluated}} high in {{the history}} of Japanese modern literature as the novel that represents the frame of mind novel on the Taishou era period. In this novel, feelings usually personal have been expressed are considered as an experience shared by everyone. The purpose of this thesis is to search by what expression such a motif became possible. As a result of the analysis. "Takibi" has the narration abstracting individual of four characters, and passive position of "Jibun" who is forcalizer, and the metaphor expression putting out border between nature and man. This <b>nonel's</b> expression symbolize ranging of man, nature, and space. "Takibi" IS an important novel where the idea connected with the masterpiece of Shiga "Anya-Koro"...|$|R
50|$|<b>Nonel</b> is a {{shock tube}} {{detonator}} designed to initiate explosions, generally {{for the purpose}} of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500 ft/s (2,000 m/s) {{along the length of the}} tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. The design of <b>nonel</b> detonators incorporates patented technology, including the Cushion Disk (CD) and Delay Ignition Buffer (DIB) to provide reliability and accuracy in all blasting applications.|$|E

40|$|The Curve Fitting and Interpolation Model {{are applied}} in <b>Nonel</b> dosage {{detection}} {{in this paper}} firstly, and the gray of continuous explosive in the <b>Nonel</b> has been forecasted. Although the traditional infrared equipment establishes the relationship of explosive dosage and light intensity, but the forecast accuracy is very low. Therefore, gray prediction models based on curve fitting and interpolation are framed separately, and the deviations from the different models are compared. Simultaneously, combining on the sample library features, the cubic polynomial fitting curve of the higher precision is used to predict grays, and 5 mg- 28 mg <b>Nonel</b> gray values are calculated by MATLAB.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of mixtures of chemicals {{with the same}} target organ was examined in rats using nephrotoxicants with similar or dissimilar modes of action. In a 4 -wk feeding study, lysinoalanine, mercuric chloride, hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene and d-limonene, each affecting renal proximal tubular cells but through different modes of action, were administered simultaneously at their individual lowest-observed nephrotoxic-effect level (LONEL), no-observed-nephrotoxic-effect level (<b>NONEL)</b> and NONEL/ 4. Combined exposure at the LONEL resulted in increased growth depression and increased renal toxicity in male but not in female rats. Go-exposure at the <b>NONEL</b> produced only weak signs of toxicity (slightly retarded growth and increased renal weight), and rats co-exposed at the NONEL/ 4 did not show any treatment-related changes. The absence of an obviously. increased hazard on combined exposure at the <b>NONEL</b> suggested absence of synergism and probably also of additivity. In a subsequent study the additivity assumption (dose addition) was tested, using the similarly acting nephrotoxicants tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene and 1, 1, 2 -trichloro- 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropene. The compounds were given to female rats by daily oral gavage for 32 days either alone, at the LONEL and <b>NONEL</b> (= LONEL/ 4), or in combinations of four (at the <b>NONEL</b> and LONEL/ 2) or three (at the LONEL/ 3). Relative kidney weight was increased on exposure to the individual compounds at their LONEL and, to about the same extent, on combined exposure at the <b>NONEL</b> or the LONEL/ 3. As assessed by this endpoint, the renal {{toxicity of}} the mixtures corresponded to the effect expected {{on the basis of}} the additivity assumption. The other endpoints were not (or hardly) affected on combined exposure...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} comparison of excavation damage zones resulting from blasting with <b>nonel</b> detonators and blasting with electronic detonators. The <b>nonel</b> detonator {{is a common}} type of detonator used in drill-and-blast tunnel excavations, while the use of electronic detonators {{in recent years has}} also been gaining popularity in complex tunneling conditions. The tunnel has an overburden of 25 to 40 m. The field study involves an ultrasonic wave measurement in drill holes at two different tunnel sections separately excavated by using electronic detonators and <b>nonel</b> detonators. The results demonstrate that using electronic detonators can help limit the EDZ development in drill-and-blast tunnel excavations. The disturbed zone is dominated by a change of stress and hydraulic head state. The changes in rock mass properties are insignificant or reversible. The presence of the failed zone and damaged zone affects the short-term and long-term stability of the tunnel. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Micro-blast waves {{emerging}} from the open end of a detonation transmission tube were experimentally visualized in this study. A commercially available detonation transmission tube was used (<b>Nonel</b> tube, M/s Dyno Nobel, Sweden), which is a small diameter tube coated with {{a thin layer of}} explosive mixture (HMX traces of Al) on its inner side. The typical explosive loading for this tube is of the order of 18 mg/m of tube length. The blast wave was visualized using a high speed digital camera (frame rate 1 MHz) to acquire time-resolved schlieren images of the resulting flow field. The visualization studies were complemented by computational fluid dynamic simulations. An analysis of the schlieren images showed that although the blast wave appears to be spherical, it propagates faster along the tube axis than along a direction perpendicular to the tube axis. Additionally, CFD analysis revealed the presence of a barrel shock and Mach disc, showing structures that are typical of an underexpanded jet. A theory in use for centered large-scale explosions of intermediate strength gave good agreement with the blast trajectory along the tube axis. The energy of these micro-blast waves was found to be J and the average TNT equivalent was found to be. The repeatability in generating these micro-blast waves using the <b>Nonel</b> tube was very good and this opens up the possibility of using this device for studying some of the phenomena associated with muzzle blasts in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Since camera drivers {{provided}} by the different manufacturers are not compatible, machine vision systems must be redeveloped according to specific camera. It is great significant {{to work out the}} problem, which could improve the versatility of the inspection system. The reconfigurable technology has applied to image processing, image matching and so on. Hence, in the paper the reconfigurable image acquisition module is designed, which reserves some interfaces for the image detection module. Citing the <b>nonel</b> visual inspection system as an example, adopting DALSA and BASLER cameras to acquire the images, the images was displayed properly. Therefore, the compatibility of the image detection system has been improved greatly...|$|E
40|$|The Novel of <b>Nonel</b> and Vovel is a {{collaboration}} with the Palestinian artist Larissa Sansour that entails a graphic novel (Charta, 2009), digital collages and leaflets, public events, and an additional participatory piece entitled Falafel Road. The graphic novel charts {{the story of two}} anti-heroes, based on the Israeli-born and Palestinian-born identities of the artists, who try to save Palestine from the occupation and imagine a new liberated future. The work is rooted in my ongoing research into Jewish identities in the Arab and Islamic world, and in my research interest in the management of bodies under state control and in the creative and ethical conditions for artistic responses to the occupation of Palestine, both in the art world and outside of it. Each element of this collaborative project derives from our research into these issues. Falafel Road was themed around postcolonial questions regarding the systematic eradication and appropriation of Palestinian cultural heritage in Israel, including the case of the falafel, which has become a national culinary symbol of Israel. The work was set in 20 diverse falafel eateries in London and was advertised and open to the public, {{who took part in the}} meals and in relevant debates and discussions...|$|E
40|$|There {{are four}} large {{limestone}} quarries, located nearby Cairo metropolitan. Drilling and blasting operations {{are used to}} extract limestone for the cement industries. In these quarries, the blast vibration should be kept below a certain limit. One of these quarries is Tourah Portland Cement Company (TPCC) limestone quarry which, lies near important and historical large caves, within Tourah Mountain. Therefore, control of blast vibration level becomes very critical. A series of multi-holes blasts have been performed to answer several questions about the optimum scaled distance {{that can be used}} safely to avoid caves damage, what constitutes true timing and initiation system?, and their relation to the blast vibration level?. Four Tri-axial geophones located in a linear array, over a distance of 1. 0 km (0. 621 miles) from the quarry faces, they have synchronized by means of a GPS timing reference. The data retrieved from the geophones and subjected to different steps of processing and analysis. The field tests showed that {{there was a significant difference}} in the blast vibration level between top and bottom initiation systems, containing the same explosive charge per delay intervals. In the upper bench, the results showed that the blast optimization of vibration level requires small delay intervals at distance more than 800. 0 m (875 yards), between shot point and caves. This study helped TPCC limestone quarry to remain operating since the government permitted the continuation of blasting operations. In addition, the advantages of using <b>Nonel</b> system in comparison with VA electrical detonators, could lead to convince the government to raise the permitted explosive charge per day...|$|E
40|$|Blast-induced {{fragmentation}} plays {{a leading}} role on mining efficiency, hence many {{studies have been conducted}} {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms behind rock breakage and to improve the fragmentation. This report presents the results from field tests conducted at the Aitik mine belonging to Boliden Mineral AB in Sweden, which is part of a project called Vinnova. The project aims to evaluate the effects of short delay time blasting on fragmentation and other post-blast parameters which influence the comminution process, e. g. swelling and crushing. A total number of 6 benches were assigned for trials with different inter-hole delay times. Two of the benches were blasted with pyrotechnic <b>Nonel</b> caps and were used as references for further comparisons. Two benches were blasted with 1 ms of inter-hole delay time by use of electronic detonators. Two other benches were also blasted by electronic detonators, but with 3 ms and 6 ms of inter-hole delay time respectively. MWD (Measure While Drilling) system was used to log and analyze the drilling process in order to investigate the penetration rate and specific energy of drilling, which represent the hardness of the rock. GPS (Global Positioning System) and RTK (Real time Kinematic System) were used for measurements of benches’ swelling. The blasts were also filmed using a high-speed camera. Image analysis with Split-Desktop software was used to analyze the fragmentation of the rock after blasts. A series of images was shot from trucks carrying the ore and was later analyzed to obtain the fragmentation for each bench. Minestar integrated operation and mobile equipment management system was used to log the data from the fleet in the mine. The data were later used together with the crusher energy consumption logs to evaluate the energy efficiency of the crushing process for the ore from each bench. The tests showed that the inter-hole delay time of 3 ms resulted in the finest fragmentation among all benches; all examined values i. e. x 50, x 80 and xmax showed improvements upon other benches. However, the crushing energy of the ore from this trial was the highest among all. Two trials with 1 ms inter-hole delay time did not result in any significant variation compared to reference benches. The difference in x 50 values were ignorable, the same is true for crushing energy of the mentioned trials. The bench with inter-hole delay time of 6 ms resulted in the lowest crushing energy among other trials. However, the bench gave more boulders and coarser fragmentation compared to reference benches. Altogether, the results did not lead to any solid conclusion regarding the effect of the short delay times on fragmentation. Such ambiguity might be resulted by various sources of errors in data acquisition and analysis, as well as uncertainties regarding geology of the test area. In order to investigate the effect of delay times on blast results, more trials with more detailed data acquisition method is necessary. Godkänd; 2013; 20130429 (nikpet...|$|E
