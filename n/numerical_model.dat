5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E

25|$|The second {{method used}} was the linear-plus-cubic diffusion, {{which is a}} model of fault scarping. This method uses the {{diffusive}} process on hill slopes, such as rain-splash and wind erosion, that move sediment down hill. t = t’(SO)*2/k (0). The last method used to date the faulting was the morphologic dating without <b>numerical</b> <b>model.</b> Such a technique requires that down slope debris instability is a timedependent function of slope angle, in units of volume per time per length of contour (Nash, 2005). The scarp ages can be determined based on the relationship Ta/Tb = H*-2 b / H-2 b From the first method we can conclude that there were at least five seismic events that did not occur at the same time. From method two we can say than the faulting ages between 57ka to 377ka with surface offset of 11.2m that had a magnitude of 6-7 earthquakes. Finally the third method of dating concludes that the relative ages of the east Potrillo fault scarps ranges form 153,000 to 239,000.|$|E

The present work starts with a brief introduction to the different types of underground hy-droelectric schemes with an illustration to the specific works related to the hydraulic circuit, the powerhouse complex and surge chambers. Sections concerning the methodologies followed by <b>numerical</b> <b>modeling</b> of the underground structures and for risk analysis are presented. Also the numerical use of inverse methodologies for the identification of parameters is evaluated. Two examples of application of <b>numerical</b> <b>modeling</b> are pre-sented. The first case is related to the application of <b>numerical</b> <b>modeling</b> to the Venda Nova II hydroelectric scheme in Portugal, where innovative numerical methodologies were developed and validated using real test-ing and monitoring data. An optimization algorithm was used with a 3 D model for the power caverns. The se-cond case regards to numerical studies performed to Jinping II hydroelectric scheme in China.

500|$|In 2009, the NHC made {{moves to}} {{eliminate}} pressure and storm surge ranges from the categories, transforming {{it into a}} pure wind scale, called the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (Experimental) [...] The new scale became operational on May 15, 2010. The scale excludes flood ranges, storm surge estimations, rainfall, and location, which means a Category2 hurricane which hits a major city will likely do far more cumulative damage than a Category5 hurricane that hits a rural area. The agency cited various hurricanes as reasons for removing the [...] "scientifically inaccurate" [...] information, including Hurricane Katrina (2005) and Hurricane Ike (2008), which both had stronger than estimated storm surges, and Hurricane Charley (2004), which had weaker than estimated storm surge.

500|$|Later models {{used more}} {{complete}} equations for atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics. In 1959, Karl-Heinz Hinkelmann produced the first reasonable primitive equation forecast, 37 years after Richardson's failed attempt. Hinkelmann {{did so by}} removing small oscillations from the <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> during initialization. In 1966, West Germany and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive-equation models, followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977. Later additions to primitive equation models allowed additional insight into different weather phenomena. In the United States, solar radiation effects {{were added to the}} primitive equation model in 1967; moisture effects and latent heat were added in 1968; and feedback effects from rain on convection were incorporated in 1971. [...] Three years later, the first global forecast model was introduced. [...] Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971. [...] Efforts to involve sea surface temperature in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of the Pacific.|$|E

2500|$|For {{problems}} with coherent features, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, firelines, squall lines, and rain fronts, {{there is a}} need to adjust the <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> state by deforming the state in space (its grid) as well as by [...] correcting the state amplitudes additively. In Data Assimilation by Field Alignment, Ravela et al. introduce the joint position-amplitude adjustment model using ensembles, and systematically derive a sequential approximation which can be applied to both EnKF and other formulations. Their method does not make the assumption that amplitudes and position errors are independent or jointly Gaussian, as others do. The morphing EnKF employs intermediate states, obtained by techniques borrowed from image registration and morphing, instead of linear combinations of states.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{much of the}} {{theoretical}} groundwork necessary for numerical descriptions of wave evolution was laid. For forecasting purposes, it was realized that the [...] random nature of the sea state was best described by a spectral decomposition in which {{the energy of the}} waves was attributed to as many wave trains as necessary, each with a specific direction and period. This approach allowed to make combined forecasts of wind seas and swells. [...] The first <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> based on the spectral decomposition of the sea state was operated in 1956 by the French Weather Service, and focused on the North Atlantic. [...] The 1970s saw the first operational, hemispheric wave model: the spectral wave ocean model (SWOM) at the Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center.|$|E
2500|$|The {{precession}} rate {{is not a}} constant, but is (at the moment) slowly increasing over time, {{as indicated}} by the linear (and higher order) terms in T. In any case it must be stressed that this formula is only valid over a limited time period. It is a polynomial expression centred on the J2000 datum, empirically fitted to observational data, not on a deterministic model of the solar system. It is clear that if T gets large enough (far in the future or far in the past), the T² term will dominate and p will go to very large values. In reality, more elaborate calculations on the <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> of the Solar System show that the precessional constants have a period of about 41,000 years, the same as the obliquity of the ecliptic.
