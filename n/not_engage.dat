5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered to <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to <b>not</b> <b>engage,</b> the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} week of May 1941 a {{detachment}} of III./JG52, including Graf, was transferred to southern Greece to support Operation Merkur, the German invasion of Crete. The unit flew mostly ground attack and anti-shipping missions during the fortnight it was based there but Graf did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in any aerial combat.|$|E
5|$|Spiders in the French {{territory}} of New Caledonia in the Pacific {{were identified as}} L. hasselti in 1920, based on morphology. Their behaviour differs from Australian redbacks, as they do <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in sexual cannibalism and are less prone to biting humans. The first recorded envenomation in New Caledonia was in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw limited action during World War I, {{largely a}} result of the {{cautious}} strategies employed by the Regia Marina and its opponent, the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Nino Bixio was involved in the pursuit of a group of Austro-Hungarian raiders in December 1915, but did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> them before they escaped. Marsala briefly battled Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917. Both ships were sold for scrapping in the late 1920s, the victims of very tight naval budgets and their own poor performance.|$|E
5|$|Dante Alighieri was {{the first}} {{dreadnought}} battleship built for the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy), and completed in 1913. The ship served as a flagship during World War I, but saw very little action other than the Second Battle of Durazzo in 1918 where she did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> enemy forces. She never fired her guns in anger during her career. Dante Alighieri was refitted in 1923, stricken from the Navy List in 1928 and subsequently sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105mm howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Muhammad {{organized}} {{an attack against}} northern Arabia because of their previous defeat at the Battle of Mu'tah and reports of hostility adopted against Muslims. With great difficulty he assembled 30,000 men; half of whom {{on the second day}} returned with Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, untroubled by the damning verses which Muhammad hurled at them. Although Muhammad did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> with hostile forces at Tabuk, he received the submission of some local chiefs of the region.|$|E
5|$|Males {{mark their}} territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes {{made by the}} feet {{in the ground and}} twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have a {{peculiar}} habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{suspension}} of NATO flights, former US President Jimmy Carter personally negotiated a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia. Although there were some violations of this ceasefire, most of the parties in the conflict heeded it. NATO ordered its planes back in the air, but due to the diminished hostilities, they did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in any significant operations {{for the next several}} months. The reduced tensions resulting from the Carter ceasefire and the cessation of NATO air operations also led to the release of most of the UNPROFOR hostages over the next several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Slaves {{had special}} sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E
5|$|The Welles Declaration {{established}} a five-decade non-recognition of the Baltic states' annexation. The document had major significance for overall U.S. policy toward Europe {{in the critical}} year of 1940. While the U.S. did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> the Soviet Union militarily in the region, the Declaration enabled the Baltic states to maintain independent diplomatic missions, and Executive Order 8484 protected Baltic financial assets. Its essence was supported by all subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions. The Baltic states re-established their independence in 1990–91.|$|E

5|$|The ethical {{requirements}} of senators were significant. Senators could <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in banking or {{any form of}} public contract. They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce, and they could not leave Italy without permission from the Senate. In addition, since they were not paid, individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.|$|E
5|$|The high US {{demand for}} {{tickets for the}} tour, and the {{difficulty}} which some fans had in getting them, brought attention to rapidity with which tickets turned up on the higher-priced secondary market. Some tickets were being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} holding back tickets from general sale and delivering them straight into the secondary market, Live Nation said that U2 did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in this practice.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the bookseller and apothecary, the scholarly gentry class did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in trade professions, since scholars and government officials viewed the merchant class as lowly and contemptible. Sympathetic to the plight of farming peasants who had lost their land, a court edict of 94 CE stipulated that farming peasants who had been reduced to selling wares as street peddlers were not to be taxed as registered merchants, since the latter were heavily taxed by the state. Registered merchants, the majority being small urban shopkeepers, were obligated to pay commercial taxes in addition to the poll tax.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beaty {{returned}} to Cincinnati {{and raised his}} family. His son, A. Lee Beaty, became an Ohio state legislator and an assistant U.S. District Attorney for southern Ohio. He resumed {{his career as a}} turner and pursued amateur acting and public speaking engagements. He gave public readings for charitable causes and became a well-known elocutionist among the African American community of Cincinnati. Through the 1870s he acted in local theaters and directed music and drama exhibitions in the city. He wrote a play about a rich southern planter entitled Delmar, or Scenes in Southland, which was performed in January 1881 with himself in the lead role. Set in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Massachusetts, the work covered the end of slavery and transition to freedom for blacks from 1860 to 1875. The privately run play was well received, but Beaty did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> in self-promotion and it never moved into public theaters.|$|E
5|$|At 3:30p.m., the Kaštela TG {{turned around}} {{once more to}} attack Cape Lovište, but were engaged by nearby coastal {{artillery}} located on Korčula. Blitvenica was damaged in the shooting and the entire naval force moved north-west towards Šćedro Island. Iž sustained heavy damage and ran aground in Torac Bay off Hvar, and was abandoned. Olib sank between Pelješac and Hvar. Her crew was rescued by the remaining vessels in the group. At 7:00p.m., the fleet sailed south from Šćedro towards {{the western part of}} Korčula, seeking shelter as the Sirocco wind strengthened. As the ships approached Korčula, they were fired upon by coastal artillery at Črna Luka and Cape Privala, forcing them to turn west towards Vis. The Vis TG did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> Croatian positions on 16 November.|$|E
5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers {{illuminated by}} the landing lights. Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights and he did <b>not</b> <b>engage</b> another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E
