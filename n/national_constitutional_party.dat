At the time, the Sabor and Ban Josip Jelačić advocated the severance of ties with the Kingdom of Hungary, emphasising links to other South Slavic lands within the empire. Several prominent Croatian political figures emerged, such as Ante Starčević, Eugen Kvaternik, Franjo Rački and Josip Juraj Strossmayer. A period of neo-absolutism {{was followed by the}} Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement, which granted limited independence to Croatia. This was compounded by Croatian claims of uninterrupted statehood since the early Middle Ages as a basis for a modern state. Two political parties that evolved in the 1860s and contributed significantly to the sentiment were the Party of Rights, led by Starčević and Kvaternik, and the People's Party, led by Janko Drašković, Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski, Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Ivan Mažuranić.

At the time, the Sabor advocated the implicit severance of ties with the Kingdom of Hungary, emphasizing links to other South Slavic lands within the empire. A period of neo-absolutism was followed by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and Croatian–Hungarian Settlement, recognizing the limited independence of Croatia, together with reinvigorated claims of uninterrupted Croatian statehood. Two political parties that evolved in the 1860s and contributed significantly to this sentiment were the Party of Rights (1861–1929) and the People's Party. They were opposed by the <b>National</b> <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Party</b> that was in power for most of the period between the 1860s and 1918, which advocated closer ties between Croatia and Hungary. Another significant party formed in this era was the Serb People's Independent Party, which would later form the Croat-Serb Coalition with the Party of Rights and other Croat and Serb parties. This Coalition ruled Croatia between 1903 and 1918. The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), established in 1904 and led by Stjepan Radić, advocated Croatian autonomy but achieved only moderate gains by 1918. In the Kingdom of Dalmatia, two major parties were the People's Party, a branch of the People's Party active in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, and the Autonomist Party, which advocated maintaining the autonomy of Dalmatia, opposing the People's Party's demands for unifying Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia. The Autonomist Party was also linked to Italian irredentism. By the 1900s, the Party of Rights also made electoral gains in Dalmatia. In Dalmatia, the Autonomists won the first three elections held there in 1861, 1864 and 1867, while those from 1870 to 1908 were won by the People's Party. In 1861–1918 there were 17 elections in Croatia-Slavonia and 10 in Dalmatia.|$|E

In 1861-1918 there were 17 elections in Croatia-Slavonia and 10 in Dalmatia.Exercising its sovereignty once again on 29 October 1918, the Sabor decided on independence from Austria-Hungary and formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The council of the newly established state voted to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; however, the Sabor never confirmed that decision. The 1921 constitution defining the new kingdom as a unitary state, and the abolition of historical administrative divisions, effectively ended Croatian autonomy for the time and the Sabor did not convene until the 1940s. The Cvetković-Maček Agreement of August 1939 established the autonomous Province of Croatia, or Banovina of Croatia, in which the Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport, while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed ban (Viceroy or governor). Before any elections were held, the establishment was made obsolete with the beginning of World War II and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia which banned all political opposition. In 1942, three sessions of an unelected Sabor were held in the Independent State of Croatia; these were held between 23 February and 28 December 1942, when it was formally dissolved. The assembly had no real power as the state was under the direct rule of (the fascist) Ante Pavelić.|$|E

40|$|FOR UNION AND SLAVERY, FOR SLAVERY AND UNION: KNOW-NOTHINGS IN GEORGIA 1854 - 1860 by LESLYE JOY ALLEN Under the Direction of Dr. Wendy Hamand Venet ABSTRACT This thesis {{examines}} the Know-Nothing (or “American”) Party {{in the state}} of Georgia as a political entity whose leading members descended from the bipartisan <b>Constitutional</b> Union <b>Party</b> of Georgia in 1850. This thesis affirms that Georgia Know-Nothings emerged in 1854 and lasted until 1859 as a political party devoted to settling the sectional controversies brought on by the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. Their role in the 1856 presidential campaign of Millard Fillmore and the 1857 gubernatorial campaign of Benjamin Harvey Hill, along with their role and membership in the revitalized <b>national</b> <b>Constitutional</b> Union <b>Party</b> in 1860 are also critically examined. The major argument is that Georgia Know-Nothings were not nativist, but were conservative unionists whose aim was to protect slavery and prevent the secession of Georgia and the South by using ideologies and political techniques honed while they were members of Georgia’s <b>Constitutional</b> Union <b>Party.</b> INDEX WORDS: Georgia Know-Nothing Party, Benjamin H.

40|$|Summary: In {{the process}} of European integration, <b>national</b> <b>constitutional</b> law remains crucial, in several respects. The EU Constitution, in its {{broadest}} sense, builds on the common constitutional traditions and principles of the Member States, and EU law refers back to <b>national</b> <b>constitutional</b> law in many ways. <b>National</b> <b>constitutional</b> law contributes to constitutionalising the EU, to give it legitimacy, {{and to ensure that}} the EU and the Member States as its agents continue to comply with fundamental constitutional requirements, such as the rule of law, democracy and accountability, and the protection of fundamental rights. Also, from the <b>national</b> perspective, <b>national</b> <b>constitutional</b> law remains essential, since it provides the foundation of membership of the EU, it is decisive for the procedures to be followed when powers are transferred at times of accession and Treaty amendment, and it serves to provide the connection between the national and the EU legal orders. Participation in the EU requires adaptation of the <b>national</b> <b>constitutional</b> arrangements, and <b>national</b> constitutions should not be neglected in {{the process of}} the constitutionalisation of Europe. This paper looks into the <b>national</b> <b>constitutional</b> experience of the EU- 15 with the EU and asks whether lessons can be learned for candidate countries...|$|R
