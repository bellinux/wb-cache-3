500|$|Beecham and Sargent were allies {{from the}} early days of the London Philharmonic to Beecham's final months when they were {{planning}} joint concerts. They even happened to share the same birthday. When Sargent was incapacitated by tuberculosis in 1933, Beecham conducted a performance of Messiah at the Albert Hall to raise money to support his younger colleague. Sargent loved Beecham's company, and took in good part his quips, such as his reference to the rising conductor Herbert von Karajan, as [...] "a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent" [...] and, on learning that Sargent's car was caught in rifle fire in Palestine, [...] "I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>the</b> Arabs were so musical." [...] Beecham declared that Sargent [...] "is the greatest choirmaster we have ever produced ... he makes the buggers sing like blazes." [...] And on another occasion he said that Sargent was [...] "the most expert of all our conductors – myself excepted of course." ...|$|E

500|$|For his marimba performance, DePonte {{earned a}} Grammy Award {{nomination}} for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance with Orchestra, {{the first time}} that the Oregon Symphony or any of its musicians had been recognized by the Recording Academy. Following the announcement, DePonte admitted that he was surprised by the nomination and had not felt similar emotions since learning of his invitation to join the orchestra 26 years earlier: [...] "I am completely overwhelmed. I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>the</b> recording had been submitted." [...] DePriest said: [...] "The credit goes to Mary Tooze for making the recording possible, to Niel for his fine playing and to Tomas for writing such a wonderful piece. I am thrilled for everyone concerned." [...] Svoboda said of the nomination: [...] "The prestige goes to the orchestra. This is a great moment for our symphony." [...] The Oregon Symphony's director of public relations commented: [...] "The running joke is that forever more, the name of this organization is 'The Grammy-nominated Oregon Symphony Orchestra.' The Grammy acknowledgment is recognized as a mark of great artistic achievement. To be nominated is about as good as it gets." ...|$|E
500|$|The final {{song on the}} record, [...] "Whipping Post," [...] {{was written}} shortly after Allman {{returned}} to Jacksonville. The song came to him shortly before bed, but {{he was unable to}} acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas, as there was a child asleep in the room and he could not turn on the lights. Turning to his next best alternative, he struck two kitchen matches (one for light and one, later blown out, as a charcoal writing utensil) and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board. [...] "Whipping Post" [...] was similar in composition to [...] "Dreams" [...] in its first incarnation, with Oakley later creating the heavy bassline that starts off the track. Duane and Betts take quick solos before the track builds to an [...] "anguished climax," [...] leading to Gregg Allman's solo voice, singing the song's refrain: [...] "Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'." [...] Allman had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>the</b> intro was written in 11/4 time — [...] "I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with" [...] — until his brother pointed it out for him. [...] "My brother told me — I guess the day I wrote it — he said, 'That's good, man. I didn’t know you understood 11/4.' Of course I said something intelligent like, 'What's 11/4?' Duane just said, 'Okay, dumbass, I'll try to draw it up on paper for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|MacNeil, who had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>the</b> Mint was {{changing}} his designs, requested permission {{to visit the}} Mint on October 24 to discuss the conversion of his approved models into actual coins. [...] Chaffin (again briefly acting director in von Engelken's absence) declined {{to pay for his}} journey, and MacNeil did not come. [...] According to Burdette, [...] "the action saved the government less than $20 in October, but may have cost many times that amount before the revised quarter design was accepted the following year." [...] Von Engelken viewed sample coins about that time. [...] He objected to two leaves of the olive branch on the obverse that lay within the angle of the [...] "L" [...] in [...] "Liberty" [...] and asked that they be removed; this was done. [...] The Mint Director then met with Secretary McAdoo to view coins struck from the modified dies. [...] McAdoo felt that the figure of Liberty was indistinct, but von Engelken persuaded him that could not be changed without considerable delay. [...] They did decide that the Mint could make the shield clearer, and approved the design with that instruction. [...] Feeling it was impossible to make the change in time to strike coins in 1916, von Engelken instructed Joyce that beginning in 1917, the figure of Liberty should be sharpened. [...] By the time dies were finally made, the year 1916 was almost over, and only 52,000 quarters were struck. [...] This was done as proof that the Barber design had been replaced in the 25th year, as Mint officials believed was required.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>the</b> record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E

In an interview with WAVY-TV, Portsmouth, Virginia, Washington Redskins running back Clinton Portis and a teammate, offensive tackle Chris Samuels, defended Vick. Portis said that if Vick is charged and convicted of dog fighting, [...] "then you're putting him behind bars for no reason. I don't {{know if he was}} fighting dogs or not, but it's his property. It's his dog. If that's what he wants to do, do it." [...] Those comments were sharply criticized by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Redskins and Portis himself later apologized, stating that his controversial remarks about dog fighting were insensitive and that he now realizes he [...] "shouldn't have made the comments." [...] He added, [...] "At that time I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>the</b> love people have for animals, and I didn't consider it when I made those comments." ...|$|E
2500|$|A few unusual {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on Kingman Island. In October 1941, {{the body of}} a homeless African American man was found on the island. Police concluded that the man had been attacked and killed by a wild dog, and the body almost completely devoured. Attempts to capture the animal proved fruitless. A seven-year-old boy, which the local media dubbed the [...] "Cold Crusoe" [...] (after the fictional shipwrecked character of Robinson Crusoe), was rescued from Island No. 3 in February 1956. The boy allegedly swam to the island using a log as a raft. With no sign of a boat, police believed the boy had drowned. After several days, the police finally located the child (who revealed how he got to the island). And in 1959, a 13-year-old boy in a stolen automobile plunged into Kingman Lake while being chased by police. The boy later said he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>the</b> lake was there.|$|E

2500|$|On first down, Johnson spiked {{the ball}} to stop the clock. On the next play, with the down marker {{accurately}} indicating second down, a power run into the line by Eric Bieniemy was stopped {{just short of the}} goal line. Colorado then called its third and final timeout. During the timeout, the chain crew failed to flip the down marker to note that it was now third down. On the next play, with the down marker showing second down when it was really third down, the Buffaloes made the same call and Bieniemy was again stopped short of the end zone. Johnson then spiked the ball (thinking it was third down when it was really fourth) to stop the clock with two seconds left. He later claimed that he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>the</b> officials had made a mistake, and believed he was spiking the ball on third down. On the following play – fourth down according to the marker, but [...] "fifth down" [...] in reality – Johnson kept the ball himself. [...] Whether the ball crossed the goal line before Johnson was down remains a subject of some argument, but he was awarded a touchdown.|$|E
