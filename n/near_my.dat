500|$|Of Keats's {{six major}} odes of 1819, [...] "Ode to Psyche", was {{probably}} written first and [...] "To Autumn" [...] written last. Sometime between these two, he wrote [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". It {{is possible that}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] was written between 26 April and 18 May 1819, based on weather conditions and similarities between images in the poem and those in a letter sent to Fanny Brawne on May Day. The poem was composed at the Hampstead house Keats shared with Brown, possibly while sitting beneath a plum tree in the garden. According to Keats' friend Brown, Keats finished the ode in just one morning: [...] "In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest <b>near</b> <b>my</b> house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat {{for two or three}} hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of the nightingale." [...] Brown's account is personal, as he claimed the poem was directly influenced by his house and preserved by his own doing. However, Keats relied on both his own imagination and other literature as sources for his depiction of the nightingale.|$|E

2500|$|To see David Campese in seven-a-side {{play was}} another delight. The {{abbreviated}} version {{seemed to be}} made for him. Of course it was invented <b>near</b> <b>my</b> home area of the Scottish border country at Melrose and there was massive interest in the appearance of David Campese in a Randwick squad who were special guests in 1990 at the ‘Blue Riband’ of the spring sevens series, the Melrose tournament. Came the day and the rain simply teemed down on a pitch that was treacherous to say the least. The local players rubbed their hands in gleeful anticipation. Here was the weather and ground conditions to which they were accustomed and in which they could revel. Such hazardous conditions would cut the famous Wallaby down to size. The Borderers would show the great man how it should be done. Some hope! He was the star of the show, the tournament’s top try-scorer and points-scorer with 44 of Randwick’s 92 points. Not only that but he was like a duck in water, completely at home, fizzing about in the ‘glaur’, the Border name for cloying mud, as to the manner born. He had been preparing himself for water sports having previously asked that his Melrose billet should have a swimming pool! He saved Randwick from semi-final defeat with a typical touch of Campese magic. Randwick were 15-12 in arrears to Melrose with time almost up when he received the ball at halfway and took off like an inebriated skater. Some metres short of the goal line he produced a dive that would have dome credit to an Olympic swimmer and slithered his way to a momentous try that took Randwick to the final in which they beat the renowned sevens artistes from Kelso who included the famous ‘White Shark’, John Jeffrey. David admitted afterwards that he was grateful for the rain and mud: ‘I wouldn’t have scored that try on a dry day because I {{would not have been able}} to aquaplane into the corner.’ ...|$|E
