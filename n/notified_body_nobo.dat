50|$|Compliance to {{type-approval}} requirements can be {{denoted by}} a third-party marking {{on the back}} of the product (e.g. ABS, TUV,UL, CSA), or by a Type-Approval certificate obtained by a manufacturer and kept on file. The CE mark found {{on the back of}} many electronic devices does not mean that the product has obtained Type Approval in the European Union. The CE mark is the manufacturer's declaration that the system/assembly meets the MINIMUM safety requirements of all the Directives (laws) applicable to it, and of itself, does not signify any Third Party involvement in the design or testing of a system/assembly. Many of the New Approach safety directives do not mandate third party involvement at all (e.g. LVD, EMD), and the ones that do (e.g. PED, MDD, ATEX) only require <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> (<b>NoBo)</b> involvement above a certain degree of risk category. When the risk category mandates this involvement, the CE Marking on the system/assembly will be followed by the NoBo number, which right to use is granted by the NoBo after the required design review, testing or auditing, as spelled out in the Conformity Assessment options of each Directive. See http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/cemarking/about-ce-marking/index_en.htm. On the other hand, in China type approval is denoted by the CCC mark.|$|E

2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} <b>notified</b> <b>bodies</b> and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states {{to take a hard look}} at the regulatory system, including how <b>notified</b> <b>bodies</b> play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on <b>notified</b> <b>bodies,</b> to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking <b>notified</b> <b>bodies</b> to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of <b>Notified</b> <b>Bodies</b> Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|R

5000|$|Compliance with ISO 13485 {{is often}} seen {{as the first step}} in {{achieving}} compliance with European regulatory requirements. The conformity of Medical Devices and In-vitro Diagnostic Medical Device according to European Union Directives 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC and 98/79/EEC must be assessed before sale is permitted. One of the major requirements to prove conformity is the implementation of the Quality Management System according ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 and ISO 14971. Although the European Union Directives do not mandate certification to ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 the preferred method to prove compliance to such standards is to seek its official certification which is issued by certifying organizations known as [...] "Registrars". Several registrars also act as <b>Notified</b> <b>Body.</b> For those medical devices requiring the pre-market involvement of a <b>Notified</b> <b>Body,</b> the result of a positive assessment from the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> is the certificate of conformity allowing the CE mark and the permission to sell the medical device in the European Union.A very careful assessment of the company Quality Management System by the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body,</b> together with the review of the required Technical Documentation, is a major element which the <b>Notified</b> <b>Body</b> takes into account to issue the certificate of conformity to the company product(s).|$|R

2500|$|A <b>notified</b> <b>body,</b> in the European Union, is {{an entity}} {{that has been}} {{accredited}} by a Member State to assess whether a product {{to be placed on}} the market meets certain preordained standards. Conformity assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the manufacturing environment and processes associated with it. [...] For example, a <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> may designate that a medical device conforms to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices. With this Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer can label the product with the CE Mark, which is required for distribution and sale in the E.U. Additionally, the E.U. member state accrediting the <b>notified</b> <b>body</b> will then inform the European Commission that the product complies with set standards (or not).|$|R

The German case against TÜV was dismissed initially and on appeal in district and regional courts, and an appeal to a German federal court resulted in referral of {{the case to the}} Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for clarification [...] "on three issues on the interpretation of the Medical Devices Directive." [...] Additionally, the original restitution decision by French courts was appealed and overturned on July 2, 2015, forcing affected patients to return their interim compensation, leaving many patients without recourse.|$|R
