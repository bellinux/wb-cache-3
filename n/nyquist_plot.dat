At initial state, the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>plots</b> consist of one compressed semicircle in high and intermediate frequency ranges that reflect charge transfer resistance and a straight line inclined at a constant angle to the real axis in lower frequency range that reflects the diffusion properties of lithium ion in solid materials.

Since the reaction impedance due to direct oxidation of interfering species was significantly higher than that of glucose oxidation catalyzed by glucose oxidase, unfavorable influence from interfering species could be eliminated without needing a complicated sensor device.

A method to prepare calibration curves from AC impedance measurements with a fixed frequency was established so that this technique can be put to practical use.
