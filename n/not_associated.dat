5|$|Another {{classification}} scheme considers genetic and demographic factors. Type 1 {{has a positive}} family history, starts {{before the age of}} 40, and is associated with the human leukocyte antigen, HLA-Cw6. Conversely, type 2 does not show a family history, presents after age 40, and is <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with HLA-Cw6. Type 1 accounts for about 75% of persons with psoriasis.|$|E

5|$|Risk {{factors for}} the {{development}} of acne, other than genetics, have not been conclusively identified. Possible secondary contributors include hormones, infections, diet and stress. Studies investigating the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of acne have been inconclusive. Sunlight and cleanliness are <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with acne.|$|E
5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils and spinach) are <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with gout. Neither is total consumption of protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer and spirits.|$|E
5|$|The glaciers on Mount Rainier can {{generate}} mudflows, through glacial outburst floods <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with any eruption. The South Tahoma Glacier generated 30 floods in the 1980s and early 1990s, {{and again in}} August, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Use of topical aloe vera is <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with {{significant}} side effects. Oral ingestion of aloe vera, however, may cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea {{which in turn}} can decrease the absorption of drugs.

5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|Endpoints {{are grouped}} into {{interfaces}} and each interface {{is associated with}} a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a composite device. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.|$|E

5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at any price, either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E
5|$|Female {{homosexual}} {{behavior may}} be present in every culture, although {{the concept of a}} lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.|$|E
5|$|Florida International University {{ecologist}} Suzanne Koptur {{reported the}} presence of extrafloral nectaries on F. aurea figs in the Florida Everglades. Extrafloral nectaries are structures which produce nectar but are <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with flowers. They are usually interpreted as defensive structure and are often produced in response to attack by insect herbivores. They attract insects, primarily ants, which defend the nectaries, thus protecting the plant against herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Globally about 106 {{million cases}} of {{chlamydia}} and 106 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2008. The {{number of cases}} of PID however, is not clear. It is estimated to affect about 1.5 percent of young women yearly. In the United States PID is estimated to affect about one million people yearly. A type of intrauterine device (IUD) known as the Dalkon shield led to increased rates of PID in the 1970s. Current IUDs are <b>not</b> <b>associated</b> with this problem after the first month.|$|E
