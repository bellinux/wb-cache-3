5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two.

5|$|Troilus, however, {{after he}} had learned of his father's {{intention}} {{to go ahead and}} release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, was overwhelmed and completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished sighs, and laments, because he cherished her with the great fervour of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of blazing passion. There was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his dear ones who could console him.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most of {{the larger}} Orkney islands, the {{derivation}} of the name 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for island, but the first two syllables {{are more difficult to}} interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be hjalpandis-øy (helpful island) owing to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay, which may suggest a derivation from Judge's island. Another suggestion is Hyalpandi's island, although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.|$|E

25|$|The typical {{frontier}} society therefore was one {{in which}} class distinctions were minimized. The wealthy speculator, if one was involved, usually remained at home, so that ordinarily <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> wealth was a resident. The class of landless poor was small. The great majority were landowners, {{most of whom were}} also poor because they were starting with little property and had not yet cleared much land nor had they acquired the farm tools and animals which would one day make them prosperous. Few artisans settled on the frontier except for those who practiced a trade to supplement their primary occupation of farming. There might be a storekeeper, a minister, and perhaps a doctor; and {{there were a number of}} landless laborers. All the rest were farmers.|$|E

25|$|One of Boas's most {{important}} books, The Mind of Primitive Man (1911), integrated his theories concerning {{the history and}} development of cultures and established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years. In this study he established that in any given population, biology, language, material and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these dimensions is reducible to another. In other words, he established that culture {{does not depend on}} any independent variables. He emphasized that the biological, linguistic, and cultural traits of any group of people are the product of historical developments involving both cultural and non-cultural forces. He established that cultural plurality is a fundamental feature of humankind, and that the specific cultural environment structures much individual behavior.|$|E
25|$|At about 9:00 pm, twelve boats {{armed with}} carronades {{and filled with}} 180 marines and sailors from the Plantagenet and the Rota were towed into battle by the Carnation, which stopped out of gun range. There the boats divided into three {{divisions}} for another attack. Lieutenant William Matterface commanded the boats and Carnation was directed to provide covering fire. Loyd anchored the Rota and the Plantagenet {{a few miles away}} and they did not participate in the engagement. Just after 9:00 pm the British headed forward, the boats advanced but accurate American fire and the current kept the Carnation from closing the range and she was damaged. It took Lieutenant Matterface until about 12:00 am for his boats to reach the General Armstrong, largely due to the current but partly because of where Loyd had stopped his ships. While the Americans were waiting they offloaded three of their cannon and erected a battery so when the British arrived, a boarding was attempted but the American gunners sank two of the British boats before they could get close, captured two more and killed many of the boarders with swords and musketry at point blank range. Lieutenant Matterface and several other officers were killed and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> sufficient rank survived to lead the remaining Britons.|$|E
25|$|After {{trying to}} escape the dollhouse in the season five finale, Charles punishes Emily, Hanna, Spencer, Aria, and Mona, {{subjecting}} them to various types of torture while Alison, Ezra, Caleb, and Toby {{try to find a}} way to help find the girls. Andrew becomes a suspect after being reported missing. Realizing what Charles is planning to do with Alison, the Liars hatch a plan to get out of the dollhouse by setting his vault on fire. The plan worked successfully, and the girls get out of the dollhouse where they are met by Alison, Ezra, Caleb, Toby, and the police. Andrew is arrested and accused of kidnapping the girls. However, the girls are far from okay, as they all suffer from PTSD from their time in captivity. Another girl, Sara Harvey, who went missing the same time Ali did, is found in the dollhouse, reportedly having been held there for two years. Unable to deal with her home life, she runs away and stays with Emily for a while. Meanwhile, Ali tries to get answers out of her dad about Charles DiLaurentis, but he insists there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> that name in their family; however, Jason remembers Charles as his imaginary friend when he was a kid. Later, Andrew is released from police custody because of lack of evidence, and the Liars realize that he isn't Charles after all.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} Dr. Silas Mitchell's series of {{articles}} for The Chess Monthly that the secret was fully revealed.

500|$|Nelson Goodman had {{formulated}} {{a similar}} notion in Fact, Fiction and Forecast in 1956. In that work, Goodman {{went as far}} as to suggest that there is [...] "no one world, but many worlds, each created by the human mind." [...] Putnam rejected this form of social constructivism, but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the [...] "one, true" [...] description of the world. This does not imply relativism, for Putnam, because not all descriptions are equally correct and the ones that are correct are not determined subjectively.|$|E

500|$|Alexander H. Smith related a {{story of}} how unique {{circumstances}} {{led to the development}} of a local superstition about the species:... the members of a family here in Ann Arbor were poisoned, some fatally, as the result of eating caps of a species of Amanita. The next year Volvaria bombycina fruited on a maple tree at the home of these people, and the story was circulated that some of the spores of the poisonous fungus, which caused the deaths the year before, had escaped from the house, lodged in the tree, germinated, grew and were now producing fruiting bodies. Consequently the carpophores of the Volvaria were held in great awe by the neighbors, and soon came to be referred to as the [...] "ghost mushroom". <b>No</b> <b>one,</b> <b>of</b> course, would consider eating them.|$|E

[...] This vignette offers a snapshot into life just north of the United States-Mexico border for two girls who are presumably of Mexican descent. Lucy's home is portrayed as a low-income, Mexican-American family. [...] Her mother is overworked and busy with many children while her father is rarely around. [...] However, the story focuses on the freedom that the girls have when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> authority is watching; for example, waving at strangers, jumping on mattresses, scratching mosquito bites, picking scabs, and somersaulting in dresses.|$|E
500|$|In August 1956, Drew {{fell ill}} and many {{within the party}} urged him to step aside, feeling that the Progressive Conservatives needed {{vigorous}} leadership with an election likely within a year. He resigned in late September, and Diefenbaker immediately announced his candidacy for the leadership. A number of Progressive Conservative leaders, principally from the Ontario wing of the party, started a [...] "Stop Diefenbaker" [...] movement, and wooed University of Toronto president Sidney Smith as a possible candidate. When Smith declined, they could find <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> comparable stature to stand against Diefenbaker. At the convention in Ottawa in December, Diefenbaker won on the first ballot, and the dissidents reconciled themselves to his victory. After all, they reasoned, Diefenbaker was now 61 and unlikely to lead the party {{for more than one}} general election, an election they believed would be won by the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E
