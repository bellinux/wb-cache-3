The Pulse Laser Imaging (PLI) technique was applied for visualising the back-stream melt flow phenomena with an analogue water atomizer and the associated PLI images compared with numerical results. In the investigation a Convergent–Divergent (C–D) discrete <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> die at five different atomization gas pressures of 1 – 5 MPa, with different <b>gas</b> exit <b>jet</b> distances of 1. 65, 1. 6, 1. 55, 1. 5, 1. 45 and 1. 40 mm from the melt nozzle external wall, was combined with four melt <b>nozzles</b> of varying <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> mis-match angles of 0 °, 3 °, 5 °, and 7 ° relative to the melt nozzle external wall (referred to as nozzle types 1 – 4). The results show that nozzle type 1 with the smallest mis-match angle of zero degrees has highest back-stream flow at an atomization gas pressure of 1 MPa and a <b>gas</b> die exit <b>jet</b> located between 1. 65 mm and 1. 5 mm from the external melt nozzle wall.

40|$|A {{previously}} developed {{mathematical model}} is amended to more accurately incorporate {{the effects of}} lift and drag on single dust particles in order to predict their behavior {{in the wake of}} high velocity gas flow. The model utilizes output from a CFD or DSMC simulation of exhaust from a rocket <b>nozzle</b> hot <b>gas</b> <b>jet.</b> An extension of the Saffman equation for lift based on the research of McLaughlin (1991) and Mei (1992) is used, while an equation for the Magnus force modeled after the work of Oesterle (1994) and Tsuji et al (1985) is applied. A relationship for drag utilizing a particle shape factor (phi = 0. 8) is taken from the work of Haider and Levenspiel (1989) for application to non-spherical particle dynamics. The drag equation is further adjusted to account for rarefaction and compressibility effects in rarefied and high Mach number flows according to the work of Davies (1945) and Loth (2007) respectively. Simulations using a more accurate model with the correction factor (Epsilon = 0. 8 in a 20 % particle concentration gas flow) given by Richardson and Zaki (1954) and Rowe (1961) show that particles have lower ejection angles than those that were previously calculated. This is more prevalent in smaller particles, which are shown through velocity and trajectory comparison to be more influenced by the flow of the surrounding gas. It is shown that particles are more affected by minor changes to drag forces than larger adjustments to lift forces, demanding a closer analysis of the shape and behavior of lunar dust particles and the composition of the surrounding gas flow...|$|R

40|$|The IGISOL Laser Ion Source Trap (LIST) is {{a method}} in which a {{supersonic}} <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> is used to transport thermalized nuclear reaction products from a gas cell into a sextupole radio frequency ion guide (SPIG) while removing any non-neutral part of the jet by a positively biased repeller electrode. Specific atom species are resonantly re-ionized with laser radiation in the SPIG which enables the study of exotic nuclei without isobaric contamination. In {{the first part of}} this work the repelling effect is studied through a series of ion optical Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulations were able to support the hypothesis that the constant collisions between the fast moving buffer gas atoms and the ions provides additional momentum to overcome potential barriers of several tens of volts, explaining the need for high repelling electrode potentials in practice. The simulations were also used to investigate the differences between helium and argon buffer gases and different repelling geometries. The experimental behaviour of the repelling efficiency as a function of repelling potential was qualitatively reproduced. The second part of this work concentrated on the supersonic <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> formation and the parameters that affect the <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> properties, in particular the width.

This method of visualizing <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> in water can be used to investigate the <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> structure, development and interaction with the environment where injection takes place. The fuel injector used is called Spark Plug Fuel Injector (SPFI). SPFI is a low cost conversion device for conversion to compressed natural gas direct injection (CNGDI) in spark ignition engine. The experiment was carried out to measure the <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> of SPFI by using pure gaseous nitrogen as compressed natural gas substitute for safety proposes. Nitrogen was injected at 40, 50 and 60 bar with different length of SPFI’s fuel path. The images of the gas bubbles which formed at the nozzle of the SPFI for different time after the start of injection (SOI) from a direct fuel injector were captured using a digital camera where exposure times were adjusted accordingly. The fuel injection was synchronized with a flash light using MOSFET-controlled circuit and two pulse generators. Two sets of SPFI with different fuel path length were used. Results showed that the SPFI with shorter fuel path achieved shorter fuel delivery time and less pressure loss. The <b>gas</b> <b>jets</b> of the longer SPFI were 11. 70 % and 2. 5 % shorter and narrower than that of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> of shorter SPFI. The results also showed that higher injection pressure increased both <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> length and width of SPFI and the shape of the <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> were in agreement with the vortex ball model [1] but with different degree of penetration compared to <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> in air environment.

30|$|Because {{supersonic}} <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> has {{the characteristics}} of high temperature, high pressure and high speed, {{there are two main}} difficulties in numerical computation. One is that the numerical computation of supersonic <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> with complicated geometric model and flow characteristics is sensitive to initial field. The initial deviation from actual physical field will cause difficulty of convergence, even divergence at the beginning of computation. The other is that a high-precision discrete format, appropriate turbulence model and boundary conditions are needed to capture shock wave and expansion wave of the flow field, which leads to a long computation time and large memory usage. Therefore, domestic and foreign scholars usually use two-dimensional numerical simulation model to carry out the research [9 – 11]. But the flow information of two-dimensional numerical results is limited, which is unable to analyze the anisotropic impact effect of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> on a jet blast deflector.

The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used to simulate numerically the impact effect of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> from aircraft engines on a jet blast deflector by using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and turbulence models. First of all, during the pre-processing of numerical computation, a sub-domains hybrid meshing scheme is adopted to reduce mesh number and improve mesh quality. Then, four different turbulence models including shear-stress transport (SST) k-w, standard k-w, standard k-ε and Reynolds stress model (RSM) are used to compare and verify the correctness of numerical methods for <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> from a single aircraft engine.

The results show that SST k-w turbulence model is more suitable for the numerical simulation of compressible viscous <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> with high prediction accuracy. Finally, the impact effect of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> from two aircraft engines on a jet blast deflector is analyzed based on the above numerical method, not only the flow parameters of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> and the interaction regularity between <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> and the jet blast deflector are got, but also the thermal shock properties and dynamic impact characteristics of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> impacting the jet blast deflector are got.

The ideal results {{can be obtained by}} testing techniques such as PIV and LDV. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate data in the case of complicated geometry and the contradiction between geometric similarity and dynamic similarity. Furthermore, the experimental method has the problem of long cycle and high cost, which is also easy to be affected by scale effect, external interference and other factors. It is difficult to reflect the true situation of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> [3, 4]. At present, the widely used analytical method like one-dimensional/quasi one-dimensional is to establish a physical model and a mathematical model of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> by simplifying and assuming the limits of solid boundary. It ignores turbulent effect, flow viscosity and wall interference of <b>gas</b> <b>jet,</b> which makes a large deviation between computational results and experimental data [5 – 7]. In contrast, using a numerical method based on RANS equations to compute the impact effect of <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> is more effective, and more detailed flow field information can be obtained [8].|$|R
