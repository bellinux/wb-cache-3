6000|$|... "It is {{too late}} <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of that," [...] said Eric. [...] "Hall is a well-skilled man, and, for the rest, fear not: I will watch him." ...|$|E
60|$|Mar. My lord, {{we are not}} <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of kindness. If you {{acknowledge}} I {{have saved}} your life, Be grateful in return, and do an act, Your honour, though unasked by me, requires.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{very kind}} of you to invite me in here," [...] he began bitterly, [...] "when you are so run after by every one, and to leave Judge Fletcher just <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me, but I suppose you are simply pitying me for being a fool!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What signifies it <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of my father?" [...] {{said the}} damsel, pettishly; then {{instantly}} changing to {{a tone of}} deep feeling, she added, [...] "my father has this day lost that which will make him hold light the loss of all the gear he has left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do very well," [...] he {{asserted}} mournfully. [...] "But if you gentlemen, {{if you had}} turned up here only three months ago--ay, {{less than three months}} ago--you would have found somebody very different from what I am <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you. It's true. What do you think of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} and Diana will <b>now</b> proceed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> all night," [...] said Marilla sarcastically, {{as the girls}} went upstairs. Marilla was always sarcastic after any self-betrayal.|$|R
60|$|Everybody <b>now</b> began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> at once. Harry's {{father was}} so delighted {{to find his}} boy again, {{that he did not}} care to explain anything, and he and Harry walked off together.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the barber}} has {{properly}} filled up the customer with information of this sort, he rapidly removes his whiskers {{as a sign that}} the man is <b>now</b> fit <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> and lets him out of the chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, we'll forget it; you did {{not mean}} it, you could not think it. It is useless <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of escaping, for the Sergeant cannot be moved; and the {{blockhouse}} must be defended, cost what it will. Maybe Lundie will get the tidings of our disaster, and send a party to raise the siege." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{these are}} topics {{familiar}} from my boyhood, and which I am apt to pursue; and lest I should be tempted <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> too long about them, I will, in conclusion, {{give you a}} sentiment, most appropriate, I am sure, {{in the presence of}} such writers as Bryant, Halleck, and--but I suppose I must not mention the ladies here - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} very differently, Emily, that under no {{circumstances}} will I have you taken to another home. I cannot understand much of all this yet, but I suppose I shall come to see it. If Lopez be, as you say, ruined, it is well that I have still {{enough for us to}} live on. This is a bad time just <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about your husband's affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well," [...] he said, turning resolutely on his heel. [...] "I go <b>now</b> <b>to</b> make <b>talk</b> {{with the}} chiefs, {{so that they}} may know I am gone to show the Russians the way." ...|$|R
60|$|Mark gladly {{agreed to}} the proposal. She turned the {{conversation}} <b>now</b> <b>to</b> India, and <b>talked</b> of her life there.|$|R
50|$|At {{one time}} K9 was the {{internal}} codename for the dual-core AMD64 processors as the brand Athlon 64 X2, however AMD has distanced {{itself from the}} old K series naming convention, and <b>now</b> seeks <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a portfolio of products, tailored to different markets.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Undy,' said he, 'pray {{bear with}} me a while. The truth is, I cannot endure this misery any longer. I do not now want to blame anyone but myself. The thing has been done, and it is useless <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of blame. The thing has been done, and all that now remains for me is to undo it; to put this girl's money back again, and get this horrid weight from off my breast.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Means must be found," [...] said Lady Montfort. [...] "We cannot stop <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about means. That {{would be}} a mere waste of time. The thing must be done. I am now going to your sister, to consult with her. All {{you have got to}} do is to make up your mind that you will be in the next parliament, and you will succeed; for {{everything}} in this world depends upon will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eleanor, that is, Miss Harding, if {{she thinks}} fit,--that is, if her father--or, rather, if she--or, indeed, he,--if {{they find it}} necessary--but there is no {{necessity}} <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Eleanor Harding; but this I will say, that if she {{has the kind of}} spirit for which I give her credit, she will not condemn me for doing what I think to be a duty." [...] And Bold consoled himself with the consolation of a Roman.|$|E
50|$|It {{was pretty}} much 'Come on in and vote'.… We're going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{football}} <b>now.</b> We're going <b>to</b> stop <b>talking</b> about CBAs and lockouts and <b>now</b> we're going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about rules and video and getting ourselves ready to work football games.|$|R
60|$|Ralph never had, {{and as a}} man <b>now</b> came up <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{him about}} hay, the dog and {{everything}} connected with it passed out of his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "That doesn't {{interest}} me, especially, sir," [...] answered Kenneth, smiling. [...] "I'm not electioneering just <b>now.</b> I've come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{with you}} about young Gates." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] says I, making {{shift to}} force a laugh {{in spite of the}} anxiety with which I was consumed; [...] "it is a mere scratch, and nothing to speak of. There is no time <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of such little matters as this, but only of leaving the ship, for we can defend {{ourselves}} no longer. Get together what things you need from your cabin, and make haste, for there is no time to lose." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Now,</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of any {{ordinary}} bird swooping, and fluttering, and tugging, {{does not}} sound very tremendous; but, reader, had you witnessed {{the manner in}} which that enormous albatross conducted itself, you wouldn't have stared with amazement--oh, no! You wouldn't have gone home with your mouth as wide open as your eyes, and have given a gasping account of what you had seen--by no means! You wouldn't have talked of feathered steam-engines, or of fabled rocs, or of winged elephants in the air--certainly not! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you know}} what my lord approves of and what he disapproves you {{understand}} him a great deal better than I do. And if you mind what he approves or disapproves, you care for his opinion {{a great deal more}} than I do. My cousin is here <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me,--about his own affairs, and I mean to see him,--alone." [...] Then she left the little room, and went down to that in which Frank was waiting for her, without the company of Miss Cassewary.|$|E
60|$|The mulattoes <b>now</b> began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{of other}} matters--how quickly the insurrection would spread, the towns {{that were to}} be attacked, and the steps to be taken--and he {{therefore}} quietly made off, and waited for Dinah at the place agreed on. It {{was not long before}} she arrived with her first load.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} I did help much, {{but after the}} horse knocked me down I went to the {{homestead}} and Jardine was kind. <b>Now</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him; he's a good rancher." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{kissed the}} hand {{she had given}} me, and we <b>now</b> began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> a little more like people of the world, {{concerning}} our movements. The interview lasted an hour longer, when the heaven. [...] "You never yet were so unkind to one who was offensive; much less could you willingly have plotted this cruelty to one you regard!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was unwilling}} <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with the townsfolk. He had earned for himself the {{reputation}} of an awful skinflint, of a miser {{in the matter of}} living. He mumbled regretfully in the shops, bought inferior scraps of meat after long hesitations; and discouraged all allusions to his costume. It was as the barber had foretold. For all one could tell, he had recovered already from the disease of hope; and only Miss Bessie Carvil knew that he said nothing about his son's return because with him it was no longer [...] "next week," [...] "next month," [...] or even [...] "next year." [...] It was [...] "to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Babie, half-pleading, half-meditating, [...] "Allen is not stupid. He {{used to be}} {{considered}} just as clever as Bobus; and he is so <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. Can there be any reason but laziness, and want of application, that makes him never succeed in anything, except in answering riddles and acrostics in the papers? He generally just begins things, and makes mother or Armie finish them for him. He really did set to work and finish up an article on Count Ugolino since we came home from Fordham, and he has tried all the periodicals round, and they won't have it, not even the editors that know mother!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Undy Scott {{had become}} tyrannical in his logic {{as soon as}} he had persuaded Alaric to make use of a portion of Madame Jaquêtanàpe's {{marriage}} portion. 'You have taken part of the girl's money,' was Undy's argument; 'you have already converted to your own purposes so much of her fortune; it is absurd for you <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of conscience and honesty, of your high duties as a trustee, of the inviolable distinction between meum and tuum. You have already shown that the distinction is not inviolable; let us have no more such nonsense; there are still left £15,000 on which we can trade; open the till, and let us go on swimmingly with the business.' ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Selina {{was sitting}} {{at one of the}} windows, over her carpet-work frame. She had talked a great deal of sound sense to Fanny that morning, about her brother, and <b>now</b> {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> some more. Preparatory to this, she threw back her long red curls from her face, and wiped her red nose, for it was February.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So Zarinska {{will come}} to the White Man's lodge? Good! I go <b>now</b> <b>to</b> have <b>talk</b> with thy father, for he may not be so minded. And I will give him many tokens; but he must not ask too much. If he say no? Good! Zarinska shall yet come to the White Man's lodge.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he resumed, [...] "if {{you agree}} to my proposition, we'll get a lawyer to fix it up. In a way, it's some relief to know Helen has enough, and <b>now</b> I'm going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|R
