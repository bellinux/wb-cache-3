40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt {{is hard to}} {{argue that there is}} a more prevailing issue than <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> when discussing strike warfare today. The outlook of the United States and other militaries regarding bombing operations, particularly concern about <b>collateral</b> <b>damage,</b> is a historically contingent process. This thesis examines three case studies—the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Kosovo air campaign—to examine the impact of concern about <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> on U. S. policy and strategy. It analyzes the disparity between <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> effects at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels over the span of a half century. A significant amount of research on the effects of <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> from strike warfare focuses on legal, humanitarian, and moral issues. To oversimplify, killing non-combatants is bad, but it happens, and not always by accident. Therefore, it is instructive to gain knowledge on how it affects policy and strategy. Depending on the conflict and time period, U. S. administrations and war strategists have put the priority of mitigating <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> at different levels. Understanding the reasoning and timing behind the political and military attitudes toward <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> is helpful to understanding how the potential for civilian casualties fits into military strategy as a whole.

40|$|Some ISPs {{and governments}} (most notably the Great Firewall of China) use DNS {{injection}} to block access to “unwanted” websites. The censorship tools inspect DNS queries near the ISP’s boundary routers for sensitive domain keywords and inject forged DNS responses, blocking the users fromaccessingcensoredsites, suchastwitterandfacebook. Unfortunately this causes <b>collateral</b> <b>damage,</b> affecting communicationbeyondthecensorednetworkswhenoutsideDNS traffic traverses censored links. In this paper, we analyze {{the causes of}} the <b>collateral</b> <b>damages</b> and measure the Internet to identify the injecting activities and their effect. We find 39 ASes in China injecting forged DNS replies. Furthermore, 26 % of 43, 000 measured open resolvers outside China, distributed in 109 countries, may suffer some <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> from these forged replies. Different from previous work that considers the <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> being limited to queries to root servers (F, I, J) located in China, we find that most <b>collateral</b> <b>damage</b> arises when the paths between resolvers and some TLD name servers transit through ISPs in China...|$|R
