40|$|AbstractCareer {{development}} is challenging task {{for those who}} wish to excel in the university. This is especially true for <b>newcomers</b> to the academia whose career path has to be built successfully. In research universities, productivity and publications are important components influencing promotions. The main aim {{of this study was to}} explore how <b>newcomers</b> perceive the academic environment of the university including expectations stipulated by the university and how they manage themselves as <b>newcomers</b> to the academia. Ten <b>newcomers</b> who have been in the university for at least two semesters were interviewed and the data gathered were analyzed qualitatively. The findings show that: (a) <b>newcomers</b> initially perceived their roles were essentially to teach; (b) their role perceptions changed as a result of the research university status and; (c) <b>newcomers</b> generally do not have full knowledge of the academic community including collegial relationship building; (d) <b>newcomers</b> coping strategies include faculty involvement, information seeking and career planning.

5|$|The {{developers}} {{created the}} game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use. The memory limits also prohibited <b>Newcomer</b> from creating more characters. The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand-animated. To animate the birds, Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge's book Animals In Motion as a reference. Given the limited memory, {{she had to}} balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, <b>Newcomer</b> finalized {{the look of the}} platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, <b>Newcomer</b> instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Though <b>Newcomer</b> prioritized the wing flap, other sound effects like those related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs were considered important as well.|$|E

However, for all co-authorship networks <b>newcomers</b> tend to enter the network by forming links with other <b>newcomers</b> (p^*N L_nl > p^*N L_l).

40|$|Online {{communities}} have {{become one of}} the most common forms of organizations on the Internet. They are integral to the functioning of resources such as Wikipedia and form the backbone of many software development efforts, particularly Open Source Software. Going back at least a decade, researchers have examined various issues related to online communities. They have examined different forms of participation and highlighted the problems encountered in maintaining and growing these communities. One important finding from this literature is that it is critical to nurture and support <b>newcomers</b> for communities to thrive. <b>Newcomers</b> are essential for any organization and their successful participation determines their performance, turnover, motivation, and overall productivity and innovation in an organization. Empirical literature on how <b>newcomers</b> become part of an organization focuses primarily on socialization and assimilation. Studies have examined how <b>newcomers</b> proactively seek information, how information acquisition leads to formation of social relationships and assimilation in the work environment, and how <b>newcomers</b> move from peripheral to full participation within a community of practice. Despite the recognition of the importance of <b>newcomers,</b> few studies have looked at how <b>newcomers</b> actually participate in online communities and what role, if any, technology plays in this process.

Normative control diaries kept by XYZ <b>newcomers</b> provided insight into internal and external reactions to normative control messages. Finally, the researcher interviewed XYZ <b>newcomers</b> to understand how they sensemake normative control messages during organizational socialization. ^ Results indicate that management sends normative control messages that are thought-based, or intended to influence how <b>newcomers</b> think about the organization and its practices. <b>Newcomers</b> sensemake management 2 ̆ 7 s messages as indicators of appropriate organizational behaviors. <b>Newcomers</b> adapt their thoughts and police their behaviors {{as a result of}} sensemaking these messages. Normative control appears to have been achieved at XYZ as <b>newcomers</b> report that employees are better served by the norms of XYZ than managers. Four interrelated and co-constituted messages ground the communication of normative control at XYZ. Additionally, a process of normative control emerged in this study. <b>Newcomers</b> police their own actions in order to demonstrate that they think and behave in organizationally appropriate ways, thereby, giving the organization moral authority over its members. ...|$|R

40|$|Upon {{entry into}} an organization, <b>newcomers</b> are {{plunged into a}} "strange new world. " Uncertain and anxious, <b>newcomers</b> undergo the process of {{organizational}} socialization, seeking information to understand and accept the requirements of their new organizational role in terms of values, beliefs, abilities, and expected behaviors. Much of the research in organizational socialization has focused on investigating the intentional socialization tactics used by organizations to orient <b>newcomers,</b> such as training and orientation programs. Such a focus, however, assumes the information organizations purposefully produce for <b>newcomers</b> is the only information newcom-ers use to comprehend their surroundings. By employing the use of critical incidents, evidence is provided that such assumptions may be short-sighted.

40|$|The {{organizational}} assimilation {{literature suggests}} that <b>newcomers</b> need several types of information {{from a variety of}} sources during the process of organizational entry. It seems reasonable to assert that this claim is as true of <b>newcomers</b> in Asian-based organizations as it is of <b>newcomers</b> within organizations in the United States; however, assimilation research to date is dominated by an almost exclusively Western view. The research reported in this paper seeks to bridge that gap by exploring assimilation within a company founded and located in Thailand. Two hundred forty-seven <b>newcomers</b> from Bangkok Bank were surveyed to assess the perceived usefulness of seven types of information and four information sources which <b>newcomers</b> routinely utilize during organizational assimilation. In general, the social information was seen as the most useful information, and both supervisors and co-workers are preferred in comparison to other sources, e. g., the media. The results of this research are compared and contrasted with research conducted in Western organizations, providing new insight into the types and sources of information that <b>newcomers</b> obtain during organiza-tional assimilation...|$|R

5|$|In {{designing}} the levels, <b>Newcomer</b> added platforms {{to the environment}} after the combat was devised. A static game world was chosen over a scrolling world to showcase visual textures applied to the platforms. The hardware could not easily display the textures while scrolling, and the team felt that displaying the whole environment would aid players. The last game world element was a lava pit and a hand reaching out of it to destroy characters {{too close to the}} bottom. <b>Newcomer</b> placed the platforms to optimize Pfutzenrueter's enemy artificial intelligence (AI), which factors attack patterns based partly on platform placements. The knight enemies were designed to exhibit progressively more aggressive behavior. Bounders fly around the environment randomly, occasionally reacting to the protagonist. Hunters seek the player's character in an effort to collide. Shadow Lords fly quickly and closer {{to the top of the}} screen. Pfutzenrueter designed them to fly higher when close to the protagonist to increase the Shadow Lord's chances of victory against the player. The pterodactyl was designed to attack idle players and be difficult to defeat. The only vulnerability was attacking the creature in its open mouth during a specific animation frame. <b>Newcomer</b> and Pfutzenrueter designed the pterodactyl to quickly fly upward at the last moment when approaching a player waiting at the edge of a platform. This was done to prevent an easy defeat of the enemy. When processing the graphics, the game gives priority to the player characters over the enemies. As a result, enemies begin to react more slowly when the number of on-screen sprites increases.|$|E
