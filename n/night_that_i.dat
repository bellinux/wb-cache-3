5|$|Zelda now {{claims to}} be {{in direct contact with}} Christ, William the Conqueror, Mary Stuart, Apollo and all the stock {{paraphernalia}} of insane-asylum jokes... For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To give you all my love / I told my girls {{you can get it}} / Don't slow it down, just let it go / So in love / I'll give it all away / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E

6000|$|... "It’s a great {{temptation to}} housebreakers," [...] said her sister, not {{pressing}} the point. [...] "I made sure last <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> heard {{somebody in the}} house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] I answered, [...] "it {{was only}} last <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{looking over my}} old notes, and {{classifying}} some of our past results." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} that," [...] he said gravely. [...] "I {{never thought of}} myself as a {{particularly}} emotional person. In fact, I have always rather prided myself on my common sense. <b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> went a little mad. Your appearance, you see, was so unusual." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing more, my dear," [...] {{the little}} woman replied quietly. [...] "You {{have been of}} such great service to me this <b>night</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can never repay you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We put him inside," [...] said Wilkinson. [...] "He wasn't quite {{able to sit}} up. I'd {{have kept}} him all <b>night</b> only <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{reckoned}} you might be scared." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You shall hear directly," [...] replied Magdalen. [...] "I have {{something}} to say first. I told you, last <b>night,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had another object in view besides the object of earning my living on the stage--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We meet {{almost as}} strangers, mademoiselle," [...] Desmond said, deeply bowing, [...] "for I own that I saw {{so little of}} your face, the other <b>night,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should hardly have {{recognized}} you, had I met you elsewhere." ...|$|E
