It was then that Thomas made a call to LaFace label-head L.A. Reid to discuss working on TLC's fourth studio album. After contacting Watkins, and soon after, Lopes, sessions for 3D had begun in the Fall of 2001. However, soon after recording had begun, sessions came to a halt, as Lopes began work on her second studio album, known as N.I.N.A (New Identity <b>Non</b> <b>Applicable),</b> and as Watkins was hospitalized in January 2002 due to complications stemming from her ongoing battle with sickle-cell anemia, Lopes eventually came to visit Watkins {{in the hospital and}} went back to the studio to record raps for 3D. In April 2002, as Watkins' condition improved greatly, Lopes disappeared to Honduras to do missionary work.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} pain on {{movement}} control {{have been widely}} described. Studies agree that control of movement is impaired by pain. It is hypothesized that movement is modified to reduce stress on painful tissue to protect from further pain and/or injury. Although this hypothesis is logical, it has never yet been tested. Analysis of the literature shows that, although reduced stress within painful tissue is certainly the goal of these motor adaptations; {{it is not always}} achieved. Aside from this biomechanical objective, motor adaptations depend on the subject 2 ̆ 7 s sociopsychological context, which may partly explain observed inter-individual variation in adaptation. Finally, we report some recent results suggesting that, while motor adaptation may provide short-term benefit, they can have deleterious long-term negative consequences.

40|$|Numerical library {{routines}} mostly compute an approximation for {{the solution}} of a given problem and estimate the number of correct digits.

But interval methods are frequently considered inefficient and <b>non</b> <b>applicable</b> to real problems. Our proposal is the development of libraries in which the estimation is substituted by efficient inclusions. The feasibility of this approach for linear systems with H matrices is shown in this paper.

40|$|Teleology {{is today}} {{one of the}} most {{important}} issues on Biology debate. Prof. F. J. Ayala strongly supports the uses of teleological explanations in Biology. He maintains: a) Teleological explanations are compatible with causal efficient explanations on living being but <b>non</b> <b>applicable</b> to other natural objects. b) Teleological explanations loss explanation capacity if they expressed in non teleological terms. c) The teleological explanations are the characteristic of Biology as natural autonomous science. However, Prof. Ayala claims that no all biological processes need teleological explanation; they are teleological if they contribute to the survival of the organics systems. Two basic concepts: function and utility together, support the Ayala’s meaning of teleology. In opposition to the authors who refuse the teleology in living being or uses the softer word teleonomy, he remarks the real sense of teleology in Biology: a natural internal teleology (determined or indetermined), but never external as the product of divine o human design...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} issue in formalizing the Data Integration Systems (DIS) is the {{semantic}} characterization of its global schema and the mappings with its source databases. Each DIS must be robust enough {{in order to take}} in account the incomplete and inconsistent information of its source data-bases, typical in Web applications: the extension of source databases change in an unpredictable way so that in differ-ent time instances we pass from a consistent to inconsistent DIS and viceversa. Thus, DIS will generally have possibly innite number of consistent repairs and their models and, consequently, query answering in such DISs is very complex and time consuming. The current systems adopt the two ex-treme solutions for a query-answering: certain answers (true in all models of a given DIS) or all possible answers (true at any model). The rst solution is to much strong require-ment and practically <b>non</b> <b>applicable</b> in real situations, the sec-ond one is less meaningful (not all possible Skolem-based completions of an incomplete logical theory are plausible for users) and time/space consuming (they may be innite also).

40|$|International audienceTo improve heat {{recovery}} and reduce energy consumption in industrial processes, heat exchanger network (HEN) design {{has been widely}} applied, but it {{has proven to be}} a challenging task. Plenty of different design methods have been developed since the early 80 's. Most of them consider HEN design as a mathematical optimisation problem to be solved. Using existing design methods does not allow taking into account some technical constraints leading to <b>non</b> directly <b>applicable</b> solutions. In this paper, we introduce new features to a recent HEN algorithm: multiple heat exchanger technologies and flexible streams. By considering different heat exchanger technologies since the HEN design step, we will be able to handle heat flows' physical properties and particularities such as corrosion or fouling aspect. Moreover, from an economical point of view, considering different technologies allows having a more accurate cost evaluation depending on heat exchanger configuration (shell and tube, plate heat exchangers, finned tubes [...] .) and materials used for fabrication. Furthermore, the creation of a new stream type with floating outlet temperature will ease realistic {{heat recovery}} on waste heat (such as hot fumes). In this article, the implementation of these proposed features into an existing algorithm is described. Then, a literature case is used to illustrate the relevance of the new proposed features...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, Ground-Based (GBSAR) {{has proven to}} be a {{reliable}} microwave Remote Sensing technique in several application fields, especially for unstable slopes monitoring. GBSAR can provide displacement measurements over few squared kilometres areas and with a very high spatial and temporal resolution. This work is focused on the use of GBSAR technique for long term landslide monitoring based on a particular data acquisition configuration, which is called discontinuous GBSAR (D-GBSAR). In the most commonly used GBSAR configuration, the radar is left installed in situ, acquiring data periodically, e. g. every few minutes. Deformations are estimated by processing sets of GBSAR images acquired during several weeks or months, without moving the system. By contrast, in the D-GBSAR the radar is installed and dismounted at each measurement campaign, revisiting a given site periodically. This configuration is useful to monitor slow deformation phenomena. In this work, two alternative ways for exploiting the D-GBSAR technique will be presented: the DInSAR technique and the Amplitude based Technique. The former is based on the exploitation of the phase component of the acquired SAR images and it allows providing millimetric precision on the deformation estimates. However, this technique presents several limitations like the reduction of measurable points with an increase in the period of observation, the ambiguous nature of the phase measurements, and the influence of the atmospheric phase component that can make it <b>non</b> <b>applicable</b> in some cases, specially when working in natural environments. The second approach, that is based on the use of the amplitude component of GB-SAR images combined with a image matching technique, will allow the estimation of the displacements over specific targets avoiding two of the limitations commented above: the phase unwrapping and atmosphere contribution but reducing the deformation measurement precision. Two successful examples of D-GBSAR landslide monitoring will be analysed and discussed: the first example is based on DInSAR and concerns to an urban landslide located in Barberà de la Conca (Catalonia, Spain). This village has experienced deformations since 2011 that have caused cracks in the church and several buildings. The results of a one year and half monitoring will be shown. The second example is based on the amplitude based approach and concerns to the active landslide of Vallcebre (Eastern Pyrenees, Spain). For this site, the results of eight campaigns during a period of 19 months were performed. During this period displacements of up to 80 cm were measured...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Peripheral {{perfusion}} index (PPI) is a non-invasive {{numerical value}} of peripheral perfusion {{derived from a}} pulse oximeter signal. It {{has been suggested that}} PPI may be a valuable adjunct diagnostic tool to detect early clinically significant hemodynamic embarrassment. The aim of this paper was to determine normal PPI in healthy newborns, in order to establish cut-off values that can be use in different pathologic settings. Material and Methods : Prospective observational study performed with term newborns, born in a tertiary level care hospital between January 1 st to December 31 st 2012. Demographic data such as gender, gestational age, birth weight and Apgar score were collected. PPI, heart rate (HR) and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) were evaluated simultaneous on the right hand (preductal) and on the left foot (postductal) of the newborn, before discharge from the hospital. Results : 2, 032 newborns, 52 % male, with a mean birth weight of 3, 237 ± 432 g and median gestational age of 39 weeks, were evaluated. PPI values obtained were: preductal median of 1. 6 with interquartile range of 1. 2 - 2. 3, postductal median of 1. 4 with interquartile range of 1 - 2 (p < 0. 001). Conclusions : PPI is an easily <b>applicable</b> <b>non</b> invasive method to monitor peripheral perfusion changes. We established normal PPI values in healthy Portuguese newborns. PPI was higher on the upper limb (preductal) when compared to the lower limb (postductal). This finding has important implications, in the time of choosing a single probe placement, and in the interpretation of the results. </p...|$|R
40|$|In risk {{assessments}} of soil bounded pollutants, the bioaccessibility {{is defined as}} the amount of solid-solubilized phase transition fraction of pollutants, which is actual available for oral, pulmonary and dermal uptake (absorption) by human. The bioaccessibility does not express the bioavailability of pollutants, thus, the effect on organism by uptake of pollutants. However, the bioaccessibility is an excellent benchmark for the potential bioavailable amount of pollutants in soils, because more than the bioaccessible fraction cause no effects on organism function. The results enhanced the knowledge about in-vitro extraction tests to determine the bioaccessibility of soil bounded pollutants for oral, pulmonary and dermal uptake. The applicability and validity of the approaches will be discussed for selected inorganic and organic pollutants. New applicable knowledge for the pulmonary and dermal exposition pathway in soil protection is summarized. The conclusion is that a risk assessment on basis of total content of pollutants in soil samples overestimate mostly the actual human health risk. The approved and practice-oriented in-vitro method DIN 19738 : 2004 - 07 for estimating the oral bioaccessibility exhibits a good ruggedness and validity particular for the priority metals As, Pb, and Cd in soils. The use of the DIN-method is recommended for application in the triggering further investigations according the Federal Soil Protection Ordinance in Germany. More research studies are needed for an essential assessment of validity regarding the priority organic compounds. First reasonable results in estimating of pulmonary bioaccessibility was achieved by a promising, however, non standardized in-vitro method for selected metals (Pb, Cr, and Ni). For estimating the dermal bioaccessibility a <b>non</b> standardized but <b>applicable</b> and physiologically based extraction test is available as well, where moderate results for organic compounds (DDT, *-HCH und PCB) determined. Finally, {{there is a lack of}} important ruggedness tests and validity assessments for more pollutants in either case...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the Author {{tries to}} assess the {{establishment}} of an interindividual le- gal system in the EU by resorting to the theoretical assumptions of dualism (or pluralism). He assumes that pluralism is not only the best key to assess in general the relationship between international law and interindividual systems of law, but also helps very much in giving a correct appraisal of the contributions given by the ECJ, on one side, and national courts, on the other side, to the establishment of that interindividual legal system. Further, it is suggested that the effective establishment of such a legal system has produced a real modification of sovereignty in Europe. This has to be understood not as a direct consequence of the EU Treaties, nor of ECJ case law. Rather, at the centre of the stage is the auto-constituting process that took place in line with ECJ pretentions, thanks to the “retraction” of State sovereignties and the effective “occupation” of the field by the EU through the activities of its Institutions and Or- ganisms, combined with the “Europeanization” of a part of Member States’ apparat- uses. Such a process, it is submitted, has happened not only as for the sectors in which EU law is directly administered by the EU Commission, and upon which judicial control is centralized at the ECJ level. Also when the task of administering direct applicable EU law is left to member States’ authorities, and even in case of <b>non</b> directly <b>applicable</b> provisions of EU law, a decisive role is played by the structural principles of effectiveness of judicial protection, as a limit to the procedural autonomy of Member States in jurisdictional and enforcement tasks, and of internal (civil) liability of the State for the violation of EU law, as a conceptual limitation to the absolute character of sovereignty. The paper’s assumption is that, thanks to the abovementioned prin- ciples, and to the effective operation of the preliminary reference procedure – shaped by the ECJ case law and accepted by the national judiciaries, essentially as a federal tool – an independent EU system of interindividual law not subject to member States sovereignties operates in all areas where EU competences have been effectively im- plemented. Furthermore, the latitude and quality of EU law development, and the ef- fective resort to its provisions by citizens of Member States and of third countries even against the strongest choices of Member States political organs, and despite final decisions by their courts, causes in the Author’s view the effective appearing of a true relationship of allegiance between individuals in the EU and the Union. The system in place, however, substantially lacks transparency and democracy. Recognition of the present state of the art of the European integration, on one side, and consequent re- shaping of the governance in a truly (pan-European) democratic sense, on the other, are outlined in the conclusions as the obliged path the EU, its member States, and its citizens have to follow, in order not to see their common house collapse...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) {{spectroscopy}} is a robust, <b>non</b> invasive technique <b>applicable</b> {{in structure}} determination {{as well as}} in the study of dynamic behaviour of chemical compounds. This thesis is in two sections, the first dealing mainly with a structure determination application of NMR and the second dealing mainly with a study of dynamic behaviour. Section 1 NMR characterisation of carbohydrates has proved challenging because of the limited chemical shift ranges of both the proton and carbon signals. The broad signals due to the labile hydroxy 1 protons cause further complications by overlapping proton signals from the ring. Protecting group chemistry is vital in the preparation and manipulation of synthetic carbohydrates and can potentially help with the assignment of the (otherwise extremely complicated) NMR spectra of carbohydrates. However, the widely used benzyl protecting group can make the spectrum more difficult to interpret because the benzyl CH(_ 2) proton signals often come in the same region of the spectrum as the anomeric protons, usually used as reporter groups of carbohydrates and the benzyl CH(_ 2) carbon signals come in the same region as the carbohydrate ring carbons. This section reports the invetsigation and application of a family of alternative protecting groups, namely various fluorobenzyl groups, which have not been used in carbohydrate chemistry before. With pentafluorobenzyl, the proton chemical shift dispersion is improved, and the CH(_ 2) and carbohydrate ring carbon signals are shifted to lower frequency, considerably simplifying the task of assigning the carbon spectrum, facilitating the interpretation of all (^ 1) H-(^ 13) C correlation experiments (HSQC, HMQC, HMBC). Section 2 Cyclen complexes of lanthanide (III) ions have found use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), luminescence imaging and assay studies. In particular, europium (III) complexes have potential in anlytical, forensic, and biomedical applications based on their impressive emissive properties. However, the emissive properties are modulated by the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of the complexes. For biomedical applications, chelation is necessary to avoid europium toxicity that may be triggerd by accidental dissociation of the complex and release of the metal in vivo. A new cyclen europium(III) complex with pyridyl pendant ligands instead of the usual acetate groups has been synthesised by a group at Manchester University. The pyridyl ligands confer higher emmisive intensities to the complex, to enable applicability of the complex in time gated measurements. The chemical structure determination of the compound was accomplished by (^ 1) H, (^ 13), COSY, HMQC / HSQC and EXSY NMR experiments. Selective inversion experiments data were evaluated using the CIFIT simulation program, and showed that in aqueous solutions from - 0. 2 с to 107. 6 с the dominant dynamic process is flipping of the pendant (pyridyl) arms, and isomerism is biased towards the twisted square antiprism (TSAP) ...|$|R
