25|$|The New South Wales Constitution Act of 1855, steered {{through the}} British Parliament by the veteran radical Lord John Russell, {{who wanted a}} {{constitution}} which balanced democratic elements against the interests of property, as did the Parliamentary system in Britain at this time. The Act created a bicameral Parliament of New South Wales, with a lower house, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, consisting of 54 members elected by adult males who met a moderate property qualification (anyone who owned property worth £100, or earned £100 a year, or held a pastoral licence, or who paid £10 a year for lodgings, could vote). The Assembly was heavily malapportioned in favour of the rural areas. The Legislative Council was to consist of at least 21 members (but with <b>no</b> <b>upper</b> <b>limit)</b> appointed for life by the Governor, and Council members had to meet a higher property qualification.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{refers to}} the {{combination}} of a high-throughput sequencing methodology with computational methods to capture and quantify transcripts present in an RNA extract. The nucleotide sequences generated are typically around 100 bp in length, but can range from 30 bp to over 10,000 bp, depending on the sequencing method used. RNA-Seq leverages deep sampling of the transcriptome with many short fragments from a transcriptome to allow computational reconstruction of the original RNA transcript by aligning reads to a reference genome or to each other (de novo assembly). The typical dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude for RNA-Seq is a key advantage over microarray transcriptomes. In addition, input RNA amounts are much lower for RNA-Seq (nanogram quantity) compared to microarrays (microgram quantity), which allowed finer examination of cellular structures, down to the single-cell level when combined with linear amplification of cDNA. Theoretically, there is <b>no</b> <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> of quantification in RNA-Seq, and background signal is very low for 100 bp reads in non-repetitive regions.|$|E

25|$|Much {{analysis}} of the experiment has dealt with how the fitness of the populations relative to their ancestral strain has changed. All populations showed a pattern of rapid increase in relative fitness during early generations, with this increase decelerating over time. By 20,000 generations the populations grew approximately 70% faster than the ancestral strain. This increase and deceleration in increase has continued in subsequent generations. A 2013 study by Wiser et al. reported ongoing improvement at 50,000 generations relative to samples isolated at 40,000 generations. They found that the fitness increase fit to a power law model {{much better than the}} hyperbolic models that had been used earlier. As a power law model describes an ever-slowing increase that has <b>no</b> <b>upper</b> <b>limit,</b> while a hyperbolic model implies a hard limit, the work suggested that the increase would continue without bound as progressively lower benefit mutations were fixed in the populations. Further work published in 2015 reported the results of over 1100 new fitness assays that examined fitness changes through 60,000 generations. The data once again fit the proposed power law model, and, indeed, fit within predictions of the model from earlier data. These results suggest that, contrary to previous thinking, adaptation and adaptive divergence can potentially increase indefinitely, even in a constant environment.|$|E

500|$|Boulder {{problems}} are generally shorter than [...] from ground to top. This makes the sport significantly safer than free solo climbing, {{which is also}} performed without ropes, but with <b>no</b> <b>upper</b> <b>limit</b> on {{the height of the}} climb. However, minor injuries are common in bouldering, particularly sprained ankles and wrists. Two factors contribute to the frequency of injuries in bouldering: first, boulder problems typically feature more difficult moves than other climbing disciplines, making falls more common. Second, without ropes to arrest the climber's descent, every fall will cause the climber to hit the ground.|$|E
