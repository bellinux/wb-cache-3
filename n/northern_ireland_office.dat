500|$|The escape was a {{propaganda}} coup and morale boost for the IRA, with Irish republicans dubbing it the [...] "Great Escape". Leading unionist politician Ian Paisley called on Nicholas Scott, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to resign. The British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher {{made a statement}} in Ottawa {{during a visit to}} Canada, saying [...] "It is the gravest [...] in our present history, and there must be a very deep inquiry". The day after the escape, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Prior announced an inquiry would be headed by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, James Hennessy. The Hennessy Report was published on 26 January 1984 placing most of the blame for the escape on prison staff, and made a series of recommendations to improve security at the prison. The report also placed blame with the designers of the prison, the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Office</b> and successive prison governors who had failed to improve security. Prior announced that the prison's governor had resigned, and {{that there would be no}} ministerial resignations as a result of the report's findings. Four days after the Hennessy Report was published, then Minister for Prisons Nicholas Scott dismissed allegations from the Prison Governors Association and the Prison Officers Association that the escape was due to political interference in the running of the prison.|$|E
500|$|Ballistic {{evidence}} indicates that the 10-member gang took at least six guns {{with them on the}} attack. An independent panel of inquiry commissioned by the Pat Finucane Centre has established that among the weapons actually used in the killings were two Sterling 9mm submachine guns and a 9mm Luger pistol serial no. U 4. The submachine guns, which had been stolen years earlier from {{a former member of the}} B Specials, were linked to prior and later sectarian killings, whereas the Luger had been used to kill leading IRA member, John Francis Green, the previous January. In a letter to the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay's Tavern dated 22 February 2004, the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>Office</b> stated that: [...] "The PSNI [...] have confirmed that a 9mm Luger pistol was ballistically traced both to the murder of John Francis Green and to the Miami Showband murders." [...] In May 1976, Robin Jackson's fingerprints were discovered on the metal barrel of a home-made silencer constructed for a Luger. Both the silencer and pistol– which was later established to have been the same one used in the Miami Showband killings– were found by the security forces at the home of Edward Sinclair. Jackson was charged with possession of the silencer but not convicted, the trial judge having reportedly said: [...] "At the end of the day I find that the accused somehow touched the silencer, but the Crown evidence has left me completely in the dark as to whether he did that wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly".
