40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focusing on an employee benefits system and its functionality. Theoretical part of the thesis specifies the human resources field as a whole, and its <b>particular</b> <b>aspects,</b> <b>considering</b> mainly the employee remuneration and employee benefits system. It also expands {{on the relationship between}} motivation, employee benefits and employee remuneration. The established knowledge are used in a practical part of the thesis, which has been carried out in H 1 s. r. o. The company is first introduced, with both the current situation, as well as its historical development described, and the thesis then outlines the current employee benefits based on a undertaken survey and also analyses the collected data. At the end of the practical part, the recommendations and suggestions for improvements of the <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> of employee benefits system functioning are listed...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between cognitive function {{and violence in}} 76 remanded prisoners, without formal psychiatric illness, was investigated. The violent group tended to be of slightly lower general ability than the non-violent group, but not abnormally so {{in relation to the}} general population; no relationship was found between specific patterns of cognitive functioning and violence. The violent group reported significantly higher levels of neurotic symptoms than the non-violent group, and were more socially deviant. To a small extent, general intelligence (reasoning ability), in interaction with many other factors, may be related to a propensity for violent behaviour, but <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>aspect</b> of cortical functioning seems to be related to violence...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometric}} and radiometric {{characteristics of}} thematic mapper data through analysis of linear {{features in the}} data are investigated. The <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>considered</b> are: (1) thematic mapper ground IFOV; (2) radiometric contrast between linear features and background; (3) precision of system geometric correction; (4) band-to-band registration; and (5) potential utility of TM data for linear feature detection especially as compared to MSS data. It is shown that TM data {{may be used to}} estimate TM pixel size and to illustrate band-band mis-registration. Further, the geometry and radiometry of the data are sufficiently precise to allow accurate estimation of the widths of linear features. In optimum conditions features one quarter of a pixel in width may be accurately measured. These results have considerable potential for applications for hydrological and topographic mapping...|$|R
30|$|The <b>particular</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>considered</b> in this paper, which {{represents}} an unresolved issue {{even in the}} simplest case of elastic response, is that of Variationally Consistent Homogenization (VCH) {{in the limit of}} macroscopic incompressibility. This situation is encountered when the micro-constituents of a composite are intrinsically incompressible (or nearly incompressible), which infers macroscale incompressibility as well. An example is when a composite of metallic particles (or fibers) embedded in an elastomer matrix is subjected to stresses that are sufficiently large to cause significant plastic deformations in the particles. Another class of problems is characterized by an initially compressible macroscale response, which may become incompressible {{as the result of the}} deformation process. An important example is the evolving porous microstructure of a PM-product during the process of sintering, whereby the homogenized response is compressible until the porosity vanishes inferring incompressible macroscale response, cf. [15]. This process is thus characterized by a transition from the compressible to incompressible regimes.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how {{students}} perceive flipped classroom education in a university research methods course. Three <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> were <b>considered,</b> namely, (a) the student’s general experiences and attitudes of learning through flipped classroom, (b) the student’s experiences of using video lectures as a medium for learning, and (c) the student’s experiences of using a Learning Management System (LMS) in the frame of the flipped classroom model. Further, this study has also considered differences in experiences and attitudes of low and high achieving students.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of the SEASAT synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor was evaluated using data processed by the MDA digital processor. Two <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> are <b>considered</b> the location accuracy of image data, and the calibration of the measured backscatter amplitude {{of a set of}} corner reflectors. The image location accuracy was assessed by selecting identifiable targets in several scenes, converting their image location to UTM coordinates, and comparing the results to map sheets. The error standard deviation is measured to be approximately 30 meters. The amplitude was calibrated by measuring the responses of the Goldstone corner reflector array and comparing the results to theoretical values. A linear regression of the measured against theoretical values results in a slope of 0. 954 with a correlation coefficient of 0. 970...|$|R
40|$|This project {{looked at}} the various responses, both {{political}} and aesthetic, {{to the end of}} socialist realism and the return of pre-war modernism as a desirable ideal. It considered both the built environment and objects of daily use (furniture, radios, TV sets, etc.) in several countries of the region, including Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Russia and Romania, also comparing developments there with corresponding ones in the west. Among <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>considered</b> were the effects of Kruschev's speech in December 1954 to workers in construction, machine-building and design industries, in which he argued against monumentalism and criticised both "classical architecture" and socialist realism. The team see the real issue in interpreting Eastern European architecture as its lack of a critical edge, since official discourses took the place of any form of criticism and architects sought to implement the "official line". Megastructures became increasingly popular from the 1960 s onwards and in Romania, for instance, came to dominate the city in the late 1980 s. Such structures proved an efficient way to control the environment in countries plagued by prefabrication and social housing, and the group see the exhibition of inflated concrete grids as perhaps the most important feature of Eastern European architecture in the 1960 s and 1970 s. They also point out the rarity of glass and steel architecture in the east, where the preferred material was concrete, a material seen as "revolutionary" as it was the product of heavy industry and was grey, i. e. the workers' colour. Tactile elements were more important here than the visual elements favoured in the west, and a solidity more in line with the dominant ideology than the ephemeral qualities of glass...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} acupuncture for smoking cessation and to examine whether any individual aspect of trials is associated with an effect.  DATA SOURCES—All randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for smoking cessation that were listed in computerised databases or reference lists of relevant articles.  STUDY SELECTION—All randomised single-blind studies that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture.  DATA EXTRACTION—Methodological data were extracted for quality assessment. Outcome data were extracted for rates of total smoking cessation at three intervals: early after treatment and after six and 12  months follow up.  DATA SYNTHESIS—Results were expressed as odds ratios of success over failure in intervention over control groups. The combined odds ratio for all studies was calculated. Repeated meta-analyses were subsequently performed on subsets of studies combined according to defined characteristics: acupuncture technique, number of attendances, country of origin, status of journal, and control procedure. The overall quality of studies was poor. The combined odds ratio for smoking cessation calculated for the earliest results {{after the end of}} treatment was 1. 20  (95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs)  =  0. 98  to 1. 48). The combined odds ratio for smoking cessation after six months was 1. 29  (95 % CI =  0. 82  to 2. 01), and after 12  months was 1. 03  (95 % CI =  0. 73  to 1. 46). There were no significant effects of relevance among subsets of studies grouped according to defined characteristics.  CONCLUSIONS—Acupuncture was not superior to sham acupuncture for smoking cessation; <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> <b>aspect</b> of acupuncture technique was associated with a positive effect. The conclusions are limited by methodological inadequacies of studies and by the absence of testable hypotheses; design of future trials should avoid these deficiencies.    Keywords: acupuncture; smoking cessatio...|$|R
40|$|One <b>particular</b> <b>aspect</b> is <b>considered</b> of {{the feature}} {{selection}} problem which {{results from the}} transformation x=Bz, where B is a k by n matrix of rank k and k is or = to n. It is shown that in general, such a transformation results {{in a loss of}} information. In terms of the divergence, this is equivalent {{to the fact that the}} average divergence computed using the variable x is less than or equal to the average divergence computed using the variable z. A loss of information in terms of the probability of misclassification is shown to be equivalent to the fact that the probability of misclassification computed using variable x is greater than or equal to the probability of misclassification computed using variable z. First, the necessary facts relating k-dimensional and n-dimensional integrals are derived. Then the mentioned results about the divergence and probability of misclassification are derived. Finally it is shown that if no information is lost (in x = Bz) as measured by the divergence, then no information is lost as measured by the probability of misclassification...|$|R

We use this explicit construction to explain a recent conjecture relating study of stable pairs on algebraic curves with HOMFLY polynomials. Furthermore, for torus knots, using the explicit construction of the Lagrangian cycle, we also give a direct A-model computation and recover the HOMFLY polynomial for this case.

We also establish the competitiveness of the spacetransformation -based numerical procedures in terms of accuracy and speed. Further improvements in computational speed can be accomplished by parallel implementation of the space-transformation calculations. The space-transformation method is shown to provide a computationally e#cient approach for obtaining three-dimensional f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to an {{examination}} of the creation and development of the Soviet machine tool industry in the inter-War years. It opens with a brief review of the low level of machine tool building: before the October Revolution, and then considers the revival and changing priorities of the industry during the 1920 s. After a review of the intensive development of the branch during the first three Five-year Plans, <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> are <b>considered</b> in detail. The overall, strategy of the industry, involving decisions relating to production specialisation and technology, is analysed, together with a study of the role of process and parts specialisation. A major problem facing the industry was that of the choice of machine tool technology; this question is examined in detail, and followed by a consideration of the influence of technical progress {{and the creation of a}} research and development system in the branch. The limited role of foreign technical assistance and the much greater role of imports are discussed. Further chapters are devoted to the problems of developing a skilled labour force and of building new enterprises. It is concluded that the development of the Soviet machine tool industry was on the whole a successful achievement, offering some lessons for present-day developing countries...|$|R

The effort has been based on an in-depth market analysis, not limiting to <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> but <b>considering</b> as far as possible the whole picture. The paper also describes a methodology to derive novel CBTC products from the global model, and to define system requirements for the individual CBTC components. To this end, the proposed methodology employs scenario-based requirements elicitation aided with rapid prototyping. To enhance the quality of the requirements, these are written in a constrained natural language (CNL), and evaluated with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The final goal is to go toward a formal representation of the requirements for CBTC systems. The overall approach is discussed, and the current experience with the implementation of the method is presented. In particular, we show how the presented methodology has been used in practice to derive a novel CBTC architecture...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} general strategies to evaluate the dynamic effects occurring in reversible hydro systems (i. e. turbine/pumping) with long penstocks resulting from the regular operation of the hydro equipments and, most significantly, from accidental events. It is of great importance these <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> are <b>considered</b> in the early stages of a design, in order to ensure the best technical, economical and safety operation for each developed solution. This work presents two complementary approaches to the study of dynamic effects associated to reversible hydro systems based on a parametric analysis and a simulation-based procedure, as well as in the definition of design and operation rules to guarantee a safe solution. The first approach establishes the dynamic behavior of the system by means of a parametric analysis of the hydraulic and the hydro mechanical aspects associated to system operation. Based on this methodology, it is possible to estimate the maximum upsurge, the flow variation under turbogenerators runaway conditions and a valve manoeuvre. The second approach consists in the implementation of a numerical model that simulates accurately enough, the interaction between different components of the system during transient flow regimes associated to the hydropower load rejection, pumps shutdown, actuation of upsurge protection devices and wave propagations along the all system. This methodology gathers the necessary tools for the computational transient analysis of a complex reversible system...|$|R

30|$|The {{findings}} of the present interview study (N =  18) revealed, that users perceive the interaction with self-improvement tools as form of communication and {{they are able to}} distinguish between different communication styles (research question 1). Furthermore, the way a self-improvement product speaks to its user can possibly influence the effectiveness of the self-improvement tool. There seems to be a connection between the specific style of communication and emotional consequences of the user (research question 2). Additionally, the individual goal a user is pursuing seems to be connected to the preference of one communication style over another (research question 3). In order to analyze our data we used typologies of communication psychology. We see our findings as one possible starting point to inform designers of self-improvement technologies about the importance of communication aspects. Beyond the general relevance of the perceived communication, a <b>particular</b> important <b>aspect</b> to <b>consider</b> seems to be the type of self-improvement goal and its particular characteristics.|$|R

The key areas of performance in respect of the implementation of affirmative action are identified as equalising opportunities, eradicating discrimination, the process of actively integrating affirmative action into human resource planning and the general management of the organisation and the process of taking affirmative action beyond the boundaries of the organisation into the community. The results provide a basis for investigating aspects that may help with the implementation of affirmative action, on the one hand, and aspects that might hamper or undermine its successful implementation, on the other. The article also reflects management's views on the extent to which the aforementioned issues actually contribute to the successful implementation of affirmative action in their respective departments/sections/teams within the organisation.

In <b>particular</b> the <b>aspects</b> <b>considered</b> are: • Control and monitoring mechanisms of water distribution networks • Losses in water distribution networks • Demand and supply management in water distribution networks • Energy (electrical) cost for water distribution networks and water management systems • Service-Oriented Architecture approaches to water management • Design and analysis of water distribution networks The investigation {{does not want to be}} completely exhaustive at this stage of the research, but the aim is to clarify concepts and themes that could be deeply investigated in a future stage. The importance of water for society and human beings do not need in this report to be investigated, I think it just worths to remark the importance of the theme that United Nation define water and sanitation as a Human Right 1. Water losses Water losses in the water distribution system are a big issue especially for those countries that do not have an efficient water distribution networks, but also in those countries that suffer from the scarcity of water itself (e. g., desert region of Africa and Middle East). A study of International Water Association (IWA) Water Loss Task Force in 2003 [35] showed that 726 millions of liter of water per year are lost. However, when speaking about water losses the problem is more complex than it seems. In fact, according to IWA given a total volume of water in the system different outcomes are possible for part of this volume as shown in Figure 1. In particular as explained in [37] the IWA gives a specific definition of each of the terms appearing in Figure 1 : • System Input Volume is the annual volume input to that part of the water supply syste...|$|R

While planning the environments for children the <b>particular</b> <b>aspects</b> should be <b>considered.</b> The important questions are: What kind of contact does child have with the city, urban places and buildings? How does the child construct the picture of the city? What kind of urban or architectural spaces contributes to the relation that a child has with the environment?
