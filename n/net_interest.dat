25|$|The {{contract}} {{to build and}} operate the M6 Toll was won by Midland Expressway Ltd (MEL) in 1991. In 2005 MEL reported an operating profit of around £16million. Total revenue was £45million, with staff and other operating costs amounting to £11.4million and depreciation of £17.4million. Taking into account <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> costs of around £43million, that leaves an overall loss of £26.5million in 2005 – their first full financial year.|$|E
25|$|CBO {{reported}} that <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> {{on the public}} debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates. During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $432 billion. GAO {{reported that}} even though the national debt rose in FY2012, the interest rate paid declined. Should interest rates rise to historical averages, the interest cost would increase dramatically.|$|E
25|$|Organizations {{increasingly}} {{make money}} from trading in already existing assets which are not used by them to produce any new products and services with. Put differently, an increasing share of total generic profit income consists of <b>net</b> <b>interest,</b> net taxes, net capital gains, fees & royalties, and rents. This can happen {{because a lot of}} non-productive assets have been accumulated that are available for trade; second-hand physical assets, financial assets and properties are being traded; all sorts of things are traded internationally, taking advantage of currency and cost differentials; assets are being held via all kinds of special financial constructions to extract profit, etc. And, an increasing amount of interest payments, rents and capital gains have been excluded from operating surplus because, by statistical definition, they are not classified as production expenditure at all (i.e. they are not counted as value-added). Post-Keynesian researchers such as Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie therefore tried to devise more adequate measures of the real financial profitability of companies. If a lot of capital is borrowed at a cost which is lower than the income obtained from reinvesting it in assets that appreciate in value, then a lot of profit income is earnt which has nothing directly to do with creating new product value, and therefore is not counted as value-added. Instead, existing wealth is transferred from one set of owners to another.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that the global current account and global capital and financial account discrepancies are the twin result of a common cause. This cause can be identified in the payment of <b>net</b> <b>interests</b> on debt. Re-interpreting the World Bank’s definition of capital flight, we will show that both discrepancies can be consistently accounted for by Schmitt’s analysis of the double charge of net interests’ payments. As strikingly confirmed by statistical evidence, the pathological payment of <b>net</b> <b>interests</b> between countries explains away {{the mystery of the}} ‘missing surplus’ while accounting for what has been considered so far as an understatement of international capital flows...|$|R

2500|$|The cost of {{servicing}} the U.S. {{national debt}} {{can be measured}} in various ways. The CBO analyzes <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> as a percentage of GDP, with a higher percentage indicating a higher interest payment burden. During 2015, this was 1.3% GDP, close to the record low 1.2% of the 1966–1968 era. The average from 1966 to 2015 was 2.0% of GDP. However, the CBO estimated in 2016 that the interest amounts and % GDP will increase significantly over the following decade as both interest rates and debt levels rise: [...] "Interest payments on that debt represent a large and rapidly growing expense of the federal government. CBO's baseline shows <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> payments more than tripling under current law, climbing from $231 billion in 2014, or 1.3 percent of GDP, to $799 billion in 2024, or 3.0 percent of GDP—the highest ratio since 1996." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over the 2013-2022 period, {{the budget}} {{essentially}} freezes defense and non-defense discretionary spending in dollar terms, such that these categories shrink {{relative to a}} growing economy, from 8.7% GDP to 5.9% GDP. [...] Mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other safety net programs) remain around 14% GDP. [...] <b>Net</b> <b>interest</b> rises from 1.5% GDP to 3.3% GDP.

2500|$|Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid {{expenditures}} are funded by more permanent Congressional appropriations {{and so are}} considered mandatory spending.

Some programs, such as Food Stamps, are appropriated entitlements. Some mandatory spending, such as Congressional salaries, {{is not part of}} any entitlement program. Mandatory spending accounted for 59.8% of total federal outlays (net of receipts that partially pay for the programs), with <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> payments accounting for an additional 6.5%. In 2000, these were 53.2% and 12.5%, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result for}} the {{necessary}} zprop given by (Ret-03) depends critically on the assumptions that you make.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal debt {{repayment}} policy {{of a government}} facing a credibility problem: the public is uncertain about whether the outstanding public debt will be repaid in full or in part and requires a risk premium to roll it over.

The timing depends on the initial reputation of the government, the costs of taxing labour income, {{and the costs of}} defaulting on government debt, which are endogenized {{as a function of the}} redistributive preferences of the government. In the presence of a deficit <b>net</b> of <b>interest</b> payments, the uncertainty may or may not be resolved, but it will always be resolved when a lasting surplus <b>net</b> of <b>interest</b> payments is achieved.
