Remarkably, their relationships {{have yet to}} be clarified. The confusion concerns the enigmatic position of nematodes. Traditionally, nematodes have occupied a basal position, in part because they lack a true body cavity. However, the leading hypothesis now joins nematodes with arthropods in a molting clade, Ecdysozoa, based on data from several genes. Results We tested the Ecdysozoa hypothesis with analyses of more than 100 <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>alignments,</b> under conditions that would expose biases, and found that it was not supported.

40|$|The Optical Nuclear Polarization (ONP) in {{molecular}} crystals is {{a consequence}} of the selective population and depopulation of the electronic magnetic sublevels of optically excited triplet states due to symmetry selection rules for the mixing of electronic states by spin orbit coupling. Two ONP-mechanisms have been proposed on this basis: The "relaxation"-mechanism, analogous to the Overhauser-effect, treats the optically produced distribution over the electronic magnetic sublevels as a steady state polarization which is transferred partially to the nuclear spin states via suitable hyperfine relaxation. The "crossing polarization"-mechanism takes into account in addition the mixing of states due to the hyperfine interaction in the electronic intersystem crossing processes. In this paper the latter mechanism is extended to a complete description of the dynamics of population and depopulation of the electronic and nuclear spin levels by including also all relaxation processes among the magnetic sublevels.

The expansion parameters were adjusted by using a computer simulated search program. The best expansion parameters from the fit were used to assign the spins of the superdeformed (SD) rotational bands (RB) by integrating the calculated J (2). The data set includes 23 RB’s in 11 SD nuclei, which show no evidence of either irregular behavior {{near the bottom of}} the bands or abrupt angular momentum at low rotational frequency in the mass region ranging from A = 142 to A = 154. We used the differences of angular momenta at constant frequency as effective alignment. The relative properties of superdeformed rotational bands (SDRB’s) are analyzed in terms of the effective alignment of the valence nucleons. The effective alignment is a powerful tool to assign the configurations, to select the identical bands as well as to predict new SD bands from other combination of the orbitals.

During cell fusion, micro tubules and 10 -nm filaments from many cells form large bundles which are localized between rows of nuclei. No organized bundles of actin fibers were detected in these areas, although actin fibers were observed in regions away from the aligned nuclei. Although colchicine disrupts microtubules and inhibits nuclear movement, cytochalasin B (CB; 20 - 50 microgram/ml) does not inhibit cell fusion or nuclear movement. However, CB alters {{the shape of the}} syncytium, resulting in long filamentous processes extending from a central region. When these processes from neighboring cells make contact, fusion occurs, and nuclei migrate through the channels which are formed. Electron and immunofluorescence microscopy reveal bundles of microtubules and 10 -nm filaments in parallel arrays within these processes, but no bundles of microfilaments were detected. The effect of CB on the structural integrity of microfilaments at this high concentration (20 microgram/ml) was demonstrated by the disappearance of filaments interacting with heavy meromyosin. Cycloheximide (20 microgram/ml) inhibits protein synthesis but does not affect cell fusion, the formation of microtubules and 10 -nm filament bundles, or nuclear migration and alignment; thus, continued protein synthesis is not required.

Cryptogramma {{is a small}} circumboreal genus of rock ferns in the large, diverse family Pteridaceae and is most {{closely related to the}} Asian genus Coniogramme and the monotypic Central American genus Llavea. I generated a combined six locus plastid sequence alignment (rbcL, rbcL-accD, rbcL-atpB, rps 4 -trnS, trnG-trnR, and trnPpetG) and a low-copy <b>nuclear</b> marker (gapCp) <b>alignment</b> for 40 accessions. Phylogenetic analysis of these datasets using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference demonstrate that all three genera are reciprocally monophyletic, with Cryptogramma and Coniogramme most closely related to one another. This analysis also recovered the monotypic Cryptogramma section Homopteris and sect. Cryptogramma as reciprocally monophyletic. Within sect. Cryptogramma, the unambiguously supported phylogeny supported recognizing most described species as reciprocally monophyletic clades that are mostly allopatric and can be delineated by a few morphological characters. The nuclear DNA phylogeny supported the hypothesis that the allotetraploid Cr. sitchensis originated from a hybridization event between the Asian Cr. raddeana and the Beringian Cr. acrostichoides, and the plastid DNA phylogeny revealed that Cr. acrostichoides was the maternal parent. In contrast, the tetraploid Cr. crispa appears to have originated as an autopolyploid from an undiscovered or extinct ancestor. Further phylogenetic investigation of European Cryptogramma species using DNA sequence data from 15 accessions from Europe and southwest Asia revealed that Pleistocene glacial cycles have created genetic partitioning of Cr. crispa into eastern and western clades and have also {{led to the formation of}} the Turkish auto-octoploid Cr. bithynica with Cr. crispa as the parental taxon. Divergence time estimates for key nodes were inferred using Bayesian analysis of the plastid data set coupled with secondary time constraints to reveal that crown group Cryptogramma began diversifying in the Oligocene, with most present-day species originating in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The genus was inferred by likelihood-based ancestral area reconstruction of the chronogram and geographic distribution data to have originated in east Asia, with four colonization events reconstructed by vicariance or dispersal to the New World. My Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures (BAMM) showed no significant difference in speciation rates across time or among clades. The morphological stasis of Cryptogramma and its stable speciation rates in response to climate cycles during the Pleistocene suggest it will survive future range shifts caused by anthropogenically induced climate change...|$|R

The addition of Bi 2 O 3 results in the depolymerization of the phosphorus chain {{and the formation of}} Q((n)) (n = 0, 1, 2) phosphorus species, where n represents the number of P-Q-P bonds that can be quantified using P- 31 magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and constant-time double-quantum based,dipolar recoupling effects <b>nuclear</b> <b>alignment</b> reduction (CT-DQDRENAR). The Na- 23 {P- 31 }, P- 31 {Na- 23 }, and XPS results, consistently prove that both Na+ and Bi 3 + ions are bounded by phosphorus tetrahedron [PO 4](3 -). Unlike other trivalent ions such as Ga 3 + and Al 3 +, which connect with the phosphorus tetrahedron by corner-sharing, Bi 3 + ions were first proved to share edge with the phosphorus tetrahedron by the analysis of P- 31 spectra, taking the charge balance,and bond valence consideration into account. Such a difference in connectivity result in significant structural differences...|$|E

The structure {{of these materials}} forms continuous transitional gradients and discrete local microenvironments between adjacent (or within) tissues, and across matrix-cell boundaries, which is difficult to replicate with common scaffold systems. Here, the matrix densification of collagen leading to gradients in density, mechanical properties, and fibril morphology is studied. High-density regions form via a fluid pore pressure and flow-driven mechanism, with increased relative fibril density (10 x), mechanical properties (20 x, to 94. 40 +/- 18. 74 kPa), and maximum fibril thickness (1. 9 x, to 2 ̆ 6 gt; 1 mu m) compared to low-density regions, while maintaining porosity and fluid/mass transport to support viability of encapsulated cells. Similar to {{the organization of the}} articular cartilage zonal structure, it is found that high-density collagen regions induce cell and <b>nuclear</b> <b>alignment</b> of primary chondrocytes. Chondrocyte gene expression is maintained in collagen matrices, and no phenotypic changes are observed as a result of densification. Collagen densification provides a tunable platform for the creation of gradient systems to study complex cell-matrix interactions. These methods are easily generalized to compression and boundary condition modalities useful to mimic a broad range of tissues...|$|E
