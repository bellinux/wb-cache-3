With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it [...] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor. It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.

50|$|As dissimilatory nitrate {{reduction}} to ammonium is an {{anaerobic respiration}} process, marine microorganisms capable of performing DNRA are most {{commonly found in}} environments low in O2, such as oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the water column, or sediments with steep O2 gradients.DNRA has been documented in prokaryotes inhabiting the upper layer of marine sediments. For example,Benthic sulfur bacteria in genera such as Beggiatoa and Thioploca inhabit anoxic sediments on continental shelves and obtain energy by oxidizing sulfide via DNRA. These bacteria are {{able to carry out}} DNRA using intracellular nitrate stored in vacuoles. The direct reduction of nitrate to ammonium via dissimilatory nitrate reduction, coupled with the direct conversion of ammonium to dinitrogen via Anammox, has been attributed to significant <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> in certain parts of the ocean; this DNRA-Anammox coupling by DNRA and Anammox bacteria can account for nitrate loss in areas with no detectable denitrification, such as in OMZs off the coast of Chile, Peru, and Namibia, as well as OMZs over the Omani Shelf in the Arabian Sea. While denitrification is more energetically favourable than DNRA, there is evidence that bacteria using DNRA conserve more energy than denitrifiers, allowing them to grow faster. Thus, via DNRA-Anammox coupling, bacteria using DNRA and Anammox may be stronger competitors for substrates than denitrifiers.|$|E

40|$|The eastern {{tropical}} South Pacific (ETSP) upwelling {{region is}} one of the ocean’s largest sinks of fixed nitrogen, which is lost as N 2 via the anaerobic processes of anammox and denitrification. One-third of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> occurs in productive shelf waters stimulated by organic matter export as a result of eastern boundary upwelling. Offshore, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> rates are lower, but due to its sheer size this area accounts for ~ 70 % of ETSP <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss.</b> How <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> and primary production are regulated in the offshore ETSP region where coastal upwelling is less influential remains unclear. Mesoscale eddies, ubiquitous in the ETSP region, have been suggested to enhance vertical nutrient transport and thereby regulate primary productivity and hence organic matter export. Here, we investigated the impact of mesoscale eddies on anammox and denitrification activity using 15 N-labelled in situ incubation experiments. Anammox was shown to be the dominant <b>nitrogen</b> <b>loss</b> process, but varied across the eddy, whereas denitrification was below detection at all stations.

Usually, various conservation practices are implemented in the watershed to control the NPS pollution problem.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the linkage between nutrient input from various pasture management practices and water quality, and to quantify the impacts of land use changes and pasture management on water quality in a pasture-dominated watershed. Land use data from 1992, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2001, and 2004 were evaluated for the land use changes in the watershed, and the corresponding implemented management practices were also incorporated into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The individual impacts of land use change and pasture management were quantified by comparing the SWAT simulation results for different land use change and pasture management scenarios. The results indicated that land use changes resulted in greater total sediment (499 kg ha - 1) and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>losses</b> (3. 8 kg ha - 1) in the Moores Creek subwatershed, whereas pasture management resulted in greater total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>losses</b> (4. 3 kg ha - 1) in the Beatty Branch subwatershed.
