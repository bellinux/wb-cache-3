5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention.</b> However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E

After the annulment of Chief Moshood Abiola's presidential election on 12 June 1993, Chief Remilekun Fani-Kayode was one of those who openly wrote about and spoke out strongly against the annulment. He even went to court over the issue. In 1994 the government of General Sanni Abacha appointed him into the Justice Kayode Eso panel of inquiry which effectively probed and helped to sanitise the Nigerian judiciary and rid it of corrupt judges.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Hooker {{went back}} to being a {{traveling}} salesman, this time for wholesale grocers Carr, Chase & Raymond. He later became a junior partner with the banker-brokers William A. Belden & Company and was a successful businessman in New York for several years. In 1876, Hooker moved to Brattleboro, Vermont, where he became interested in politics. In 1878, Hooker was named as Governor Redfield Proctor's chief of staff, carrying the rank of colonel. Hooker was elected in 1879 and 1880 as department commander of the Grand Army of the Republic in Vermont, and received a third nomination to be re-elected, which he declined. In 1880, {{he was part of the}} <b>national</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> in Chicago as a delegate-at-large and also became a member of the national Republican committee. In 1881, Hooker was named as the sergeant at arms for the United States House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|Other {{issues than}} the tariff {{were still being}} decided. In May 1830 Jackson vetoed the Maysville Road Bill an {{important}} internal improvements program (especially to Kentucky and Henry Clay), and then followed this with additional vetoes of other such projects shortly before Congress adjourned {{at the end of}} May. Clay would use these vetoes to launch his presidential campaign. In 1831 the re-chartering of the Bank of the United States, with Clay and Jackson on opposite sides, reopened a long simmering problem. This issue was featured at the December 1831 <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> in Baltimore which nominated Henry Clay for president, and the proposal to re-charter was formally introduced into Congress on January 6, 1832. The Calhoun-Jackson split entered the center stage when Calhoun, as vice-president presiding over the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to deny Martin Van Buren the post of minister to England. Van Buren was subsequently selected as Jackson’s running mate at the 1832 Democratic National Convention held in May.|$|E

2500|$|Morton was {{originally}} a Democrat and {{opposed to the}} extension of slavery, but {{he became one of}} the organizers of the Republican Party. In 1856, after he joined the Republicans, he was one of three delegates from Indiana that attended that party's organizational convention in Pittsburgh. In 1856 he was nominated by his new party for the position of governor of Indiana. [...] In 1860 he was elected lieutenant governor on the ticket with Henry S. Lane. He became governor when Lane was elected to the United States Senate. Morton was re-elected in 1864 and served until 1867, in which time he was elected to the United States Senate. [...] He was re-elected in 1873 to the Senate. As Senator he worked for the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, was involved in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, and was a trusted advisor of the Republicans in the South. At the <b>national</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> in 1876 he received the second-highest number of votes for the presidential nomination. He was considered a leading Radical Republican during his government career. He died on November 1, 1877.|$|E

Senator Mark Hanna, President McKinley's warmest personal friend, was chairman, and the delegates, numbering over seven hundred, came, as usual at such conventions, from every State in the Union. Governor Roosevelt {{himself was a}} delegate, and sat near the middle aisle, five or six seats from the front.

60|$|From such anecdotes she pieced {{together}} her new Ditmar. He {{spoke of a}} large world she had never seen, of New York and Washington and Chicago, where he intended to take her. In the future he would never travel alone. And he told her of his having been a delegate to the last <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention,</b> explaining what a delegate was. He gloried in her innocence, and it was pleasant to dazzle her with impressions of his cosmopolitanism. In this, perhaps, he was not quite so successful as he imagined, but her eyes shone. She had never even been in a sleeping car! For her delectation he launched into an enthusiastic description of these vehicles, of palatial compartment cars, of limited, transcontinental trains, where one had a stenographer and a barber at one's disposal.|$|E

60|$|Only one higher honour {{could now}} {{fall to the}} lot of {{a citizen of the}} United States. The {{presidency}} was the single post to which Garfield's ambition could still aspire. That honour came upon him, like all the others, without his seeking; and it came, too, quite unexpectedly. Five months later, in the summer of 1880, the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> met to select a candidate for their party at the forthcoming presidential election. Every four years, before the election, each party thus meets to decide upon the man to whom its votes will be given at the final choice. After one or two ineffectual attempts to secure unanimity in favour of other and more prominent politicians, the Convention with one accord chose James Garfield for its candidate--a nomination which was quite as great a surprise to Garfield himself as to {{all the rest of the}} world. He was elected President of the United States in November, 1880.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, the <b>national</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention</b> {{assembled}} at Chicago on the 16th of May, full {{of enthusiasm}} and hope. The situation was easily understood. The Democrats {{would have the}} South. In order {{to succeed in the}} election, the Republicans had to win, in addition to the States carried by Fremont in 1856, those that were classed as [...] "doubtful,"--New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, or Illinois in the place of either New Jersey or Indiana. The most eminent Republican statesmen and leaders of the time thought of for the Presidency were Seward and Chase, both regarded as belonging to the more advanced order of antislavery men. Of the two, Seward had the largest following, mainly from New York, New England, and the Northwest. Cautious politicians doubted seriously whether Seward, to whom some phrases in his speeches had undeservedly given the reputation of a reckless radical, would be able to command the whole Republican vote in the doubtful States. Besides, during his long public career he had made enemies. It was evident that those who thought Seward's nomination too hazardous an experiment would consider Chase unavailable for the same reason. They would then look round for an [...] "available" [...] man; and among the [...] "available" [...] men Abraham Lincoln was easily discovered to stand foremost. His great debate with Douglas had given him a national reputation. The people of the East being eager to see the hero of so dramatic a contest, he had been induced to visit several Eastern cities, and had astonished and delighted large and distinguished audiences with speeches of singular power and originality. An address delivered by him in the Cooper Institute in New York, before an audience containing a large number of important persons, was then, and has ever since been, especially praised {{as one of the most}} logical and convincing political speeches ever made in this country. The people of the West had grown proud of him as a distinctively Western great man, and his popularity at home had some peculiar features which could be expected to exercise a potent charm. Nor was Lincoln's name as that of an available candidate left to the chance of accidental discovery. It is indeed not probable that he thought of himself as a Presidential possibility, during his contest with Douglas for the senatorship. As late as April, 1859, he had written to a friend who had approached him on the subject that he did not think himself fit for the Presidency. The Vice-Presidency was then the limit of his ambition. But some of his friends in Illinois took the matter seriously in hand, and Lincoln, after some hesitation, then formally authorized [...] "the use of his name." [...] The matter was managed with such energy and excellent judgment that, in the convention, he had not only the whole vote of Illinois to start with, but won votes on all sides without offending any rival. A large majority of the opponents of Seward went over to Abraham Lincoln, and gave him the nomination on the third ballot. As had been foreseen, Douglas was nominated by one wing of the Democratic party at Baltimore, while the extreme proslavery wing put Breckinridge into the field as its candidate. After a campaign conducted with the energy of genuine enthusiasm on the antislavery side the united Republicans defeated the divided Democrats, and Lincoln was elected President by a majority of fifty-seven votes in the electoral colleges.|$|E
