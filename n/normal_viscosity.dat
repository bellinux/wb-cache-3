We found that for simulations with <b>normal</b> <b>viscosity</b> the slopes for spectra of MHD are similar, although slightly more shallower than for hydro simulations. However, for simulations with hyperviscosity the slopes were very different, for instance, the slopes for hydro simulations showed pronounced and well-defined bottleneck effect, while the MHD slopes were relatively much less affected. We {{believe that this is}} indicative of MHD strong turbulence being less local than Kolmogorov turbulence. This calls for revision of MHD strong turbulence models that assume local "as-in-hydro case" cascading.

40|$|A marked {{anisotropy}} in viscosity {{develops in}} Earth's mantle as deformation strongly aligns the crystallographic axes {{of the individual}} grains that comprise the rocks. On the basis of geodynamic simulations, processes significantly affected by viscous anisotropy include post-glacial rebound, foundering of lithosphere and melt production above subduction zones. However, {{an estimate of the}} magnitude of viscous anisotropy {{based on the results of}} deformation experiments on single crystals differs by three orders of magnitude from that obtained by grain-scale numerical models of deforming aggregates with strong crystallographic alignment. Complicating matters, recent experiments indicate that deformation of the uppermost mantle is dominated by dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, a mechanism not activated in experiments on single crystals and not included in numerical models. Here, using direct measurements of the viscous anisotropy of highly deformed polycrystalline olivine, we demonstrate a significant directional dependence of viscosity. Specifically, shear viscosities measured in high-strain torsion experiments are 15 times smaller than <b>normal</b> <b>viscosities</b> measured in subsequent tension tests performed parallel to the torsion axis. This anisotropy is approximately an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by grain-scale simulations. These results indicate that dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding produces an appreciable anisotropy in rock viscosity. We propose that crystallographic alignment imparts viscous anisotropy because the rate of deformation is limited by the movement of dislocations through the interiors of the crystallographically aligned grains. The maximum degree of anisotropy is reached at geologically low shear strain (of about ten) such that deforming regions of the upper mantle will exhibit significant viscous anisotropy...|$|R

Recently, it was experimentally shown by Boyer et al.

We investigate the shear flow of dense granular materials composed of circular particles immersed in a viscous fluid by means of molecular dynamics simulations interfaced with the Lattice Boltzmann Method [3]. A homogeneous flow of the suspension is obtained through periodic boundary conditions and by directly applying a confining pressure on the granular phase and shearing the fluid phase.

40|$|The {{steady state}} {{rheological}} properties of viscous emulsions {{are discussed in}} the dilute and semi-dilute concentration regions. In these systems the first normal stress differences can be measured as well. Such data have been collected over a wide range of ratios of droplet over matrix viscosity. In this manner data became available to evaluate the Choi-Schowalter model. Application of the latter to the normal stresses requires that the droplet diameter be known. At high shear rates the droplet diameter changes nearly inversely proportional to the shear rate. This results in a first normal stress difference proportional to shear rate and hence a 'normal viscosity' can be defined. This is used to compare the data with the available theoretical predictions.

Scavenger antioxidant {{capacity of}} reactive oxygen species was evaluated by superoxide dismutase and catalase activity measurements, whereas the chain-breaking antioxidant efficiency was detected by total antioxidant status assessment. In semen with <b>normal</b> <b>viscosity,</b> unaltered enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant capacity was revealed in the asthenozoospermic specimens, whereas low superoxide dismutase activity was detected in oligoasthenozoospermic samples. On the contrary, impairment of both the scavenger and chain-breaking antioxidative systems was revealed in asthenozoospermic and oligoasthenozoospermic hyperviscous ejaculates, regardless of sperm count. Catalase activity and total antioxidant status values were also reduced in the 2 subgroups of hyperviscous ejaculates compared with their respective matched controls, whereas similar superoxide dismutase activities were detected in oligoasthenozoospermic samples with normal and high consistencies. These results suggest that asthenozoospermia {{could be related to}} an antioxidant deficiency only in combined ejaculate pathologies, and that a severe impairment of the low and high molecular weight seminal antioxidative capacities could be associated with semen hyperviscosity.

The inner zone is advection-dominated, the middle zone is convection-dominated and ranges from a few tens to a few thousands of gravitational radii, and the outer zone is convectively stable and outwardly matches a Keplerian disc. The net energy flux throughout the flow is inward, as in type I solutions.

Methods and results We studied the accuracy of Doppler pressure gradients derived from regurgitant jet peak velocities using the simplified Bernoulli equation (SBE) using an in vitro flow model of atrio-ven-tricular valve regurgitation. We observed overall a good correlation (r = 0. 89, P, 0. 0001) with actual pressure gradient, when there is <b>normal</b> fluid <b>viscosity</b> and the jet is free of wall interaction. However, we observed various degrees of underestimation of pressure gradient by Doppler when regur-gitant chamber size was reduced (P = 0. 0003), when fluid viscosity was increased (P, 0. 0001), or in the presence of wall interaction (P, 0. 0001). Chamber compliance had no effect on the accuracy of pressure gradient prediction (P = 0. 36). Significant underestimation error in pressure gradient prediction by Doppler of up to 43. 2 % was observed.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{prograde}} equatorial jet stresses cannot occur in an axisymmetric inviscid fluid, owing to the constraints of local angular momentum conservation. For a viscous fluid, the constraints of mass conservation prevent the formation of any local maximum of absolute angular momentum (m) without a means of transferring m against its gradient (delta m) in the meridional plane. The circumstances under which m can be diffused up-gradient by <b>normal</b> molecular <b>viscosity</b> are derived, and illustrated with reference to numerical simulations of axisymmetric flows in a cylindrical annulus. Viscosity is shown to act so as to tend to expel m from the interior outwards from the rotation axis. Such an effect can produce local super-rotation even in a mechanically isolated fluid. The tendency of viscosity to result in the expulsion of m is shown to be analogous in certain respects to a vorticity-mixing hypothesis for the effects of non-axisymmetric eddies of the zonally-averaged flow. It is shown how the advective and diffusive transport of m by non-axisymmetric eddies can be represented by the Transformed Eulerian Mean meridional circulation and the Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux of Andrews and McIntyre respectively, in the zonal mean. Constraints on the form and direction of the EP flux in an advective/diffusive flow for such eddies are derived, by analogy with similar constraints on the diffusive flux of m due to viscosity...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new normal-mode {{formalism}} for computing {{the response of}} an aspherical, self-gravitating, linear viscoelastic earth model to an arbitrary surface load.

We introduce a surface-load representation theorem analogous to Betti’s reciprocity relation in seismology. Taking advantage of this theorem and the biorthogonality of the viscoelastic modes, we determine the complete response to a surface load {{in the form of a}} Green’s function. We also demonstrate that each viscoelastic mode has its own unique energy partitioning, which can be used to characterize it. In subsequent papers, we apply the theory to spherically symmetric and aspherical earth models. Key words: glacial rebound, mantle <b>viscosity,</b> <b>normal</b> modes, viscoelasticity. ...|$|R
