50|$|Nail polish in the Western {{world has}} {{traditionally}} been worn by women, {{going in and out}} of acceptability depending upon moral customs of the day.

Since the 1920s, nail colors progressed from French manicures and standard reds to various palettes of color choices, usually coordinated with the fashion industry's clothing colors for the season.|$|E

5000|$|Acrylic nails are a {{more common}} form of {{artificial}} nails and may also {{be referred to as}} [...] "liquid and powder nails". They have been around for decades whereas gel <b>nail</b> <b>products</b> are still a very recent addition to the nail industry first being introduced in the 1980's. The most popular acrylic nail service is the pink and white which refers to the use of pink colored acrylic and a white acrylic powder to create a long-lasting French manicure look. Just as with gel nails, acrylic nail extensions can be created using forms to create sculpted nails or tips. Forms are special stickers that are placed {{at the end of each}} finger, under the finger nail, and secured in place so that wet acrylic can be sculpted into a nail extension at the fingernail's edge. Thus, each nail extension is sculpted and why this procedure is referred to as [...] "sculpts" [...] or [...] "sculpted nails." [...] Tips are simply mass-produced plastic nail tips that are adhered to the fingernail's edge using nail resin. Each tip is clipped and filed into shape before applying the wet acrylic and the nail extension is made.|$|E
5000|$|The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with nail polish are disputed. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), [...] "The amount of chemicals used in animal studies is probably {{a couple of hundred}} times higher than what you would be exposed to from using nail polish every week or so. So the chances of any individual phthalate producing such harm humans is very slim." [...] A more serious health risk is faced by professional nail technicians, who perform manicures over a workstation known as a [...] "nail table," [...] on which the client's hands rest - directly below the technician's breathing zone. In 2009, Dr. Susan Reutman, an epidemiologist with the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Division of Applied Research and Technology, announced a federal effort {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} downdraft vented nail tables (VNTs) in removing potential nail polish chemical and dust exposures from the technician's work area. These ventilation systems have potential to reduce worker exposure to chemicals by at least 50%.

40|$|This article {{gives the}} results of contact {{allergic}} reactions to cosmetics seen between 1985 and 1990 (462 patients investigated) and between 1991 and 1996 (486 patients investigated). Perfume components remain the most frequently occurring allergens in cosmetics. They are followed by preservative agents, a class within which important shifts have occurred over time (e. g. as with the isothiazolinone mixture). Excipients and certainly emulsifiers (e. g. cocamidopropylbetaine) are potentially not only irritants but also allergens. Among the "active" or category-specific ingredients, oxidative hair dyes, based on paraphenylenediamine and derivatives, and <b>nail</b> care <b>products,</b> based on (meth) acrylates are particularly apt to cause professional dermatoses. Finally, the share of sunscreens as cosmetic allergens remains limited, which may well be because a contact or photocontactallergy is often not recognized since the differential diagnosis with a primary sun intolerance is not always obvious. status: publishe...|$|R
