2500|$|The welder {{can adjust}} the {{oxy-acetylene}} flame to be carbonizing (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment {{is made by}} adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The <b>neutral</b> <b>flame</b> is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the <b>neutral</b> <b>flame</b> {{as the starting point}} for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the oxygen valve on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air. The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue inner cone and the darker blue to colorless outer cone. The inner cone is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this inner cone is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately [...] and provides enough heat to easily melt steel. In the inner cone the acetylene breaks down and partly burns to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which in the outer cone combine with more oxygen from the surrounding air and burn.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFlame-enhanced laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) {{was investigated}} to improve the sensitivity of LIBS. It was realized by generating laser-induced plasmas in the blue outer envelope of a <b>neutral</b> oxy-acetylene <b>flame.</b> Fast imaging and temporally resolved spectroscopy of the plasmas were carried out. Enhanced intensity of up to 4 times and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 60 % for emission lines were observed. Electron temperatures and densities were calculated to investigate the flame effects on plasma evolution. These calculated electron temperatures and densities showed that high-temperature and low-density plasmas were achieved before 4 µs in the flame environment, which {{has the potential to}} improve LIBS sensitivity and spectral resolution...|$|R

40|$|Closed accessCost {{effective}} and fast ultra-high-temperature testing {{methods such as}} oxyacetylene torch testing are extremely useful for the rapid screening of ultra-high-temperature ceramic (UHTC) materials for hypersonic applications. There is no report in the literature, however, of an organised study to measure the heat flux and how it varies with gas flow rate, gas flow ratio and distance from the nozzle tip for an oxyacetylene flame. In this paper, the authors report {{for the first time}} the heat flux mapping of an oxidising, <b>neutral</b> and reducing <b>flame.</b> The measured heat flux was as high as ∼ 17 MW m- 2 at a distance of 10 mm from the nozzle, which is much higher than that previously reported in the literature. Torch testing was carried out for Cf-HfB 2 UHTC composites at this heat flux and the results are presented along with detailed microstructural characterisation...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} measure the total gaseous phosphorus content in biogas. The amount of air needed for a <b>neutral</b> to oxidising <b>flame</b> was mixed with the biogas. The gas mixture was burnt in a closed quartz burner and the combustion gasses were bubbled through a nitric acid solution. The phosphate content in the bubbling liquid was determined with sector field ICP-MS. The {{technique was}} validated in the lab with phosphine. Afterwards the set-up was installed on a landfill. The total gaseous phosphorus content in the landfill gas, measured with the combustive technique, ranged from 1. 65 to 4. 44 mgrg P/m 3. At {{the same time the}} phosphine concentration in the landfill gas was determined gas chromatographically (GC). The phosphine (PH 3) content measured with GC ranged from 7. 6 to 16. 7 mgrg PH 3 -P/m 3. Since the phosphine-P content (GC) was consistently higher than the total gaseous phosphorus content (burner/ICP-MS), the hypothesised presence of highly toxic gaseous phosphorus compounds other than phosphine could not be demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Preparation {{of flight}} {{experiment}} designs {{is supported by}} experimental studies of acoustically induced mixing process, optical transmissivities of particle cloud distributions, wall saturation effects and their control {{through the use of}} electrically <b>neutral</b> <b>flame</b> tube materials and surfaces, and the pyrolysis-vaporization kinetics of selected organic particulates. Drop tower tests of stabilized particle cloud flames have allowed valuable comparison of g = 0 and g = 1 (upwards and downwards) stabilized flame propagation. These stabilized flame data will be valuable assists in dealing with the freely propagating particle cloud flame data anticipated through Space Shuttle experimentation. Supporting theoretical studies emphasize comprehensive flame propagation and extinction relations among premixed single phase (gaseous) flames and premixed particle cloud flames, for both stabilized and freely propagating flames...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{positive}} flame stretch on laminar burning velocities, and conditions for transition to unstable flames, were studied experimentally for freely propagating spherical flames at both stable and unstable preferential-diffusion conditions. The data base involved new measurements for H 2 /O 2 /N 2 mixtures at values of flame stretch up to 7600 s- 1, and existing measurements for C 3 H 8 /O 2 /N 2 mixtures at values of flame stretch up to 900 s- 1. Laminar burning velocities varied linearly with increasing Karlovitz numbers [...] either decreasing or increasing at stable or unstable preferential-diffusion conditions [...] yielding Markstein numbers that primarily varied with the fuel-equivalence ratio. Neutral preferential-diffusion conditions, however, were shifted toward the unstable {{side of the}} maximum laminar burning velocity condition that the simplest preferential-diffusion theories associate with <b>neutral</b> stability. All <b>flames</b> exhibited transition to unstable flames: unstable preferential-diffusion coditions yielded early transition to irregular flame surfaces, and stable preferential-diffusion conditions yielded delayed transition to cellular flames by hydrodynamic instability. Conditions for hydrodynamic instability transitions for H 2 /O 2 /N 2 mixtures were consistent with an earlier correlation due to Groff for propane/air flames, based on the predictions of Istratov and Librovich...|$|R

By brazing there can be assembled pieces of most metals and ferrous and nonferrous alloys, with high melting temperature. This paper presents an analysis of the microstructure of materials from a brazed merge of aluminum alloy L 103 which is often used to produce pieces of aeronautical industry. Brazing material was performed using several technologies, and after examination of the microstructure of materials from the merge area it was established as optimal technology the technology which consist of pickling in Aloclene 100 solution with the deposition of filler material {{on both sides of the}} base material and the use of spectral acetylene and <b>neutral</b> <b>flame.</b> Key words...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{ionization}} of alkali species {{emitted from}} thermally decomposing vegetative matter into the combustion zone {{of a fire}} makes the zone a weakly ionized gaseous medium. Collision between the medium electrons and <b>neutral</b> <b>flame</b> particles is a dominant form of particle interaction and incident microwave energy absorption process. Electromagnetic wave absorption properties of vegetation fire have implications {{for the safety of}} fire fighters during wildfire suppression where communication blackouts have been experienced. Propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves in a vegetation fire could be deduced from its relative dielectric permittivity. In the experiment, a controlled fire burner was constructed where various dried natural vegetation could be used as fuel. The burner was equipped with thermocouples and used as a cavity for microwaves with a laboratory quality network analyser to determine effective complex permittivity from scattering parameters. A controlled vegetation fire with a maximum flame temperature of 1050 K was set in the burner and X-band microwaves (8. 0 – 9. 6 GHz) were made to propagate through the flame. For the flame, at temperatures of 800 and 1015 K, imaginary and real components of effective complex dielectric permittivity were measured to range from 0. 113 to 0. 119 and from 0. 898 to 0. 903, respectively...|$|E
