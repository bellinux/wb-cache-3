However, {{it is essential to}} evaluate and characterize the wastes for a correct management namely by incorporation in industrial processes in order to avoid negative impacts. Foundry sand is a waste that can be reused as an aggregate and incorporated in asphalt mixtures. In this work, a mix design study of one asphalt mixture was carried out to assess the maximum amount of material that could be used (5 %), together with an evaluation of its water sensitivity.  Additionally the leaching behavior was evaluated. Due to the fluoride concentration, it was concluded that this waste should be sent to a non-hazardous waste landfill, however it does not constitute a limitation on its incorporation in asphalt mixtures which could be an effective process for foundry sand management from both the environmental and economic points of view. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{often has}} had (and has) {{detrimental}} outcomes on destinations but {{the need and}} the rele-vance of a sustainable development of tourism was only recently recognised. Sustainable tour-ism is a quite recent concept, derived by the notion of sustainable development; it is usually re-lated to environmental issues and particularly to <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> <b>waste.</b> Wider definitions are now emerging {{in the scientific community}} including, usually, social and economic dimensions together with the environmental one. Although, the intrinsic multidimensional nature of sustain-ability and the high number of stakeholders to be involved in its evaluation (e. g. policy makers, administrators, local residents, tourists, etc.) make quite difficult the definition and the meas-urement of this trait.

Therefore, it is appropriate to consider and optimize the resource efficiency of 3 D printing technologies at this early stage of this technology development. In this work, the direct electrical energy demand of 3 D printing (i. e. fused deposition modeling) was studied and a generic model proposed.

As a result, all measured properties of the studied recycled vegetable oils show that the products are environmentally friendly. Two types of vegetable oil were studied; three chain oils and two mold oils. The degree of biodegradation (BOD 28 ) of the mold oils, was about 77 % and the biodegradation of chain oils was about 60 % - 62 %.

Today, {{sustainable design}} {{is an integral}} part of all design, construction, procurement and operations and maintenance activities. This paper outlines NYC Transit’s adoption of sustainable business practices which exposed significant opportunities to reduce the impact to ecologies. These practices encompass high-performance building designs, renewable energy applications, conservation of energy, water and <b>natural</b> <b>resources,</b> <b>waste</b> reduction, recycling and reuse, environmentally responsible procurement and total life cycle analysis. A cause-and-effect benefit is then demonstrated for many of these sustainable practices encompassing both local and geographically distant ecologies. Some examples include the inadvertent procurement of Azobe (an unsustainably over-harvested tropical hardwood from Africa) used as rail ties in the design and construction of rail tracks; the demand for large quantities of energy to move rolling stocks, contributing to toxic emissions fallout from regional power plants; the contribution to poor ambient air quality as a result of non-regulated off-road diesel equipment emission from construction sites.

In {{order to reduce the}} depletion of valuable materials and <b>natural</b> <b>resources,</b> <b>waste</b> management of constructions needs to be considered {{in the early stages of}} design. This requires innovative design strategies that take into account the future demolition and provide flexible and versatile structures. Industrial, flexible and demountable building system (IFD) is trying to create buildings with higher quality, more adaptable and better environmental characteristics. But till date, a recognized method for IFD building assessment has not been defined. This research focuses on IFD component analysis process for a residential terrace house layout. In the first step of the research, a conceptual prototype for the key elements was proposed. Next step was to create a procedure for evaluating the suggested design. The evaluation process contains two parts. First, the layout and design characteristics assessment according to IFD criteria was developed. Second, the stability, seismic and load bearing capacity of the designed structure was characterized by conventional nonlinear static analysis (pushover) through finite element computations with ETABS software. It is proposed that, application of these assessments can testify to the flexibility and strength of the designed layout.
