5000|$|Nowadays {{the term}} [...] "Rogallo wing" [...] {{is synonymous with}} one {{composed}} of two partial conic surfaces with both cones pointing forward. Slow Rogallo wings have wide, shallow cones. Fast subsonic and supersonic Rogallo wings have long, narrow cones. The Rogallo wing is a simple and inexpensive flying wing with remarkable properties. The wing itself is not a kite; neither is it a glider nor a powered aircraft, until the wing is tethered or arranged in a configuration that glides or is powered. In other words, how it is attached and manipulated determines what type of aircraft it becomes. The Rogallo wing is most often seen in toy kites, but {{has been used to}} construct spacecraft parachutes, sport parachutes, ultralight powered aircraft like the trike and hang gliders. Rogallo had more than one patent concerning his finding; the due-diligence expansion of his invention involved cylindrical formats, multiple lobes, various stiffenings, various <b>nose</b> <b>angles,</b> etc. The Charles Richards design and use of the Rogallo wing in the NASA Paresev project resulted in an assemblage that became the stark template for the standard Rogallo hang-glider wing that would blanket the world of the sport in the early 1970s.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to verify the functional and structural capability of the Centaur D- 1 A nose fairing. A full-scale flight-type nose fairing was jettisoned at the Lewis Research Center Space Power Chamber at simulated altitude. Two complete jettisons of the nose fairing were performed, one without aft helper springs and one with aft helper springs. A ''static'' rotation test was also performed to verify capability of the helper springs and to allow clearance measurements between the nose fairing and spacecraft envelope mock-up at certain discrete <b>nose</b> fairing rotation <b>angles.</b> <b>Nose</b> fairing trajectories, structural deflections, clearances, and hinge forces during jettison are presented. Data from subsequent Centaur D- 1 A flights, relative to nose fairing jettisons, are compared with the experimental results...|$|R

Tavian technician in electronics from ENIM for his contribution {{on the development}} of the residual velocity measurement sensors. International audienceThe paper describes a work focused on the process of perforation of steel sheet. Experimental,analytical and numerical investigations have been carried out to analyze in details the perforation process. Based on these approaches,the ballistic properties of the material and the failure modes depending on the projectile nose shape(conical,blunt or hemispherical) have been studied. Different failure modes have been observed,including petaling, plug ejection and circumference necking. The special study about the number of petals has been done for different <b>nose</b> <b>angles</b> using conical shape projectiles. The complete energy balance is also reported and the absorbed energy by the steel sheet has been obtained by measuring initial and residual projectile velocities. A wide range of impact velocities from 35 to 180 m/s has been covered during the tests. All the projectiles are 13 mm in diameter and the plates are 1 mm thick. Moreover,the mass ratio(projectile mass/steel sheet mass) and the ratio between the span of the steel sheet and the diameter of the projectile are constant, equal to 0. 38 and 3. 85, respectively...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{have been}} {{considerable}} interest and research {{addressing the problem}} of vortex asymmetry and induced side forces on slenderbodies at high incidence. We present here a brief review highlighting some of the developments {{that have taken place}} in the broad understanding of this complex phenomenon and control of side forces, which are very important for engineering applications. Results are presented from two recent studies (carried out in NAL, India) showing in some detail the effectiveness of nose bluntness and axial nose blowing for side force control. The problem of vortex asymmetry and the associated side forces (and yawing moments) on pointed forebodies at high angles of attack and zero side slip has received considerable attention in literature (Fig. 1). Beyond a certain angle of attack (depending primarily on the <b>nose</b> apex <b>angle),</b> the symmetric vortex flows become asymmetric resulting in side force generation; the side force generally increase...|$|R
