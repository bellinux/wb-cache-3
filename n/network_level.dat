25|$|The New Zealand Treasury once {{estimated}} the economic loss from Telecom's (now former) monopoly {{to be in}} the region of $50–$250 million a year. Another study commissioned in 1998 by competitor Clear (later TelstraClear) estimated that the loss was $400 million a year. At a retail level Telecom now faces competition in all areas— cellular, internet, toll-calls and, subject to ongoing developments, in local calling. At a <b>network</b> <b>level</b> these retail services often resell Telecom wholesale products.|$|E
25|$|Presenters at the O also {{occasionally}} take on duties at the <b>network</b> <b>level,</b> alongside {{their existing}} capacities {{at the local}} level. For example, several local anchors at CTV's O have filled in for Lloyd Robertson in the past on the network's national newscast CTV National News; and weathercasters from CTV's Toronto and Vancouver O (CFTO-DT and CIVT-DT, respectively) present the weather segments on CTV News Channel. A number of personalities at New York City radio and television stations have also done assignments for both a station and a parent network at the same time, due to their proximity to network studios and offices.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a level-based algorithm {{to deal with}} the network design problem. The proposed algorithm performs the design of the different <b>network</b> <b>levels</b> simultaneously, {{in the sense that the}} information from an ascending level can be used to optimize the solution obtained for a previous level. The experimental results have shown a significant cost reduction of 13. 16 % when the proposed algorithm is compared to a conventional approach in which the <b>network</b> <b>levels</b> are processed in separate. In addition, the time consumed for an engineer to design the network used in the experiment was reduced...|$|R

This study expands this view theoretically {{by focusing on}} food supply chain networks. Specifically, we argue that both, network-level and firm-level goals have to be achieved to structure long-term and successful network relationships. By implementing simultaneously partnering and supply chain management strategies, the network’s management will ensure goal consensus among the network actors and goal compatibility between the <b>network</b> <b>levels.</b> Thereby, preconditions for the achievement of network-level and firm-level goals will be installed. <b>Network</b> goals, <b>network</b> <b>levels,</b> goal consensus, goal compatibility, focal company, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R
25|$|Meridian also geared a {{large amount}} of its network output towards younger viewers, with {{independent}} commissions including Wizadora for pre-school children, plus ZZZap!, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, It's a Mystery, The Vanishing Man, Jane Austen's Emma, William and Mary and Eye of the Storm for older children. Drama became a successful genre for the station, with Peter Kosminsky's No Child of Mine, tackling the emotionally difficult subject of child abuse, winning Meridian a BAFTA award. Meridian presents Mary Wesley's two novels: Harnessing Peacocks and The Vacillations of Poppy Carew. Later, the same production team tackled vicious childhood bullying in Walking on the Moon. Meridian's two-part production In the Name of Love in 1999 starred Tara Fitzgerald, Tim Dutton and Mark Strong, and was written by Sarah-Louise Hawkins and directed by Ferdinand Fairfax. Hornblower was a Sunday night success for the ITV network while another Sunday night favourite, Where the Heart Is, transferred production from Anglia Television to Meridian in 2002 - the station's last major contribution at a <b>network</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{performance}} of hierarchical and distributed caching architectures. With hierarchical caching, caches are placed at multiple <b>levels</b> of the <b>network.</b> With distributed caching, caches are only placed at the bottom <b>levels</b> of the <b>network</b> {{and there are no}} intermediate caches. Our main performance measure is the expected latency to retrieve a Web document. We find that hierarchical caching has shorter connection times than distributed caching, thus, placing additional copies at intermediate <b>network</b> <b>levels</b> reduces the retrieval latency for small documents. We also find that distributed caching has shorter transmission times than hierarchical caching. Distributed caching has higher bandwidth usage than hierarchical caching. However, the network traffic generated by a distributed scheme is better distributed, using more bandwidth in the lower <b>network</b> <b>levels,</b> which are less congested. We also discuss administrative issues concerning the large scale deployment of distri [...] ...|$|R
