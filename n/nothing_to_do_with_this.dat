500|$|Kaja: 1988–2008 {{became a}} bestseller in Norway. The book reached second {{place on the}} bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. Kaja: 1988–2008 sparked renewed {{controversy}} over perceptions of Scientology activities in Norway. In {{a review of the}} book, Dagbladet noted that because the author was writing both as a private individual and as a physician, [...] "he is trained to look at the familiar and intimate with professionalism and distance." [...] Upon the book's publication, representative Matthias Fosse of the Church of Scientology stated, [...] "Church of Scientology had absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> young woman's decision to take her own life. We are sorry for the loss the family has suffered, but this young woman was never a member of the Church of Scientology and never participated in any of the church activities." ...|$|E
500|$|Cruise's {{representative}} {{responded to}} the controversy shortly after it broke, telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise's involvement were [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "he never said that". According to The Washington Post, Cruise's publicist asserted that [...] "Tom had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' {{for the last six}} months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'" [...] A representative of Cruise had also denied any involvement of Cruise with the issue, specifically responding to allegations of Cruise's reputed corporate power play.|$|E
500|$|Crews began hanging {{the sign}} in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune {{architecture}} critic Kamin warned Trump that {{his review of}} the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded [...] "As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign", but architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying [...] "Just for the record, I had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> sign!". The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, [...] "Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign". Kamin has noted {{that part of the}} problem is the architectural traditions of the city: [...] "If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior Chicago Sun-Times building signage was via Twitter. As a result of the fiasco, Emanuel initiated a study on how to alter the rules to avert similar signage controversies in the future.|$|E

500|$|... "Trapped in the Closet" [...] {{generated}} significant controversy. Tom Cruise, who {{is portrayed}} in the episode, reportedly threatened {{to back out of}} his promotional obligations for the Paramount Pictures film [...] if Viacom, the owner of both Comedy Central and Paramount, allowed a repeat of the episode to air. A publicist of Cruise denied this, saying [...] "Tom had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Though the episode was originally scheduled for rebroadcast on March 15, 2006, the episode [...] "Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls" [...] was shown instead. Comedy Central representatives stated this change was made as a tribute to Isaac Hayes, but South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone thought otherwise; they issued a satirical statement saying they (Parker and Stone) were [...] "servants of the dark lord Xenu". Hayes, the voice of staple character Chef, asked to be released from his contract shortly {{before the start of the}} tenth season. The reason for his departure, as reported by Stone, was due to his membership in Scientology and this episode, which Hayes—despite initially supporting the show's satirical take on several talk shows—claimed was very offensive. The episode has since been rebroadcast on Comedy Central multiple times.|$|E

2500|$|In 1440, in the King's name, an {{invitation}} {{is said to}} have been sent to the young, 16-year-old 6th Earl of Douglas and his little brother, twelve-year-old David, to visit the king at Edinburgh Castle in November 1440. According to legend, they came, and were entertained at the royal table, where James, still a little boy, was charmed by them. However, they were treacherously hurried to their doom, which took place by beheading in the castle yard of Edinburgh on 24 November, with the 10-year-old king pleading for their lives. Three days later Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld, their chief adherent, shared the same fate. It is likely the king, being a small child, had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this.</b> This infamous incident took the name of [...] "the Black Dinner".|$|E
2500|$|Years later, while President of France, Mitterrand {{maintained}} that Vichy France, a distinct and unrecognized entity, had {{been responsible for}} the roundup of Jews who were then deported to death camps during the war. [...] "The Republic had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this.</b> I do not believe France is responsible," [...] he said in 1994. This position was refuted by President Jacques Chirac in 1995 who stated that it was time that France faced up to its past and he acknowledged the role of the State - [...] "4500 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [...] obeyed the demands of the Nazis" [...] - in the Holocaust. He added that the [...] "criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French State".|$|E
2500|$|While the {{criminal}} behaviour of Vichy France was consistently acknowledged, {{this point of}} view denied any responsibility of the state of France, alleging that acts committed between 1940 and 1944 were unconstitutional acts devoid of legitimacy. The main proponent of this view was Charles de Gaulle himself, who insisted, as did other historians afterwards, on the unclear conditions of the June 1940 vote granting full powers to Pétain, which was refused by the minority of Vichy 80. In particular, coercive measures used by Pierre Laval have been denounced by those historians who hold that the vote did not, therefore, have Constitutional legality (...) [...] In later years, de Gaulle's position was reiterated by president Mitterrand. [...] "I will not apologize in the name of France. The Republic had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this.</b> I do not believe France is responsible," [...] he said in September 1994.|$|E
5000|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in September 1997, when a {{group of}} youths {{reportedly}} gathered at Yeomans's home on several consecutive nights, on each occasion throwing eggs, margarine, butter, cakes, and mud at the house and shouting taunts aimed at Yeomans. Her mother later said that the incident prompted Yeomans to tell her family, [...] "It is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Daddy, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Mummy, and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Sarah (her sister).

Ultimately, for all its naked ambition, [...] "Advocate" [...] ends up proving that without the guiding hand of Dre, Game can ... sound like Dre. Just listen to him, he’ll tell you. But without that ability to hammer out his own identity, the Game is still in progress." [...] Stylus Magazine stated [...] "Despite the fact that Dre had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> project, the album sounds just as big-budget and lavishly appointed as The Documentary. Like his mentor, Game knows how to tweak the bone-rattling clap of the snare and play up the percussive aspect of keyboards." ...|$|E
2500|$|A form {{of social}} {{production}} and reproduction, along with its economic and financial mechanisms, its political formations, and so on, can be desired as such, {{in whole or in}} part, independently of the interests of the desiring-subject. It was not by means of a metaphor, even a paternal metaphor, that Hitler was able to sexually arouse the fascists. It is not by means of a metaphor that a banking or stock-market transaction, a claim, a coupon, a credit, is able to arouse people who are not necessarily bankers. And what about the effects of money that grows, money that produces more money? There are socioeconomic [...] "complexes" [...] that are also veritable complexes of the unconscious, and that communicate a voluptuous wave from the top to the bottom of their hierarchy (the military–industrial complex). And ideology, Oedipus, and the phallus have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> because they depend on it rather than being its impetus.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2001, Sanger was {{introduced}} to the concept of a wiki by extreme programming enthusiast Ben Kovitz after explaining to Kovitz the slow pace of growth Nupedia endured {{as a result of its}} onerous submission process. Kovitz suggested that adopting the wiki model would allow editors to contribute simultaneously and incrementally throughout the project, thus breaking Nupedia's bottleneck. Sanger was excited about the idea, and after he proposed it to Wales, they created the first Nupedia wiki on January 10, 2001. The wiki was initially intended as a collaborative project for the public to write articles that would then be reviewed for publication by Nupedia's expert volunteers. The majority of Nupedia's experts, however, wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> project, fearing that mixing amateur content with professionally researched and edited material would compromise the integrity of Nupedia's information and damage the credibility of the encyclopedia. Thus, the wiki project, dubbed [...] "Wikipedia" [...] by Sanger, went live at a separate domain five days after its creation.|$|E

2500|$|This did {{not prevent}} the Sultan from seizing Old Phocaea in December, or attacking the domains of Domenico's cousin, Dorino II Gattilusio, in January 1456: Mehmed himself {{captured}} Ainos, while his admiral Yunus Pasha took the islands of Imbros and Samothrace. Lemnos, ruled by Domenico's younger brother Niccolò Gattilusio, was also lost when the local population rebelled in spring 1456 and called for Ottoman aid. Lesbos itself was spared the same fate, for the time being, {{partly due to the}} general impotence of the Christian powers in the Aegean, and partly because Mehmed's attention was diverted north, to his wars with Hungary. In the autumn of 1456, a Papal squadron under Cardinal Ludovico Trevisan managed to capture the islands of Lemnos, Thasos, and Samothrace. Although the Gattilusi had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> in summer 1457 Mehmed sent his fleet to attack Lesbos. The Ottomans' attack on Methymna failed, however, in the face of determined resistance, an with the aid of Trevisan's ships.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the failure}} of Operation Dove, Ryan {{remained}} in Berlin. Between Autumn 1940 and January 1943 {{he lived in a}} [...] "large gloomy flat" [...] in Berlin with an acquaintance from Ireland, Helmut Clissmann, and Hans Ritter, both of whom were Abwehr assets. Clissmann was married to Elizabeth [...] "Budge" [...] Mulcahy of Sligo, a friend of both Ryan and Leopold Kerney. As an exchange student in Dublin in the 1930s Clissmann had known Ryan and other republicans and socialists well; before Hitler came to power, he {{had been a member of}} a left-wing student organisation. Ryan was not in good health as a result of his wound and treatment in the Spanish prison, and at one stage he had a stroke, but he remained convivial and drew around him a small circle of friends. He had to remain incognito and in general did not discuss politics. He grew increasingly deaf (though his friends suggested that he sometimes feigned deafness to avoid uncomfortable conversations with the German authorities) so that he could not be left alone at night – he could not hear the anti-aircraft sirens. He later had to spend his days outdoors or in cafés (where he became friendly with Francis Stuart, whom he had known from Dublin) so that people could see him if the sirens sounded. He took Irish newspapers to Stuart and, being in a position to get extra rations, shared them generously with his friends. In return, Stuart took Ryan, who had a lot of time on his hands, on trips to the countryside and on outings with his students. Stephen Hayes, Chief of Staff of the IRA, claimed that Ryan and Stuart were carrying out propaganda work among Irish prisoners of war. This was untrue. They visited a camp for Irish prisoners, who signified their intent of joining an [...] "Irish Guard". Ryan and Clissmann also visited a camp containing some men who intended setting up this Guard. Ryan had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> and the scheme came to nothing. Ryan regretted visiting the camp and told Stuart that the whole scheme disheartened him – he only had sympathy with men who were, like he and his comrades had been, in prison camps.|$|E
