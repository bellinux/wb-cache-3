Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists.

Macrobius says that Virgil's father was of a humble background; however, scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education. He attended schools in Cremona, Mediolanum, Rome and Naples. After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law, the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry.|$|E

In such cases, he anesthetizes them once he has informed them of his judgment. When victims awaken, they are naked and secured to a table with plastic wrap, and for stronger victims, duct tape. If he has not already done so, he confronts them with <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> of their crimes.

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, the {{prosecution}} is generally entitled to prove its case in the manner it sees fit. Jurors come to court expecting that evidence {{will be presented to}} them in narrative fashion, and {{there is a possibility that}} jurors may punish a party that does not meet this expectation. Even if jurors do not expressly punish the prosecution for the sin of making its case with stipulations, they may still be confused by a story that moves in fits and starts, with essential gaps filled in by stipulations instead of succinct storytelling. Yet, as far as the element of a prior conviction is concerned, a defendant's stipulation is just as conclusive as the underlying facts of the crime. The prosecution's need to prove its case via storytelling has no force when it comes to the fact of a prior conviction. In order to find this element of the felon-in-possession crime satisfied, all the jury needs to know is that the defendant has been convicted of a crime that qualifies him as a prohibited possessor, and this can just as easily be accomplished by stipulation as by narrative storytelling. Therefore, although the prosecution ordinarily may insist on proving its case via <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence,</b> Rule 403 allows the defendant to stipulate to prior convictions in order to avoid the unfair prejudice that would result from the prosecution introducing the facts of that prior crime into evidence during the later prosecution.|$|E

40|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>narratives</b> are cousins to human-impact stories. While {{everyone}} likes a good statistic, collecting meaningful, large-scale quantitative {{data in the}} settings where Microsoft grantees operate is often not cost-effective. Stories are a powerful alternative. They can illustrate a meaningful dynamic. They can convey emotion. They are memorable. They can be retold. They spread like good gossip. The problem is that most impact stories feature “poster children” that are so obviously exceptional {{that it is impossible}} for the story to represent typical beneficiaries. <b>Evidence</b> <b>narratives</b> attempt to harness the power of storytelling and apply an academically rigorous methodology so that stories are selected and analyzed for their typicality. The mantra of the <b>evidence</b> <b>narrative</b> is “from anecdote to evidence. ” Sometimes “remarkable” stories only describe an individual and don’t provide evidence of more general impact. Sometimes, however, “remarkable” stories become more impressive — the “poster child” really is representative of the larger population. TASCHA designed a methodology for developing evidence-based human impact stories (re-named “evidence narratives”), as well as a toolkit to guide organizations to produce their own narratives.

40|$|Although "evidence" {{is often}} used as an {{important}} argument in persuasive health campaigns, it remains unclear what type of evidence has the strongest impact on particular outcome variables. We conducted a meta-analysis in which the effects of statistical and <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> on beliefs, attitude, and intention were separately compared. Statistical evidence {{was found to have}} a stronger influence than <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> on beliefs and attitude, whereas <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> had a stronger influence on intention. We explain these findings in terms of the match between the specific characteristics of the two types of evidence and those of the outcome variables. Statistical evidence, beliefs, and attitude all relate primarily to cognitive responses, whereas both <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> and intention relate more specifically to affective responses. We conclude that communication professionals developing health campaigns should match the type of evidence to the main communication objectives...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In an {{experimental}} online study {{we compared the}} effects {{of different types of}} persuasive evidence in promoting the acceptance of a personal health risk. Design: 118 {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) at-risk for infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) were recruited via a range of websites and randomly assigned to one of 4 conditions (2 experimental and 2 control) : <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> (i. e., a personal account), statistical evidence (i. e., abstract prevalence data), mere assertion of increased risk, and no risk information. Main Outcome Measures: <b>Narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> was expected to more effective than statistical evidence in increasing MSM’s perceived risk of infection with HBV an intention to obtain vaccination. Results and Conclusion: As predicted, perceptions of personal risk and intention to obtain vaccination against HBV were highest after presentation of <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence,</b> and risk perception mediated the effect of type of message evidence on intention. We propose that <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> effectively promotes a sense of personal risk because it is less affected by defensive message processing resulting from the threat to important self-beliefs that seems inherent in health risk communication...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the relative impact of incorporating <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence,</b> statistical evidence or both into patient education about warfarin, a widely used oral anticoagulant medication. METHODS: 600 patients receiving anticoagulant therapy {{were randomly assigned}} to view one of three versions of a video depicting a physician-patient encounter where anticoagulation treatment was discussed, or usual care (no video). The videos differed in whether the physician used <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> (patient anecdotes), statistical evidence, or both to highlight key information. 317 patients completed both the baseline and post-test questionnaires. Questions assessed knowledge, beliefs and adherence to medication and laboratory monitoring regimens. RESULTS: All three approaches positively effected patients 2 ̆ 7 warfarin-related knowledge, and beliefs in the importance of lab testing; there was also some indication that viewing a video strengthened belief in the benefits of warfarin. There was some indication that <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> had a greater impact than statistical evidence on beliefs about the importance of lab testing and on knowledge. No other evidence of the differential effectiveness of either approach was found. No statistically significant effect was found on intent to adhere, or documented adherence to lab monitoring. CONCLUSION: Videos depicting a physician-patient dialogue about warfarin were effective in educating patients about anticoagulant medication, and had a positive impact on their beliefs. The use of <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> in the form of patient anecdotes may be more effective than statistical evidence for some patient outcomes. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients on oral anticoagulant therapy may benefit from periodic educational efforts reinforcing key medication safety information, even after initial education and ongoing monitoring. Incorporating patient anecdotes into physician-patient dialogues or educational materials may increase the effectiveness of the message...|$|E

40|$|Decisionmakers {{are often}} {{presented}} with explicit likelihood assessments (e. g., {{there is a}} 10 % chance that an attack will occur {{over the next three}} months) and supporting narra-tive evidence in forecasting and risk communication domains. Decisionmakers are thought to rely on both numerical and narrative information {{to the extent that they}} perceive the information to be diagnostic, accurate, and trustworthy. In two studies, we explored how lay decisionmakers varying in numeracy evaluated and used likelihood assessments and <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> in forecasts. Overall, the less numerate reported higher risk and likelihood percep-tions. In simple probabilistic forecasts without <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence,</b> decisionmakers at all levels of numeracy were able to use the stated likelihood information, although risk perceptions of the less numerate were more affected by likelihood format. When a forecast includes nar-rative evidence, decisionmakers were better able to use stated likelihood in a percentage as compared to frequency or verbal formats. The more numerate used stated likelihood more in their evaluations whereas the less numerate focused more on the <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence.</b> These results have important implications for risk analysts and forecasters who need to report the results of their analyses to decisionmakers. Decisionmakers varying in numerical ability may evaluate forecasts in different ways depending on the types of information they find easiest to evaluate...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{development}} programs in India are implemented {{for a variety}} of reasons. A key question is whether such transfer spending by the government is consequential for the local economic activity. This chapter estimates the multiplicative effects of rural transfer spending on state agricultural output using a novel dataset of statewise expenditure on all major rural {{development programs}} that were operational between 1980 - 2010. Using government reports as <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> we show that the principal motivation to introduce a new scheme is either (i) to replace old inefficient programs or (ii) to address a deep-rooted social or economic issue that has not been addressed by any existing program. Importantly, the introduction of a new scheme is largely independent of the current or prospective output fluctuations. Using this <b>narrative</b> <b>evidence</b> we isolate the �introductory variation� that occurs every time a new program is introduced as a measure of change in transfer spending that is exogenous to local output fluctuations. The results suggest that local variations in rural transfer spending can be quite consequential for the local economic activity in rural areas...|$|E

Most of the fighting occurred between youth who identify as ethnic – racial minorities, like Latinos, African-Americans, and Armenians.
