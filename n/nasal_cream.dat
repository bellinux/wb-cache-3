40|$|In {{the present}} {{clinical}} trial {{the efficacy of}} a new <b>nasal</b> <b>cream</b> containing hyaluronic acid (Rhinogen) on mucosal wound healing has been evaluated in comparison to an ointment (H. E. C.), which is commonly prescribed for this disorder in Switzerland. A total of 56 patients recovering from surgical operation of the nasal cavities participated in this study. In both treatment groups (Rhinogen n = 27 patients, H. E. C. n = 29 patients) respiration and {{the condition of the}} nasal mucosa clearly improved. The statistical comparison between the two treatments showed a significant difference in favor of Rhinogen. With regard to the improvement in respiration, the Rhinogen-treated group showed a faster and greater progress than did the H. E. C. -treated group. Furthermore, hyaluronic acid prevented extensive crust formation {{during the first week of}} wound healing. The analysis of the efficacy of the treatments, judged by both the patients and the investigator, showed the overall superiority of Rhinogen (patients: p = 0. 0041, investigator: p = 0. 0023) after 6 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, Rhinogen scored significantly better than H. E. C. with respect to the organoleptic parameters of smell and sensation of cooling. Both treatments were well tolerated. No adverse reactions were reported or observed for Rhinogen, whereas three patients in the H. E. C. -treated group complained of sore throat and burning sensation when the ointment flowed down into the pharynx. In conclusion, this study confirms the therapeutic benefit of hyaluronic acid in mucosal wound healing...|$|E
40|$|Aim. Study of structural-mechanical nasal semisolid dosage {{forms on}} {{emulsion}} bases providing with optimal release active substance was done. Methods and results. Established vinpocetine <b>nasal</b> <b>creams</b> rheologic properties showed them as thixotropic systems. Restoration after stress removal is cuased by their structure coagulation bonds. Their consistent properties are completely situated within rheologic optimum of consistence limits. Conclusion. Analysis of rheograms of flow allowed to reveal compositions of vinpocetine nasal emulsion ointments with optimal consistent properties and {{selected for the}} next preclinical investigations. ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{eyes with}} CSR undergo {{spontaneous}} resorption of subretinal fluid within 3-4 months, recovery of visual acuity usually follows. Any ongoing corticosteroid treatment should be tapered and stopped, where possible. It {{is important to}} check current medication, including <b>nasal</b> sprays and <b>creams,</b> for ingredients of corticosteroids, if found seek advice from a medical practitioner for an alternative.|$|R
50|$|Fluticasone {{is used by}} powder or aerosol {{inhalation}} for the prophylaxis of asthma, {{the nasal}} spray is used for prophylaxis and treatment of allergic rhinitis, nasal drops {{are used in the}} treatment of <b>nasal</b> polyps, and <b>creams</b> and ointments are applied topically in the treatment of various skin disorders. It can be given orally in the treatment of Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis. Some benefit was also reported in coeliac disease.|$|R
