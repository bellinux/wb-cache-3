50|$|Cheater {{recognition}} {{is closely related}} to the recognition of specific emotions. Bell et al. argue for the existence of an emotional incongruity effect. Memory is better for the face of a smiling cheater than of a smiling cooperator, because the incongruity captures the attention of the participant.

Negative emotions have a strong effect on source memory due to the presence of threatening stimuli.Memory is determined by the emotional reaction of people at the encoding stage for both trustworthy and cheaters' facial expressions.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that face perception is influenced by emotional contextual information. However, because facial expressions are routinely decoded and understood during social communication, sociality should also be considered—that is, it seems necessary to explore whether emotional contextual effects are influenced by the sociality of contextual information. Furthermore, although one behavioural study has explored the effects of context on selective attention to faces, the exact underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, the current study investigated how valence and sociality of contextual information influenced the early and later stages of neutral face processing. We first employed an established affective learning procedure, wherein neutral faces were paired with verbal information that differed in valence (negative, neutral) and sociality (social, non-social), to manipulate contextual information. Then, to explore the effects of context on face perception, participants performed a face perception task, while the N 170, early posterior negativity (EPN), and late positive potential (LPP) components were measured. Finally, to explore the effects of context on selective attention, participants performed a dot probe task while the N 2 pc was recorded. The results showed that, in the face perception task, faces paired with negative social information elicited greater EPN and LPP than did faces paired with neutral social information; no differences existed between faces paired with negative and <b>neutral</b> non-social <b>information.</b> In the dot probe task, faces paired with negative social information elicited a more negative N 2 pc amplitude (indicating attentional bias) than did faces paired with neutral social information; the N 2 pc did not differ between faces paired with negative and <b>neutral</b> non-social <b>information.</b> Together, these results suggest that contextual information influenced both face perception and selective attention, and these context effects were governed by the interaction between valence and sociality of contextual information...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{definitive}} difference in mood congruence and mood dependence. Lewis and Critchley discuss {{the difference in}} these memory effects. Mood congruence is when one can match an emotion to a specific memory. Mood dependence, on the other hand, is the sorting of memory when mood at retrieval {{is the same as}} encoding. After using others' research, Lewis and Critchley {{came to the conclusion that}} there is neural basis for the influence of mood at encoding and that this influence at the base relates to activity of emotion specific regions of the brain. One model they propose is the semantic-network approach, which suggests that 'emotion-specific memory nodes connect many related aspects of an emotion, such as autonomic responses, expressive behaviours, and description of situations that might evoke the emotion'. Within this model, two assumptions may be made: remembering certain information while in a specific mood leads to responsiveness in the emotional system that corresponds to that particular mood and mood at retrieval influences ones' emotions. This relates to mood-dependent memory because it may suggest that ones' mood at encoding could become associated with <b>neutral</b> <b>information.</b> It may also imply the activity of emotions, triggered by mood at retrieval, could propagate to the nodes with the same mood at encoding.|$|E
40|$|Using {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging, we examined whether {{individual differences in}} amygdala activation in response to negative relative to <b>neutral</b> <b>information</b> are related to differences in {{the speed with which}} such information is evaluated, the extent to which such differences are associated with medial prefrontal cortex function, and their relationship with measures of trait anxiety and psychological well-being (PWB). Results indicated that faster judgments of negative relative to <b>neutral</b> <b>information</b> were associated with increased left and right amygdala activation. In the prefrontal cortex, faster judgment time was associated with relative decreased activation in a cluster in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, BA 24). Furthermore, people who were slower to evaluate negative versus <b>neutral</b> <b>information</b> reported higher PWB. Importantly, higher PWB was strongly associated with increased activation in the ventral ACC for negative relative to <b>neutral</b> <b>information.</b> Individual differences in trait anxiety did not predict variation in judgment time or in amygdala or ventral ACC activity. These findings suggest that people high in PWB effectively recruit the ventral ACC when confronted with potentially aversive stimuli, manifest reduced activity in subcortical regions such as the amygdala, and appraise such information as less salient as reflected in slower evaluative speed...|$|E

We find that in the long run, neutral technological change is the main source of productivity growth in Germany. For Japan and the U.
