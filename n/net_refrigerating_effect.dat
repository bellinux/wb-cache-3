One such method {{is by the}} use of a chest freezer for the storage of frozen food. This investigation considers different loads and design parameters {{for the development of a}} chest freezer using R 134 a as the working fluid. Experimental designs of an evaporator coil, condenser coil and capillary tube are investigated through the development of storage periods in terms of steady state and cyclic performance, by optimising the quantity of refrigerant charge, with strict adherence to the standards and requirement for maintaining an internal temperature of - 23 °C at 43 °C ambient. Cyclic load performance tests optimise the performance of individual components selected for the design of a chest freezer. The system selection has a highly balanced performance with R 134 a and showed 118 kJ/kg cooling capacity with 8. 42 coefficient of performance (COP).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental {{analysis of the}} effect of condenser subcooling on the performance of vapor-compression systems. It is shown that, as condenser subcooling increases, the COP reaches a maximum {{as a result of a}} trade-off between increasing <b>refrigerating</b> <b>effect</b> and specific compression work. The thermodynamic properties associated with the relative increase in <b>refrigerating</b> <b>effect,</b> i. e. liquid specific heat and latent heat of vaporization, are dominant to determine the maximum COP improvement with condenser subcooling. Refrigerants with large latent heat of vaporization tend to benefit less from condenser subcooling. For a typical AC system, numerical results indicate that the R 1234 yf would benefit the most from condenser subcooling in comparison to R 410 A, R 134 a and R 717 due to its smaller latent heat of vaporization. On the other hand, the value of COP maximizing subcooling does not seem to be a strong function of thermodynamic properties. Experimental results comparing R 1234 yf and R 134 a confirmed the trends observed during the numerical study.
