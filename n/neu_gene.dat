40|$|The <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> encodes a 185, 000 -Da {{membrane}} glycoprotein that {{is highly}} homologous to epidermal growth factor receptor. It is frequently overexpressed or amplified in human breast carcinomas and ovarian cancers, which correlates with a poor prognosis for patients. The importance of <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> regulation is noted {{by the fact that}} many breast cancer cells overexpress the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> without proportional gene amplification. The mechanism for that is unclear. My initial finding of neu autoregulation led to a realization that defects in neu autoregulation pathway may contribute to neu overexpression in tumor cells. I have found in the nontransformed NIH 3 T 3 model system that (i) the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> product autorepresses its own promoter activity, (ii) the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> promoter contains a novel enhancer, (iii) neu autorepression is mediated through this enhancer by inhibition of the enhancer activity, and (iv) c-myc expression serves as an intermediate step downstream from the membrane bound neu-encoded receptor in this complicated feedback inhibition pathway. ^ In addition, a part of my research is studying the neu-encoded receptor molecule. I have generated a construct coding the neu ligand-binding domain and demonstrated that (i) the neu ligand-binding domain is a secretory peptide, (ii) it inhibits the normal neu-associated tyrosine kinase but not activated neu-associated tyrosine kinase. My study provided experimental evidence for the mechanisms of <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> activation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of my {{research}} involved the characterization of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> promoter. I subcloned a 2. 2 -kb sequence located upstream to the extreme 5 ' end of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene,</b> {{in front of the}} bacterial reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Transfection of this construct into different cell lines and subsequent CAT assays demonstrated that this 2. 2 -kb fragment was functional as a promoter. A series of deletion constructs was engineered to study the contribution of different fragments to transcription. Subcloning of individual fragments was followed by a cotransfection competition experiment, which demonstrated the involvement of protein factors interacting with the promoter. A gel retardation assay was also performed to show the physical binding of protein factors to the promoter. The combined results suggested that both positively and negatively acting protein factors are involved in interacting with different regions of the promoter, contributing to the overall transcription activity. My findings provide an insight into the regulation of <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> expression, which in turn provides the tools to understand the molecular mechanisms of overexpression of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> in some breast cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines. ^ In the second part of my research, I discovered that another oncogene, c-myc, was able to reverse the transformed morphology that was induced by the neu oncogene. Utilizing the promoter constructs that I made, I was able to show that the c-myc oncogene has a negative regulatory effect on the expression of the neu oncogene. Further studies suggested that c-myc is able to lower the effective concentration of a positive factor(s) that interact with a 139 -bp fragment of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> promoter. These findings may provide a direct evidence of the long suspected role of the c-myc gene in transcriptional regulation. The <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> may very well be the first identified mammalian target gene that is regulated by the c-myc oncogene. Since c-myc is known to be stimulated by various mitogenic signals and the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> {{is likely to be a}} growth factor receptor, it is possible that c-myc, when stimulated by the signal transduction pathway of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene,</b> would function as a negative feedback regulator on the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> receptor.

40|$|The neu {{oncogene}} encodes {{a growth}} factor receptor-like protein, p 185, with an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. A single point mutation, an A to T transversion {{resulting in an}} amino acid substitution from valine to glutamic acid, in the transmembrane domain of the rat <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> {{was found to be}} responsible for the transforming and tumorigenic phenotype of the cells that carry it. In contrast, the human proto-neu oncogene is frequently amplified in tumors and cell lines derived from tumors and the human <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> overexpression/amplification in breast and ovarian cancers is known to correlate with poor patient prognosis. Examples of the human <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> overexpression in the absence of gene amplification have been observed, which may suggest the significant role of the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional control of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> in the oncogenic process. However, {{little is known about the}} transcriptional mechanisms which regulate the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> expression. In this study, three examples are presented to demonstrate the positive and negative control of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> expression. ^ First, by using band shift assays and methylation interference analyses, I have identified a specific protein-binding sequence, AAGATAAAACC ($-$ 466 to $-$ 456), that binds a specific trans-acting factor termed RVF (for EcoRV factor on the neu promoter). The RVF-binding site is required for maximum transcriptional activity of the rat neu promoter. This same sequence is also found in the corresponding regions of both human and mouse neu promoters. Furthermore, this sequence can enhance the CAT activity driven by a minimum promoter of the thymidine kinase gene in an orientation-independent manner, and thus it behaves as an enhancer. In addition, Southwestern (DNA-protein) blot analysis using the RVF-binding site as a probe points to a 60 -kDa polypeptide as a potential candidate for RVF. ^ Second, it has been reported that the E 3 region of adenovirus 5 induces down-regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor through endocytosis. I found that the human <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> product, p 185, (an EGF receptor-related protein) is also down-regulated by adenovirus 5, but via a different mechanism. I demonstrate that the adenovirus E 1 a gene is responsible for the repression of the human <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> at the transcriptional level. ^ Third, a differential expression of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> has been found in two cell model systems: between the mouse fibroblast Swiss-Webster 3 T 3 (SW 3 T 3) and its variant NR- 6 cells; and between the mouse liver tumor cell line, Hep 1 -a, and the mouse pancreas tumor cell line, 266 - 6. Both NR- 6 and 266 - 6 cell lines are not able to express the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> product, p 185. I demonstrate that, in both cases, the transcriptional repression of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> may account for the lack of the p 185 expression in these two cell lines. ...|$|E

The activity of sialidase Neu 4 enzyme against sialic acid containing ganglioside GM 2 has been demonstrated. Biological role of sialidase Neu 4 enzyme has been shown by the transfection of neuroglia cells from a Tay-Sachs patient with a Neu 4 -expressing plasmid showed clearance of accumulated ganglioside GM 2. It has been also shown that sialidase Neu 4 enzyme is responsible for degradation reactions of another ganglioside such as GD 1 a in brains of Neu 4 -/- mice. Aim of our study is to identify minimal promoter region of human <b>Neu</b> 4 <b>gene</b> and demonstrate binding of transcription factors to this region. In our study, we used bioinformatic approaches to predict the sequence motifs where several specific transcription factors bind using TESS (Transcription Element Seach System) tool. We amplified seven different DNA fragments from human Neu 4 promoter region, cloned into luciferase expression vector and performed reporter assay. We also performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay to demonstrate binding of transcription factors to candidate promoter region. We demonstrated that 187 bp upstream of <b>Neu</b> 4 <b>gene</b> is minimal promoter region to control transcription from <b>Neu</b> 4 <b>gene.</b> Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that 187 bp upstream region recruits several transcription factors. Our results demonstrated the minimal promoter region revealing several putative transcription factors such as Sp- 1 and c-myc which might be responsible mainly for regulation of <b>Neu</b> 4 <b>gene</b> transcription. The data we obtained might be useful to discover small molecules which can control <b>Neu</b> 4 <b>gene</b> expression.

40|$|The <b>NEU</b> 1 <b>gene</b> is {{the first}} {{identified}} member of the human sialidases, glycohydrolitic enzymes that remove the terminal sialic acid from oligosaccharide chains. Mutations in <b>NEU</b> 1 <b>gene</b> are causative of sialidosis (MIM 256550), a severe lysosomal storage disorder showing autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Sialidosis has been classified into two subtypes: sialidosis type I, a normomorphic, late-onset form, and sialidosis type II, a more severe neonatal or early-onset form. A total of 50 causative mutations are reported in HGMD database, {{most of which are}} missense variants. To further characterize the <b>NEU</b> 1 <b>gene</b> and identify new functionally relevant protein isoforms, we decided to study its genetic variability in the human population using the data generated by two large sequencing projects: the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 G) and the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). Together these two datasets comprise a cohort of 7595 sequenced individuals, making it possible to identify rare variants and dissect population specific ones. By integrating this approach with biochemical and cellular studies, we were able to identify new rare missense and frameshift alleles in <b>NEU</b> 1 <b>gene.</b> Among the 9 candidate variants tested, only two resulted in significantly lower levels of sialidase activity (p C and c. 700 G>A. These two mutations give rise to the amino acid substitutions p. V 217 A and p. D 234 N, respectively. NEU 1 variants including either of these two amino acid changes have 44 % and 25 % residual sialidase activity when compared to the wild-type enzyme, reduced protein levels and altered subcellular localization. Thus they may represent new, putative pathological mutations resulting in sialidosis type I. The in silico approach used in this study has enabled the identification of previously unknown NEU 1 functional alleles that are widespread in the population and could be tested in future functional studies...|$|R
40|$|The rat <b>neu</b> <b>gene,</b> which encodes a receptor-like protein {{homologous}} to the epidermal {{growth factor}} receptor, is frequently activated by a point mutation altering a valine residue to a glutamic acid residue in its predicted transmembrane domain. Additional point mutations have been constructed in a normal neu cDNA at and around amino acid position 664, {{the site of the}} naturally arising mutation. A mutation which causes a substitution of a glutamine residue for the normal valine at residue 664 leads to full oncogenic activation of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene,</b> but five other substitutions do not. Substituted glutamic acid residues at amino acid positions 663 or 665 do not activate the <b>neu</b> <b>gene.</b> Thus only a few specific residues at amino acid residue 664 can activate the oncogenic potential of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene.</b> Deletion of sequences of the transforming <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> demonstrates that no more than 420 amino acids of the 1260 encoded by the gene are required for full transforming function. Mutagenesis of the transforming clone demonstrates a correlation between transforming activity and tyrosine kinase activity.

Two {{of the eight}} cell lines in our study (SKOV 3 and YAOVBIX 1) exhibited five- to ninefold neu DNA sequence amplification, accompanied by up to 200 -fold overexpression of transcripts and protein (p 185). Both of these cell lines expressed a major approximately 7. 5 kb neu-complementary transcript not previously reported in other neu-positive tumor cell lines. One pair of cell lines (YAOVBIX 1 and YAOVBIX 3), isolated from a single ovarian carcinoma patient's ascites sample differed dramatically in regard to level of <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> amplification and expression.

Amplification of the proto-neu gene in NIH 3 T 3 cells by means of cotransfection with a dihydrofolate reductase gene resulted in methotrexate-resistant colonies that produce high levels of normal neu-encoded p 185 protein.

40|$|Amplification/overexpression of {{the human}} neu {{protooncogene}} has been frequently found in human primary breast and ovarian cancers and is correlated {{with the number of}} axillary lymph nodes positive for metastasis in breast cancer patients. Identification of the factors controlling transcription of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> is essential for understanding the mechanisms of <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> regulation and its role in tumorigenicity. The adenovirus early region 1 A (E 1 A) gene products are pleiotropic transcription regulators of viral and cellular genes and have been identified as a viral suppressor gene for metastasis. Here we demonstrate that transcription of neu can be strongly repressed by the E 1 A gene products. The 13 S and 12 S products of E 1 A gene are effective at repressing neu transcription and the transcriptional repression requires the conserved region 2 of the E 1 A proteins. The target for E 1 A repression was localized within a 139 -base-pair DNA fragment in the upstream region of the neu promoter. In addition, competition experiments suggest that the sequence TGGAATG, within the 139 -base-pair fragment, is an important element for the E 1 A-induced repression.

Genetic mutations in any of this complex components results in their functional deficiency causing severe lysosomal storage disorders. Here we study the molecular defects underlying sialidosis (mutaions in sialidase; <b>gene</b> <b>NEU</b> 1) and galactosialidosis (mutations in cathepsin A; gene PPGB) in the Portuguese population. Methods: Using gDNA extracted from patient’s fibroblasts, we performed a molecular study of the PPGB and <b>NEU</b> 1 <b>genes</b> in the known Portuguese patients with galactosialidosis and sialidosis, respectively. The expression of both genes was determined by qRT-PCR. The effect of each mutation was also analysed at protein levels, through different in silico procedures. Results and Conclusions: On the PPGB gene, we identified two predictably deleterious missense mutations (c. 394 G>A -Zhou et al, 1996 - and c. 254 G>T) and two deletions (c. 228 - 229 DelC and c. 1075 - 1076 DelT), both of them giving origin to transcripts {{that lead to the}} synthesis of truncated non-functional proteins. On the <b>NEU</b> 1 <b>gene,</b> we found two novel missense mutations associated to a severe form of the disease (c. 700 G>A and c. 599 C>T), which, at protein levels, lead to the substitution of two aminoacids localized in a surface region of the molecule, already proposed {{to be involved in the}} interface of sialidase binding with cathepsin A (Lukong, 2000).

To facilitate analysis of capsule synthesis and translocation, an E. coli K 1 strain with mutations in nanA and neuB, affecting sialic acid degradation and synthesis, respectively, was constructed by transduction. The acapsular phenotype of the mutant was corrected in vivo by exogenous addition of sialic acid. By blocking sialic acid degradation, the nanA mutation allows intracellular metabolite accumulation, while the neuB mutation prevents dilution by the endogenous sialic acid pool and allows capsule synthesis {{to be controlled}} experimentally by the exogenous addition of sialic acid to the growth medium. Complementation was detected by bacteriophage K 1 F adsorption or infectivity assays. Polysialic acid translocation was observed within 2 min after addition of sialic acid to the growth medium, demonstrating the rapidity in vivo of sialic acid transport, activation, and polymerization and translocation of polysaccharide to the cell surface.

The possibility of cooperation between the c-myc and the normal rat neu (c-neu) genes in transforming cells was examined. Surprisingly, the expression of c-myc in B 104 - 1 - 1 cells, and activated rat neu oncogene (neu*) -transformed NIH 3 T 3 line, resulted in morphologic reversion. This reversion was found to be a consequence of a transcription-repressive action of c-myc on the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> via a 140 -bp fragment on the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> promoter. The effective concentration of a positive factor(s) interacting with this fragment seemed to be lowered by the expression of c-myc. Our findings lend support to arguments concerning the long-suspected function of c-myc as a transcriptional modulator. They also imply that an oncogene such as c-myc, or possibly the rapidly explored class that encodes transcription factors, under certain conditions may act to reverse a transformed phenotype that is induced by another oncogene instead of contributing positively towards the transformation process.

This preferential phosphorylation has the properties that would be expected of p 185 autophosphorylation: it takes place on tyrosine and requires intact p 185 kinase activity. The normal p 185 protein does not demonstrate increased phosphorylation even when it coexists in a transformed cell with the transforming p 185 protein. These data show that transforming p 185 is specifically associated with an active tyrosine kinase activity and suggest that this activity is intrinsic to the transforming protein.

A series of promoter deletion constructs was made, and results from transfection and subsequent chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays suggested the presence of multiple cis-acting elements that contributed either positively or negatively to the transcription activity. Cotransfection competition experiments using subcloned cis-acting elements confirmed the existence of trans-acting factors interacting with these DNA fragments. In addition, a gel retardation assay was performed to demonstrate the physical binding of nuclear factors to certain fragments.

40|$|The neu {{oncogene}} (also {{referred to}} as c-erbB- 2 and HER 2) encodes a 185 -kDa transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity termed p 185. The p 185 glycoprotein is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. It is thought that p 185 is the receptor for an as yet unidentified growth factor. In the present study, RNA blot analyses and immunohistochemical studies were performed on rat tissues obtained {{from a variety of}} prenatal and postnatal stages to examine the expression of the neu oncogene and its product, p 185, during normal development. Expression of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> was detected in mid-gestation embryos in a variety of tissues including nervous system, connective tissue, and secretory epithelium, but not in lymphoid tissue. In adult animals, secretory epithelial tissues and basal cells of the skin expressed neu. These studies demonstrate that the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> is expressed in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. We suggest that the p 185 molecule {{plays an important role in}} the growth and development of a variety of tissues, and, in particular, in epithelial tissue...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{transfection}} experiments {{using the}} NIH 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast cell line {{have demonstrated that}} chemically induced tumors and chemically transformed cell lines frequently contain dominant transforming genes. Although many of the genes detected using the NIH 3 T 3 transfection-transformation assay are activated versions of H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras, in some experimental systems activated forms of genes such as met and neu that are unrelated to ras have been observed. The activated met gene was originally detected in a human cell line that had been transformed by exposure to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the met proto-oncogene encodes a novel growth factor receptor and that gene activation involves {{the production of a}} chimeric gene in which the regions of met encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the receptor are replaced by the 5 '-region of an unrelated gene called trp. The activated <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> was detected in tumors of the nervous system that arose in mice following transplacental exposure to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. The <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> also encodes a novel growth factor receptor but, in contrast to met, its activation involves a single T:A- * A:T point mutation in the region of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> encoding the receptor transmembrane domain. The presence of genetic alterations in chemically induced malignancies has also been assessed in cytogenetic studies and by Southern analysis of DNA from neoplastic cells. These studies have demonstrated the presence of altered versions the c-myc and mos genes in plasmocytomas induced in mice following exposure to pristane or mineral oil and of activated pim- 1 and c-myc genes in thymomas that arise in AKR mice following treatment with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Analyses of the mechanisms of activation of these non-ras genes has provided important insights into the different ways in which genes may become activated following chemical exposure...|$|E
40|$|The <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> (also c-erbB- 2 or HER 2) encodes a 185 kilodalton {{protein that}} is {{frequently}} overexpressed in breast, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers. Study of {{the regulation of}} neu indicates that <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> expression can be modulated by c-myc or by the adenovirus 5 E 1 a gene product. This study demonstrates that the transforming protein, large T antigen, of the simian virus 40 represses neu promoter activity. Repression of neu by large T antigen is mediated through the region $-$ 172 to $-$ 79 (relative to first ATG) of the neu promoter [...] unlike through $-$ 312 to $-$ 172 for c-myc or E 1 a. This suggests a different pathway for repression of neu by large T antigen. The 10 amino acid region of large T required for binding the tumor suppressor, retinoblastoma gene product, Rb, is not necessary for repression of neu. Moreover, the tumor suppressors, Rb and p 53 can independently inhibit neu promoter activity. Rb inhibits neu through a 10 base pair G-rich enhancer (GTG element) ($-$ 243 to $-$ 234) and also through regions close to transcription initiation sites ($-$ 172 to $-$ 79). Mutant Rb unable to complex large T is able to repress the region close to transcription initiation but not the GTG enhancer. Thus, Rb inhibits the two regulatory domains of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> by different mechanisms. Both Rb and p 53 can repress the transforming activity of activated neu in focus forming assays. These data provide evidence that tumor suppressors regulate expression of growth stimulatory genes such as neu. Therefore, {{one reason for the}} overexpression of neu that is frequently seen in breast cancer cells may be due to functional inactivation of Rb and p 53 which is also a common occurrence in breast cancer cells. ...|$|E
40|$|MATERIALS AND METHODS The erbK- 2 (or III K- 2 or <b>neu</b> i <b>gene</b> is amplified and overexpressed in {{approximately}} one-third of cancers of the breast, stomach, and ovary. Evidence is accumulating that erbK- 2 overexpression {{is associated with}} decreased survival of breast cancer patients. In an effort to understand how erbÃŸ- 2 overexpression might impart a more malignant potential to breast cancer cells, we have searched for evidence of changes in gene expression associated with erbÃŸ- 2 overexpression. Using differential screening of a complementary DNA library we identified several comple mentary DNAs that represent mRNAs the expression of which may vary according to erbÃŸ- 2 level. One complementary DNA was studied in detail. The mRNA encoding the ribosomal protein I.

The level of IA 9 mRNA expression varied over a 1 - to 64 -fold range among the tumor samples. No evidence of gene amplification for I. I') was identified.

40|$|Amplification and {{overexpression}} of the neu (c-erbB 2) proto-oncogene {{has been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of 20 to 30 % of human breast cancers. Although the activation of Neu receptor tyrosine kinase {{appears to be a}} pivotal step during mammary tumorigenesis, the mechanism by which Neu signals cell proliferation is unclear. Molecules bearing a domain shared by the c-Src proto-oncogene (Src homology 2) are thought to be involved in signal transduction from activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as Neu. To test whether c-Src was implicated in Neu-mediated signal transduction, we measured the activity of the c-Src tyrosine kinase in tissue extracts from either mammary tumors or adjacent mammary epithelium derived from transgenic mice expressing a mouse mammary tumor virus promoter/enhancer/unactivated <b>neu</b> fusion <b>gene.</b> The Neu-induced mammary tumors possessed six- to eightfold-higher c-Src kinase activity than the adjacent epithelium. The increase in c-Src tyrosine kinase activity was not due to an increase in the levels of c-Src but rather was a result of the elevation of its specific activity. Moreover, activation of c-Src was correlated with its ability to complex tyrosine-phosphorylated Neu both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these observations suggest that activation of the c-Src tyrosine kinase during mammary tumorigenesis may occur through a direct interaction with activated Neu...|$|R
40|$|Sialic acids are acidic monosaccharides {{that bind}} to the sugar chains of glycoconjugates and change their conformation, intermolecular interactions, and/or half-life. Thus, sialidases are {{believed}} to modulate the function of sialoglycoconjugates by desialylation. We previously reported that the membrane-associated mammalian sialidase NEU 3, which preferentially acts on gangliosides, is involved in cell differentiation, motility, and tumorigenesis. The <b>NEU</b> 3 <b>gene</b> expression is aberrantly elevated in several human cancers, including colon, renal, prostate, and ovarian cancers. The small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of NEU 3 in cancer cell lines, but not in normal cell-derived primary cultures, downregulates EGFR signaling and induces apoptosis. Here, to investigate the physiological role of NEU 3 in tumorigenesis, we established Neu 3 -deficient mice and then subjected them to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis, using a sporadic and a colitis-associated colon cancer models. The Neu 3 -deficient mice showed no conspicuous accumulation of gangliosides in the brain or colon mucosa, or overt abnormalities in their growth, development, behavior, or fertility. In dimethylhydrazine-induced colon carcinogenesis, {{there were no differences}} in the incidence or growth of tumors between the Neu 3 -deficient and wild-type mice. On the other hand, the Neu 3 -deficient mice were less susceptible than wild-type mice to the colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate.

40|$|Correlation between neu/c-erbB- 2 /Her- 2 gene {{amplification}} and overexpression of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> product {{has been reported}} in tumors of glandular origin, especially ductal breast carcinomas. Formalin-fixed and dewaxed sections from 23 cases of mammary (MPD) and 9 cases of extramammary (EPD) Paget's disease were immunohistochemically stained by means of the monoclonal antibody 3 B 5 directed against an intracellular domain of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> protein. All MPDs exhibited a distinct membrane staining of tumor cells independent of the presence of ductal breast carcinomas found in 18 cases. All these breast carcinomas also were positive for neu staining. In contrast to MPD, all EPDs were negative. Normal epidermis was always negative. Northern blot analysis sustained the immunohistologic findings in that the presence of neu mRNA could be demonstrated in two of three cases with MPD. Negativity in one case was due to dilution effects by nontumor cells. Our results suggest that Paget cells of mammary and extramammary localization, although very similar phenotypically, derive from different genetic accidents. Furthermore neu positivity in all MPDs and all underlying ductal carcinomas suggests common genetic alterations for both tumors. However the finding of five neu protein-positive MPDs without associated ductal breast carcinomas may suggest a somewhat different transformation process...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: ErbB- 2 is a {{critical}} oncogenic marker in human breast cancer. Its appearance correlates with poor prognosis and it is, therefore, an important target for physiologic investigation and therapeutic intervention. With this in mind, we have created and characterized two mouse breast cancer models that express rat wild type neu, the homologue of ErbB- 2, and rat mutant neu {{under the control of}} the normal mouse neu promoter. These models in which the copy number of the <b>neu</b> <b>gene</b> is moderately amplified should more closely parallel the expression pattern of ErbB- 2 seen in some cases of human breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transgenic mouse models were constructed by injecting one of the two pronuclei of a fertilized FVB/n egg and implanting it into a pseudopregnant Swiss /Webster mouse. Tissue expression was analyzed through the use of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and mammary histopathology examined by fixing, staining and mounting of the entire gland. RESULTS: In the former wild type model, we show that low level, long term expression of neu leads to abnormal lobuloalveolar development in virginal glands and incomplete regression in multiparous glands. Malignant foci form following multiple rounds of pregnancy and regression. In the latter model, a similarly directed transgene carrying the constitutively activated, mutant form of the rat <b>neu</b> <b>gene,</b> a stronger but similar phenotype is displayed. CONCLUSION: Evidently minor perturbations in amplified neu expression are sufficient to alter mammary development and induce malignant transformation...|$|E

40|$|Several studies {{performed}} {{over the}} last decade have focused on the role of sialylation in the progression of cancer and, in particular, on the association between deregulation of sialidases and tumorigenic transformation. The plasma membrane-associated sialidase NEU 3 is often deregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC), and it was shown that this enzyme co-immunoprecipitates in HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the molecular target of most recent monoclonal antibody-based therapies against CRC. To investigate the role of NEU 3 sialidase on EGFR deregulation in CRC, we first collected data on <b>NEU</b> 3 <b>gene</b> expression levels from a library of commercial colon cell lines, demonstrating that NEU 3 transcription is upregulated in these cell lines. We also found EGFR to be hyperphosphorylated in all cell lines, with the exception of SW 620 cells and the CCD 841 normal intestinal cell line. By comparing the effects induced by overexpression of either the wild-type or the inactive mutant form of NEU 3 on EGFR, we demonstrated that the active form of NEU 3 enhanced receptor activation without affecting EGFR mRNA or protein expression. Moreover, through western blots and mass spectrometry analysis, we found that EGFR immunoprecipitated from cells overexpressing active NEU 3, unlike the receptor from mock cells and cells overexpressing inactive NEU 3, is desialylated. On the whole, our data demonstrate that, besides the already reported indirect EGFR activation through GM 3, sialidase NEU 3 could also play a role on EGFR activation through its desialylation...|$|R
