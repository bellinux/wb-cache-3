5|$|Juveniles {{have lower}} {{foraging}} efficiency compared to adults {{and in most}} feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend {{to stay close to}} one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group. During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim—either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young—and extract the ball of food. This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them. This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. The explanation of the species' sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.|$|E

He is stopped {{at the last second}} by Homer, who decides to jump the gorge himself to show Bart {{what it is like to}} see a family member needlessly risk their life for no good reason. Bart, not wanting to see his father killed on his account, {{promises}} to never jump the gorge and <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be a daredevil again.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the success}} of [...] "Day 'n' Nite", the rapper had {{said that he would}} <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> mix {{politics}} or jocular things in with his lyrical content. After realizing the power of his voice he then decided to make important and unique songs, focusing on the message, rather than just creating inane music. He said his mode of operation at that time [...] "was just, 'Hey, I'm making these cool sounding songs and I have little messages in them'", but still had himself in it. Although Cudi had a message in every track, he chose to avoid using dense lyrics, explaining {{that he did not want}} to write material that he would not actually say or use in real life, adding that being true to yourself entirely was meaningful to him. [...] "I don't speak like a fucking nerdy guy; I speak like a regular dude", he remarked.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music of}} Isis is not {{suitable}} for mainstream release or commercial radio playtime due to extensive song length and niche appeal; as guitarist Michael Gallagher states, [...] "we've <b>never</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> be on the radio, and we've <b>never</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> please others. We've simply done whatever we've wanted to do, and we've all decided {{to be happy with}} the results." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Taboo" [...] is an R {{song that}} borrows {{influences}} from numerous genres including hip-hop, Japanese pop, and dance-pop. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express noted elements of 80s pop and disco music. Koda's vocals are heavily processed through vocoder pyrotechnics, and are delivered during the chorus {{and parts of}} the bridge section. The lyrics to [...] "Taboo" [...] emphasize the term with the same name, discussing taboo nature and exploring it. Regarding homosexuality, Koda commented to Oricon; [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] In terms of musical depth and lyrical diversity, Koda found that [...] "Taboo" [...] was one of her most [...] "widen" [...] tracks throughout her entire music career.|$|E
500|$|For Storaro, {{the limited}} color palette {{was the most}} {{challenging}} aspect of production. [...] "These are {{not the kind of}} colors the audience is used to seeing," [...] he noted. [...] "These are much more dramatic in strength, in saturation. Comic strip art is usually done with very simple and primitive ideas and emotions," [...] Storaro theorized. [...] "One of the elements is that the story is usually told in vignette, so what we tried to do is never move the camera at all. <b>Never.</b> <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> make everything work into the frame." [...] For the matte paintings, Ellenshaw and Lloyd executed over 57 paintings on glass, which were then optically combined with the live action. For a brief sequence in which The Kid dashes in front of a speeding locomotive, only [...] of real track was laid; the train itself was a [...] scale model, and the surrounding train yard a matte painting.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Arwadi in {{particular}} has expressed his belief in Christianity {{that is not a}} religion, but more about faith, as in his opinion most religions are about laws, organizations, rites, and dogmas. In one interview, Jeff clarified that for him personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, {{does not have to be}} associated with religion whatsoever. When asked to clear up the [...] "confusion" [...] surrounding the band's stance regarding God, Christianity, and religions in general, Jeff responded that his views about religion are [...] "very different than the view in western countries," [...] and further said that [...] "in Indonesia, religion is not an issue of faith nor tradition. It's more the constitutional issue, that means the legal and political ones. I am not anti-religion person, but I do against religion in a political and legal context" [...] and then Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: [...] "...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists. We hate being trendy and we <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be the same with the rest of the scene. People can love us or hate us, I don't care." ...|$|E

500|$|Koda {{has even}} {{explored}} {{the themes of}} sexuality and taboos in her lyrics. While listening {{to the music of}} [...] "But", the first thing that came to Koda's mind was homosexuality. Regarding the theme of homosexuality, Koda said in an interview: [...] "I'm {{the type of person who}} thinks that [...] it doesn't matter what sex the other person is. No matter who they are, it doesn't change the 'I love this person' feeling, does it?" [...] The video for [...] "Taboo" [...] portrayed homosexuality and other [...] "taboo" [...] subjects to deliver Koda's message of [...] "there really is no such thing as a taboo". [...] She also said of [...] "Taboo"'s themes, [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] Such themes are also present in her music videos: she has incorporated her [...] "sexy" [...] image into her videos since [...] "Crazy 4 U" [...] through sexually charged dances and skin-baring outfits. The video of [...] "Ima Sugu Hoshii" [...] featured two males in sexual positions, and the video of [...] "Juicy", which also featured sexual posturing, was censored in Taiwan.|$|E

2500|$|Later in 1822, a 30-year-old Rossini {{succeeded in}} meeting Ludwig van Beethoven, {{who was then}} aged 51, deaf, cantankerous and in failing health.

2500|$|On several {{occasions}} 99p Stores has been criticised for its handling of {{situations in which}} smaller, independent retailers face threat of closure following the opening of branches of 99p Stores. In January 2009, an independent pound shop in Poole, Dorset was forced to close after a branch of 99p Stores opened directly opposite, offering a similar range of items and undercutting their competitor by a penny, causing the pound shop's turnover to drop by 70percent. Commercial director Nadir Lalani claimed that [...] "we <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> directly affect anyone but it's all healthy competition".|$|E
2500|$|The {{pharmacological}} treatment of barbiturate withdrawal is an extended process often consisting of converting {{the patient to}} a long acting benzodiazepine (i.e. Valium), followed by slowly tapering off the benzodiazepine. Mental cravings for barbiturates can last for months or years in some cases and counselling/support groups are highly encouraged by addiction specialists. Patients should <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> tackle the task of discontinuing barbiturates without consulting a doctor due to the high lethality and relatively sudden onset of the withdrawal, attempting to quit [...] "cold turkey" [...] may result in serious neurological damage, severe physical injuries received during convulsions, and even death via glutamatergic excitotoxicity.|$|E
2500|$|To these {{concrete}} five {{might be}} added a vaguer sixth, {{having to do}} with maintaining a chemical purity in the reaction between product and appraiser. Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in any ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind. Never, <b>never...</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> put the author [...] "in his place," [...] making of him a pawn in a contest with other reviewers. Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, and all our discriminations should curve toward that end.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2014, Mick {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) as Mick is attempting to overcome his fear of water and learn to swim. It was reported that this would [...] "help a grieving Ian {{just as much as}} Mick." [...] It was then reported that Mick would be arrested when he helps Ian track down Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks), a prostitute that Ian had sex with on the night his daughter Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was murdered. A show source said, [...] "Mick has no idea what he's getting into when he agrees to help Ian. We all know that Mick is one of the good guys and would <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> pick up a prostitute. He'll be praying that Linda trusts him enough to believe he's innocent." [...] The episodes where Mick takes part in a charity swim and is arrested for kerb-crawling were originally broadcast from 4 to 8 August 2014. A promotional trailer for the episodes was released on 30 July.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they have}} {{received}} some acclaim in places, DeLillo's post-Underworld novels have been often viewed by critics as [...] "disappointing and slight, especially when held up against his earlier, big-canvas epics", marking a shift [...] "...away from sweeping, era-defining novels such as [...] "White Noise," [...] "Libra" [...] and [...] "Underworld" [...] to a more [...] "spare and oblique" [...] style, characterized by [...] " [...] decreased length, the decommissioning of plot machinery and the steep deceleration of narrative time". DeLillo has commented on this shift to shorter novels, saying [...] ""If a longer novel announces itself, I’ll write it. A novel creates its own structure and develops its own terms. I tend to follow. And I <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stretch what I sense is a compact book." [...] In a March 2010 interview, {{it was reported that}} DeLillo's deliberate stylistic shift had been informed by his having recently re-read several slim but seminal European novels, including Albert Camus's The Stranger, Peter Handke's The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, and Max Frisch's Man in the Holocene.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his having}} {{personally}} described {{his work as}} [...] "Gonzo", it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as {{a participant in the}} events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in Playboy addressed the issue himself, saying [...] "Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't {{think of myself as a}} reporter." [...] Tom Wolfe would later describe Thompson's style as [...] "...part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric." [...] Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, [...] "While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robin Hood disguises {{himself as}} a friar in the forest and {{encounters}} two [...] "lusty" [...] priests on horseback (4.4). He begs the priests for a silver groat, saying he hasn't {{been able to get}} anything to eat or drink all day. The priests explain that they have no money because they have been robbed that morning. Robin tells them he thinks they're lying, and at that they speed away on their horses, but Robin soon catches up with them. He pulls them off of their horses, whereupon the priests fall on their knees and promise to pray for money. After they've prayed for an hour, Robin says they will all search themselves for the money heaven has given them. The priests pretend to search themselves and still find no money, but when Robin searches them he finds five hundred pieces of gold, which he lays out on the ground. He gives them each fifty pounds for praying so earnestly and keeps the rest for himself. Relieved to get away physically unharmed, the priests rise from their knees to go, but Robin commands them to stay until they have taken three oaths by the forest's [...] "holy grass": that they never again will lie, that they will <b>never</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> persuade maidens to sin or lie with other men's wives, and that they will be charitable to the poor (21.3). The priests go on their way and Robin returns to the forest.|$|E
