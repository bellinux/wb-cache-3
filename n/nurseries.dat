5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal <b>nurseries</b> that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known <b>nurseries</b> include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E

5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} {{protective}} {{of their young}} and may keep others at a distance.

Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

The study method involved content analysis of reports of 51 students who were trained in <b>nursery</b> school practice. The students learned from <b>nursery</b> teachers about the support necessary for children s growth and development and they learned about relationships and communication with a group of children. After receiving training from the <b>nursery</b> teachers, the students changed the way they interacted with children. There were {{only a small number of}} <b>nursery</b> teachers'reports on the direct training of students, and there was no report on nursing employment in the <b>nursery</b> school. This study enabled the review of goals in <b>nursery</b> school practice and made evident what needed to be improved in past training. Further study is necessary to examine the effect of <b>nursery</b> school practice on students' understanding of roles of other professionals in their future nursing practice. 本研究の目的は、保育所実習で学生が現場の保育士から学ぶ点を明らかにし、今後の保育所実習の改善点や、学生指導体制における保育士との連携を検討することである。研究方法は、保育所実習を実施した学生 51 名の報告書を内容分析の手法を用いて分析した。その結果、学生は保育士から子どもの成長発達に必要な援助や子ども集団との関係およびコミュニケーションを学習していたことが明らかとなった。また、保育士の指導から子どもとの関わり方を変化させていたが、保育士の学生への直接指導の報告は少なく、保育所看護職についての報告はゼロであった。さらに、保育所実習の目標の見直しや事前学習の改善点が見出せた。今後は、保育所実習を経験したことが将来の看護実践において、他職種の役割理解にどう影響するか検討する必要がある...|$|R

Children's folk-lore plays (widely used in child education) have an instructive value for the emotional and intellectual development of a child. <b>Nursery</b> active-wear uniform designs applied to children's folklore's plays could be positive for the emotional devel-opment and specialized cultural education of children. We designed three <b>nursery</b> active-wear uniforms with three dif-ferent design concepts (casual, semi-formal and sporty) regardless of sex. The main color of the three <b>nursery</b> active-wear uniforms was yellow. We used three different chroma and values of yellow through three design concepts: Design I of a <b>nursery</b> active-wear uniform (a training suit style with a good activity), Design II of a <b>nursery</b> active-wear uniform (a semi suit style), and Design III of a <b>nursery</b> active-wear uniform (a sportswear style that reflected a sport wear trend).
