5|$|In {{addition}} to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in Albania and Serbia respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia. They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows, but typically are <b>not</b> <b>so</b> referred to by non-partisan scholars.|$|E
5|$|Over-hunting {{also caused}} a severe {{population}} bottleneck {{in the northern}} elephant seal in the 19th century. Their resulting decline in genetic variation can be deduced by comparing it {{to that of the}} southern elephant seal, which were <b>not</b> <b>so</b> aggressively hunted.|$|E
60|$|SOAMES. I {{admit that}} I should {{probably}} <b>not</b> do <b>so.</b> I should perhaps be wrong not {{to steal the}} turnip: I cant defend my reluctance to do so; but I think I should <b>not</b> do <b>so.</b> I know I should <b>not</b> do <b>so.</b>|$|R
60|$|It is sad {{to think}} that in human affairs this {{condition}} is not unfrequently the precursor of misfortune. It is <b>not</b> necessarily <b>so.</b> Happily, it is <b>not</b> always <b>so.</b> Indeed, we would fain hope that it is <b>not</b> often <b>so,</b> {{but it was so}} on this occasion.|$|R

5|$|Abbreviations {{are rarely}} {{used in the}} codex. The {{handwriting}} {{is very close to}} that of the Rossano Gospels. The errors of itacism occur, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> often as in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. It uses grammatical forms typical of the ancient manuscripts (e.g. ειπαν, ηλθαν, ευραν), which are not used in later medieval manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{important}} to the local economy with spending generating over £53,000,000 GVA, Christchurch is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> heavily dependent on tourism as some of its neighbours. Tourism's contribution to the local economy is about 9% compared to 18% for Weymouth and Portland, 15% for Purbeck and 12% for Bournemouth. Visitor accommodation consists of 11 caravan and camping parks and some 900 bed spaces in eight hotels and 75 guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Leon, [...] "do <b>not</b> say <b>so.</b> <b>Not</b> that. A {{man with}} such a nature as yours should <b>not</b> derogate <b>so</b> far. What are a few privations here and there, {{so long as you}} are working for a high and noble goal?" ...|$|R

5|$|As Part III progresses, the {{narrative}} switches to describing their upper-class {{life on the}} island, and filling details of the lifestyle the family was born into. The story of the voodoo practicing Haitian family maid is elucidated: she escaped Trujillo's massacre of Haitians and came to work for Laura, although much of her family was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> lucky.|$|E
5|$|Based on the 2005 British film Kinky Boots, {{written by}} Geoff Deane and Tim Firth and {{inspired}} by true events, the musical {{tells the story}} of Charlie Price. Having inherited a shoe factory from his father, Charlie forms an unlikely partnership with cabaret performer and drag queen Lola to produce a line of high-heeled boots and save the business. In the process, Charlie and Lola discover that they are <b>not</b> <b>so</b> different after all.|$|E
5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy {{has been}} so heavily modified for flight, and immediate transitional fossil predecessors have <b>not</b> <b>so</b> far been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been advanced, including links to the avemetatarsalian-like Scleromochlus, an ancestry among the basal archosauriforms, like Euparkeria, or among the protorosaurs.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I wish {{your eyes}} were <b>not</b> quite <b>so</b> large and <b>not</b> quite <b>so</b> bright,’ said the Minor Canon, slowly {{releasing}} the hand {{he had taken}} in his.|$|R

40|$|This species {{occupies}} only 600 km 2, {{but there}} is a stable population of about 12, 000 mature individuals (<b>so</b> <b>not</b> Vulnerable: C), nor is the population either severely fragmented (<b>so</b> <b>not</b> B) or restricted to a single location (<b>so</b> <b>not</b> C 2 b). Nor can it be listed as Near Threatened, as neither range nor density has declined by over 50 % (<b>so</b> <b>not</b> a or c), and the population is more than 3, 000 (<b>so</b> <b>not</b> d) ...|$|R
5|$|His story complete, Tom awakens to find Anne by his side. She {{tells him}} she knew he’d return for his sons. He tells {{her that he}} came back for her too. Tom then reunites with his {{children}} before greeting fellow members of the 2nd Mass. They appear happy to see him. Pope (Colin Cunningham), however, appears <b>not</b> <b>so</b> happy to see Tom. He tells Weaver about his suspicions.|$|E
5|$|In conclusion, {{the insistence}} of ahimsa is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much about non-injury to others {{as it is about}} non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{returned}} to Australia {{and participated in}} the 1953–54 season, which was purely domestic. He continued his recent strong form against Queensland in the first match, taking 4/56 and 5/61 {{to set up a}} 254-run win. However, {{the rest of the season}} was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> productive; Johnston managed only 20 more wickets in the remaining seven matches at an average of almost 50. He ended the season with 29 wickets at 38.24.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, Amy! {{you don't}} know. You must <b>not</b> think <b>so</b> much better of me than I deserve. It is not only--No, I would <b>not</b> be <b>so</b> selfish, if but--but--' Never had her self-command so given way.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘We-e-ell!’ {{said the}} Dean, {{in a more}} {{confidential}} tone, and slightly glancing around him, ‘I would <b>not</b> say <b>so,</b> generally. <b>Not</b> generally. Enough of suspicion attaches to him to—no, I think I would <b>not</b> say <b>so,</b> generally.’ ...|$|R
5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much for buying things, but {{to interact with the}} people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E
5|$|Mrs Rix Nicholas is very {{gifted and}} {{she has her own}} {{individuality}} as an artist; but her personal outlook is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much that of an artist with startling things to say... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{bombardment}} began, the German 916th Grenadiers reported their positions {{to be under}} particularly heavy fire, with the position at WN-60 very badly hit. Although the Rangers at Pointe-du-Hoc were greatly assisted in their assault of the cliffs by the Satterlee and Talybont, elsewhere the air and naval bombardment was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> effective, and the German beach defenses and supporting artillery remained largely intact.|$|E
6000|$|... "But yes, Sir 'Oo. The lady, your wife, is {{the sister}} to Lady Ongar. Is <b>not</b> that <b>so?</b> Lady Ongar did {{live with you}} before she was married. Is <b>not</b> that <b>so?</b> Your brother and your cousin both wishes to marry her and have all the money. Is <b>not</b> that <b>so?</b> Your brother has come to me to help him, and has sent the little man out of Warwickshire. Is not that so?" ...|$|R

5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> subtle. From {{the outset of}} his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|That man's a great director. He {{can make}} people feel {{perfectly}} natural. He's got what Chaplin did when he directed A Woman of Paris—he and Lewis Milestone and Mal St. Clair all have that same touch, they all belong to the new school of directors, it seems to me. They're <b>not</b> <b>so</b> busy thinking about technique that they have actors turning into marionettes.|$|E
5|$|The German {{national}} team was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> fortunate, losing {{the final of}} the European Championship to the Netherlands before a home town crowd in Frankfurt. It claimed silver at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, Canada, and beat the Netherlands in the 2015 European Championships, to claim its tenth European title. At the 2016 Paralympic Games, it won silver after losing the final to the United States.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's what we {{want you}} to find out over there,' said Sir John, who was <b>not</b> quite <b>so</b> zealous, perhaps <b>not</b> quite <b>so</b> conscientious, as his more humble assistant,--whose mind was more {{occupied}} with other matters. 'You'll find out all that at Sydney.' ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} whether that has a {{sinister}} meaning or <b>not,</b> and <b>so</b> I will <b>not</b> enlarge upon it lest I should chance to be in the wrong. It sounds like ship-money come again, but it may <b>not</b> be <b>so</b> intended.|$|R
