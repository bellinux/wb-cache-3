25|$|A very frail Ethel {{returns to}} Albert Square in 2000, {{arriving}} unannounced at Pauline Fowler's (Wendy Richard) house. Ethel {{had run away}} from her retirement village and had decided {{that she was going}} to come back to the square, to live in the place she loves with her old friends. Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted. Ethel appears to have lost none of her zest for life, despite her considerable age, so it is a huge shock to Dot when Ethel reveals that she is suffering from terminal cancer and is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> much longer. Ethel reveals that she has come home to the square to die, but instead of waiting to die in agony, she wants to choose her final moments so she can die with dignity.|$|E
500|$|In May 1980 Jacques's doctor {{advised her}} against {{travelling}} to Greece on holiday as planned, so she visited Ireland instead. During the return ferry crossing {{she told her}} friend Bruce Copp that [...] "You know I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> long". Her health remained poor, and insurance companies refused to insure her for film work. By October her weight had risen again; she had problems breathing and was again admitted to Charing Cross Hospital. She took a weekend break from hospital and returned home to Eardley Crescent, where on 6 October she died {{from a heart attack}} at the age of 58; she was also suffering from kidney failure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track is}} an up-tempo {{composition}} featuring funk production and go-go elements. It is composed {{in the key}} of D#minor and moves at a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute. Set in common time, [...] "Work" [...] is written in the common verse-chorus form. The singer has described the song as [...] "actually very innocent [...] a little aggressive maybe:" [...] "All I'm saying is don't come around if you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to all your talk and as you know, some guys are just full of talk," [...] Rowland said in a 2008 interview with Popjustice. [...] "It's just a woman saying you can't catch me easy {{and you have to}} put in the work. It's about putting in work – that's it, of course." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} blow to David's plans came on 12 July 1152, when Henry, Earl of Northumberland, David's only son and successor, died, although Henry {{might have been}} ill for some time before. David himself had under a year to live, and may have known that he himself was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> much longer. David quickly arranged for his grandson Máel Coluim to be made his successor, and for his younger grandson William to be made Earl of Northumberland. Donnchad I, mormaer of Fife, the senior Gaelic magnate in Scotland-proper, was appointed as rector, or regent, and made to take the 11-year-old Máel Coluim around Scotland-proper on a tour to meet and gain the homage of his future subjects. David's health began to fail seriously in the Spring of 1153 and he died on 24 May 1153. In his obituary in the Annals of Tigernach, he is called Dabíd mac Mail Colaim, rí Alban & Saxan, [...] "David, son of Máel Coluim, King of Scotland and England", a title which acknowledged the new Scoto-Northumbrian identity of David's realm.|$|E
2500|$|Patel's health {{declined}} rapidly {{through the}} summer of 1950. He later began coughing blood, whereupon Maniben began limiting his meetings and working hours and arranged for a personalised medical staff to begin attending to Patel. The Chief Minister of West Bengal and doctor Bidhan Roy heard Patel make jokes about his impending end, and in a private meeting Patel frankly admitted to his ministerial colleague N. V. Gadgil that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> much longer. Patel's health worsened after 2November, when he began losing consciousness frequently and was confined to his bed. He was flown to Bombay (now Mumbai) on 12December on advice from DrRoy, to recuperate as his condition was deemed critical. Nehru, Rajagopalchari, Rajendra Prasad, and Menon all came to see him off {{at the airport in}} Delhi. Patel was extremely weak and had to be carried onto the aircraft in a chair. In Bombay, large crowds gathered at Santacruz Airport to greet him. To spare him from this stress, the aircraft landed at Juhu Aerodrome, where Chief Minister B. G. Kher and Morarji Desai were present to receive him with a car belonging to the Governor of Bombay that took Vallabhbhai to Birla House.|$|E

5000|$|On 18 May 2005, Witchalls' husband, Benoit, {{was interviewed}} on BBC's Crimewatch programme, {{and said that}} he and his wife felt no anger towards the attacker. Discussing his wife's future, he said, [...] "People live {{wonderful}} lives paralysed from the neck down. Our expectations have had to change drastically in the last three weeks, but that's not to say that we're <b>not</b> still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> peaceful lives, with a family." [...] Three weeks later it was announced that her unborn baby was developing normally.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{through her}} that we're in this trap," [...] Ogle stormed on. [...] "Through her and through you. It {{was to bring}} her to Jamaica that you risked all our <b>lives,</b> and we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lose our <b>lives</b> as long as there's {{a chance to make}} {{ourselves}} safe through her." ...|$|R

At Christmas, {{but only}} for a short time, when it struck me that she treated us with the {{patronage}} of precocious youth; and I thought she made the most of a cold when church or parish was concerned. I hinted as much; but her mother seemed quite satisfied. Poor girl! Have I been blind? I did <b>not</b> like her <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> at one of those boarding-houses for lady students. Do you know anything of them? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} trouble about them," [...] the farmer said, [...] "we {{have made them}} safe. We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> risk our <b>lives</b> and those of our wives and families, as {{we should have done}} if we had left those fellows alive to {{identify}} us. There is sure to be a search sooner or later, and those two men would have led the party to every house within miles round, and would have been sure to recognize one or other of us. We are ready <b>to</b> risk our <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> save Mynheer Von Bost, but we are not willing to throw them away needlessly." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, Phipps {{founded the}} U.S. Dream Academy, Inc., a {{non-profit}} organization dedicated to providing a values-based, interactive, tutorial and remedial education program targeting children and at-risk youth through community Family Learning Centers located in various states. Phipps wanted something to help break the cycle he saw played out {{so many times in}} his own family. Wintley formed the U.S. Dream Academy to help children who've had a family member behind bars. The program provides mentoring, academic tutoring, and exposure to computers and the Internet. Phipps says, [...] "Just the computers themselves are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> transform the <b>lives</b> of these kids," [...] and [...] "The most important part of our program is really the caring, loving adults who surround them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I suppose--you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with me--long, are you, Angel?" [...] she asked, the sunk {{corners of}} her mouth betraying how purely {{mechanical}} were the means by which she retained that expression of chastened calm upon her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she shan't come," [...] {{the woman}} said, {{throwing}} {{herself into a}} chair, and regarding him insolently.

5000|$|As the show's 50th anniversary approached, {{there was}} some {{speculation}} {{about the possibility of}} another live edition, particularly after rival soap EastEnders aired a <b>live</b> edition <b>to</b> celebrate its 25th anniversary on air on 19 February 2010. In April 2010 Bill Roache confirmed that ITV would not be airing another live edition. He said; [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do a <b>live</b> episode, we did that in the Millennium year show's 40th anniversary, we don't want to do that again." [...] However, on 29 August actor Keith Duffy said that Coronation Street would air a <b>live</b> episode <b>to</b> celebrate its 50th anniversary, something which was confirmed on 1 September by ITV. The episode was aired on Thursday 9 December as part of a week long celebration of the show's 50th birthday.|$|R
2500|$|The {{release was}} subject to {{numerous}} delays, mostly due to manufacturing problems. The first mention of the release of live material from the Volta tour was made through an announcement made on Björk's official website regarding a [...] "Live Session Album" [...] made at the now-closed Olympic Studios. This was then followed by online stores adding to their pages a release titled [...] "Volta Revisited" [...] in February 2008, with projected (and incorrect) release dates of April/May 2008 listed. An email from Derek Birkett, head of One Little Indian, stated the proposed contents of the release, meant to 'tie-up' the Volta compaign. The release was originally <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> include a <b>live</b> DVD, but amongst those items that {{did not make the}} final release were the online blips made as part of the viral marketing campaign for Volta, the EPK interview that was used in the Volta podcasts available on the iTunes Store, and an unreleased [...] "AOL Online session".|$|R
5000|$|Manic Street Preachers bassist/lyricist Nicky Wire {{reportedly}} expressed cynicism towards Myers' book. In {{an interview}} in September 2010, Wire said, [...] "I found it too upsetting to read. Richey was - is - a brother, a son, a friend." [...] In another interview in the same month, Wire said, [...] "I just feel it's better if I don't see novel. It's a free country and it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ruin our <b>lives</b> and in a pure fictional sense it may well have its worth. It's just the presumption that the writer kind of knew someone..." [...] In a November 2010 interview, Wire described {{the premise of the}} book as “really presumptuous...It would be really pious and stupid to try and ban it because we grew up on rock 'n' roll mythology. I feel uncomfortable with it and it fills me with a bit of dread, but if I was 16 I'd probably look at reading it. But we're not happy with it.” ...|$|R

He was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> He was about to die. No, that would not do. [...] "Forgive malice"--yes, but there was no malice to forgive. Schemmer and the rest were doing this thing without malice. It was to them merely a piece of work that had to be done, just as clearing the jungle, ditching the water, and planting cotton were pieces of work that had to be done. Schemmer jerked the cord, and Ah Cho forgot [...] "The Tract of the Quiet Way." [...] The knife shot down with a thud, making a clean slice of the tree.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{episodes of}} Coronation Street were {{broadcast}} live. A live episode {{was produced in}} December 2000 to celebrate the programme's 40th anniversary. As the show's 50th anniversary approached, speculation began to grow as <b>to</b> whether another <b>live</b> edition would be broadcast, particularly after rival soap EastEnders aired its own <b>live</b> edition <b>to</b> celebrate its 25th anniversary on air in February 2010.

But that's different. You are a boy, {{and will be a}} man; and a man whom I destine to do for me what it has been the object of my life to achieve. Let us be friends. We will--we must be friends; and when old Doctor Grim, worthless wretch that he is, sleeps in his grave, you shall not have the pang of having parted from him in unkindness.
