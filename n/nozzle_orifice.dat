50|$|Making {{a keyhole}} welds: An {{outstanding}} characteristics of plasma arc welding, owing to exceptional penetrating power of plasma jet, {{is its ability}} to produce keyhole welds in work piece having thickness from 2.5 mm to 25 mm. A keyhole effect is achieved through right selection of current, <b>nozzle</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter and travel speed, which create a forceful plasma jet to penetrate completely through the work piece. Plasma jet in no case should expel the molten metal from the joint. The major advantages of keyhole technique are the ability to penetrate rapidly through relatively thick root sections and to produce a uniform under bead without mechanical backing. Also, the ratio of the depth of penetration to the width of the weld is much higher, resulting narrower weld and heat-affected zone.As the weld progresses, base metal ahead the keyhole melts, flow around the same solidifies and forms the weld bead. Key holing aids deep penetration at faster speeds and produces high quality bead. While welding thicker pieces, in laying others than root run, and using filler metal, the force of plasma jet is reduced by suitably controlling the amount of orifice gas.|$|E

The thesis deals with the analysis on the different inlet diameter of <b>nozzle</b> <b>orifice</b> and the different inlet pressure on the flow and also spray characteristics. The objective of this thesis is to compare the final performance of flow and spray characteristics between the different designs of <b>nozzle</b> <b>orifice.</b> Besides that, the purpose of this thesis is to determine the flow and spray characteristics with different inlet diameter of <b>nozzle</b> <b>orifice.</b> This thesis also purposes to study the flow and spray characteristics with different inlet pressure. The geometry of <b>nozzle</b> <b>orifice</b> used is the inlet diameter and the parameter used is the pressure. The data used for analysis is obtained from the simulation by using Solidworks 2012 software.

In this technique high intensity pulses, generated by discharging a capacitor across a spark gap, {{were used as}} the sound source. The test conditions include heated and unheated flows, with and without simulated flight. Results for a straight round duct, three convergent nozzles, a suppressor <b>nozzle,</b> 12 <b>orifice</b> plates, and 10 perforated plates are presented. A low frequency acoustic power loss phenomenon was observed for all configurations at all test conditions including the no flow condition. It was suspected that the power loss phenomenon at the no flow condition {{could be due to}} the conversion of acoustic energy into vortical energy due to non-linear propagation of high intensity pulses. However, a small amount of low frequency power loss was noticed even when tests were repeated with a low intensity sound. Detailed flow visualization results were also obtained to complement the acoustic results...|$|R
40|$|An {{acoustic}} impulse {{technique is}} used to study the acoustic transmission characteristics of ducts, <b>nozzles,</b> <b>orifices,</b> and perforated plates. High intensity pulses were generated by discharging a capacitor across a spark gap for both heated and unheated flows, with and without simulated flights. The effect of a termination geometry on power absorption for high acoustic intensities was observed, showing the existence of power absorption at low frequencies for the duct, <b>nozzles,</b> <b>orifice</b> plates, and perforated plates at a no flow condition; the amount of power absorption was controlled primarily by the open area at the exit. Power conservation with flow {{was similar to that}} for no flow: Power absorption initially increased for the duct and conical nozzles and then decreased with increasing Mach number. Power absorption results for the suppressor nozzle were similar to those for the conical nozzle, and the nonlinear effect was found to be insignificant in the presence of flow. A power imbalance was noted for heated jets, with a greater power loss at low frequencies than for unheated jets. Low frequency power absorption increased with the simulated flight, and a small amount of low frequency power absorption was found even for low intensity sound. A typical schlieren photograph of vortex formation (Whiffen and Ahuja, 1981) helped to confirm that sound energy can be converted into vortical energy and may account for low frequency power losses...|$|R

The volume and {{the shape of the}} meniscus could be regulated dynamically by changing the pressure at the capillary <b>nozzle</b> <b>orifice,</b> thus the capillary force alters correspondingly. The pressure adjustment was realized by adjusting the height of the reservoir device precisely. Fluent software was used to simulate the fluid meniscus under different pressures.

5000|$|The SilverEx- {{electrodes}} and the TungstenEX- nozzles offer {{a number}} of significant advantages: higher cutting current based on the lower electrical resistance of silver, a higher number of start-ups because silver is a superior thermal conductor (vs. copper); therefore the silver electrodes operate cooler than the bi-metallic or copper electrodes while also generating an improved arc force. The TungstenEX- nozzles more than double the life of (conventional) <b>nozzle</b> <b>orifices,</b> thus again improving the process, while maintaining a focused plasma cutting arc. [...] This results in 15-30% higher cutting speed,(depending on thickness of material being cut) less dross, minimum kerf angle, and longer lifetime of both the electrodes and the nozzles while extending the life torch itself due to lower generated heating effect.

Higher injection pressures and multiple injection events every cycle are a reality. To be able to understand how the fuel injection process can be further improved studies are needed on how higher pressure, multiple injections and multi <b>orifice</b> <b>nozzles</b> affect the overall process. The objective of this study was to further develop a measurement technique to determine injection rates and discharge coefficient for multi <b>orifice</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The technique used is based on measuring the instantaneous force of a fuel jet for a non-stationary injection process. The technique is applicable for multi <b>orifice</b> <b>nozzles</b> at high injection pressures. Both single and multiple injections can be resolved.

Steady flow impinging jets can produce relatively high heat transfer coefficients; however it has been shown by Kercher et al., (2003) that synthetic jets can deliver similar cooling effects without the need for an air supply system. Impinging synthetic jets are therefore an extremely promising alternative for applications such as cooling of electronic components, Glezer et al., (2000). A study has been undertaken of the heat transfer distribution to an impinging synthetic jet flow with two exit geometries; contoured <b>nozzle</b> and <b>orifice</b> plate. The jet is directed at a heated copper plate, which approximates a uniform wall temperature boundary condition. Nusselt number profiles generated by the synthetic jet for various driving frequencies and heights above the plate were obtained.

Good agreement for the cavitation extent inside the orifice is found between the micro-CT and the corresponding temporal mean 2 D cavitation image, as captured by the high-speed camera.

Moreover, the cavitation volume fraction exhibits a significant gradient along the orifice volume. The cavitation number and the needle valve lift seem to be the most influential operating parameters, while the Reynolds number seems to have only small effect for the range of values tested.

The sensor uses a vortex gas flow instead of the traditional linear gas flow as the inertial mass to detect the angular rate and linear acceleration. For this complex multi-axis sensing scheme, the theoretical modeling for the sensitivity and the cross-axis sensitivity of the sensor are discussed in detail. During the verification of the sensor's performance, the vortex was created by jetting the air supplied by an external air pump into a detection chamber via two opposing <b>nozzle</b> <b>orifices</b> in opposite directions.
