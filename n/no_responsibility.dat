5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> for what happened. The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{for storing}} {{programmes}} {{that had not}} originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each thought nothing of destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the erasure {{of much of the}} Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world, the missing Doctor Who episodes are probably the best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} found that crewing {{of the train}} was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued the use of traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting of signals. Two members of the train support crew were also on the footplate of Tangmere, but they had <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> in respect of {{the operation of the}} train. No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from the data that was recorded by the OTDR.|$|E

5|$|Once again, the British {{government}} {{did not wish to}} entrust its interests in Japan to a foreign officer, so the British Chiefs of Staff appointed Air Vice Marshal Cecil Bouchier as their representative at MacArthur's headquarters. His brief {{made it clear that he}} had <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> or authority over the BCOF or Commonwealth forces in Korea. After rashly ordering the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade to Pusan without transport or heavy equipment, much to Robertson's annoyance, Bouchier did attempt to confine himself to acting solely as a liaison officer. Following the dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur, Robertson held a press conference in which he defended the general and his conduct of the war. This constituted an implicit condemnation of the British government's policy. Soon after, during the Battle of the Imjin River, Robertson was consulted by the Americans about the possible consequences of the loss of the 1st Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment, and he advised them not to endanger the rest of the I Corps line with a rescue attempt. For his services in the Korean War, he was awarded the American Legion of Merit, and the South Korean Order of Military Merit.|$|E

25|$|Fired: Nargis - For her horrible sales pitches, being rude to {{potential}} customers, creating a poor product with no {{relevance to the}} charity, taking <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> for her mistakes, and for ignoring her team's legitimate concerns.|$|E
6000|$|Josie got at {{the picturesque}} {{qualities of the}} people. They all {{interested}} her and amused her like the cattle without horns, and the guinea-hens which clacked like clocks, and the tadpoles in the marsh. She had <b>no</b> personal relations--no <b>responsibilities</b> toward them such as Rose felt were inescapably hers. Josie had <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> at all, none under heaven! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Each of the Garrison crew {{sees the}} natives and unconsciously thinks {{of his own}} early life, {{when he was a}} child, when he had <b>no</b> worries, <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> before he joined modern society. A baby lying in the sun.|$|R
5000|$|... "Politics, democracy. Don't make me laugh. The {{right to}} vote, {{what is that}} all about? I find it strange that a snot-nosed 18-year-old has the same vote as a father of seven. One has <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> whatsoever, the other {{provides}} tomorrow's citizens. [...] " ...|$|R
25|$|Fired: Mani - For {{incorrectly}} briefing {{the team}} on the venture, his arrogant behaviour, taking <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> for his actions, being disrespectful towards Ruth in the boardroom, and for his generally average at best track record through the process.|$|E
25|$|By {{operation}} of state law, New Castle County has <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> whatsoever for maintenance of roadways.

50|$|Approaching 40, Emilio (Anthony Franciosa), {{has lived}} among ideas and books, {{and is looking}} for a {{short-term}} relationship with <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> He seeks to emulate his friend Stefano (a successful womanizer) (Philippe Leroy) and tales of adventure that he has read about in books, but not experienced.|$|R
50|$|The film {{then begins}} to follow four {{friends in the}} same city. Vijay (Chunky Pandey), Appu Khote (Laxmikant Berde), Prem (Virendra Singh) and Thomas (Raj Zutshi) are a {{carefree}} bunch with <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> that roam their part of town in search of fun and beautiful women.|$|R

25|$|Fired: Kevin – For his awful sales pitches, {{refusing to}} allow Claire to pitch (despite her experience), {{allowing}} Jenny full control on creating the card, taking <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the loss, bringing Sara {{back in the}} boardroom {{in an attempt to}} scapegoat her instead of Jenny and for his overly arrogant attitude throughout the process.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Le Pen {{argued that}} France {{as a nation}} bore <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, {{a part of the}} Holocaust in which Paris policemen arrested Jewish {{citizens}} for deportation to Auschwitz. She repeated a Gaullist thesis according to which France was not represented by the Vichy regime but by General de Gaulle's Free France.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2008, {{the city}} of Durham filed a motion to remove itself as a defendant, arguing it had <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> for Nifong's actions.

50|$|Hinduism {{accepts a}} man's right to end one's life through the non-violent {{practice}} of fasting to death, termed Prayopavesa. But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to old age yogis {{who have no}} desire or ambition left, and <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> remaining in this life. Another example is dying in a battle to save one's honor.|$|R
50|$|A courier has <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> {{other than}} clandestine communications. Any {{involvement}} of the courier in activities that may draw attention from counterintelligence is unwise. For example, {{if there is a}} political party, friendship society, or other organization that would be considered favorable to Service B, couriers, under no circumstances, should be identified with them.|$|R
50|$|Prayopavesa (प्रायोपवेशनम्, {{literally}} resolving to die through fasting) is {{a practice}} in Hinduism that denotes the suicide by fasting of a person, {{who has no}} desire or ambition left, and <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> remaining in life. It is also allowed in cases of terminal disease or great disability. A similar practice exists in Jainism, termed Santhara.|$|R
25|$|In April 2006 Tallink's ferry , {{en route}} from Tallinn to Stockholm, ignored when {{multiple}} passengers reported that a passenger had fallen overboard. The crew refused to stop the ship {{to search for the}} passenger and the 21-year-old Estonian male perished in the incident. Tallink later accepted <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the accident, emphasizing that none of the passengers confirmed actually seeing the man falling overboard or in the water.|$|E
25|$|Other than UC {{appointing}} {{three members}} to the two separate board of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> for or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.|$|E
25|$|McCarthy also sued Olin Corporation, {{the parent}} of Winchester Ammunition under {{products}} liability and negligence theories for their manufacture of the Black Talon bullets used by Ferguson. The cartridges carry hollow-tipped bullets that expand upon impact, increasing the severity of wounds. One month before the Ferguson shootings, Winchester Ammunition announced they were voluntarily withdrawing the Black Talon cartridges from the market. McCarthy's suit failed for numerous reasons, most notably because New York State law placed <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> on manufacturers for the criminal misuse of their products.|$|E
50|$|Constitutionally, provincial governments had <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for Aboriginal peoples, {{but they}} used the {{prohibition}} movement, primarily the liquor laws, {{as a way to}} define Aboriginals. Rules for the retail selling of alcohol were primarily a provincial responsibility. This came to be following the adoption of government control after Canada's experience with prohibition during the First World War.|$|R
50|$|Prathi Gnayiru 9.30 to 10.00 {{movie is}} about four college {{students}} Suresh (Ramesh), Remo (Karunaas), Murugan (Balaji) and Seetharaman (Ravi) who are carefree and have <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in their life.

25|$|The {{nominations}} for honorary degrees by the Royal Military Colleges can be initiated by different organizations or individuals, including the Royal Military Colleges Club of Canada through {{any member of}} the college senate. As with most of Canadian universities, the senate, which in the case of RMC is composed of the Chancellor (Minister of National Defence), the Vice Chancellor (The RMCC Commandant), Principal, Deans, DCadet, Registrar and the Directeur des Etudes du Royal Military College Saint-Jean, makes the final decision. The Royal Military Colleges Club of Canada (RMCCC) has <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> or authority in the process of granting honorary degrees.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentalist {{scholars}} {{justify the}} different religious laws {{for men and}} women by referring to the biological and sociological differences between men and women. For example, regarding the inheritance law which states that women’s share of inheritance is half that of men, Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi quotes the Imam Ali ibn Musa Al-reza who reasons {{that at the time of}} marriage man has to pay something to woman and woman receives something, and that men are responsible for both their wives' and their own expenses but women have <b>no</b> <b>responsibility</b> thereof. Women, however, make up 27% of the Iranian labor force, and the percentage of all Iranian women who are economically active has more than doubled from 6.1% in 1986 to 13.7% in 2000.|$|E
25|$|A {{meeting with}} the DNC was convened to discuss the results. The Fleming craft had few friends in the DNC, though their criticisms were not specific. They {{introduced}} representatives of three shipbuilding firms. The ISTDC were only interested in the Fleming design submitted already, and in trying the craft at a landing {{on the east coast}} of England in a matter of months. The DNC accepted this, but asked ISTDC to give their specifications to the firms present so that they could also submit designs. Two of the firms were unable to tender, the third, Messrs Thornycroft, had a proposal on the drawing board in forty-eight hours and ISTDC and the DNC agreed that construction of a prototype should be paid for. The craft might be constructed for experimental purposes on the understanding that the DNC held <b>no</b> <b>responsibility.</b>|$|E

50|$|A touch {{judge has}} <b>no</b> <b>responsibilities</b> after a match.
