5|$|Russian {{historian}} Oleg Sokolov {{posits that}} Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic {{victory for the}} French, which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown, although at the time {{none of this was}} apparent to either side. Sokolov adds that the decision to <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> the Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz-style defeat and quotes Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, one of Napoleon's finest strategists, who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces and allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms. Digby Smith calls Borodino 'a draw' but believes that posterity proved Napoleon right in his decision to <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> the Guard so far away from his homeland. According to Christopher Duffy, the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau in the 18th century, when both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals, and the battle itself did not have a clear result, although both sides claimed the battle as their own victory.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{his first}} full season in the majors, Youkilis became a regular first baseman (with 127 games at first).

Also in 2006 {{he played in the}} outfield {{for the first time in}} his professional career, 18 games in left field. Despite his inexperience in the outfield, Youkilis did <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> an error while in the outfield; he did, however, commit eight errors while playing the infield.|$|E
5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} {{when he told}} Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant {{with him on the}} team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers.

When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E

5|$|Prison Break {{revolves}} around two brothers: {{one who has}} been sentenced to death for a crime he did <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> and his younger sibling, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison. The brothers, along with six other prisoners at Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape, and the second season follows a massive manhunt chasing the group. Dubbed the Fox River Eight, the group splits and members go their individual way, occasionally meeting up to help each other. They struggle to escape from the police while avoiding a secret group of multinationals called The Company, that wants them all dead.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the San Francisco 49ers 49–3 in their opening playoff game. Favored by only three points, the Giants caught a break when 49ers WR Jerry Rice fumbled an apparent touchdown catch-and-carry off his knee {{early in the}} game, then dominated the Niners {{the rest of the}} way. Their defense held the 49ers to 29yards rushing, 184yards in total offense, and 2 of 14 on third-down conversions. The Giants did <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> a turnover and totalled 216 rushing yards. Jim Burt knocked 49ers quarterback Joe Montana out of the game in the second quarter, hitting him as he threw a pass which Lawrence Taylor intercepted and returned 34yards for a touchdown. The Giants defense also held the 49ers to only nine first downs, and 15 of 37 passing for zero touchdowns and three interceptions.|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E

5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Herzegovina, the KPJ {{had little}} impact until mid-August 1941, {{well after the}} initial revolt had been suppressed. During the lead-up to the mass uprising, the KPJ {{organisation}} in Herzegovina would <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> itself, as it was waiting for orders from the provincial organisation in Sarajevo, which was expecting direction from the KPJ Central Committee to launch a general uprising across Yugoslavia. Once they {{became aware of the}} German attack on the Soviet Union, the KPJ in Herzegovina voted to join the mass uprising, but this only occurred on 24 June, when the uprising was already in full swing. According to Milazzo, the rebels remained a threat throughout eastern Herzegovina well into July, although the uprising in Herzegovina did not advance until the Bosnia-wide revolt occurred at the end of July, by which time the KPJ was ready for active involvement in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|One of Frederick III's bodyguards, Statius, {{traveled}} to Scania {{to organize the}} peasants into Snapphane units and instigate anti-Swedish sentiment. In Malmö, a cabal of rich bourgeoisie, led by Bartholomaeus Mikkelsen, planned a revolt. The conspiracy tried to recruit one of Malmös two mayors, Efvert Wiltfang, but he would <b>not</b> <b>commit</b> himself to the uprising, even though {{he said he would}} support Frederick III. At the end of December, the Danes embarked on a foray into Scania, but were foiled by bad weather and poor navigation. Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities had become aware of the plot and the main leaders were arrested, among them Mikkelsen and Wildfang, and the conspirators were sentenced to death. On December 22, 1659 Mikkelsen and two others were beheaded, but in an attempt to placate the Scanian people the execution of Wiltfang and 10 others was stayed. The uprising had been averted, but rebels and insurgents continued to operate in the countryside.|$|E

5|$|Yellowfang's Secret was {{released}} on 9 October 2012. It is a Super Edition about the former medicine cat of ThunderClan, Yellowfang and her life in ShadowClan. It follows Yellowfang as she first trains to be a warrior, then a medicine cat, as Sagewhisker tells her that her paws are not meant for shedding blood. She decides to switch {{to the role of}} medicine cat instead because she can feel the injuries of all the other cats in ShadowClan. A few moons later she breaks the code of medicine cats when she gives birth to kits; as a result, she and her whole Clan are punished for her disloyalty to the code, as her only surviving kit, Brokenkit proves to be vicious, bloodthirsty, and driven only by ambition, qualities that his own father, Raggedstar, ignores. In the end, Yellowfang herself is cast out of ShadowClan to live as a rogue by her own kit, now having gone on to follow in his father's footsteps and become Brokenstar for a crime she did <b>not</b> <b>commit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did <b>not</b> <b>commit.</b> In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
