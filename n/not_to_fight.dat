5|$|Once {{assembled}} at Nadzab, the 25th Infantry Brigade commenced its {{advance on}} Lae. On 11 September, it engaged the Japanese soldiers at Jensen's Plantation. After defeating them, it engaged and defeated a larger Japanese force at Heath's Plantation. During this skirmish, Private Richard Kelliher won the Victoria Cross, Australia's highest award for gallantry. The Japanese Army elected <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for Lae, preferring instead to withdraw over the Saruwaged Range. This {{proved to be}} a gruelling test of endurance for the Japanese soldiers who had to struggle over the rugged mountains; in the end, the Japanese Army managed to withdraw its forces from Salamaua and Lae, though with extensive losses from exposure and starving during the retreat. Troops of the 25th Infantry Brigade reached Lae shortly before those of the 9th Division that had been advancing on Lae from the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|A {{year has}} past since the {{encounter}} with Beerus. Goku and Vegeta had been training under Whis who had taken them as his students to master on controlling their flow of energy, maintaining it from within themselves. During this time, the remaining remnant of Frieza's army had went to earth to use the dragon balls to revive the long dead galactic ruler. Being revived and regenerated from the army's latest technology of regeneration, Frieza had began to plot his revenge on Goku who had defeated him on planet Namek. Learning that he had defeated Majin Buu, one of two beings warned <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> with from his father; the other being Beerus, Frieza decided to begin intense training to reach new heights of power to face Goku. Frieza's army had arrived on Earth while Goku and Vegeta still training with Whis. Tien, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, and Master Roshi had fought the remnant until their return. Once arriving on Earth, Frieza and Goku had fought showing their latest forms and power. Goku achieved a form beyond the Super Saiyan God form being the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Super Sayian Blue). Frieza revealed his new form achieved after training stating he has not done before, calling it his Golden form.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the civil war, a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> until they were officially exchanged.

The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners.
