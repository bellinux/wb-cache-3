5|$|FBI {{assistant}} director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is given divorce papers from his wife, Sharon, after seventeen years of marriage. At a bar, he meets {{an attractive woman}} named Carina Sayles (Amanda Tapping); the two engage in a one night stand. However, after the tryst, Skinner has a <b>nightmare</b> <b>of</b> an old woman in bed with him. He awakens to find Sayles dead, her head twisted completely around.|$|E
5|$|Jason Voorhees first appears {{during a}} <b>nightmare</b> <b>of</b> the main {{character}} Alice (Adrienne King) in the original Friday the 13th film; he becomes the main antagonist of the series in its sequels. As well as the films, there have been books and comics that have either expanded the universe of Jason, or been based on a minor aspect of him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{plays at}} the park with his teddy, Rupert. A vicious dog grabs Rupert from him and tears it to shreds. Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and even has a <b>nightmare</b> <b>of</b> murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.|$|E

5|$|When Fat Tony {{finds out}} the Principal Skinner is giving Bart {{detention}} after school, the mobsters go to confront Skinner. The next day, Principal Skinner is missing and {{is presumed to}} have been murdered. Bart has a <b>nightmare</b> <b>of</b> Principal Skinner's ghost and his own execution on the chair. He rushes to confront Fat Tony at the bar. When the police burst in, Fat Tony blames Principal Skinner's disappearance on Bart, who is put on trial. During the trial, Fat Tony, Legs, and Louie lie to the court, saying that Bart is Principal Skinner's murderer {{and the leader of}} the Springfield Mafia.|$|E
5|$|As the {{simulation}} begins to weaken under the Saints' influence, Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past. Kinzie determines that the copies {{are being made}} from someone's memory, leading the Boss to conclude Johnny Gat, who was seemingly killed during the events of Saints Row: The Third, is still alive and trapped within {{the simulation}}. Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak, the Boss rescues Johnny from his <b>nightmare</b> <b>of</b> Aisha's death and gets {{him back to the}} ship. Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed, he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion, as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single-handedly stopped him if left on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like the audience, is eventually confronted with Marie's <b>nightmare</b> <b>of</b> repetition. Elements of the horror genre are used, not to scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at the end they have the promise of a new beginning. Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the menopause. The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins on}} April 1, with Makoto {{awakening}} from a <b>nightmare</b> <b>of</b> a girl dying on April 6 with a bell in her hand. As the week goes on, he occasionally experiences premonitions of the future, {{all of which}} come true. Depending on the player's choices, Makoto ends up getting close {{to one of the}} girls, and on April 5, the story branches into different routes focusing on one of them. In each route, the girl Makoto was close to dies on April 6 with a bell in her hand. Afterwards, Makoto finds that he has traveled back in time to April 1, retaining the memories of the previous six days. Concluding that he is trapped in an infinite loop, he vows to keep the girl alive and break free of the loop. He does so by rebuilding his relationships with her while dealing with the emotional problem troubling her. On April 6, the girl ends up in a situation similar to when she died in the last loop, but Makoto saves her, breaking free of the loop and becoming her boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The scale, and {{associated}} {{high number of}} casualties, of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to World War I, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of {{a significant percentage of}} the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, even if they were low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical <b>nightmare</b> <b>of</b> returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.|$|E
