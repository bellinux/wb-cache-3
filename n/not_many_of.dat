5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice {{care is not}} seen as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the other terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|The Lord of the Rings {{contains}} {{several more}} supporting scenes, {{and has a}} more sophisticated plot structure, following the paths of multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The {{differences between the two}} stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are <b>not.</b> <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a story for children, and The Lord of the Rings for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of Middle-earth was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.|$|E

500|$|On 23 October, the {{day after}} the broadcast, Griffin {{announced}} he would be lodging a formal complaint over the programme, over its focus on BNP issues rather than topical subjects. Griffin stated, [...] "There is not much support for me there , because the place is dominated by ethnic minorities. There is an ethnic minority that supports me: the English. But there's <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them left." [...] A spokesman for the BNP said that London was too [...] "multicultural" [...] to be fair to it and that a location like the northwest of England would have been more favourable. The BNP were also going to file a Freedom of Information Request to the BBC to determine the decision-making process behind hosting the programme in London, and in allowing the debate to focus on the BNP, arguing that criticism of the BNP had dominated the whole programme.|$|E
500|$|In November 1994, the {{eviction}} of Claremont Road took place, bringing {{an end to}} the M11 {{link road}} resistance as a major physical protest. Bailiffs, accompanied by the police in full riot gear, carried out the eviction over several days, and the Central line, running adjacent to the road, was suspended. As soon as eviction was completed, the remaining properties were demolished. In the end, the cost to the taxpayer was over a million pounds in police costs alone. Quoting David Maclean, [...] "I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that the cost of policing the protest in order to allow bailiffs to take possession of the premises in Claremont road was £1,014,060." [...] Cohen complained in parliament about police brutality, stating [...] "were <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> my constituents bullied—including vulnerable people, and others whose only crime was living on the line of route?"

There have been good and wise kings but <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them... and this I believe {{to be one of}} the worst." [...] On his death The Times captured elite opinion succinctly: [...] "There never was an individual less regretted by his fellow-creatures than this deceased king. What eye has wept for him? What heart has heaved one throb of unmercenary sorrow?... If he ever had a friend – a devoted friend in any rank of life – we protest that the name of him or her never reached us." [...] George IV was described as the [...] "First Gentleman of England" [...] on account of his style and manners. He possessed many good qualities; he was bright, clever, and knowledgeable. However, his laziness and gluttony led him to squander much of his talent. The Times wrote, he would always prefer [...] "a girl and a bottle to politics and a sermon".|$|E
500|$|Ryohgo Narita {{wanted to}} write a story set during the Prohibition and chose a light novel as the medium because <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them had that setting. He {{believed}} that this choice would better attract the interest of the ASCII Media Works judges. After Narita saw The Untouchables, he spent about ten days working with inspirations and created Baccano! [...] "out of [...] useless calculations." [...] While writing the first novel The Rolling Bootlegs, he consulted many books while writing and mixed fictional elements with historical situations to create a unique plot flow. The story he originally planned was about an ancient magician who was revived during the Prohibition and began to terrorize New York City. A group of mafiosi then violently oppose the magician. However, the story became very different from the original concept. Narita never wrote a detailed outline for the novel and is relieved by that fact because it allowed the characters to [...] "move on their own." [...] The original stages of the series included more supernatural elements. Maiza Avaro was a hypnotist; Ennis was a succubus; Szilard was a magician. In addition, every member of the Camorra, except for Firo, did not survive. Despite the great differences between the characters' initial concepts and the result, Narita is [...] "glad" [...] that these ideas were not used in the finished novel.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} few days, Finucane did not scramble. On 1 August, he was {{assigned}} Spitfire R6818 taken on charge by the unit on 26 July. On 12 August, he took off to intercept a raid at 11:30. Climbing to , [...] off North Foreland, the squadron attacked 30 Messerschmitt Bf 109s several thousand feet below them. Evading a German counterattack Finucane dived upon a formation of 12 enemy fighters. He fired from , causing one Bf 109 to crash into the Channel. The victory was witnessed by Sergeant Orchard in Finucane's flight. He landed at 11:45. While the squadron was refuelling and assembling for another patrol at RAF Manston, the airfield came under a low-level attack by Messerschmitt Bf 110s and Dornier Do 17s covered by Bf 109s. The Bf 110s were led by Hauptmann Walter Rubensdörffer, commanding Erprobungsgruppe 210. 18 Do 17s from Kampfgeschwader 2 supported them. <b>Not</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Spitfires got airborne. Alongside Jeffrey Quill, Finucane took off downwind as the first bombs started to fall. Both Quill and Finucane sighted Bf 109s and engaged. Quill hit a Bf 109 and Finucane fired on two, claiming a probable and one damaged. According to another account Quill had taken off without permission when he heard reverberations to his right. He saw a hangar roof with a mountain of earth flying sky-ward and a Bf 110 pulling out of a dive. He fired at, but missed, a Bf 109. One Spitfire was damaged in the attack. Finucane's first claim {{may be one of}} two III./Jagdgeschwader 54 Bf 109s shot down over the Channel by an unknown British fighter unit. One pilot was unhurt, the other, a Leutnant Eberle was wounded in action. No losses for Bf 109s were incurred on the second air battle.|$|E

500|$|Aoife Wilson of Eurogamer was {{critical}} of Batgirl's characterization, calling it a [...] "bland, no-frills reading of the character, to be frank, which focuses on her familial connections rather than her youthful exuberance." [...] Wilson also lamented that the emphasis on Batgirl's hacking abilities proved {{to be no more}} than a simple extension of Arkham Knights remote hacking environmental puzzles. She offered words similar to Stapleton's on how the lack of additional challenge maps confines the Batgirl character model to only the DLC. Wilson was skeptical as to whether the future season pass DLC would be worth purchasing unless there was an increase in production value and a real introduction to new gadgets and gameplay variety. Carter gave the DLC a 6.5 out of 10, reacting positively to the confinement to the [...] "good bits" [...] of Arkham Knight, more specifically the lack of the Batmobile and an emphasis on puzzle-solving - he also compared it favorably to the Harley Quinn and Red Hood story packs towards which he previously gave negative reviews. In contrast to Stapleton, Carter felt that <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the environments were particularly memorable, and also felt the length was sufficient compared to the game's previous story packs. Carter pointed out that a benefit to the game would be a free-roaming option involving the downloadable characters. Meanwhile, Erik Kain of Forbes felt that the DLC should have been provided free of charge, remarking on the campaign's shortness and calling it [...] "straightforward" [...] and [...] "lackluster". He also criticized Warner Bros. for their marketing campaign with Arkham Knight and its DLC, commenting on their sacrificing quality over quantity to continuously charge customers for rather mediocre content.|$|E
500|$|Roger Catlin {{from the}} Hartford Courant {{said that the}} {{passages}} from the book were [...] "too dirty to quote here, even the funny ones". The Daily Beast said that [...] "the book is neither groundbreaking (save that it features a major star) nor particularly sexy [...] Sex is convincing only when it's playful, as when she appears nude in a Miami pizzeria, chewing a slice while a baffled customer looks on. Elsewhere, she's simply undressed {{with no place to}} go". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post gave the book a mixed review by saying: [...] "Is Sex shocking? not really. Mostly because it's Madonna, and somehow we've come to expect this from her. Is Sex boring? surprisingly, yes". During her review of the book, British author Zoë Heller from The Independent wrote that it was [...] "the women who once saw Madonna as a witty feminist role model who have been most alarmist about her latest pornographic incarnation" [...] and that [...] "previously, they say, Madonna played with traditional images of feminine sexuality in a subversive, 'empowering' way. But now, with sado-masochism and rape fantasies, she has gone too far." [...] Calvin Tomkins, author and art critic for The New Yorker, wrote that [...] "unfortunately, the book is going to be mistaken for pornography". Vanity Fair deemed it [...] "the dirtiest coffee table book to ever be published". Caryn James from The New York Times was negative in her review stating that [...] "There is plenty here to offend the meek (whips and chains), the self-righteous (gay men and lesbians), not to mention the tasteful (a tacky and cluttered art design)". Vicki Goldberg from the same newspaper was also dismissive of the photography of the book saying that [...] "Unfortunately, <b>not</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the images are very good photographically.
