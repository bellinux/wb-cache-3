40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{the use of}} cold-formed steel either as {{structural}} and <b>non-structural</b> <b>member</b> in Indonesian has been increasing significantly. Unfortunatelly, it is also followed by many structural failures {{due to the lack}} of design code applied nationally. The condition forces Indonesian Department of Public Work to construct a design code for the application of cold-formed steel in 2010. In 2012 the committee has succesfully prepared the draft for the code, and now has been validating as a national code (Standar Nasional Indonesia, SNI). The Indonesian code draft (RSNI) for cold-formed steel is adopted from Australian Standard AS 4600 : 2005, considering the wide application of this code among Indonesian construction industries. On the other hand, almost Indonesian design code refer to American code such as ACI 318 and ASCE 2010. Therefore Indonesia needs comparison study between both references, RSNI and American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) S 100 - 2007, to check the compatibili...|$|E

30|$|Images of facades are {{publicly}} available {{for almost all}} urban areas from web services like Google Street View or can easily be gathered. For this reason, we propose a pattern recognition approach to detect windows in facade images. This allows for automatically inferring the opening-ratio from existing structures. Through this, required information can be provided to risk analyses with significantly less effort. Accordingly, alternative tunneling routes can be evaluated already in early phases of planning which enables the selection of an optimal route. It {{can be taken to}} be optimal if it minimizes structural damages to buildings inflicted by settlements. Structural damages are considered relevant if they cause a tilt and potentially induce cracks in structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>members</b> that impair appearance, serviceability or even bearing capacities.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of and experimental investigation on the behaviour of post-installed expansion metal anchors fastened to R/C pre-cracked columns and subjected to transverse reverse loading. Post-installed anchors in reinforced concrete are of crucial importance for the mechanical resistance and stability of both structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>members,</b> like façade panels and balconies, both connected to the slabs. In seismic regions, fasteners are expected to transfer cyclic actions as reliably as possible, from the member in question to the concrete. The anchors behavior, however, is still not completely understood in seismic conditions even if a number of scientific contributions have been lately devoted to this issue, that requires also the definition of appropriate experimental techniques to certify the mechanical properties of the anchors...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{assessment}} and seismic strengthening {{are the key}} issues need to be figured out {{during the process of}} protection and reusing of historical buildings. In this thesis the seismic behaviors of the hinged steel structure, a typical structure of historical buildings, i. e. hinged steel frames in Shanghai, China, were studied based on experimental investigations and theoretic analysis. How the <b>non-structural</b> <b>members</b> worked with the steel frames was analyzed thoroughly. Firstly, two 1 / 4 scale hinged steel frames were constructed based on the structural system of Bund 18, a historical building in Shanghai: M 1 model without infill walls, M 2 model with infill walls, and tested under the horizontal cyclic loads to investigate their seismic behavior. The Shaking Table Test and its results indicated that the seismic behavior of the hinged steel frames could be improved significantly with the help of <b>non-structural</b> <b>members,</b> i. e., surrounding elements outside the hinged steel frames and infilled walls. To specify, the columns are covered with bricks, they consist of I shape formed steel sections and steel plates, which are clenched together. The steel beams are connected to the steel column by steel angle, thus the structure should be considered as a hinged frame. And the infilled wall acted as a compression diagonal strut to withstand the horizontal load, therefore, the seismic capacity and stiffness of the hinged steel frames with infilled walls could be estimated by using the equivalent compression diagonal strut model. A SAP model has been constructed with the objective to perform a dynamic nonlinear analysis. The obtained results were compared with the results obtained from Shaking Table Test. The Test Results have validated that the influence of infill walls on seismic behavior can be estimated by using the equivalent diagonal strut model...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced Concrete (RC) framed {{structures}} with Un-Reinforced Masonry (URM) infill panels form {{a major portion}} of all the RC {{framed structures}} worldwide. The URM panels are considered as <b>non-structural</b> <b>members,</b> which is fairly good assumption under gravity loads, however, it is not the same under lateral forces. Under seismic loads, the stiffness additions due to infill panels modify the dynamic behavior of the structure significantly by altering the frequency of the structure. A research project has been taken up at Earthquake Engineering and Vibration Research Centre (EVRC), Central Power Research Institute (CPRI), Bangalore to investigate the influence of masonry infill on fundamental natural frequency of RC frames. 2 D RC frames of one bay and two bay having single storey, double storey and three storeys are cast and tested for bare frame and many combinations of URM infill panels. Tri-axial shake table is used for testing. The details of the numerical analysis and experimentation carried out in the research project are brought out in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{incorporate}} discrete, short, mechanically deformed, small diameter steel fibers into high strength concrete with f 2 ̆ 7 c 3 ̆e 70 MPa (10 ksi) in an attempt to reduce and partially eliminate the need for steel rebar in concrete construction. By introducing steel fibers to high strength concrete mixture, the overall tensile, compressive and shear strength of the mixture can be improved immensely thus, replacing portions or major parts of the longitudinal, temperature and shrinkage reinforcements. The reduction or elimination of longitudinal and transverse reinforcements in the construction of structural or <b>non-structural</b> <b>members</b> can result in savings in manual labor time for the placement of longitudinal and transverse reinforcements and facilitating concrete pour without the need for vibration.

In order to investigate the importance of incorporating the contribution of the infills (typically considered as <b>non-structural</b> <b>members)</b> and their interaction with non-ductile columns in a building structural model, a comprehensive performance based earthquake assessment over a range of hazard levels is carried out through Nonlinear static and Incremental Dynamic Analyses of a 2 D frame model incorporating: (1) fiber section axial force-moment interaction, (2) cracking and crushing of the infills and (3) infills-induced shear failure of columns. The analyses are performed on three different common structural configurations: (A) bare frame, (B) uniformly infilled frame, and (C) partially infilled frame (pilotis frame).

40|$|Abstract: Throughout the world, the {{disposal}} of used tires is a major environmental problem causing environmental hazards such as breeding ground for mosquitoes, producing uncontrolled fire and they are contaminating the soil and vegetation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify alternative outlets for these tyres, {{with the emphasis on}} recycling the waste tyre. Concrete is an excellent structural material and considered as essential for the modern civilization and human society. Now, the use of waste tires in concrete has become technically feasible and the concrete is being considered as light weight concrete. This study reviews the feasibility of using waste tires in the form of chips and fibers with different sizes in concrete to improve the strength as well as protecting the environment. Also it reviews the potential application in the field by exploiting its unique characteristics and properties. In this study, we outline the use of rubberized concrete in structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>members</b> and show how it is suitable for the concrete, its uses, barriers and benefits and way to future study...|$|R
3000|$|Meanwhile, foam {{concrete}} {{has been more}} widely used for <b>non-structural</b> <b>members</b> in buildings, working as lightweight material for sound barriers, filling for composite members as well as fillers for masonry due to its good thermal insulation and ability to protect against fires (Mydin and Wang 2011). Although {{foam concrete}} has been widely used for non-structural purposes, there is an increasing trend for its use in structural support (Mohamad et al. 2014). The compression and flexural resistance of foam concrete have been studied to determine the structural capacity of foam concrete members (Ibrahim et al. 2014). Due to its inherent low density and low strength (Thakrele 2014; Yue and [...] Bing 2015), foam concrete is often used with steel reinforcements or steel composites (Hilal et al. 2015; Ikponmwosa et al. 2014; Lim et al. 2014; Tan et al. 2015). Therefore, a new composite structure made of cold-formed thin-walled C steel embedment and foam concrete is a promising new product. It not only can {{make use of the}} good fire resistance feature of foam concrete, but also exhibits excellent seismic performance. This is considered to gain a great application prospect in the multi-story buildings.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of seismic isolation in protecting structural and non-structural elements from {{damage has been}} assessed in an extensive programme of shaking-table tests, carried out on four identical 1 / 3. 3 -scale, two-dimensional, reinforced concrete (R/C) frames. Four different isolation systems were considered, namely: (i) rubber-based, (ii) steel-based, (iii) shape memory alloy (SMA) -based and (iv) hybrid, i. e. based on both SMA and steel components, isolation systems. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the main results of the experimental tests on baseisolated models, whose structural response is described through: (i) maximum base displacements; (ii) maximum interstorey drifts; (iii) maximum storey accelerations and (iv) maximum storey shear forces. The evolution of the fundamental frequency of vibration of the R/C frame during the tests is also described. The beneficial effects of using base isolation resulted in no or slight damage, under strong earthquakes, to both structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>members,</b> {{as well as to}} the internal content of the building. The comparison with the experimental results obtained in shaking-table tests on similar fixed-base models emphasizes these positive aspects. Finally, advantages and drawbacks related to the use of each isolation system are discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} study on prefab reinforced concrete buildings designed with older Technical Standards {{is presented in}} this paper, where {{attention is focused on}} hall-type industrial structures. A representative case study, which includes the main sources of seismic vulnerability, is examined in detail. The possible rigid rotation of the bottom end zone of columns, which are encased in smooth socket-type foundations, and the frictional contact between the neoprene pads situated on top of the columns and the terminal zone of the roof girders are modelled in time-history assessment analyses. The latter are initially carried out by assuming an elastic behaviour of columns, highlighting unsafe response conditions under seismic action scaled at the basic design earthquake level, and near-collapse at the maximum considered earthquake level, which is caused by the loss of support of several girders from the neoprene pads. A second step of the analyses, where plastic behaviour of columns is investigated by incorporating fiber-type plastic hinges at their bottom end sections, assesses a remarkable ductility demand, as well as potential collapse induced by the complete loss of support of girders. The high lateral displacements of columns may also cause failure of the fastenings of the connected cladding panels, likely to results in their overturning-induced collapse. Based on these data, a supplemental damping-based retrofit hypothesis is proposed, consisting in the installation of dissipative braces equipped with pressurized fluid viscous spring-dampers. The protective system allows attaining a completely undamaged response of structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>members,</b> and therefore meeting the requirements of the Immediate Occupancy limit state, up to the maximum considered earthquake level...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{experimental}} {{programs have}} been conducted {{in recent years to}} understand the potential benefits of different types of external reinforcement systems aimed to reduce the seismic vulnerability of existing structures. The Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Mortar (FRCM) materials are spreading as an alternative strengthening technique to the traditional use of Externally Bonded - Fibre Reinforced Polymer (EB-FRP) systems, for both structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>members</b> of civil and industrial buildings. The behaviour of FRCM materials depends on numerous parameters and it is, in general, more complex than what observed for the more traditional EB-FRP ones, mainly due to the presence of a cement-based adhesive. Both tensile and bond tests can help researchers and manufacturers in optimizing the strengthening system. In this framework, the potential of the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique for monitoring the behaviour of FCRM systems is very high. Nevertheless, the accuracy of such a monitoring technique is good enough only if sensitivity analysis and critical post-processing of results are performed. Recently, several tests were performed in a Round Robin Test (RRT) initiative involving several laboratories and concerning tensile tests on different types of FRCM systems and bond tests on the same reinforcements applied to masonry elements. The experimental results of the tests performed by two of these laboratories are compared in this paper in order to investigate the effect of set-up on both the global performance and the local bond behaviour of three FRCM systems (glass, basalt, steel). The results allow also to evidence benefits and weaknesses of using DIC technique for monitoring tests on FRCM systems...|$|R

Hence, it is of utmost importance that attention be given to the evaluation of the adequacy of strength in framed RC structures to resist strong ground motions. In this project, a 50 -year old four storey reinforced concrete structure has been considered, which lies in Zone II according to IS 1893 : 2000 classification of seismic zones in India. For <b>non-structural</b> <b>members</b> masonry infill has been assumed. In the Equivalent Static Method of analysis, the seismic load acting on the structure is assumed to be an equivalent static horizontal force applied to individual frames. The total force applied shall be equal to the product of the acceleration response spectrum and the seismic weight. It is used only for low to high rise buildings without significant coupled lateral-torsional modes. The structure is designed in STAAD.

The demand moments and shear have been noted down from the software analysis and compared to the capacities of the given section. FRP jacketing is the most appropriate method of retrofitting the failing members in the given 4 -storey RC structure. The norms stated in ACI 440 - 2 R. 02 have been followed to calculate and suggest the method and scheme of application of FRPs to the member and also the number of plies to be used.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceSutton F. StephensCold‐formed steel {{has become}} a {{preferred}} building material for wall framing in {{many different types of}} structures. One of its main uses has been as <b>non‐structural</b> <b>members</b> in curtain wall assemblies of structural steel framed buildings. In an exterior wall application, the main purpose of the curtain wall is to transfer out of plane loads to the steel frame while not supporting any superimposed gravity loads. Therefore, when the curtain wall is in the plane of the structural steel frame, the vertical deflection of the spandrel beam directly above the wall must be known to provide the appropriate deflection gap between the beam and the curtain wall so that gravity loads are not transferred to the wall. Common practice is to size the gap for the deflection from 100 % of the live load. In some cases, the deflection gap may be significant, and since this gap must also be provided in the exterior cladding of the wall, it creates a design issue for the architect. This report presents the results of an investigation into the feasibility of reducing the size of the deflection gap when the wall is located directly under the spandrel beam. In this study, analytical models were developed for common design situations of curtain walls constructed of cold‐formed steel studs in structural steel framed buildings. This study investigates two common stud heights combined with different floor live loads. Taking into account that wall studs have some available axial compressive strength, a procedure was developed to determine an appropriate reduction for the gap. Using an iterative process a relationship is made between the axial compressive strength of the stud and the amount of axial load the stud can support to establish a factor which gives the percentage the live load gap for 100 % live load can be safely reduced by...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MIng (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 It {{has become}} a {{challenging}} exercise to obtain land {{in order to further}} develop the electrical infrastructure in South Africa. The {{reason for this is that}} high voltage transmission towers visually impacts the surroundings and require a large servitude in order to accommodate these structures. The requirements for low visible towers with small foundation footprints may be achieved with double circuit power line towers. However, the structural loading in tower member's increase drastically as a result of large conductor bundles, higher reliability, smaller foundation footprints and a increase in wind loading because of the taller structures. This limits the further economical use of standard angular hot rolled sections and requires that alternative cross sections are considered in the design of power line towers. The aim of this research is to focus on the practical and cost-e ective implementation of circular hollow sections (CHS) in power line towers. The design of a power line system consist of a family of tower structures which include a large number of structural and <b>non-structural</b> <b>members</b> as well as many connections resisting various combinations of loads. The outcome of this research proves that a feasible and practical way exist to implement circular hollow sections in power line tower design using current design software, current design standards and current manufacturing techniques for South African conditions. It is recommended that connections between tower elements should be similar to existing connection practices where possible. This will reduce the requirements for specialized software or connection standards. This will also facilitate the design of hybrid tubular and angular member towers. Hence a review of current angular member and connection design practices are given for the reader. Before the design of a tubular power line tower may be done, various hollow section connections and stability criteria are reviewed. The CIDECT manuals provide an excellent resource for hollow section connections for static and dynamic conditions. It is important to note that it is not the intention of the author to question or improve on the existing hollow section design formulae, but rather to show their ease of implementation in the power line industry. A tubular tower was designed and fabricated in order to combine the theory and practical implementation thereof. In the design of this test tower, the author introduced a novel cross arm design. The new con guration cross arm has only three main chords compared with the conventional cross arm with four main chords. It is envisaged that this new cross arm con guration will reduce overall tower cost as well as construction cost. An analytical and numerical structural analysis was used to design the test tower. An isolated analysis was also performed on the tower cross arm in order to compare and validate the use of less expensive structural software. The comparison considered a full nite element analysis (ANSYS) compared with a beam element analysis (Prokon). The results show that there is an excellent correlation between the two models given that speci c, yet simple modeling techniques are used to model the tower elements. In order to conclude the validity of the recommended design approach and the integrity of the test structure, physical testing was done at the Eskom tower test facility. The structure was securely xed to the base of the test bed and strain gauges were tted on several of the tower members. Steel wire ropes with load cells were tted to the cross arms of the structure and three typical load cases were evaluated. Comparing the physical test results with the Prokon model, a 10 % variation between member loads were recorded. The loads in the test tower was in most cases higher compared with the Prokon model. In summary, the design process proposed here may successfully be used to design and manufacture CHS power line towers. The design process uses current design software, current design standards and current manufacturing techniques. Further investigation on full scale structures are required in order to study the economics of tubular towers versus angular member towers. This study should include fabricators and construction experts in order to comprehend the impact on the power-line industry. The author suspects that the fabrication cost of CHS towers will be slightly higher but the construction cost will be signi cantly less. Master...|$|R
