40|$|The {{burst-mode}} {{control is}} generally used {{to regulate the}} output voltage of the ac/dc adapter under light or no-load condition. Although the burst-mode control reduces the switching loss, the control-IC and the feedback circuit at the output side still consume {{a large amount of}} power. In order to further reduce the power consumption at no-load condition, a zero no-load power (ZNP) ac/dc adapter for electronic equipment with an embedded battery is proposed in this paper. When the proposed adapter is load connected, the operation is same as that of the conventional adapter. At no-load condition, the adapter is totally turned off. As a result the adapter can reduce the <b>no-load</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> to less than 1 mW. Simulation of a 65 W adapter is presented in order to verify its validity. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analytical}} framework {{to model the}} sleep mode power consumption of a base station (BS) {{as a function of}} its sleep depth. The sleep depth is made up of the BS deactivation latency, actual sleep period and activation latency. Numerical results demonstrate a close match between our proposed approach and the actual sleep mode power consumption for selected BS types. As an application of our proposed approach, we analyze the optimal sleep depth of a BS, taking into consideration the increased power consumption during BS activation, which exceeds its <b>no-load</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption.</b> We also consider the power consumed during BS deactivation, which also exceeds the power consumed when the actual sleep level is attained. From the results, we can observe that the average total power consumption of a BS monotonically decreases with the sleep depth as long as the ratio between the actual sleep period and the transition latency (deactivation plus reactivation latency) exceeds a certain threshold...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} two {{optimal control}} {{models for the}} energy management of a mining crushing process based on jaw crushers. The performance index for both models {{is defined as the}} energy cost to be minimized by accounting for the time-of-use electricity tariff. The first model is referred to as a variable load-based optimal control with the feeder speed and closed-side setting of the jaw crusher as control variables. The second model is the optimal switching control. From the simulation results, it is demonstrated that there is a potential of reducing the energy cost and energy consumption associated with the operation of jaw crushing stations in deep mines while meeting technical and operational constraints. Due to the inefficiency of the jaw crushing machine, whose <b>no-load</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> is between 40 and 50 % of its rated power, the optimal switching control technique is shown to be a better candidate in reducing both energy cost and consumption of the jaw crushing station. The benefit of having an ore pass with a big storage capacity is shown to be of great importance in achieving more energy cost reduction of the primary jaw crushing station while improving the switching frequency profile associated with the switching controller.

40|$|The TEA 1721 is a {{small and}} low cost module Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) {{controller}} IC for low power applications (up to 5 W) and operates directly from the rectified universal mains input. The device includes a high voltage power switch (700 V) and has been optimized for flyback converter topologies to provide high-efficiency over the entire load range with ultra-low power consumption in the no-load condition. It provides a circuit for start-up directly from the rectified mains voltage without any external bleeder circuits. The converter operates as a regulated voltage source from no-load up to the maximum output current and operates as current source that delivers the maximum current over a broad output voltage range. Using the TEA 1721, a low power converter can be built at minimum cost and with the minimum number of external components. The controller regulates the output voltage with primary-side sensing which {{eliminates the need for}} an additional secondary feedback circuitry and simplifies the design. At higher power levels, a frequency and current control mode is used. It operates with Burst mode control at low power levels and no-load condition. The burst mode minimizes audible noise and provides an energy saver state which reduces the power consumption in no-load condition.

The scientific community is attempting {{to address this problem}} in a number of ways, for example, by employing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, selectively switching off idle or underutilized servers, and employing energy-aware task scheduling. Central to these approaches is the accurate estimation of the <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> of the various subsystems of a server, particularly, the processor. We distinguish between <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> measurement techniques and power con-sumption estimation models.
