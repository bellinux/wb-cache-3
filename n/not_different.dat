Though the incidence for MALA about nine per 100,000 person-years, this is <b>not</b> <b>different</b> from the background incidence of lactic acidosis {{in the general}} population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|It is a small, mouse-like rodent. It {{differs from}} the very similar eastern voalavo mainly in some measurements, such as a greater tail length. It also resembles small species of Eliurus, but the fur is darker {{and there is no}} tail tuft. The fur is soft, short, and thick, and appears dark gray on most of the upperparts, but more {{brownish}} on the sides. On the back, the cover hairs, which form {{the main part of the}} fur, are three-colored: most of the hair is gray, followed by a narrow light buff band and a black tip. The longer guard hairs are black. The fur of the underparts is <b>not</b> <b>different</b> in overall color, but the individual hairs are gray for about three quarters of their length and white at the tips, except for those at the chin, which are white throughout.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the genus}} Amanita, A.gemmata is {{classified}} in subgenus Amanita, section Amanita, subsection Gemmatae, and series Gemmatae. Tulloss places the species in a stirps (an informal ranking above species level) with A.russuloides and A.viscidolutea.

25|$|The early {{gay rights}} movement, {{then called the}} Homophile Movement, was {{developed}} by the Mattachine Society, formed in 1950. Although the Mattachine Society began as a provocative organization with roots in its founders' communist activism, leadership of the Mattachine thought it more prudent and productive to convince heterosexual society at large that gays were <b>not</b> <b>different</b> from themselves, rather than agitate for change. They changed their tactics in 1953. The Daughters of Bilitis followed this model by encouraging its members to assimilate as much as possible into the prevailing heterosexual culture.|$|E
25|$|National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry {{suggest that}} there is little {{difference}} in effectiveness between antipsychotics in prevention of relapse, and recommend that the specific choice of antipsychotic be chosen based on persons preference and side effect profile. The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concludes that olanzapine is <b>not</b> <b>different</b> from haloperidol in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology, or in overall assessment, but that it is superior for the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms. When trials enrolling only treatment-resistant patients were excluded from the analysis, olanzapine was superior for overall assessment.|$|E

Regarding the McGurk experiment, responses from cochlear implanted users produced the same responses as normal hearing individuals when an auditory bilabial stimulus is dubbed onto a visual velar stimulus. However, when an auditory dental stimulus is dubbed onto a visual bilabial stimulus, the responses are quite different. The McGurk effect is still present in individuals with impaired hearing or using cochlear implants, although it is quite different in some aspects.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{literacy}} bolsters {{both the}} informal and formal economies in Veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy. While indigenous people are relatively poor, little evidence {{was found that}} the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are <b>not</b> <b>different</b> than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.|$|E
