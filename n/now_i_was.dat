[...] Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: [...] "When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a [...] nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stuck re-creating that narration.

Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.|$|E
500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. And <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going {{to sit in the}} dark, and I could only see out of one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E

500|$|Nintendo's {{advertising}} campaign for Brain Age 2 featured several celebrities. The company announced on June 25, 2007 that Australian actress Nicole Kidman {{would appear in}} European television and newspaper advertisements to promote the game. Nintendo chose to feature her because of [...] "her universal appeal to mainstream audiences {{of all ages and}} backgrounds, as well as her reputation for being intelligent, entertaining and genuine". Kidman praised Nintendo's desire to reach out to new audiences with self-improvement products, and found that playing the game made her feel young. Nintendo also chose professional swimmer Kieren Perkins to promote Brain Age 2 in his native Australia, who commented, [...] "Having used the original Dr Kawashima's Brain Training game for a while <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> genuinely looking forward to all of the new ways I could exercise my mind. More Brain Training is the perfect way for me to continue my Brain Training workout, while keeping the activities fresh and interesting." [...] In the United States, print advertisements and television commercials for the game featured American actress Liv Tyler.|$|E
500|$|Recurring guest actors for {{the series}} Eugene Simon, Julian Glover, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Finn Jones, and Ian Gelder, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, Pycelle, Mace Tyrell, Loras Tyrell, and Kevan Lannister, respectively, also made their final {{appearance}} in the series. Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at a crossroads and I had {{to think of what}} the future is. I was very blessed that something like this has come along at the right moment," [...] referring to Iron Fist. Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you. This is a wonderful way to go. I really, really appreciate it, and I look forward to doing it for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a diary {{provided}} by his caretakers, Wearing {{was encouraged to}} record his thoughts.

2500|$|On September 6, 1973, {{three weeks}} after announcing his intent to {{investigate}} the allegations against Rove, George H.W. Bush chose him to be chairman of the College Republicans.

Not long after that, Edgeworth stated [...] "Bush sent me back the angriest letter I have ever received in my life.

During his years as a student, he helped home-deliver a number of babies. He received an MA degree and BM BCh degree in 1958. He qualified for his internship that December, which would begin at Middlesex Hospital the following month.

[...] In 1997, {{he told an}} interviewer he would encourage young people {{to become involved in}} politics but also warned, [...] "Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that albatross around your neck. Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena." [...] In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he [...] "was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision—a jejune and immature outlook—seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions." [...] Byrd also said in 2005, [...] "I know <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times... and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of [...] "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other things to be worried about right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put so much time and effort and politics into it– unnecessary." ...|$|E

After [...] "a few days at home," [...] wrote Aldrich, she {{was admitted to}} New York-Presbyterian Hospital for tests. Doctors said she was suffering from hepatitis, and she was admitted to a room on the 16th floor. Her former son-in-law, Dr. William G. Cahan, recalled in his 1992 memoir (by then he was a globally recognised medical expert on cancer) what happened next in 1952:She was admitted to New York Hospital [...] Her doctors were puzzled by what was described in the press as [...] "a liver problem," [...] and suspected {{that she might have}} cancer. Hearing this, and without Gertrude's knowledge, her husband consulted me. Not wanting to alarm her by appearing in person (she knew, of course, that by <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a cancer specialist), I sent some of my colleagues as consultants. They, too, were puzzled, and ordered an exploratory laparotomy (abdominal operation).|$|E

[...] In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone, [...] "I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what they smell like.... What do they have to offer humanity?" [...] In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazine, Haggard said, [...] "I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [...] I have more culture <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest with you at the moment, and {{a lot of things that}} I said [...] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn't know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information.
