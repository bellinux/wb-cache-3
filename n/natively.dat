5|$|Documentary {{evidence}} of cannon in Russia {{does not appear}} until 1382 and they were used only in sieges, often by the defenders. It was not until 1475 when Ivan III established the first Russian cannon foundry in Moscow that they began to produce cannon <b>natively.</b>|$|E
5|$|Orban was {{assisted}} by a cabinet of nine members; Patricia Bugnot (French) was Head of Cabinet and Jochen Richter (German) was Deputy Head. The cabinet {{did not include}} any <b>natively</b> anglophone member. Orban's salary was €18,233.38 (approx. US$23,631, c.2007) a month plus housing allowance.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, Google {{announced}} that 360° videos would be <b>natively</b> supported on YouTube. On March 13, 2015, YouTube enabled 360° videos {{which can be}} viewed from Google Cardboard, a virtual reality system. YouTube 360 can also be viewed from all other virtual reality headsets. Live streaming of 360° video at up to 4K resolution is also supported.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} aim to {{make the}} kernel and usermode APIs more compatible with Windows NT version 5.2 (Windows Server 2003) and to add support for more applications and hardware with plans to target newer versions of Windows as development matures. DirectX support is undertaken through ReactX, an in-house implementation. 2D hardware-accelerated rendering is done <b>natively,</b> while other drawing functionality is redirected to OpenGL as a stopgap solution.|$|E
5|$|Contact between English and {{immigrant}} languages {{has given rise}} to new accents and dialects. For instance, the variety of English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in {{the country as a whole}} have strongholds in Northern towns: Pashto is spoken <b>natively</b> by 0.08% of the population of England but 0.7% of the population of Bradford, while Cantonese is the first language of 0.4% of the population of Manchester compared to 0.08% nationally.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{does not}} <b>natively</b> render at true HD {{resolution}} (at least 720 lines of vertical resolution). In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English <b>natively.</b> He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|The ReactOS and the Wine {{projects}} {{share the}} goal to run binary Windows software <b>natively</b> and can share therefore many dependencies and development. ReactOS uses {{portions of the}} Wine project {{so that it can}} benefit from Wine's progress in implementing the Win32 API. While Wine's NTDLL, USER32, KERNEL32, GDI32, and ADVAPI32 components cannot be used directly by ReactOS due to architectural differences, code snippets of them and other parts can be shared between both projects. The kernel is developed by ReactOS separately as Wine relies here on existing Unix-like kernels.|$|E
5|$|The Windows Push Notification Service (WNS) was {{designed}} as a successor to the Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS), which was only supported <b>natively</b> on the Windows Phone 8 Operating System. Developers can still use the MPNS on apps that are installed on newer versions of Windows Mobile (Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1), but only if the Windows application was already registered to use the MPNS and has been converted to a Microsoft Silverlight application and modified to re-target the new platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is an {{opportunistic}} omnivore primarily eating fruits and leaves, {{particularly those of}} the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), known <b>natively</b> as kily. When available, tamarind makes {{up as much as}} 50% of the diet, especially during the dry, winter season. The ring-tailed lemur eats from as many as three dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, spider webs, insect cocoons, arthropods (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small vertebrates (birds and chameleons). During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Roman Empire was in {{language}} and civilization a Greek society. Linguistically, Byzantine or medieval Greek is situated between the Hellenistic (Koine) and modern phases of the language. Since {{as early as the}} Hellenistic era, Greek had been the lingua franca of the educated elites of the Eastern Mediterranean, spoken <b>natively</b> in the southern Balkans, the Greek islands, Asia Minor, and the ancient and Hellenistic Greek colonies of Southern Italy, the Black Sea, Western Asia and North Africa. At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium, the koine (Greek: κοινή) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings, while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{revealed}} at E3 2003, with a playable demo being a mostly complete {{version of the}} game, albeit with a few levels missing. Grabbed by the Ghoulies was released in North America on 21 October 2003, in Europe on 21 November 2003 and in Japan on 29 April 2004, becoming Rare's first game to be released under Microsoft. It was later re-released as an Xbox Originals game for the Xbox 360 on 16 February 2009, later being removed from the store on 16 June 2015. At Microsoft's E3 2015 press conference, the compilation title Rare Replay was unveiled. Rare Replay has a selection of thirty games from Rare's lifetime game library, including Grabbed by the Ghoulies. The game was remastered to run <b>natively</b> on the Xbox One, increasing its resolution and framerate relative to the original Xbox release.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} language is Modern Standard Arabic, a literary language {{taught in the}} schools. Most Jordanians <b>natively</b> speak one of the non-standard Arabic dialects known as Jordanian Arabic. Jordanian Sign Language {{is the language of}} the deaf community. English, though without official status, is widely spoken throughout the country and is the de facto language of commerce and banking, as well as a co-official status in the education sector; almost all university-level classes are held in English and almost all public schools teach English along with Standard Arabic. Chechen, Circassian, Armenian, Tagalog, and Russian are popular among their communities. French is offered as an elective in many schools, mainly in the private sector. German is an increasingly popular language; it has been introduced at a larger scale since the establishment of the German-Jordanian University in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate {{released}} Knight Lore {{third in}} the Sabreman series despite having completed it first. The Stamper brothers withheld its release for a year to position the company advantageously {{in anticipation of the}} game's effect on the market. Knight Lore novel image masking technique, Filmation, let images appear to pass atop and behind each other without their contents colliding. This created the illusion of depth priority, which the computer did not <b>natively</b> support. By delaying Knight Lore release, Ultimate protected sales of their upcoming Sabre Wulf and created another Filmation game before other developers could copy the style. Ultimate released the original Sabreman trilogy in quick succession in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum. Knight Lore came last, in November. Ports followed for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, MSX, and Famicom Disk System. The game was later included in compilations including Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|While Bungie founder Alex Seropian {{handled the}} {{business}} aspect of Bungie and produced the game's box art and promotional material, Jones programmed the game, wrote the story line, {{and contributed to}} the game's manual. Whereas Jones had single-handedly coded Minotaur, the small staff for Pathways was due to lack of money for a large team. To speed implementation, Jones built a level editor for the game that allowed him to add objects, monsters and walls to the levels. The game's levels and mazes span 40million scaled square feet. Jones' friend, Colin Brent, did much of the art and creature design, reducing Jones' workload and, in the programmer's opinion, improving the art. Each monster was drawn by hand in different states such as stationary, moving, attacking, and dying. They were then scanned into the computer and added to the game; if there were problems, they were redrawn. Once the final drawings were complete, the images were colorized in 24-bit color using Adobe Photoshop. Despite the game's advanced graphics, Pathways was designed to work on any Macintosh model; it was one of 30applications that ran <b>natively</b> on Apple's PowerMacs on launch day.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was {{released to the public}} on October2, 2006, delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May25, 2010. While backward compatible with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not <b>natively</b> support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the Wine software application. GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in FLOPS. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.|$|E
