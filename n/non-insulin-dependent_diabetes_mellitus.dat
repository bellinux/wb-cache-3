40|$|The {{degree of}} fasting {{hyperglycemia}} {{in patients with}} <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> {{is dependent on the}} rate of hepatic glucose production. The basal rate of hepatic glucose production is increased in patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus,</b> and there is a positive correlation between hepatic glucose production and fasting glucose levels. Diminished secretion of insulin, impaired hepatic sensitivity to insulin's effects, or a combination of these factors could contribute to the elevated hepatic glucose production in patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b> The relationship between insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production is regulated by a closed feedback loop operating between glucose levels and pancreatic beta cells. Although fasting insulin levels are usually comparable between patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> and normal subjects, insulin secretion is markedly impaired in <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> in relation to the degree of hyperglycemia present. In fact, the degree of fasting hyperglycemia in a given patient with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> is closely related to the degree of impaired pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose. Such findings suggest that impaired insulin secretion leads to increased hepatic glucose production, which raises the plasma glucose level.

Patients with IDDM diagnosed within two months, presented with normal albumin excretion, whereas the concentrations of β 2 -microglobulin and kappa light chain in urine were higher than in control subjects. The initiation of insulin therapy reduced, but did not completely normalize, the elevated rate of kappa light chain excretion. Patients with IDDM of long duration showed increased urine excretion of kappa light chains and albumin. In keeping with the findings in IDDM, patients with newly diagnosed NIDDM (within one year) showed increased urinary excretion of kappa light chains compared with control subjects. There was, however, no further increase in light chain excretion with longer duration of NIDDM. To study the effect of short-term hyperglycemia on urinary protein excretion, 12 normal subjects participated in a three-step hyperglycemic clamp study, during which their plasma glucose concentration was raised by + 50, + 125 and + 300 mg/dl. The urine excretion of albumin and β; 2 -microglobulin rose progressively with each hyperglycemic clamp step, whereas that of kappa light chain excretion was unaffected by hyperglycemia. We conclude that increased urinary excretion of kappa light chain is a consistent finding in all types of <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus,</b> and can be observed even when the albumin excretion is normal. Since the serum concentration of kappa light chain is normal in diabetes, the increased urinary excretion of kappa light chains must be of renal origin.

Breakdown of the blood–retinal barrier and leakage from the retinal vasculature leads to diabetic macular edema, an important cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes. Although epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials suggest that glycemic control {{plays a major role}} in the development of vascular complications of diabetes, insulin therapies for control of glucose metabolism cannot prevent long-term retinal complications. The phenomenon of temporary paradoxical worsening of diabetic macular edema after insulin treatment has been observed in a number of studies. In prospective studies on <b>non–insulin-dependent</b> (type 2) <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> patients, a change in treatment from oral drugs to insulin was often associated with a significant increased risk of retinopathy progression and visual impairment. Although insulin therapies are critical for regulation of the metabolic disease, their role in the retina is controversial. In this study with diabetic mice, insulin treatment resulted in increased vascular leakage apparently mediated by betacellulin and signaling via the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of Metabolic Syndrome and related chronic diseases, among them <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> (type 2) <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus,</b> {{are on the}} rise in the United States and throughout the world. Animal models that respond to environmental stressors, such as diet, are useful for investigating the outcome and development of these related diseases. Objective Within this context, growth and energy relationships were characterized in the Nile rat, an exotic African rodent, as a potential animal model for diet-induced type 2 <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> and Metabolic Syndrome. Methods Compiled data from several studies established the relationship between age, body weight gain (including abdominal adiposity), food and water consumption, and blood glucose levels as determinants of diabetes in male and female Nile rats. Glucose Tolerance Testing, insulin, HbA 1 c, blood pressure measurements and plasma lipids further characterized the diabetes in relation to criteria of the Metabolic Syndrome, while diet modification with high-fat, low-fiber or food restriction attempted to modulate the disease. Results The Nile rat fed lab chow demonstrates signs of the Metabolic Syndrome that evolve into diet-induced <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> (type 2) <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> characterized by hyperinsulinemia with rising blood glucose (insulin resistance), abdominal adiposity, and impaired glucose clearance that precedes increased food and water intake, as well as elevated HbA 1 c, marked elevation in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, microalbuminuria, and hypertension. Males are more prone than females with rapid progression to diabetes depending on the challenge diet. In males diabetes segregated into early-onset and late-onset groups, the former related to more rapid growth and greater growth efficiency for the calories consumed. Interestingly, no correlation was found between blood glucose and body mass index (overall adiposity) in older male Nile rats in long term studies, whereas blood glucose and the perirenal fat pad, as well as liver and kidney weight, were positively related to early-onset diabetes. Rats weaned early (4 - 5 wks) and challenged with a high-fat Western-type diet developed diabetes faster, and body fat accumulation was more apparent, whereas food restriction curtailed it. Conclusion The Nile rat fed typical rodent diets develops hyperinsulinemia that precedes hyperglycemia (insulin resistance) leading to diet-induced type 2 diabetes associated with hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Dietary modulation affected growth rate (weight gain and central adiposity) to impact disease progression. This rodent model represents a novel system of gene-diet interactions affecting energy utilization that can provide insight into the prevention and treatment of the type 2 diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome. </p...|$|R

Glucagon is a potent stimulus for the islet beta-cell, and intravenous bolus injection of 1 mg glucagon has been widely used to assess endogenous insulin secretion for clinical or research purposes. Plasma C-peptide levels (less commonly insulin) are usually measured immediately before and 6 min after glucagon injection. The C-peptide response to glucagon is well-correlated with the beta-cell response to mixed meals or other stimuli commonly used to characterize endogenous insulin secretion (oral or intravenous glucose, standard meals, arginine, etc.) and has the advantage of shorter duration and simple standardization. The glucagon test shows good intra-subject reproducibility, although in diabetic patients it may be influenced by variable prevailing blood glucose levels. Several applications of the glucagon test have been developed. In Type 1 diabetes, the glucagon test has been used to discriminate between patients with and without residual insulin secretion. This can be especially important during the first few months, or even years, following initiation of insulin therapy when attempts to stop the immunological destruction of the beta-cell are made. Assessment of endogenous insulin secretion is also important after pancreas or islet transplantation.

Therefore, we investigated the effects of aliskiren in comparison with those of an extensively used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, on peripheral subcutaneous small-resistance artery morphology, retinal arteriolar structure, and capillary density in a population of patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b> Sixteen patients with mild essential hypertension and with a previous diagnosis of <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> were included in the study. Patients were then randomized to 1 of the 2 active treatments (aliskiren 150 mg once daily, n= 9; or ramipril 5 mg once daily, n= 7). Each patient underwent a biopsy of the subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region, an evaluation of retinal artery morphology (scanning laser Doppler flowmetry), and capillary density (capillaroscopy), at baseline and after 1 year of treatment. Subcutaneous small arteries were dissected and mounted on a pressurized micromyograph, and the media-to-lumen ratio was evaluated. A similar office blood pressure-lowering effect and a similar reduction of the wall-to-lumen ratio of retinal arterioles were observed with the 2 drugs. Aliskiren significantly reduced media-to-lumen ratio of subcutaneous small-resistance arteries, whereas ramipril-induced reduction of media to lumen ratio was not statistically significant. No relevant effect on capillary density was observed. In conclusion, treatment with aliskiren or ramipril was associated with a correction of microvascular structural alterations in patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> in 1467 ambulatory elderly subjects aged from 60 to 90 years was determined using fasting plasma glucose as a screening test. A questionnaire survey {{on the history}} of diabetes and related complications was performed. The results showed that 10. 7 % had already been diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. Screening revealed a further 5 % who had diabetes mellitus but were asymptomatic. The {{prevalence of}} <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> was 15 % (95 % confidence interval 9 - 21) among the 60 - to 80 -year-old age group and 17 % confidence interval (3 to 30) in those older than 80 years. Obesity and advancing age were adverse risk factors associated with diabetes. The diabetic subjects had significantly more coronary and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, hypertension, and adverse lipid profiles. Even in the non-diabetic elderly subjects, fasting blood glucose was positively correlated with body weight and body mass index, confirming the importance in the aetiology of <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus.</b> This is a common disease in the elderly and is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether there was}} an association between smoking and nephropathy in patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> enrolled in the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes Trial. Sixty-one {{percent of the patients}} were smokers; 26 % had microalbuminuria, and 14 % had overt nephropathy. There was a univariate association between diabetic nephropathy and gender, smoking status, duration of diabetes, hypertension, glycosylated hemoglobin level, creatinine level, body mass index, and cholesterol level. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated an independent association between smoking and diabetic nephropathy (odds ratio 1. 61; 95 % confidence interval 1. 01, 2. 58). These findings may have important implications for patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> who smoke...|$|E
40|$|Independently of {{the amount}} of adipose tissue, certain {{patterns}} of fat distribution increase the risk of <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes.</b> Although the ratio of waist to hip (WHR) circumferences has been consistently related to <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus,</b> it is possible that only two measures do not completely characterize fat topography. The current study, therefore, examines the cross-sectional relation of six girths (waist, hip, neck, bust, wrist, and ankle) to <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> in 43, 595 women. As compared with non-diabetics, Quetelet index (kg/m 2) and all circumferences were elevated among diabetics. Stratified analyses showed that WHR, and waist, neck, and bust girths were consistently related to diabetes independently of the degree of overweight. As estimated from a logistic regression model that simultaneously controlled for age and all anthropometric variables, the prevalence of <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> was positively related to Quetelet index, and to the waist, bust, and neck girths, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 6. However, diabetes was inversely related to hip (OR = 0. 61) and ankle (OR = 0. 73) girths; p less than 0. 005 for each association. Although cross-sectional in nature, these results suggest that an adverse body fat distribution {{is not limited to the}} abdominal region, but that a relative preponderance of adipose tissue in various regions of the upper body is associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> in women...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{clinofibrate}} on serum lipoprotein concentrations, leci-thin cholesterol acyl transferase activity and atherogenic index were studied in 10 <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> patients. The patients comprised five with well-controlled <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes,</b> and five with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes; six non-insulin-depend-ent diabetics acted as placebo controls. No adverse side-effects were reported {{and there were}} no significant changes in total cholesterol, triglyceride or high-density lipoprotein 3 -cholesterol concentrations following 600 mglkg clinofibrate treatment for 4 weeks in either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetics. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activity were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased by clinofi-brate treatment in insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent dia-betics and high-density lipoprotein 2 -cholesterol concentrations were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased by dinofibrate in insulin-dependent diabetics. The atherogenic index was significantly (P<O. OI) reduced in non-insulin-dependent diabetics. It is suggested that the enhanced plasma lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activity following dinofi-brate therapy is the result of increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein 2 -cholesterol concentrations and may {{play a central role in}} the efficacy of clinoflbrate.

40|$|The {{incidence}} and prevalence of insulin-dependent (Type 1) <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> (IDDM) in populations are both well defined. In the more prevalent <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> (Type 2) <b>diabetes</b> <b>mellitus</b> (NIDDM), {{which is responsible}} for the bulk of diabetes-related morbidity, true prevalence is uncertain because of delayed diagnosis and problems of definition, particularly with increasing age. Estimates therefore vary widely. We have previously presented evidence of increased relative probability of hospital admission for people with diabetes. These absolute and relative rates of admission were based on a large scale community-derived prevalence for diabetes of 1. 36 [*]%. Assuming that the true prevalence of diabetes is higher, recalculation of activity data in a sensitivity analysis suggests a theoretical maximum prevalence of diabetes of 5 [*]% in our population, since a higher value would imply less morbidity associated with diabetes than ‘non-diabetes’. This approach identifies the possible range of unascertained diabetes in a population and defines it in functional terms as that state carrying any excess risk of admission for complications when compared to non-diabetes. Higher estimates of prevalence have little impact on the calculation of overall resource use for diabetes, since the great majority of costs are related to fixed hospital activity for people with identified diabetes. The unascertained diabetes sub-group will cost little by comparison. Paradoxically, the tendency to use higher estimates of unascertained diabetes increases the denominator for calculation of complication rates and reduces both the absolute and relative risk of complications. This dilutes the epidemiological significance of diabetes in the aetiology of its related complications...|$|R
