5|$|Arsenal {{were the}} reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 1990–91. The team had only lost one match in their {{successful}} league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991. Arsenal's opponents Wrexham had finished {{bottom of the}} entire Football League the previous season. In <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances</b> this meant the club would have been relegated to the Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition {{in time for the}} 1991–92 season meant there was to be no demotion.|$|E

The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E

Each time, the reigning champion left CMLL without losing a match and the championship to whichever successor CMLL picked. Under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> wrestlers give notice, or their contract is not renewed, and the championship transitions to a different wrestler. In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired from the company while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.|$|E
50|$|On June 18, 2014, Meredith {{announced}} that it would acquire WGGB from Gormally Broadcasting creating a duopoly with WSHM. Although FCC broadcast ownership rules normally forbid same-market ownership of two of the four highest-rated television stations (based on monthly total-day ratings), which often constitute stations affiliated with the four major broadcast networks (the Springfield market has only three full-power television stations, too few to allow a duopoly in any <b>normal</b> <b>circumstance),</b> the deal is permissible under FCC rules which allow common ownership of full-power and low-power television stations (the respective class designations of WGGB and WSHM) in all markets. This sale was completed on October 31, 2014. Although WSHM and WGGB initially maintained separate facilities, WSHM was eventually consolidated into WGGB's studios in May 2015.|$|R
50|$|Later vacuum-chamber {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the unwinding of the reel uncovered pinholes in the insulation. That in itself would not have caused a major problem, because the ionosphere around the tether, under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstance,</b> was too rarefied to divert much of the current. However, the air trapped in the insulation changed that. As it bubbled out of the pinholes, the high voltage of the nearby tether, about 3500 volts, converted it into a plasma (in a way similar to the ignition of a fluorescent tube), a relatively dense one and therefore a much better conductor of electricity. This plasma diverted to the metal of the shuttle {{and from there to}} the ionospheric return circuit. That current was enough to melt the cable.|$|R

5|$|Club {{competitions}} between {{teams from}} different European countries can trace their origins {{as far back}} as 1897, when the Challenge Cup was created for clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who did not meet under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances.</b> The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, named after entrepreneur and sportsman Thomas Lipton, was established in 1909 and was contested between clubs from Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland; the competition lasted for two years. The earliest attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club FC Servette. Founded in 1930, the Coupe des Nations featured clubs of ten major European football leagues and was deemed a success. Due to financial reasons, the competition was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, Takemitsu {{began to make}} use of {{traditional}} Japanese instruments in his music, and even took up playing the biwa—an instrument he used in his score for the film Seppuku (1962). In 1967, Takemitsu received a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, to commemorate the orchestra's 125th anniversary, for which he wrote November Steps for biwa, shakuhachi, and orchestra. Initially, Takemitsu had great difficulty in uniting these instruments from such different musical cultures in one work. Eclipse for biwa and shakuhachi (1966) illustrates Takemitsu's attempts to find a viable notational system for these instruments, which in <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances</b> neither sound together nor are used in works notated in any system of Western staff notation.|$|E
50|$|On June 18, 2014, the Meredith Corporation (owner of WFSB in Hartford) {{announced}} that it would acquire WGGB creating a duopoly with low-powered CBS affiliate WSHM-LD.

40|$|As {{the most}} {{important}} formal semantic model, labeled transition systems are widely used, which can describe the general concurrent systems or control systems without disturbance. However, under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstance,</b> transition systems are complex and difficult to use due to large amount of calculation and the state space explosion problems. In order to overcome these problems, approximate equivalent labeled transition systems are proposed by means of incomplete low-up matrix decomposition factorization. This technique can reduce the complexity of computation and calculate under the allowing errors. As for continuous-time linear systems, we develop a modeling method of approximated transition system based on the approximate solution of matrix, which provides a facility for approximately formal semantic modeling for linear systems and to effectively analyze errors. An example of application {{in the context of}} linear systems without disturbances is studied...|$|R

5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E

A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances</b> increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
50|$|The Metropolitan lines {{platforms}} one to {{four were}} largely {{the result of the}} stations rebuild in the 1920s to cater for the increase in traffic on its outer suburban routes. Today the basic layout remains the same with platforms two and three being through tracks for City services to Aldgate from Amersham, Chesham and Uxbridge flanked by terminal platforms one and four which are the domain of services to and from Watford. The northern end of the platforms is in a trench being surrounded by Chiltern Court and Selbie House the latter of which houses Baker Street control centre responsible for signalling the Metropolitan line from Preston Road to Aldgate, as well as the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines between Baker Street and Aldgate. All Metropolitan line platforms can function as terminating tracks however under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstance</b> only dead ended platforms one and four are used as such.|$|R
40|$|Cell {{turnover}} time varies from one tissue to another but is reproducible as a hereditary character-istic {{for a given}} cell line.

In <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances</b> this prestigious post would have been an unthinkable appointment for a young and inexperienced conductor, but the leading German conductors such as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Clemens Krauss and Herbert von Karajan were prohibited from conducting pending the conclusion of denazification proceedings against them. Under Solti's direction, the company rebuilt its repertoire and began to recover its pre-war eminence. He benefited from the encouragement of the elderly Richard Strauss, in whose presence he conducted Der Rosenkavalier. Strauss was reluctant to discuss his own music with Solti, but gave him advice about conducting.|$|E
5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long distances and many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and rate of movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E

In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under <b>normal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E
