5|$|The FEPP {{conducted}} a survey in 2001 which revealed that online monitoring software, including <b>Net</b> <b>Nanny,</b> SurfWatch, and Cybersitter, cast too broad a net and often blocked legitimate educational websites {{in their attempts to}} censor material from youths. In 2003, the organization assisted 33 academics in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted the sale of violent video games to minors. In coordination with the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP released a public policy report in 2006 on the inefficiency of Internet filtering; the report concluded that freedom of expression was harmed by such online censorship activity. In 2007, the FEPP became an independent organization.|$|E

5000|$|The {{site has}} {{conducted}} long battles against {{the most commonly}} used filter programs, including, most famously, <b>Net</b> <b>Nanny,</b> CyberPatrol, and Bess. [...] "In particular, Peacefire has demonstrated that the filter programs suppress political speech and filter preferentially for corporate and conservative causes. In other cases, Peacefire has presented evidence that several filtering programs block some websites without having a human being review those sites first, despite the filtering companies' claims to the contrary. However, Peacefire is not usually active against filters that act in a more neutral way.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} version of <b>Net</b> <b>Nanny</b> {{was released in}} 1995. It was developed, created and branded by Gordon Ross in mid 1994 after viewing a sting operation on a pedophile soliciting {{a child in a}} chat room, which led Ross to believe that society would need an internet protecting service in the new age of the internet. The software was designed as a means to keep families and individuals relatively safe when surfing the net, but more importantly it was designed so freedom of speech and choice would be kept alive on the internet. Late 2002 it was sold to BioNet Systems who in turn sold it to Looksmart technologies in April 2004. In January 2007, it was purchased by ContentWatch, Inc.|$|E
30|$|Since manual {{tracking}} is a labour intensive activity, software that implements parental controls may help. But {{this needs to}} be installed and appropriately configured on all devices. Some software even claims to flag potential predators alongside cyber-bullies. For example, <b>Net</b> <b>Nanny</b> [27] claims to have an “anti-predator phrase list”, perhaps similar to that of ContentBarrier [28] which apparently flags on phrases such as: “are you alone”; “believe me”; “can i see you”; “can we meet”; “come alone”. Of course, such a detection approach will only work if predators use these phrases specifically. Also, not every parent is sufficiently technologically knowledgeable to use the right software to prevent predators from gaining access to their childj and one would have to wonder about responsibility and legal liability in the event that a predator is not detected despite such software being deployed.|$|E
40|$|Since the Internet came to {{the fore}} of public {{attention}} around 1994, Americans have been obsessed with the scourge of easily accessed online pornography, violence, and hate speech. Newspaper and magazine articles have fed this fear with titillating stories about pornographic web sites, hate groups, and online sexual predators (Turow, 1999). This perceived abundance of harmful material, has led Congress to pass two laws, the Communications Decency Act (CDA), and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) aimed at criminalizing Internet content deemed harmful to minors. In conjunction with these legislative solutions, the software industry has developed its own technological solution, namely content filtering software such as Cyber Patrol, SurfWatch, <b>Net</b> <b>Nanny,</b> etc. Supporters of filtering software claim that such products are effective because they block access to the majority of "objectionable" Internet content, while also being First Amendment friendly because they do not block access to benign material that children should have access to. The goal of this project is twofold, (1. to provide concrete evidence of jus...|$|E
40|$|The {{perceived}} {{problem of}} objectionable {{material on the}} Internet, particularly pornography, child pornography, and hate speech has perplexed governments, the Internet content industry, civil liberties groups, and parents since the Internet {{came to the fore}} of public attention around 1994. Each of these groups have ventured different “solutions ” geared at protecting children from what Presidential candidate Al Gore calls the “free-fire zones and red light districts of cyberspace (1999). ” Many governments, most notably the U. S. and Australia have attempted to pass legislation criminalizing and limiting access to such material. These government actions have led to vocal opposition from the Internet industry and civil libertarians alike. Both fear the prospect of government enforced censorship; civil libertarians for its effects on democratic free speech, and industry for it effects on the free market. As such, both groups call for self-regulation of Internet content, although they differ as to who “self ” might be, and how “regulation ” should be operationalized. On the one hand, the Internet industry has aggressively pushed technological self-regulatory solutions. They point to the use of content filtering software and rating systems as an unobtrusive and empowering way for parents to limit access to material they deem offensive. To this end, several commercial software packages including Cyber Patrol, <b>Net</b> <b>Nanny,</b> and SurfWatch which block acces...|$|E
40|$|The biggest {{publishing}} news {{just now}} related to Tiananmen’s 20 th anniversary is {{the release of}} Zhao Ziyang’s memoirs, a book that was apparently already being offered for sale in Hong Kong even before its official publication date and has been reviewed, excerpted, and discussed in various newspapers and magazines. We may at some point do an “In Case You Missed It” review of Prisoner of the State(or deal with it extensively in another fashion), but we weren’t {{able to do a}} “Coming Distractions” piece about it for a simple reason: we weren’t sent an advance copy. * What we can do at this point is offer up a top 5 list, which directs readers {{to some of the most}} interesting things that others have been saying about the book, based either on reading it or in some cases simply ruminating on its appearance and how reports related to it have been making their way into or been kept out of China. Here are five things worth reading: 1. This blog post by Evan Osnos reflecting on the fact that this isn’t the first timethat efforts by the Chinese authorities to keep someone silent have failed, even if in the case of this book it is appearing posthumously. 2. This smart piece by Geoff Dyer and Jamil Anderlini of the Financial Times that sums up many key points about Zhao and the book and includes some telling quotes. 3. Peking Duck on the ability, at least for a time, for Internet users in the PRC to access excerpts from the book in audio form, with an allusion to the role of tweets in spreading word of this possibility. Or go to Jeremy Goldkorn’s post on this same phenomenon as evidence that “China’s <b>Net</b> <b>Nanny</b> moves in mysterious ways,” a good line. 4. Speaking of turns of phrase, Perry Link’s Washington Post review of Zhao’s memoir ends with a striking one. In trying to capture the complexities of a situation in which there is often great discontent and yet the government stays in power, he writes that: “The seal continues to straddle the ball — insecure as ever, but still definitely on top. ” (This sort of zoological analogy for a political situation may remind regular readers of Link’s best known New York Review of Bookscommentaries, which was about the complex workings of censorship and self-censorship and was called “China: The Anaconda in the Chandelier. ”) 5. China Digital Times with a typically good set of excerpts from reviews and other coverage. * Note to any publishers, authors, or agents who follow this blog: feel free to send advance copies of works that might interest our readers to China Beat c/o History Department, 200 Krieger Hall, University of California-Irvine, as they might end up the focus of a “Coming Distractions” post...|$|E
