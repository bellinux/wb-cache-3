40|$|Whether hESC-derived neurons {{can fully}} {{integrate}} with and functionally regulate an existing neural network remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that hESC-derived neurons receive unitary postsynaptic currents both in vitro and in vivo and adopt the rhythmic firing behavior of mouse cortical networks via synaptic integration. Optical stimulation of hESC-derived neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin- 2 elicited both inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents and triggered network bursting in mouse neurons. Furthermore, light stimulation of hESC-derived neurons transplanted to the hippocampus of adult mice triggered postsynaptic currents in host pyramidal neurons in acute slice preparations. Thus, hESC-derived neurons {{can participate in}} and modulate neural network activity through functional synaptic integration, suggesting {{they are capable of}} contributing to <b>neural</b> network <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> both in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Although certain neurophysiological {{functions}} of the amygdala complex in learning seem well established, {{the purpose of this}} review is to propose that an additional conceptualization of amygdala function is now needed. The research we review provides evidence that a subsystem within the amygdala provides a coordinated regulation of attentional processes.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{terms of}} <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> model, {{learning}} represents {{the process of}} gathering information, and organizing it into mental schemata. Information-processing theory has definite educational implications {{for students with learning}} and behavior problems. Teachers with a greater understanding of the theory and how it is formed to, select learning strategies in order to improve the retention and retrieval of learning. But it must also be taken into consideration that the learning environment has specific effects on academic achievement. Socialization alters the levels of stress, confidence, and even the content knowledge. Social support provides encouragement, stress reduction, feedback, and communication factors which enable learning. Furthermore, an evaluation of 4 learning strategies attempted via a well-formed LVQ <b>Neural</b> Network.

This article reviews recent advances in a key area: <b>neural</b> coding and <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> It is shown that synapses are capable of supporting computations based on highly structured temporal codes. Such codes could provide a substrate for unambiguous representations of complex stimuli and be used to solve difficult cognitive tasks, such as the binding problem. Unsupervised learning rules could generate the circuitry required for precise temporal codes.

30|$|The basic <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> {{units of}} the neuro-symbolic network are {{so-called}} neuro-symbols. To use neuro-symbols as elementary <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> units came from the following observation: in the brain, information is processed by neurons. However, humans do not {{think in terms of}} firing nerve cells but in terms of symbols. In perception, these symbols are perceptual images like a face, a person, a melody, a voice, and so forth. <b>Neural</b> and symbolic <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> can be seen as <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> in the brain on two different levels of abstraction. Nevertheless, there seems to exist a correlation between these two levels. Actually, there have been found neurons in the brain which react for instance exclusively if a face is perceived in the environment [30 â 32]. This fact can be seen as evidence for such a correlation and was the motivation for using neuro-symbols as basic <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> units. Neuro-symbols show certain characteristics of neurons and others of symbols. Analyses of structures in the human mind have shown that certain characteristics and mechanisms are repeated on different levels, for example, afference and efference. This repetition of characteristics is a key element to the concept of neuro-symbolic processing.|$|R
40|$|International audienceArtificial Neural Networks {{are very}} {{efficient}} adaptive models {{but one of}} their recognized weaknesses is about information representation, often carried out in an input vector without a structure. Beyond the classical elaboration of a hierarchical representation {{in a series of}} layers, we report here inspiration from neuroscience and argue for the design of heterogenous <b>neural</b> networks, <b>processing</b> <b>information</b> at feature, configuration and history levels of granularity, and interacting very efficiently for high-level and complex decision making. This framework is built from known characteristics of the sensory cortex, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex and is exemplified here in the case of pavlovian conditioning, but we propose that it can be advantageously applied in a wider extent, to design flexible and versatile <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> with neuronal computation...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{will provide}} evidence for a novel principle of neural computation. This principle is widely known {{in the field of}} electrical engineering as maximal-ratio combining. Given two noisy copies of a signal, maximal-ratio combining constructs a single signal with the optimally achievable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). I will show that this principle holds for a neural circuit in the mammalian retina. Furthermore, I will provide evidence, based on data from other investigators, that this principle holds for other neural circuits, including circuits in the mammalian brain. Maximal-ratio combining improves the reliability of <b>neural</b> signals. Optimal <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> in <b>neural</b> circuits has been postulated as a guiding principle for neural processing, but direct experimental evidence is extremely rare. ...|$|R
30|$|BP <b>neural</b> networkâs <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> {{capacity}} {{is determined by}} the input and output neuronsâ characteristics, the network structure, and the connection weights. The complexity of the neural network structure affects the performance of the neural network. In [6], a hybrid STLF method is proposed based on the improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition (IEEMD) and BP neural network. The remaining IMFs and residual are forecast by BPNN, and then, the forecasting results of each component are combined with BPNN to obtain the final predicted load series. In order to devise bus lines and make daily scheduling more precisely [7], back propagation (BP) neural network to predict bus traffic is used. As the time factor and meteorological factor are the two important factors which affect traffic, they did the data preprocessing for bus data in Guangzhou from August to December in 2014 and conducted several experiments to determine the network structure and parameters which are suitable for prediction of bus traffic. Through tenfold cross-validation experiments, the model is demonstrated being able to apply to bus traffic forecast.|$|R

40|$|Forecasting {{has long}} been the domain of {{traditional}} statistical models. Recent research has shown that novel and complex forecasting models do not necessarily outperform simpler models.

Artificial <b>neural</b> networks are <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> paradigms motivated by the <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> functions of the human brain.
