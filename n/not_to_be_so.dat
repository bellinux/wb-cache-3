5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> severe.|$|E

Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned out <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so,</b> and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.|$|E

The day after her arrival, the Emperor Jagang assaults the Confessor's Palace but is bloodily repulsed. Emperor Jagang is severely injured in the action. Even worse for the Order, their enemy unleashes an ancient magic on the main army, wreaking immense destruction. Jennsen reacts by making a pact with a dark force, the Keeper, to kill Richard in return for her surrender and obedience.|$|E

500|$|Manga artist Kaori Yuki's earlier, related short manga [...] "Psycho Knocker" [...] {{appeared}} in the October 2004 issues of the Japanese shōjo (targeted towards girls) manga magazine Hana to Yume published twice a month. It focuses on a pessimistic, heartbroken teenager who makes a pact with a lonely ghost, unknowningly exchanging her life for two wishes. Chasing down spirits that have escaped from the demon door, Raven and Tokage rescue her from the ghost, a young girl who died suddenly, and seal a spirit which feeds on negative emotions. Yuki wrote the story as a reminder to herself <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> pessimistic, a trait she shares with the teenage protagonist.|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky {{planned to}} have a strong {{presentation}} of the thematic movement from darkness into light. He originally sought to show only a silhouette of the man until the second of the film's three acts, but he chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> extreme, wanting to be more communicative to the audience. The movement was presented less aggressively in the film; Jackman's characters are seen in silhouette at the beginning, kept out of key light. In each of the three periods, the lighting on Jackman's characters is initially dim and gradually grows brighter as the storylines unfold. Meanwhile, Weisz's characters are frequently awash with light in the storylines. Libatique described the metaphoric change of the lighting on Jackman's characters, [...] "We follow the arc of the Thomas character as he gets {{closer and closer to the}} truth." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stan herself, Șerban Cazan, LeAnna James, and Naz Tokio; the {{production}} was made by Cazan. It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> hard on her, and if he really loves her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't you be so hard on me / If you love me, come and give me your everything".|$|E
500|$|Kempelen would {{inform the}} player that the Turk {{would use the}} white pieces and have the first move. Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it {{threatened}} its opponent's queen, and three times upon placing the king in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent's move. Louis Dutens, a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine [...] "by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her". Kempelen {{made it a point}} to traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and lodestones to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian courtier at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We want {{to create a sense of}} control and largely centered frames with Clive’s character, and we want to have movement with Denzel’s.' Having three operators on the same character, I’d watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> steady. It was the first time I’d worked with so many operators where I wasn’t one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Lloyd travelled to New York {{where she}} re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song {{was about a}} young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, [...] "Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers", proved hilarious; The Era observed that the line [...] "tickled the audience immensely". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but turned out <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so.</b> The Era described the character as being [...] "not so demure as she looked, for she confided to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'." [...] Many other songs followed and were all warmly received. [...] At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures. [...] The Era commented that [...] "Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success". [...] After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in Peckham in a production of Dick Whittington in which she played the title role. In it, she sang [...] "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being [...] "one of the pantomime songs of the year". The Music Hall and Theatre Review was equally complimentary, saying: [...] "Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!" [...] During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in Dick Whittington. [...] The entertainment culminated with a song from Vesta Victoria, and a short piece called The Squeaker, starring Joe Elvin.|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd George visited Haig at GHQ and {{afterwards}} wrote to Haig, {{to say that}} he had been impressed by his [...] "grip" [...] and by the [...] "trained thought of a great soldier". Subsequent relations between the two men were <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> cordial. Haig thought Lloyd George [...] "shifty and unreliable". Haig and Kiggell met Joffre and his chief of staff de Castelnau at Chantilly (14 February). Haig thought that politicians and the public might misunderstand a long period of attrition and thought that only a fortnight of [...] "wearing out", not three months as Joffre had originally wanted, would be needed before the decisive offensive. Arguments continued over the British taking over more front line from the French. Haig had thought that the German troops reported near Verdun were a feint prior to an attack on the British but the Verdun Offensive began on 21 February.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the label}} is usually applied in {{anticipation}} of the tournament rather than in retrospect.

David Lacey said, [...] "Draws may nominate a group of death but results decide its real mortality rating. [...] France and Argentina found this out in Japan." [...] Lacey also said, [...] "There are groups of death and groups of death wishes. In Euro 2000 Group D looked daunting but was shrugged aside by the Netherlands, the co-hosts, and France, the eventual champions, with the Czechs, runners-up in 1996, and the Danes, winners in 1992, offering scant resistance. Group A {{turned out to be the}} killer." ...|$|E

These are interspersed with shots of Del Rey singing, which she filmed herself using a webcam. When asked if she would change anything about the video's production, Del Rey stated, [...] "Had I known {{so many people were}} going to watch the video, I'd have put some more effort into it. I would have got my hair and make-up done and tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> pouty, seeing as everyone talks about my face all the time. And I'd have put more of a storyline into it."

2500|$|As {{the church}} began to collide and meld with {{cultures}} outside of Utah and the United States, the church began to jettison {{some of the}} parochialisms and prejudices that had become part of Latter-day Saint culture, but were not essential to Mormonism. In 1971, LDS General Authority and scholar Bruce R. McConkie drew parallels between the LDS Church and the New Testament church, who had difficulty embracing the Gentiles within Christianity, and encouraged members <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> indoctrinated with social customs that they fail to engage other cultures in Mormonism. Other peoples, he stated, [...] "have a different background than we have, which is of no moment to the Lord.... It is no different to have different social customs {{than it is to}} have different languages.... And the Lord knows all languages". In 1987, Boyd K. Packer, another Latter-day Saint Apostle, stated, [...] "We can't move [...] with a 1947 Utah Church! Could it be that we are not prepared to take the gospel because we are not prepared to take (and they are not prepared to receive) all of the things we have wrapped up with it as extra baggage?" [...] During and after the Civil Rights Movement, the church faced a critical point in its history, where its previous attitudes toward other cultures and people of color, which had once been shared by much of the white American mainstream, began to appear racist and neocolonial. The church came under intense fire for its stances on blacks and Native Americans issues.|$|E
