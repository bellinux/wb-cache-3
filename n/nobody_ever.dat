25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E

500|$|Kahn {{had already}} thought deeply {{about the proper}} design for a library, having earlier {{submitted}} proposals for a new library at Washington University. [...] He also expressed a deep reverence for books, saying, [...] "A book is tremendously important. [...] <b>Nobody</b> <b>ever</b> paid {{the price of a}} book, they only paid for the printing". Describing the book as an offering, Kahn said, [...] "How precious a book is in light of the offering, in light of the one who has the privilege of the offering.

500|$|Bush {{wanted the}} {{institute}} {{to concentrate on}} hard science. He gutted Carnegie's archeology program, setting the field back {{many years in the}} United States. He saw little value in the humanities and social sciences, and slashed funding for Isis, a journal dedicated to the history of science and technology and its cultural influence. Bush later explained that [...] "I have a great reservation about these studies where somebody goes out and interviews a bunch of people and reads a lot of stuff and writes a book and puts it on a shelf and <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> reads it." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] boat {{journey to}} South Georgia, {{described}} by polar historian Caroline Alexander {{as one of}} the most extraordinary feats of seamanship and navigation in recorded history, took 17days through gales and snow squalls, in seas which the [...] navigator, Frank Worsley, described as a [...] "mountainous westerly swell". After setting off on 24 April 1916 [...] with just the barest navigational equipment, they reached South Georgia on 10 May 1916. Shackleton, in his later account of the journey, recalled Crean's tuneless singing at the tiller: [...] "He always sang when he was steering, and <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> discovered what the song was... but somehow it was cheerful".|$|E
40|$|How is it {{possible}} to justify a lengthy review of the physics of the magnetic monopole when <b>nobody</b> has <b>ever</b> seen one? In spite of the unfortunate lack of favorable experimental evidence, there are sound theoretical reasons for believing that the magnetic monopole must exist. The case for its existence is surely as strong as the case for any other undiscovered particle. Moreover, as of this writing (early 1984), it is not certain that <b>nobody</b> has <b>ever</b> seen one. What seems certain is that <b>nobody</b> has <b>ever</b> seen two...|$|R

500|$|Disruptor was {{released}} to positive critical reception, {{and was named}} [...] "Dark Horse of the Year" [...] by various gaming publications. John Romero, founder of Doom developer id Software praised the game. Insomniac considered Disruptor a lesson about video game development. According to Price, it was [...] "the best game that <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> heard of". With little marketing and advertisement, the game was a commercial failure for Insomniac and the company almost went bankrupt. Sales of Disruptor {{failed to meet the}} team's expectations. Despite the game's poor performance, Universal continued to partner with Insomniac for its next game. The team's morale was low; they decided to develop something new instead of a sequel to Disruptor.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 1962 Palewski was {{appointed}} a minister in Georges Pompidou's government, {{and returned to}} Paris. This did not mean more regular or frequent meetings, and the affair with Mitford continued at arm's length. [...] In April 1963 Mitford was in England for the wedding of her cousin Angus Ogilvy to Princess Alexandra. A month later she was back for the funeral of her mother, Lady Redesdale, who died on 25 May. Mitford's friends were dying, too, [...] "in middle age", she informed her long-time friend Violet Hammersley. The premature deaths included that of Evelyn Waugh, who died on 10 April 1966. Mitford [...] saw the kindness and humour concealed behind his hostile public image, and said after his death: [...] "What <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> remembers about Evelyn is everything with him was jokes. Everything". Thompson calls their relationship [...] "one of the great literary friendships of the twentieth century".|$|E
500|$|The MGM moguls {{were careful}} {{to protect their}} {{contract}} big stars from controversy, and Tracy wished to conceal his relationship with Hepburn from his wife, so it was hidden from the public. The couple did not live together until {{the final years of}} Tracy's life, when they shared a cottage on George Cukor's estate in Beverly Hills. In Hollywood, however, the intimate nature of the Tracy-Hepburn partnership was an open secret. Angela Lansbury, who worked with the pair on State of the Union, later said: [...] "We all knew, but <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> said anything. In those days it wasn't discussed." [...] Tracy was not someone to express his emotions, but friend Betsy Drake believed he [...] "was utterly dependent upon Hepburn." [...] Tracy's infidelity apparently continued, however, and he is reported to have had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of Plymouth Adventure in 1952.|$|E

500|$|An inquest into Shaw's death {{commenced}} in Exeter {{shortly after}} her death was reported to the coroner. The inquest heard evidence in late 2009, among which was eyewitness testimony that the team manager, a teacher from Edgehill College, had met with the group the morning of Shaw's death. During the meeting, the group asked to end the training hike early, but they were instructed by the teacher to carry on. However, the group's navigator gave evidence that she and Shaw had been happy to continue the expedition. The possibility was also raised by other group members that the group was under-prepared for the conditions they faced. The group member whose bag Shaw had been attempting to throw across the stream told the coroner [...] "We were not told how to cross swollen rivers. We were told how to check how deep it was but we were never told how to cross them. <b>Nobody</b> <b>ever</b> talked to us about using ropes".|$|E
500|$|... "I'm With Cupid" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. Because they knew it would air on Valentine's Day, Fox asked the Simpsons staff to produce an episode related to the holiday. The episode's ending credits were also painted red {{in honor of the}} holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney, who also wrote the episode's first draft. The episode's title was pitched by fellow Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who based it on the popular T-shirt slogan I'm with stupid. However, Hauge later found out that the title had already been used before for an episode of another television series. However, he did not believe that copyright issues would arise: [...] "It's a very innocent mistake," [...] Hauge said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It {{is one of those things}} that, in the course of a career, you're gonna be on both sides of that, so <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> sues on it." ...|$|E

I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. <b>Nobody</b> <b>ever</b> brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E

500|$|Anna Rosmus {{received}} the 1994 award, {{in honor of}} work related to her research on the Nazi past of her hometown in Bavaria. [...] Rosmus researched anti-Semitism, and opposed neo-Nazis and the extreme right in Germany. [...] She also located and published artwork of Jews that had once lived {{in her hometown of}} Passau, Germany. [...] As a result of her work, Rosmus endured threats against her life. In a 1996 Yom HaShoah ceremony, Rosmus recounted threats she faced after conducting her research: [...] "Once-friendly neighbors threatened me openly - on the telephone, in person, in letters ... They threatened to kill me and kidnap my children. Some even attacked me physically, a room where I was to speak in Munich was bombed just before I was to be there, and several times I was sued. <b>Nobody</b> <b>ever</b> claimed I had said anything false or made mistakes. They just claimed all this would damage their reputations." [...] Rosmus was profiled on 60 Minutes, and her story was the subject of the 1990 West German drama film, The Nasty Girl. Rosmus was presented with the Conscience-in-Media Award in a special ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|E
500|$|Boston Globe {{sports editor}} Jason Nason campaigned for Joss' {{induction}} into the Hall of Fame {{starting in the}} 1950s. Sportswriter Red Smith wrote in 1970 in support of Joss. [...] "Could you write a history of baseball without mentioning Joss? <b>Nobody</b> <b>ever</b> has. That {{ought to be the}} measure of a man's fitness for the Hall of Fame, the only measure." [...] However, Warren Giles, then-chairman of the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee, pointed out to baseball historian Bob Broeg in 1972 that induction to the Hall required [...] "participation in ten championship seasons." [...] Joss had been on the Cleveland roster in 1911 and participated in spring training, falling ill just before regular season play commenced. Hence it was argued he had [...] "participated" [...] in the 1911 season, his tenth. The Hall's Board of Directors waived the eligibility requirements for Joss. Joe Reichler, a member of the Commissioner's office, worked to allow Joss to become eligible for the Hall and succeeded in 1977. Joss was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. He is the only player in the Hall of Fame whose regular season playing career lasted fewer than ten years.|$|E

[...] When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words [...] "Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!" [...] (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton [...] "thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy." [...] Michael Starr remembered, [...] "That was the most fantastic election... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where <b>nobody</b> <b>ever</b> saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed... The halls would be filled with people and {{sitting there in the}} front would be the first Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces... I don't care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on." ...|$|E
