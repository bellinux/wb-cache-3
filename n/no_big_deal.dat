40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} if “Big Deal” journal subscription packages are a cost-effective {{way to provide}} electronic journal access to academic library users versus individual subscriptions, pay-per-view, and interlibrary loans (ILL). Design – Cost-per-article-use analysis. Setting – Public research university in the United States of America. Subjects – Cost-per-use data from 1) journals in seven <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages, 2) individually subscribed journals, 3) pay-per-view from publishers’ websites, and 4) interlibrary loans. Methods – The authors determined cost-per-use for <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> titles by utilizing COUNTER JR 1 metric Successful Full-Text Article Request (SFTAR) reports. Individual journal subscription cost-per-use data were obtained from individual publishers or platforms. Pay-per-view cost was determined by recording the price listed on publishers’ websites. ILL cost-per-use was established by reviewing cost-per-article obtained from libraries outside of reciprocal borrowing agreement networks. With the exception of pay-per-view numbers, title cost-per-use was averaged {{over a three-year period}} from 2010 through 2012. Main Results – Cost-per-article use for journals from <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> varied from 2. 11 to 9. 42. For individually subscribed journals, the average cost-per-article ranged from 0. 25 to 84. 00. Pay-per-view charges ranged from 15. 00 to 80. 00, with an average cost of 37. 72.
