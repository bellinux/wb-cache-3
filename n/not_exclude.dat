Although this does <b>not</b> <b>exclude</b> the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|Finnish–Estonian {{relations}} were closest diplomatically after the Estonian Freedom War in the 1920s, but cooled afterwards. Military relations however remained close. From the Finnish point of view, the close relations with Estonia did <b>not</b> <b>exclude</b> the Scandinavian neutrality policy. Nevertheless, the military {{relations were}} top secret, and the countries held joint military exercises. The central {{aim was to}} prevent the Soviet Baltic Fleet from freely using its strength in the Gulf of Finland against either country. Estonia also sought public security guarantees and signed the Baltic Entente in 1934 with Latvia and Lithuania.|$|E

The upper limit on emissions within 100AU of this star is about 850mJy, at a wavelength of 850μm. This limits the total mass of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass.

5|$|Matthias {{participated in}} the lengthy Palm Sunday {{ceremony}} in Vienna in 1490, although he had felt so ill that morning {{that he could not}} eat breakfast. Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and suddenly felt faint. The next day he was unable to speak. After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April. According to Professor Frigyes Korányi, Matthias died of a stroke; Dr. Herwig Egert does <b>not</b> <b>exclude</b> the possibility of poisoning. Matthias's funeral was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and he was buried in Székesfehérvár Cathedral on 24 or 25 April 1490.|$|E
5|$|The dentary superficially {{resembles that}} of various other {{mammalian}} groups with enlarged incisors, such as rodents, lagomorphs, hyraxes, wombats, the aye-aye, and the extinct apatemyids, tillodonts, and taeniodontsall of which are known only from the Cenozoic, less than 66 million years ago. Krause and colleagues could <b>not</b> <b>exclude</b> the possibility that TNM02067 represents an early member of such a group or an otherwise unknown major group of mammals. However, only two groups of Mesozoic mammals resemble TNM02067: gondwanatheres; and multituberculates in the superfamilies Djadochtatherioidea and Taeniolabidoidea. Djadochtatherioids and taeniolabidoids occur in the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of the northern continents (Laurasia), and gondwanatheres, an enigmatic group of uncertain evolutionary affinities, are known from the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of Gondwana, with forms such as Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica (both from Argentina), Lavanify (Madagascar), and Bharattherium (India).|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does <b>not</b> <b>exclude</b> the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April 1960, Heffron {{attempted}} {{to send the}} bill back to the council, which returned it to the assembly on the same grounds as before. As {{a result of the}} deadlock, Heffron requested the Governor to order a joint session of parliament on 20 April, a session which lasted two hours and was boycotted by the opposition. On 12 May the Assembly resolved that the bill be submitted for a referendum. However, later that day the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council, Hector Clayton, started legal action against the government on the grounds that under section 5B of the NSW Constitution, the council had neither voted nor deliberated on the bill and thus the bill could not be submitted for a referendum. In the case of Clayton v. Heffron (1960) a majority of the full bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (headed by Chief Justice Evatt) found in favour of the government four to one {{on the grounds that they}} had complied fully with the intention of section 5B, while also denying the plaintiff leave to appeal to the High Court. The subsequent appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal was rejected by Chief Judge in Equity McLelland on 10 October. In a subsequent case to the High Court, Clayton argued that section 15 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which dealt with the process by which state parliaments filled senate vacancies, entrenched the requirement for such parliaments to be bicameral on account of its exclusive mention of both houses. This was rejected by the court that affirmed that the mention did <b>not</b> <b>exclude</b> the right of state parliaments to do as they saw fit regarding abolition or reform.|$|E
