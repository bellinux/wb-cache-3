50|$|In a <b>normal</b> <b>spin,</b> {{the wing}} {{on the inside}} of the turn is stalled while the outside wing remains flying; it is {{possible}} for both wings to be stalled but the angle of attack of each wing, and consequently its lift and drag, will be different. Either situation causes the aircraft to autorotate (yaw) toward the stalled wing due to its higher drag and loss of lift. Spins are characterized by high angle of attack, an airspeed below the stall on at least one wing and a shallow descent.Recovery may require a specific and counterintuitive set of actions in order to avoid a crash.|$|E
50|$|An {{airplane}} spin {{tends to}} flatten as it progresses because then its mass is distributed furthest from its center of rotation, as rotating objects tend to rotate about their axis of maximum rotational inertia. Aircraft have their maximum rotational inertia when spinning on their normal axis, i.e. flatly. In purpose-built aerobatic aircraft, spins may be intentionally flattened {{through the application}} of power and aileron within a <b>normal</b> <b>spin.</b> Rotation rates experienced are dramatic and can exceed 400 degrees per second in an attitude that may even have the nose above the horizon. Such maneuvers must be performed with the center of gravity in the normal range and with appropriate training, and consideration should be given to the extreme gyroscopic forces generated by the propeller and exerted on the crankshaft. The current Guinness world record for the number of consecutive inverted flat spins is 98, set by Spencer Suderman on March 20, 2016 flying an experimental variant of the Pitts S-1 designated the Sunbird S-1x. Suderman started from an altitude of 24,500 ft and recovered at 2000 ft.|$|E

The spindle air pressure direction was changed in both Z and S directions on the Z twist yarn of Ne 40 s Polyester/Cotton vortex yarn (50 : 50 polyester: cotton) and these yarns were then tested for their properties such as tensile, unevenness, and hairiness. It was found that unevenness was lower with <b>normal</b> <b>spinning</b> condition and increased when the spindle air pressure increased in both directions. Imperfections were also found to be minimum with <b>normal</b> <b>spinning</b> condition and increased with increase in spindle air pressure. The yarn tenacity and elongation at break found to be lower at <b>normal</b> <b>spinning</b> condition. When the spindle air pressure increased yarn tenacity and elongation at break also increased with increase in spindle air pressure. At the same time spindle air pressure {{in the same direction}} of basic yarn twist gave less increase in tenacity and elongation than opposite direction of basic yarn twist.

40|$|The beam <b>normal</b> single <b>spin</b> {{asymmetry}} {{generated in}} the scattering of transversely polarized electrons from unpolarized nucleons is an observable of the imaginary part of the two-photon exchange process. Moreover, it is a potential source of false asymmetry in parity violating electron scattering experiments. The Q{sub weak} experiment uses parity violating electron scattering to make a direct measurement of the weak charge of the proton. The targeted 4 % measurement of the weak charge of the proton probes for parity violating new physics beyond the Standard Model. The beam <b>normal</b> single <b>spin</b> asymmetry at Q{sub weak} kinematics is at least three orders of magnitude larger than 5 ppb precision of the parity violating asymmetry. To better understand this parity conserving background, the Q{sub weak} Collaboration has performed elastic scattering measurements with fully transversely polarized electron beam on the proton and aluminum.

50|$|When {{launched}} by the Ariane 4 the satellite would be mounted to a SPELDA adapter (a satellite payload carrier system), which is mounted {{on the top of}} the Ariane 4 rocket. A protective shroud or fairing covers the satellite and upper stage and protects it from aerodynamic forces (high speed air flow) during launch. The fairing is jettisoned when the rocket has reached the upper atmosphere and the aerodynamic forces are no longer significant. When the upper stage has finished firing and is coasting, the upper stage (and satellite) was spun up to 5 rpm prior to release of the satellite. This provides initial stability for the satellite after release from the rocket upper stage. The Ariane 4 put the Intelsat VI satellites directly into a transfer orbit. Ground commands would fire the apogee engines for circularizing of the initial orbit and stabilization at the desired geostationary orbital location. Ground commands would then also be used to command the satellite to spin up to its <b>normal</b> <b>spin</b> rate.|$|E

Some 0.5 GWe of diesels have at times been used to support the National Grid, whose peak load is about 60 GW. These are sets in the size range 200 kW to 2 MW.

40|$|Electronic {{states with}} {{fractional}} spins arise in systems with large static correlation (strongly correlated systems). Such fractional-spin states are {{shown to be}} ensembles of degenerate ground states with <b>normal</b> <b>spins.</b> It is proven here that {{the energy of the}} exact functional for fractional-spin states is a constant, equal to the energy of the comprising degenerate pure spin states. Dramatic deviations from this exact constancy condition exist with all approximate functionals, leading to large static correlation errors for strongly correlated systems, such as chemical bond dissociation and band structure of Mott insulators. This is demonstrated with numerical calculations for several molecular systems. Approximating the constancy behavior for fractional spins should be a major aim in functional constructions and should open the frontier for DFT to describe strongly correlated systems. The key results are also shown to apply in reduced density-matrix functional theory. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

This compound undergoes successive phase transitions at the transition temperatures T_h (= 16 K), T_c (= 9. 7 K), and T_RSG (= 3. 5 K). The static and dynamic {{behaviors of the}} reentrant spin glass phase below T_RSG are characterized by those of <b>normal</b> <b>spin</b> glass phase with critical exponent β = 0. 57 ± 0. 10, a dynamic critical exponent x = 8. 5 ± 1. 8, and an exponent p (= 1. 55 ± 0. 13) for the de Almeida -Thouless line. A prominent nonlinear susceptibility is observed between T_RSG and T_c and around T_h, suggesting a chaotic nature of the ferromagnetic phase (T_RSG≤ T ≤ T_c) and the helical spin ordered phase (T_c≤ T ≤ T_h).
