25|$|The {{deposition}} of Ignatios and the sudden promotion of Photios caused scandal and ecclesiastical division on an ecumenical scale as the Pope {{and the rest}} of the western bishops took up the cause of Ignatios. The latter's deposition without a formal ecclesiastical trial meant that Photios's election was uncanonical, and eventually Pope Nicholas I sought to involve himself in determining the legitimacy of the succession. His legates were dispatched to Constantinople with instructions to investigate, but finding Photios well ensconced, they acquiesced in the confirmation of his election at a synod in 861. On their return to Rome, they discovered that this was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> Nicholas had intended, and in 863 at a synod in Rome the pope deposed Photios, and reappointed Ignatius as the rightful patriarch, triggering a schism. Four years later, Photios was to respond on his own part by calling a Council and excommunicating the pope on grounds of heresy – over the question of the double procession of the Holy Spirit. The situation was additionally complicated by the question of papal authority over the entire Church and by disputed jurisdiction over newly converted Bulgaria.|$|E
2500|$|Rubber Soul was {{released}} on compact disc on 30 April 1987, with the 14-song UK track line-up now the international standard. Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the 14-track UK version of the album was issued on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987. As with the Help! album, Rubber Soul featured a contemporary stereo digital remix of the album prepared by George Martin. Martin expressed concern to EMI over the original 1965 stereo remix, claiming it sounded [...] "very woolly, and <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> I thought should be a good issue". He {{went back to the}} original four-tracks tapes and remixed them for stereo.|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael Lewis in Vanity Fair: [...] "Many of the {{articles}} attacking her accused her of making a very specific forecast — {{as many as a}} hundred defaults within a year! — that failed to materialize... But that's <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> she had said: her words were being misrepresented so that her message might be more easily attacked. 'She was referring to the complacency of the ratings agencies and investment advisers who say there is nothing to worry about,' said a person at 60 Minutes who reviewed the transcripts of the interview for me, to make sure I had heard what I thought I had heard. She says there is something to worry about, and it will be apparent to everyone in the next 12 months." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} Mamikonians in the Early Middle Ages is quite obscure. In {{the period between}} 655 and 750 they are <b>not</b> {{documented}} <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>What</b> follows below is their reconstructed genealogy between the 5th and 7th centuries.|$|R
