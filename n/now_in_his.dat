5|$|Although Bede {{is mainly}} studied as a {{historian}} <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works. The non-historical works contributed greatly to the Carolingian renaissance. He has been credited with writing a penitential, though his authorship of this work {{is still very much}} disputed.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Prince and Princess {{shared the}} outlook of the Progressive Party, and Bismarck was {{haunted by the}} fear that should the old Emperor dieand he was <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seventiesthey would call {{on one of the}} Progressive leaders to become Chancellor. He sought to guard against such a turn by keeping the Crown Prince from a {{position}} of any influence and by using foul means as well as fair to make him unpopular.|$|E

5|$|By <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mid thirties, {{first team}} {{opportunities}} became scarce for Gibbs in 2000–01. He made only seven first team appearances, although Watford {{managed to avoid}} defeat in six of those. His final appearance, and only game under Gianluca Vialli, came on 24 April 2002. An 82nd-minute substitute, Gibbs was unable to prevent a late Gillingham goal, which secured them a 3–2 victory. Among Gillingham's players for Gibbs' professional swansong was Andy Hessenthaler, the man who became Watford captain after Gibbs' injury. Gibbs retired as Watford's second highest all-time appearance maker, although he started more matches than Luther Blissett, the man ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Following Buckingham’s {{death in}} 1628, {{when it was}} safer to do so, a {{translation}} of a history by Pierre Matthieu was published under the title, The Powerful Favourite, the life of Aelius Sejanus. This was followed in 1634 by another translation, Sir Thomas Hawkins' Politicall Observations upon the Fall of Sejanus, which had originally been titled Della peripetia di fortuna (Of Changes of Fortune) by its author, Giovanni Battista Manzini. Later in the century Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, {{was the target of}} the four-page political pamphlet Sejanus, or The popular favourite, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> solitude, and sufferings, signed with the pseudonym Timothy Tory (1681). The story of Sejanus, with reference to the Earl's imprisonment in the Tower on a charge of treason, is interpreted as an argument for absolute monarchy, direct rule without the intermediary of politicians.|$|E

5|$|In 1540 Montejo the Elder, who was <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> late 60s, {{turned his}} royal rights to {{colonise}} Yucatán {{over to his}} son, Francisco Montejo the Younger. In early 1541 Montejo the Younger joined his cousin in Champton; he did not remain there long, and quickly moved his forces to Campeche. Once there Montejo the Younger, commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucatán Peninsula. Shortly afterwards, Montejo the Younger summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them {{to submit to the}} Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the Younger sent his cousin against them (also called Francisco de Montejo); Montejo the Younger remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Reuben Wells was {{appointed}} as shop superintendent in 1887. Jacob Rogers, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> late 70s, gradually passed {{more and more}} responsibility to Wells until Rogers resigned the presidency in 1893. After just over 60 years, the Rogers company {{would no longer be}} run {{by a member of the}} Rogers family. The company reorganized under its former treasurer and new president, Robert S. Hughes, as the Rogers Locomotive Company; Jacob Rogers remained the company's principal investor. Hughes led the company until his own death in 1900. A year later, Jacob Rogers closed the Rogers Locomotive Company plant.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} elevation, Basiliscus had {{despatched}} Illus {{and his brother}} Trocundus against Zeno, who, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> native fortresses, had resumed {{the life of an}} Isaurian chieftain. Basiliscus, however, failed to fulfill the promises he made to the two generals; furthermore, they received letters from some of the leading ministers at the court, urging them to secure the return of Zeno, for the city now preferred a restored Isaurian to a Miaphysite whose unpopularity increased with the fiscal rapacity of his ministers.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona had {{virtually}} secured their La Liga title by {{the start of}} 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated {{in the second half of}} the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health. After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi. <b>Now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13million. He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff. Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team's attack had increased exponentially; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.|$|E
5|$|His {{absence from}} the Penguins' line-up served as a {{stepping}} stone for teammate Evgeni Malkin, who, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> second season, was developing into a superstar in his own right. Picking up the offensive slack, Malkin finished second in league scoring to Alexander Ovechkin and was also a Hart Memorial Trophy nominee as MVP honours also went to Ovechkin. In addition to Crosby's return to the line-up late in the regular season, the Penguins acquired star winger Marián Hossa from the Atlanta Thrashers at the trade deadline, placing the club in a strong position to make a deep playoff run. Pittsburgh finished the regular season as Atlantic Division champions and just two points shy of the first-seeded Montreal Canadiens. In a rematch of the previous year's opening round, the Penguins began the 2008 playoffs facing the Ottawa Senators, whom they quickly swept in four games. After then defeating the New York Rangers and archrival Philadelphia Flyers, each in five games, the Penguins reached the final round {{for the first time}} since 1992, to face the Detroit Red Wings. After being shut out as a team for the first two games of the series, Crosby scored the first two goals of game three as the series shifted to Pittsburgh to fuel a 3–2 win. The Penguins lost the next game and despite staving off defeat in game five, they were overcome by the Red Wings in six games. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe-winner Henrik Zetterberg (13g, 14a in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.|$|E

25|$|Jimmy Meadows, who {{had been}} given the caretaker-manager role for a second time, was {{replaced}} in May 1978 by the returning Bob Stokoe as the club faced up to life in the Third Division. Despite the goals of Derek Spence, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> second spell with the club after a season on Greek shores with Olympiacos, the team struggled to find their feet and could only finish mid-table, with attendances at Bloomfield Road lower than ever. At the end of the 1978–79 season, Stokoe walked out for a second time, never to return.|$|E
