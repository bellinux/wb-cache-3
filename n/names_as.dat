5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Grand Lodge era, during the 1720s, James Anderson {{composed}} the first printed constitutions for Freemasons, the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry.

The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century. Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States, but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry.|$|E

The governments have argued that such names are foreign and/or divisive against Turkish unity. Names changed were usually of Armenian, Greek, Georgian (Including Laz), Bulgarian, Kurdish, Assyrian, or Arabic origin.|$|E

The design was subsequently used for the GNP and the CCE, and became known on the Underground as the 1906 stock or Gate stock. Trains for the line were stabled at the London Road depot south of Kennington Road station.|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} decades have seen a {{proliferation}} of subfamily <b>names,</b> <b>as</b> a result of three factors: (1) the realization that some subfamilies were assemblages of unrelated taxa; (2) abandonment of paraphyletic taxa, and (3) the discovery of novel fossil taxa. Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies. One of the fossil taxa, Armaniinae, is often given family rank within the superfamily Formicoidea. About 13 genera are incertae sedis (of uncertain placement), and are not assigned to any subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The rows of {{the table}} are called periods; the columns are called groups.

The periodic table {{can be used to}} derive relationships between the properties of the elements, and predict the properties of new elements yet to be discovered or synthesized. The periodic table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behaviour, and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences.|$|E

The design became known on the Underground as the 1906 stock or Gate stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1774 by German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer as Agaricus bombycinus. Throughout its taxonomical history, {{it has been}} shuffled to several genera, including Pluteus (by Elias Fries in 1836), Volvaria (Paul Kummer, 1871), and Volvariopsis (William Alphonso Murrill, 1911). Rolf Singer placed it in its current genus, Volvariella, in 1951. Other names that have been applied to the species include Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Amanita calyptrata and August Johann Georg Karl Batsch's Agaricus denudatus (both published in 1783), but these are illegitimate <b>names</b> <b>as</b> Schäffer's earlier 1774 name has priority.|$|E
5|$|The two white-tailed {{cockatoo}} {{species were}} called short-billed and long-billed black cockatoos in scientific works, {{yet they were}} called Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoo in Western Australia. Hence ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles pushed for the latter two names to be used. The International Ornithologists' Union has taken up this suggestion and uses these <b>names</b> <b>as</b> their official common names. The local Noongar people did not distinguish between Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoos. Nyungar names recorded include ngolyenok, ngoolyoo (from Northampton), and G'noo-le-a (from Geraldton).|$|E
