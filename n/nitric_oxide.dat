5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E

40|$|Owing {{to recent}} strict legislation, {{environmental}} impact of combustion processes is nowadays {{one of the most}} important problems involving both scientific community and burner manufacturers. In the case of natural gas combustion, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxides</b> (NOx) reduction is the most critical aim to achieve, often requesting for industrial applications heavy and highcost plant revamping (for instance, adoption of low-NOx burners or burned gases de-NOx treatment). Moreover, although NOx formation mechanisms are today quite understood, many unsolved questions are connected to the interaction between fluid dynamic and chemistry inside the burner device and this makes the CFD codes not yet fully predictive. This paper presents the results obtained for pollutant emissions (<b>nitric</b> <b>oxides</b> and carbon monoxide) upon two different natural gas burner typologies: a swirl burner equipped with two different fuel injectors (co-axial or transverse with respect to the rotating air stream) and a premixed burner with a flame generated downstream a metallic grid.

5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E

25|$|<b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> {{known as}} an endothelium-derived {{relaxing}} factor (EDRF), is biosynthesized endogenously from L-arginine, oxygen, and NADPH by various <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase (NOS) enzymes. Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also serve to make <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide.</b> The endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels uses <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, thus resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes.

40|$|The {{production}} of ozone and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxides</b> and the oxidation of two organic contaminants, methane and acetylene, were {{studied in the}} corona discharge of a model cylindrical electrostatic precipitator. Both air and oxygen streams were passed through the discharge while current, voltage, electrode/wall radius ratio, residence time and wall temperature were varied. Under all conditions using air, much more ozone was produced in the negative than in the positive corona, in agreement with qualitative data reported in the literature. However, using oxygen, as much as {{three to four times}} more ozone is produced by the positive corona. Over a wide range of conditions ozone production is proportional to current. Limited analyses of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxides</b> formation in air indicated that levels were higher in the negative than in the positive corona. In contrast to previous work using an RF discharge, methane contamination was not removed by the corona discharge. However, the oxidation of acetylene was affected by the discharge and could not be accounted for by homogeneous ozonation alone...|$|R

25|$|Independent of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase, an {{alternative}} pathway, coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, elevates <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based foods. Nitrate-rich vegetables, in particular leafy greens, such as spinach and arugula, and beetroot, {{have been shown}} to increase cardioprotective levels of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-hypertensive persons. For the body to generate <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by nitrate reductase, a bacterial enzyme) occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step. Monitoring <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> status by saliva testing detects the bioconversion of plant-derived nitrate into <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide.</b> A rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive diets such as the DASH diet.|$|E
25|$|The {{reactive}} {{nitrogen species}} arise once the {{reactive oxygen species}} destroy the mitochondria. This leads {{to the formation of}} the reactive nitrogen species, which are responsible for damaging DNA in arsenic poisoning. Mitochondrial damage is known to cause the release of reactive nitrogen species, due to the reaction between superoxides and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO). <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) is a part of cell regulation, including cellular metabolism, growth, division and death. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) reacts with reactive oxygen species to form peroxynitrite. In cases of chronic arsenic exposure, the <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> levels are depleted, due to the superoxide reactions. The enzyme NO synthase (NOS) uses L-arginine to form <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide,</b> but this enzyme is inhibited by monomethylated arsenic (III) compounds.|$|E
40|$|A photochemical-transport {{two-dimensional}} {{model has}} been used {{to assess the impact of}} a projected fleet of high-speed stratospheric aircraft using different emissions scenarios. It is shown that the presence in the background atmosphere of nitric acid trihydrate aerosols is responsible for a lower stratospheric denoxification in addition to that caused by the sulfate aerosol layer. This has the effect of further decreasing the relative role of the odd nitrogen catalytic cycle for ozone destruction, so that the lower stratosphere is primarily controlled by chlorine species. The effect of aircraft injection of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxides</b> is that of decreasing the level of ClO, so that the lower stratospheric ozone (below about 20 - 25 km altitude) increases. The net effect on global ozone is that of a small increase even at Mach 2. 4, and is enhanced by adopting emission scenarios including altitude restriction at 15 or 18 km. Reductions of the emission index (EI) of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxides</b> below relatively small values (about 15) are shown to reduce the aircraft-induced ozone increase, because of the associated smaller decrease of ClO. This conclusion is no more valid when the emission index is raised at the present values (about 45) ...|$|R
