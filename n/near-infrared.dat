5|$|Long-slit Intermediate Resolution Infrared Spectrograph – <b>near-infrared</b> imager/spectrograph, with imaging over a 4' field, {{spectral}} resolutions R = 700-2500, spectropolarimetry, {{and long}} slit and multi-object slit-masks. Mounted at Cassegrain focus.|$|E
5|$|Natural-guide-star Adaptive Optics for Multi-purpose Instrumentation – an {{adaptive}} optics feed, operating {{over the entire}} optical and <b>near-infrared</b> wavelength regions. Permanently mounted {{at one of the}} Nasmyth foci.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 20%. Its surface {{composition}} {{is thought to}} be broadly similar to its composition as a whole. <b>Near-infrared</b> spectroscopy has revealed the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 2550%. The analysis of high-resolution, <b>near-infrared</b> and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, on Callisto with the Hubble Space Telescope|year=1996|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1852.PDF|page=1852|format=PDF}} and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. Spectral data indicate that Callisto's surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale. Small, bright patches of pure water ice are intermixed with patches of a rock–ice mixture and extended dark areas made of a non-ice material.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 43%. Water ice {{seems to be}} {{ubiquitous}} on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 %, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. <b>Near-infrared</b> spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, <b>near-infrared</b> and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. Galileo results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to PET and fMRI, which show which {{areas of the}} brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas, thus providing insight into how different areas interact. Functional <b>near-infrared</b> spectroscopy (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.|$|E
5|$|Like Pluto, Makemake appears red in {{the visible}} spectrum, and {{significantly}} redder than the surface of Eris (see colour comparison of TNOs). The <b>near-infrared</b> spectrum is marked {{by the presence of}} the broad methane (CH4) absorption bands. Methane is observed also on Pluto and Eris, but its spectral signature is much weaker.|$|E
5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and <b>near-infrared</b> radiation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and <b>near-infrared</b> wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large dark red area on Haumea's bright white surface was seen in September 2009, possibly an impact feature, which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly {{a higher proportion of}} crystalline ice. Thus Haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent of Pluto, if not as extreme.|$|E
5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (red light) and 814nm (<b>near-infrared).</b> Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E
5|$|In {{visible and}} <b>near-infrared</b> light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the {{cross-sectional}} area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Semiconducting single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit <b>near-infrared</b> light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually {{occurs as}} follows: an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a c1−v1 transition resulting in light emission.|$|E
5|$|The ARCHER imaging system, mounted {{aboard the}} GA8 Airvan, uses visible and <b>near-infrared</b> light {{to examine the}} surface of the Earth and find {{suspected}} crash sites, evaluate areas affected by disasters, or examine foliage from an airborne perspective in order to flag possible marijuana plantations. Both the SDIS and ARCHER systems were used to great success in the response to Hurricane Katrina; ARCHER may be used in coordination with the SDIS system.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{receives}} 174petawatts (PW) {{of incoming}} solar radiation (insolation) {{at the upper}} atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and <b>near-infrared</b> ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m², or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m² per day.|$|E
5|$|The WHT is {{equipped}} {{with a wide range of}} instruments operating over the optical and <b>near-infrared</b> regimes. These are used by professional astronomers to conduct a wide range of astronomical research. Astronomers using the telescope discovered the first evidence for a supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the centre of the Milky Way, and made the first optical observation of a gamma-ray burst. The telescope has 75% clear nights, with a median seeing of 0.7".|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, {{the primary}} {{component}} of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and <b>near-infrared</b> spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse <b>near-infrared</b> radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} two forthcoming missions {{planned for the}} Jovian system. Juno, launched on 5 August 2011, has limited imaging capabilities, but it could monitor Io's volcanic activity using its <b>near-infrared</b> spectrometer, JIRAM. The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a planned European Space Agency mission to the Jovian system that is intended {{to end up in}} Ganymede orbit. JUICE has a launch scheduled for 2022, with arrival at Jupiter planned for January 2030. JUICE will not fly by Io, but it will use its instruments, such as a narrow-angle camera, to monitor Io's volcanic activity and measure its surface composition during the two-year Jupiter-tour phase of the mission prior to Ganymede orbit insertion. The Io Volcano Observer (IVO) is a proposal for a Discovery-class mission that would launch in 2021. It would involve multiple flybys of Io while in orbit around Jupiter beginning in 2026.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to <b>near-infrared</b> wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.|$|E
5|$|Which {{part of the}} {{electromagnetic}} spectrum—the visible, <b>near-infrared</b> (NIR) or mid-infrared (MIR)—produces the most accurate angular measurement is still debated. In 1996, Betelgeuse was shown to have a uniform disk of 56.6 ± 1.0mas. In 2000, the SSL team produced another measure of 54.7 ± 0.3mas, ignoring any possible contribution from hotspots, which are less noticeable in the mid-infrared. Also included was a theoretical allowance for limb darkening, yielding a diameter of 55.2 ± 0.5mas. The earlier estimate equates to a radius of roughly 5.6AU or , assuming the 2008 Harper distance of 197.0 ± 45pc, a figure {{roughly the size of}} the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU, published in 2009 in Astronomy Magazine and a year later in NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.|$|E
25|$|The skin is {{permeable}} to <b>near-infrared</b> light (NIR). As a consequence, <b>near-infrared</b> dyes can {{be measured}} across the skin without the need of an optic fibre, which has been termed “smart tattoo” by McShane who created a <b>near-infrared</b> oxygen quenching assay contained in microspheres.|$|E
25|$|Cy5.5 is a <b>near-infrared</b> (IR) fluorescence-emitting dye (Excitation/emission maximum 678/694nm).|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of flux emitted by L and T dwarfs {{is in the}} 1 to 2.5 micrometre <b>near-infrared</b> range. Low and decreasing temperatures through the late M-, L-, and T-dwarf sequence result in a rich <b>near-infrared</b> spectrum containing {{a wide variety of}} features, from relatively narrow lines of neutral atomic species to broad molecular bands, all of which have different dependencies on temperature, gravity, and metallicity. Furthermore, these low temperature conditions favor condensation out of the gas state and the formation of grains.|$|E
25|$|With {{the current}} resolution, the visible and <b>near-infrared</b> spectra of most {{satellites}} appear featureless. So far, water ice has been inferred on Phoebe and Nereid and features attributed to aqueous alteration {{were found on}} Himalia.|$|E
25|$|SPIRou (SpectroPolarimètre Infra-Rouge) is a <b>near-infrared</b> spectropolarimeter and high-precision {{velocimeter}} {{designed and}} constructed {{by an international}} consortium for observing exoplanets and the forming of Sun-like stars and their planets. Silhouettes of Spirou and Spip are featured in its logo.|$|E
25|$|Terephthalic acid {{is used as}} {{a filler}} in some {{military}} smoke grenades, most notably the American M83 smoke grenade and M90 vehicle-employed smoke grenade, producing a thick white smoke that acts as an obscurant in the visual and <b>near-infrared</b> spectrum when burned.|$|E
25|$|CdSe photoresistors are 5–100 {{times more}} {{sensitive}} than CdS devices; their sensitivity peaks in the red to <b>near-infrared</b> region (670–850nm) and extends up to 1100nm. They have an inferior dynamic range and linearity than their CdS counterparts, but are faster, with a time constant of less than 20 ms.|$|E
25|$|Two {{members of}} the glass-frog family Centrolenidae (Centrolenella fleischmanni, C. prosoblepon) and the hylid {{subfamily}} Phyllomedusinae (Agalychnis moreletii, Pachymedusa dacnicolor) reflect <b>near-infrared</b> light (700 to 900 nanometers) when examined by infrared color photography. Infrared reflectance may confer adaptive advantage to these arboreal frogs both in thermoregulation and infrared cryptic coloration.|$|E
25|$|Astronomers have {{determined}} the three-dimensional distribution of extinction {{in the solar}} circle of our galaxy, using visible and <b>near-infrared</b> stellar observations and {{a model of the}} distribution of stars in the galaxy. The dust giving rise to the extinction lies along the spiral arms, as observed in other spiral galaxies.|$|E
25|$|The eye focuses {{visible and}} <b>near-infrared</b> light onto the retina. A laser beam can be focused to an {{intensity}} on the retina {{which may be}} up to 200,000 times higher than {{at the point where}} the laser beam enters the eye. Most of the light is absorbed by melanin pigments in the pigment epithelium just behind the photoreceptors, and causes burns in the retina. Ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 400nm tends to be absorbed by lens and 300nm in the cornea, where it can produce injuries at relatively low powers due to photochemical damage. Infrared light mainly causes thermal damage to the retina at <b>near-infrared</b> wavelengths and to more frontal parts of the eye at longer wavelengths. The table below summarizes the various medical conditions caused by lasers at different wavelengths, not including injuries due to pulsed lasers.|$|E
25|$|Superlenses {{are made}} from {{negative}} index metamaterials and claim to produce images at spatial resolutions exceeding the diffraction limit. The first superlenses were made in 2004 using such a metamaterial for microwaves. Improved versions {{have been made by}} other researchers. the superlens has not yet been demonstrated at visible or <b>near-infrared</b> wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 study {{packaged}} nanoparticles with miR-34a and ammonium bicarbonate {{and delivered}} them to prostate CSCs in a mouse model. Then they irradiated {{the area with}} <b>near-infrared</b> laser light. This caused the nanoparticles to swell three times or more in size bursting the endosomes and dispersing the RNA in the cell. miR-34a can lower the levels of CD44.|$|E
25|$|For decades, NASA and NOAA {{satellites}} have {{continuously monitored}} vegetation from space. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments measure {{the intensity of}} visible and <b>near-infrared</b> light reflecting off of plant leaves. Scientists use the information to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of photosynthetic activity or “greenness” of the landscape.|$|E
25|$|The market {{introduction}} of noninvasive blood glucose measurement by spectroscopic measurement methods, {{in the field}} of <b>near-infrared</b> (NIR), by extracorporal measuring devices, has not been successful because the devices measure tissue sugar in body tissues and not the blood sugar in blood fluid. To determine blood glucose, the measuring beam of infrared light, for example, has to penetrate the tissue for measurement of blood glucose.|$|E
25|$|Its {{instrumentation}} {{includes a}} 67-million-pixel wide-field imager (WFI) with {{a field of}} view {{as large as the}} full moon, which has taken many images of celestial objects. Other instruments used are GROND (Gamma-Ray Burst Optical <b>Near-Infrared</b> Detector), which seeks the afterglow of gamma-ray bursts—the most powerful explosions in the universe, and the high-resolution spectrograph FEROS (Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph), used to make detailed studies of stars.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an established}} {{medical imaging technique}} that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence interferometry, typically employing <b>near-infrared</b> light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. Confocal microscopy, another optical technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.|$|E
25|$|The first laser {{was made}} with a rod of {{synthetic}} ruby. Titanium-sapphire lasers are popular due to their relatively rare capacity to be tuned to various wavelengths in the red and <b>near-infrared</b> region of the electromagnetic spectrum. They can also be easily mode-locked. In these lasers a synthetically produced sapphire crystal with chromium or titanium impurities is irradiated with intense light from a special lamp, or another laser, to create stimulated emission.|$|E
