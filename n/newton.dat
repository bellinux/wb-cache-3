5|$|Hurricane <b>Newton</b> {{was one of}} the few {{tropical}} cyclones {{that were}} intercepted by Hurricane Hunter flights during the moderately active 1986 Pacific hurricane season. A tropical depression formed near Central America on September18; two days later, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm. Moving towards to northwest, <b>Newton</b> strengthened into a hurricane on September21. After paralleling the coast, <b>Newton</b> move ashore near Cabo San Lucas on September 22.

The following day, <b>Newton</b> moved ashore the Mexican mainland. <b>Newton</b> dissipated on September 23. However, the remnants of <b>Newton</b> continued across the United States and eventually emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. While 40 homes lost their roofs, damage in Mexico was fairly minor, and no fatalities were reported in association with <b>Newton,</b> though the remnants produced fairly heavy rains in the Great Plains.|$|E
50|$|Spring {{balances}} come {{in different}} sizes.

50|$|Suppose a rock's {{weight is}} {{measured}} as 10 <b>newtons</b> when suspended by a string {{in a vacuum}} with gravity acting on it. Suppose that, when the rock is lowered into water, it displaces water of weight 3 <b>newtons.</b> The force it then exerts on the string from which it hangs would be 10 <b>newtons</b> minus the 3 <b>newtons</b> of buoyant force: 10 − 3 = 7 <b>newtons.</b> Buoyancy reduces the apparent weight of objects that have sunk completely to the sea floor. It is generally easier to lift an object up through the water {{than it is to}} pull it out of the water.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1699, {{other members}} of the Royal Society (of which <b>Newton</b> was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism.

This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that <b>Newton</b> himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz.

5|$|A flashforward {{occurs in}} the narration, to find Daniel's ship under attack by the fleet of Edward Teach (Blackbeard) in 1713.

5|$|A. <b>Newton</b> {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found.

Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen.

50|$|It may {{be simple}} {{to write down}} the {{equations}} of motion in vector form using <b>Newtons</b> laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with spatial coordinates and time, and solving them is not easy.
