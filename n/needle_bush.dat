The Noongar name for the plant is Tanjinn.|$|E

50|$|These {{factors have}} {{influenced}} the lichen flora of the area which is dominated by crustose lichen species followed by foliose species. Only one fruticose lichen, belonging to the Ramalina genus has been observed in the NEC. Among foliose lichens more prominent are several species of the Parmotrema, Pyxine and the very common Physcia atrostriata genera.Corticolous crustose lichens contribute {{the greatest number of}} species to the lichen flora within the NEC. Among these the most distinguished are species within the Graphis, Arthonia, Glyphis, Opegrapha, Chrysothrix, Cryptothecia, and Trypethelium genera. Several species of saxicolous lichens have been observed in natural areas within the NEC among which are a species of Lecanora and several Pyxine. One Bacidia species has been observed growing on leaf litter in some areas of the NEC, particularly in the hills and other areas of higher elevation. The branches of the <b>needle</b> <b>bushes</b> (Vachellia farnesiana) are particularly rich in coverage with crustose lichen, specially of those species within the Graphidaceae family.|$|R
5000|$|Hakea leucoptera is a plant {{of the dry}} {{regions of}} Australia. The species is often {{referred}} to as silver needlewood, <b>needle</b> hakea, pin <b>bush,</b> and water tree. It has several indigenous names; Booldoobah, Uri, Kuluva, and Kuloa. The specific epithet, derived from the Latin Leucoptera (Gk): leuco means [...] "white"; and ptera means [...] "winged", referring to the characteristic white-winged seeds of this species.|$|R
50|$|The {{tobacco company}} sends Merwin {{to report the}} {{progress}} of the townspeople's commitment. The company needs just one person to fail. Among the weakest: the elderly Doctor Proctor (Barnard Hughes), who must always have a cigarette before surgery, and the anxiety-ridden wife of the mayor, Mrs. Wappler (Jean Stapleton), who counts the small gherkin pickles she eats as the hours pass. However, a group of 29 non-smoking residents, all members of the ultra-conservative Christopher Mott Society (based on the John Birch Society) have been asked by Brooks to police all traffic entering Eagle Rock to ensure no tobacco products enter. Another running gag ensues when elderly Odie Turman (Judith Lowry) keeps <b>needling</b> leader Amos <b>Bush</b> (Graham Jarvis) about his pistol, which she later steals.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to oaks, pines and holm oaks, {{there is also}} a great biodiversity of herbs and shrubs such as kidneywood, copal, mallow, mugwort, foxtail, and other trees such as willow, the amate fig, and the cat's claw (tepame) and <b>needle</b> <b>bush</b> (huisache) acacias. It is one of three known habitats of the Styrax jaliscana, a white-flowering shrub in the Styrax family.|$|E

50|$|Hakea lissosperma {{is a type}} of {{spreading}} shrub with almost 4 metres height, needle-shaped leaves and white flowers. In 1999 it was recognised that it grows commonly in over 1200 m rocky mountains, in subalpine woodland. And common names include <b>needle</b> <b>bush</b> and mountain needlewood. What is more, this species is a favourite of birds due to the dense clusters of flowers and pungent rigid needle-shaped leaves which can be a shelter against predators. It is also resistant to wildlife browsing due to its unpalatability but not suitable below powerlines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Beginning {{two years}} ago, the US Dept of Health and Human Services began "special reviews" of all current {{research}} grants that involved harm reduction, sex and drugs, and continues its ban on funding of <b>needle</b> exchange. With <b>Bush's</b> second term, {{the campaign was}} extended to all US funded international programs that dealt with these issues and populations. And, most recently, the US has again undertaken to dominate the discourse within international organizations charged with drug control and AIDS policies – especially those of the UN. But the international harm reduction and human rights community is fighting back in several important ways, including "An Open Letter to the delegates of the Forty-eighth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) of the UN" prepared {{by a group of}} 334 well respected public health experts and human rights advocates, protesting U. S. pressure on the U. N. to withdraw its support from harm reduction. This editorial includes the letter and signatures as well as French, Spanish, and Russian versions of the letter as additional files. </p...|$|R
50|$|Vachellia farnesiana, {{also known}} as Acacia farnesiana, and {{previously}} Mimosa farnesiana, commonly known as sweet acacia, huisache or <b>needle</b> <b>bush,</b> is so named because of the numerous thorns distributed along its branches. The native range of V. farnesiana is uncertain. While the point of origin is Mexico and Central America, the species has a pantropical distribution incorporating northern Australia and southern Asia. It remains unclear whether the extra-American distribution is primarily natural or anthropogenic. It is deciduous over part of its range, but evergreen in most locales. The species grows to a height of up to 8 m and has a lifespan of about 25-50 years.|$|E
50|$|Weaving in {{this village}} dates back at least until 500 BCE. The {{earliest}} weavings used cotton and ixtle and utilized the backstrap loom. Teotitlán would pay its financial tribute to the Aztecs in weavings. More modern weaving was introduced here by Dominican bishop Juan López Dezárate around 1535 when the bishop brought sheep and treadle looms to the area. The new materials and looms allowed for the weaving a large, heavy duty items such as rugs, serapes and blankets. Over time the village grew and began specializing solely in rugs {{to be used for}} trade or sale in markets of other towns in the other parts of the state. With the completion of the Pan-American Highway in the late 1940s, the area was connected with Mexico City, opening up markets. In the 1950s with air travel, tourists began coming to Oaxaca and taking interest in the crafts. A famed Zapotec weaver was Arnulfo Mendoza of Casa Serra Sagrada in Teotitlan, owner of La Mano Majica gallery in Oaxaca City.The rugs are handcrafted from wool and most of the designs are woven from the craftsmen’s memory. Designs include Zapotec and Mixtec glyphs and fretwork, Navajo designs (a contentious issue) and more contemporary designed including reproductions of works by famous artists such as Picasso, Joan Miró, Matisse, Diego Rivera or Rufino Tamayo. The making of the rugs begins the washing of the raw wool to rid it of dirt and residues. Next it is carded then spun into yarn. The yarn is wound into large balls to prepare for dying with natural dyes such as those obtained from the <b>needle</b> <b>bush,</b> indigo, cochineal, “musgo de roca”, Brazilwood, Mexican marigold and others. some workshops use chemical dyes. The looms are hand-operated.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the chemical composition and in vitro gas production of different legume and wild arboreal pods. Seven seeds of legume browse species, Mexican calabash (Crescentia alata), esculent leadtree (Leucaena esculenta), guamuchil (Phitecellobium dulce), bastard cedar (Guazuma ulmifolia), <b>needle</b> <b>bush</b> (Acacia farnesiana), mimosa (Mimosa sp.) and elephant ear tree (Enterolobium cyclocarpum). Were evaluated for their chemical composition (g/kg DM) and in vitro gas production pattern. Crude Protein was higher for L. esculenta (220) and lower for G. ulmifolia (70). Neutral and acid detergent fiber were higher for G. ulmifolia (687 and 554) and lower for A. farnesiana (267 and 176). Lignin was higher for Mimosa sp. (219) and lower for P. dulce (81). Total gas production (ml gas/g DM) of P. dulce (187) and E. cyclocarpum (164) were higher (P< 0. 001) than Mimosa sp. The lowest values were for C. alata (108), G. ulmifolia (102), L. esculenta (99) and A. farnesiana (90). The nutritional characteristics of L. esculenta and A. farnesiana might be used as supplements in ruminant diets, due to their major content in CP and in vitro digestibility, representing an alternative protein supplement during dry season...|$|E
