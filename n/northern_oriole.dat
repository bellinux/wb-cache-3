40|$|Birds {{feeding on}} horticultural crops may cause {{extensive}} losses, but control techniques currently available {{are not always}} practical or otherwise appropriate. Control of certain birds is attempted by placing widely spaced lines or wires over or around sites needing protection (Pochop et al., 1990). Recently, Knight (1988) reported observations that monofilament lines {{could be used to}} protect various horticultural crops, including grapes, from bird damage. However, more closely controlled research was needed to better quantify effectiveness of this technique for various bird species. The objectives of this study were to determine the effectiveness of monofilament lines in protecting ripening grapes (Vitis) from bird damage and to observe how damage-causing bird species behave in relation to the lines. We selected the vineyard at the Univ. of Nebraska horticultural garden because of its availability and its history of bird damage ranging from 30 % to 100 % of the crop (D. H. S., unpublished). The study was conducted from 17 July through 25 Sept. 1988, and included seven grape cultivars, each with four or more plants (Table 1). Plants of the various cultivars were distributed haphazardly throughout the vineyard. Each grape bunch on all plants was tagged and visually examined before ripening occurred. Plants were individually and randomly assigned to control (no lines) or experimental groups. Each experimental plant received, separately, clear 5. 4 -kg test monofilament lines spaced 30 cm apart, attached horizontally and parallel between two rigid 100 -cm-diameter wire hoops. The wire hoops were supported by the poles of the grape trellis. Grapes were considered to be damaged if they were either pecked or missing (Boudreau, 1972). The percentage of grapes damaged in each grape bunch was estimated every 4 to 5 days throughout the susceptible ripening period (Hothem et al., 1981) and individual bunch ratings were averaged for each plant. Cultivars were analyzed separately for treatment effects because the cultivars were known to differ with regard to fruit ripening time. Bird damage reached 100 % in all grape cultivars regardless of presence of lines, and damage within cultivars occurred at similar rates with or without lines. The mean number of days for damage to reach 100 % in all plants within cultivars ranged from 12 ± 2. 1 (‘Leon Millet’) to 54 ± 7. 5 (‘Bath’). Comparisons between control and experimental plants for each cultivar, using an independent two-sample t test, showed no difference in the mean number of days to 50 % damage (Table 1). European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), American robins (Turdus migratorious), <b>northern</b> <b>orioles</b> (Icterus galbula), and three other incidental species were observed going through the lines into plants. For example, European starlings were observed passing through the lines 32 times, 24 by flying and eight by hopping from the hoop or support pole. Most of the bird species entering through lines were flying or, to a lesser extent, hopping from a perch or the ground. Regardless of lines, damage occurred more slowly in some cultivars than others and was slowest in ‘Bath’ and ‘McCampbell’ grapes. ‘Leon Millet’ apparently was the most vulnerable to bird damage, a result possibly related to the cultivar (small, dark, sweet grapes) and the feeding habits of the bird species present, which typically damage grapes by plucking (Boudreau, 1972). Our results differ from Knight’s (1988) observations that lines would protect grapes from bird damage. However, house sparrows (Passer domestics), the species most noted by Knight (personal communication), were not present in this study. Subsequent studies at baited sites, which included various combinations of line size, color, orientation, and spacing, have confirmed that monofilament lines effectively repel house sparrows from certain feeding sites but do not repel European starlings (Agüero, 1990). Why lines repel only certain birds is not fully understood (Pochop et al., 1990). In this study, American robins, European starlings, and <b>northern</b> <b>orioles</b> appeared to be undeterred by lines around grape plants, and grape damage was total. Further studies are needed to better understand bird response to lines and potential management implications...|$|R

40|$|Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has {{demonstrated}} great utility for phylogeography and phylogenetics, but has several limitations {{and must be}} corroborated by independent nuclear evidence. Stochastic lineage sorting and introgressive hybridization frequently cause gene genealogies to be incongruent with the species tree and can render even the most strongly supported gene tree misleading. I utilized multiple nuclear introns and several multilocus approaches to investigate the evolutionary relationships between New World orioles within genus Icterus. First, I tested the utility of nuclear introns for inferring species-level phylogenies (Ch. 1). Concatenation analysis of six sex-linked introns yielded a well-resolved phylogeny that corroborated many nodes supported by mtDNA, especially deeper in the oriole tree. Second, I assessed the performance of four species tree algorithms by inferring a phylogeny of a recent radiation of eleven oriole species (Ch. 2). I sequenced seven independent introns from multiple individuals of each species, and found overall agreement between methods and previous data sets. Concatenation and Bayesian concordance analysis were mostly congruent and agreed on eight nodes. One of two coalescent-based methods used (*BEAST) supported six of these eight nodes. I found strong conflict between mtDNA and nDNA regarding the relationships within the well-studied ""northern oriole"" group. MtDNA supported a sister relationship between I. galbula and I. abeillei, whereas nDNA supported a sister relationship between I. bullockii and I. abeillei. Finally, I tested the utility of an extended IM model to examine the divergence population genetics of the three <b>northern</b> <b>orioles</b> (Ch. 3). Multi-population IMa 2. 0 analysis revealed extensive introgression between I. galbula and I. bullockii. In contrast, there was no gene flow between I. bullockii and I. abeillei, suggesting that their close nDNA relationship is not due to extensive introgression. However, previously undocumented substantial introgression between I. galbula and I. abeillei suggests that their close mtDNA relationship is likely due to mtDNA introgression and replacement in I. abeillei, causing the mtDNA tree to be misleading. Increased documentation of introgression in nature highlights the need for methods that can infer both trees and population parameters {{so that we can}} account for gene flow when inferring the evolutionary history of closely-related species...|$|R

40|$|The density, diversity, and nest-site {{selection}} of riparian breeding birds were studied from 1982 to 1985 in mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) communites along the Colorado River in northern Arizona. Avian density in tamarisk communities was significantly greater (P= 0. 052 and 0. 024 in 1984 and 1985, respectively) than avian density in native mesquite communities with similar vegetative cover and height attributes.

Vegetation structure and shrub species composition were measured at nest sites of eleven species of riparian birds in a tamarisk community to examine avian habitat relationships. Riparian birds exhibited differences in their choice of nesting habitat.
