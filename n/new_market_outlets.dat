40|$|This paper proscribes a {{marketing}} plan for New Mexico’s small (boutique) wineries {{to gain a}} significant {{share of the market}} for all wines sold in New Mexico restaurants. Survey results showed that the boutique wineries held only 1. 2 percent market share in 2007. The restaurant wine market was dominated by wines from around the world and to a lesser extent, two large wineries located in New Mexico. The ability to distribute wines to restaurant across a large geographic area was the major obstacle limiting the boutique wineries market share. It is not cost effective for small individual wineries to distribute their wines to the restaurants and the two national liquor distributors, which controlled 90 percent of the wine sold in restaurants, showed little interest in promoting local wines wine from small wineries. The number of boutiques wineries has been growing rapidly in recent years and their collective output is expected to double within the next four years signaling a need for <b>new</b> <b>market</b> <b>outlets.</b> The marketing plan proscribes the establishment of a distribution company owned by the boutique wineries implementing an aggressive marketing plan that is expect to result in a 9 percent market share by the year 2012. Many of the elements in the marketing plan were derived from focus group research conducted with restaurant managers and chefs...|$|E
40|$|The rural {{economy of}} the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been {{adapting}} to new economic and political realities. Especially important for rural areas has been {{the breakdown of the}} socialist market structure in agriculture, which meant the demise of cooperative structures and farmers gaining access to <b>new</b> <b>market</b> <b>outlets.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the potential of dairy sheep farmers to enter into new contracts with buyers and to analyze why some farmers continue selling to traditional market outlets. Using survey data of dairy sheep farmers we studied the choice they make between 3 market outlets: (1) selling milk to a recently established large dairy processor, (2) selling milk to traditional small local processors, or (3) transforming milk on-farm into cheese and selling it at the farm gate or at local markets. The significance of determinants of choice for these markets were tested in a multinomial logit model, which showed that distance to the collection point of the large dairy processor was the most important determinant of whether farmers sold milk or made cheese, with those at a greater distance selling cheese. Furthermore, we analyzed the main sources of transaction costs in developing new market channels. Overcoming transport and transaction costs may contribute to higher income for the farmers and hence to improving their livelihoods...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{restructuring of}} the American {{iron and steel industry}} that occurred {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century, culminating in the formation of the United States Steel Corporation in April of 1901, had a powerful effect on how domestic firms interacted with the international marketplace. The promotion of protectionist tariff policy [...] the industry's primary political goal throughout the 19 th century [...] began to recede before other issues. Chief amongst these was creation of an American political-economic posture conducive to global economic expansion that would allow firms to achieve stabilized operations in the international arena comparable to the competitive tranquility that had been the objective of domestic policy. Such, at least, was the vision of Judge Elbert H. Gary, titular head of U. S. Steel from its founding until his death in 1927. This paper will explore the firm's attempt to create international stability in steel, and pursue reasons for its failure. The most crucial variable underlying the iron and steel industry's new political posture was a strengthened economic position achieved by the end of the 19 th century. The continual adoption of new technological innovations, in conjunction with expanded demand and the utilization of scale economies in both plant size and through vertical integration, had allowed American steelmakers to rise to the top in global competitiveness [63; 11, p. 66, 115 - 7]. This propitious development spurred an intensified search for <b>new</b> <b>market</b> <b>outlets,</b> which in turn fostered a basic reconsideration of the industry's longstanding protectionist foreign economic policies...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a broader {{research}} process assessing the local economic, social and environmental impacts from feedstock expansion for the growing biofuel sector (see German et al. 2011). Nonetheless, in the Malaysian context, biofuel production volumes are negligible despite government interest in promoting sector expansion. Since Malaysia is the second largest palm oil producer in the world, palm oil is slated to become the primary feedstock for biofuel production in the country. Since palm oil consistently outperforms all other substitute vegetable oils on price, it is also becoming an important feedstock globally. While a rapidly growing global biofuel sector could develop into an important <b>new</b> <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> for Malaysia, it does carry a number of risks. This paper aims to reflect on these risks by exploring the local social and land-use impacts of oil palm in the Beluran District of Sabah State. This is based on household surveys to discover the perception of impacts among relevant local stakeholder groups, and remote-sensing analysis. While the impacts of oil palm in the study site cannot be attributed to the biodiesel industry per se, lessons learnt will be directly applicable to the biodiesel sector in Malaysia, and relevant for the whole Southeast Asia region...|$|R

Through a competitive selection process, 15 cases {{from around the world}} provide insights into how small-scale initiatives that use sustainable production practices are supported by market demand, and create innovations in the institutions that govern sustainable practices and market exchanges. These cases respond to both local and distant consumers’ concerns {{about the quality of the}} food that they eat. The book evidences that the initiatives rely upon social values (e. g. trustworthiness, health [nutrition and food safety], food sovereignty, promotion of youth and rural development, farmer and community livelihoods) to adapt sustainable practices to local contexts, while creating <b>new</b> <b>market</b> <b>outlets</b> for food products. Specifically, private sector and civil society actors are leading partnerships with the public sector to build market infrastructure, integrate sustainable agriculture into private and public education and extension programmes, and ensure the exchange of transparent information about market opportunities. The results are: (i) system innovations that allow new rules for marketing and assuring the sustainable qualities of products; (ii) new forms of organization that permit actors to play multiple roles in the food system (e. g. farmer and auditor, farmer and researcher, consumer and auditor, consumer and intermediary); (iii) new forms of market exchange, such as box schemes, university kiosks, public procurement or systems of seed exchanges; and (iv) new technologies for sustainable agriculture (e. g. effective micro-organisms, biopesticides and soil analysis techniques). The public sector plays a key role in providing legitimate political and physical spaces for multiple actors to jointly create and share sustainable agricultural knowledge, practices and products...|$|E

Integrative and {{interdisciplinary}} {{approaches to}} the ecologisation of agrifood systemsCrop diversification is often presented {{as a way to}} improve the sustainability of agricultural production systems (reduction in the use of inputs and environmental damage resulting from their excessive use - pesticides, fertilizer, water). However, despite these benefits and various incentive programs, crop diversification is gaining little ground in France. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify: i) the main obstacles to crop diversification at agro-industrial supply chain and farm levels; ii) the levers that can be employed to encourage these stakeholders to integrate greater crop diversity within their production system. An interdisciplinary analysis framework was used, integrating farming system agronomy, sociotechnical transition approach and new institutional economics. This theoretical framework is centred on the "technological lock-in" theory, derived from the innovation economy, and socio-technical transition theory, which proposes potential "break-out" avenues. This framework is tested on twelve crop diversification cases studies with three in-depth analyses. Our results show that the socio-technical system organized on the basis of dominant crops and the simplification of cropping plans is therefore an obstacle to the development of diversification crops as a result of various closely interlinked processes: (i) genetic progress that is less rapid than for "major crops"; (ii) a lack of crop protection solutions (agrochemicals one but also genetic and agronomic ones); (iii) a shortage of technical references concerning minor crops to explain low yield or quality defects at regional scale; (iv) a competition with "major crops" on the raw material market not only due to price but also accessibility and homogeneity differences (v) the diversity of coordination methods between the different stakeholders in the supply chains Finally, to encourage the development of diversification crops, it would appear to be essential to act simultaneously on three levers supported by public action: (1) Promotion of <b>new</b> <b>market</b> <b>outlets,</b> (2) Coordination of stakeholders and structuration of supply chains and (3) getting R&D, advisory and plant breeding actors involved on a national nd regional level to develop innovative technologies and varieties...|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} population, {{coupled with}} land shortage and weather variations, wetlands in Uganda {{have continued to}} face degradation due to mainly conversion for agricultural, industrial and settlement purposes. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the spatial and temporal wetland use/cover changes and local perceptions attributed to these changes. The study utilized three sets of ortho-rectified and cloud free Landsat TM/ETM+/MSS temporal images (30 m) of 1986, 2000 and 2011. The classification procedures were carried out using an Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) software version 3. 7. A wetland classification system for Uganda developed by the National Biomass Study, 2003 was adopted to describe the wetland use/cover types. The classified images were validated in a ground truthing exercise using Global Positioning System (GPS) to improve on the classification accuracy. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with communities adjacent to the wetlands in each of three of the ten Ugandan agro-ecological zones to determine the underlying drivers of wetland use/cover changes, while household interviews generated information on local perceptions of the changes. Significant changes were mainly observed in wetland use/cover between 1986 and 2011. Major factors responsible for these changes were subsistence farming due to intensification of growing paddy rice in Kyoga plains, an influx of migrants who accessed wetlands for daily subsistence (livestock grazing) in South western farmlands and proximity to urban centres in the Lake Victoria Crescent. In all the sampled agro-ecological zones, increased crop farming in wetlands was due to changing opportunities created by existent large markets for wetland crops. Majority (60 %) of the local people perceived wetlands in their proximity to have undergone high degradation within the last 10 years, and to have declined in quantity and quality of vegetation, soil fertility and water levels. There was a noticeable variation across the sampled agro-ecological zones, with the highest proportion of local communities perceiving degradation being in Kyoga plains (76 %), followed by Lake Victoria crescent (63 %) and South-western farmlands (41 %). Locally perceived threats to wetlands were mainly from crop growing that accounted for 33 % of the frequency of mentioned threats, collection of wetland resources (30 %), and prolonged floods and droughts (12 %).

Primary data were collected from 120 farmers and 37 wheat traders using structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and Econometrics models were used to analyze the collected data. Results show that the main wheat value chain actors in the study area are input suppliers, farmers/producers, assemblers, wholesalers, processors, retailers, commission agents and cooperatives. Market concentration ratio at district level was 88. 7 % which indicated oligopolistic market structure. The result of 2 SLS indicated that size of landholding, livestock ownership, family size and quantity of wheat produced influences amount of wheat supplied to market significantly. The multinomial logit model result indicated that the likelihood to choose wholesalers <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by frequency of extension contact, distance from market place, own price of the commodity and membership to cooperative compared to accessing assemblers wheat <b>market</b> <b>outlet.</b> The likelihood of accessing cooperative wheat <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by price given to the commodity and distance from market place compared to accessing assembler <b>market</b> <b>outlet.</b> The likelihood of accessing processors <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by price of commodity, ownership of transportation facilities and distance of processors from production place.

Telenor {{is one of the}} organizations which realized that the budget was inadequate for the company's needs because it did not always contribute in providing the optimal management information. Management realized that the budget was grasping for more than it could handle and introduced Going Dynamic – a management model inspired by the Beyond Budgeting philosophy. We have studied why and how Telenor introduced Going Dynamic by interviewing the project leader for Going Dynamic and employees in two <b>market</b> <b>outlets.</b> Telenor decided to introduce Going Dynamic in the Norwegian organization in 2006. The <b>market</b> <b>outlets</b> were separately responsible for introducing new designs that replaced the budget, which has resulted in some interesting similarities and differences. The study of how Going Dynamic has been introduced in the <b>market</b> <b>outlets</b> has been done from a management control perspective which includes targets, resource allocation and prognoses. The literature states that each organization’s journey to go Beyond Budgeting is unique, and our study confirms that this is the case even between divisions in a single organization. We found that the budget no longer provided management with the adequate information needed in Telenor’s rapid changing environment. The budget could no longer perform its multiple roles included target setting, resource allocation, and cost management in a way that enabled decision making and follow up. Telenor has separated the targets, resource allocation and prognoses as a result of this. The two <b>market</b> <b>outlets</b> have developed different mechanisms that allow a more dynamic resource allocation. The processes of making prognoses, which aim to reveal gaps towards the targets, are applied differently in the two <b>market</b> <b>outlets.</b> The prognoses have made processes more visible and the incentive structure has been changed. However, there are indications that the budget has not been fully deinstitutionalized yet and the budget-like fixed target setting process seems to hamper Telenor’s ability to allocate resources dynamically to a certain degree...|$|R
