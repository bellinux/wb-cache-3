40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} {{the question of}} whether ethical decision-making affects a person’s happiness. Using cross-country data from the World Values Survey, I find that people who agree that it is never justifiable to engage in ethically-questionable behaviors report that they are more satisfied with their life than people who are more tolerant of unethical conduct, even after controlling for other factors known to affect self-reported happiness. The size of the ethics effect is roughly similar to that of a modest increase in income, being married and attending church, while the effect is smaller than that of having poor health or being dissatisfied with one’s personal finances. These results are robust across the four countries studied (the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazil), although there is variation in the ethics and happiness relationship across countries. One implication {{of this study is that}} a consideration of a society’s ethical norms will improve our understanding of the subjective well-being of people.

40|$|SUMMARY: Salmonella Typhimurium is an {{important}} nontyphoidal Salmonella serovar associated with foodborne diseases {{in many parts of}} the world. This organism is the major causative agent of non-typhoidal salmonellosis in Malaysia. We aimed to investigate the genetic profiles of the strains isolated from clinical, zoonotic, and dietary sources in Malaysia using multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). By focusing on the 5 common variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci, we found that PFGE (D ＝ 0. 99) was more discriminative than MLVA (D ＝ 0. 76). The low MLVA score might be because of a lack of VNTR loci STTR 6 (81. 0 z) and STTR 10 pl (76. 2 z). Both subtyping methods suggested that our S. Typhimurium strains were largely endemic with limited genetic variation. Furthermore, we observed that biphasic S. Typhimurium strains were dominant (<b>99</b> <b>z)</b> and multidrug resistance was prevalent (50 z) within our sample pool. The most frequently observed phenotypes were resistance to compound sulfonamides (49 z), tetracycline (51 z), and streptomycin (52 z).

40|$|Differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) {{functioning}} {{between patients}} with {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) and controls {{are among the most}} consistent neurobiological findings in PTSD. HPA-axis activation results in the output of various steroid hormones including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which is then converted into dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), with anti-glucocorticoid actions among its pleiotropic effects. To investigate whether there is evidence for consistent differences in basal DHEA and DHEA-s levels between individuals with and without PTSD, we performed random-effect meta-analyses aggregating findings of previously published studies. Nine studies reporting on DHEA levels (486 participants) and 8 studies reporting on DHEA-S levels (501 participants) were included. No significant differences in DHEA or DHEA-S levels between PTSD and control groups were found. Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed to"distinguish between effects of PTSD and trauma exposure.

A hypergraph is planar if its bipartite incidence graph is planar. A vertex coloring of H is proper if each C{edge contains two vertices {{with the same}} color and each D{edge contains two vertices with dierent colors. The set of all k's for which there exists a proper coloring using exactly k colors is the feasible set of H; the feasible set is called gap-free if it is an interval. The minimum (maximum) number of the feasible set is called a lower (upper) chromatic number. We prove that the feasible set of any planar mixed hypergraph without edges of size two and with an edge of size at least four is gap-free. We further prove that a planar mixed hypergraph with at most two D{edges of size two is two-colorable. We describe a polynomial-time algorithm {{to decide whether the}} lower chromatic number of a planar mixed hypergraph equals two. We prove that it is NP-complete to nd the upper chromatic number of a mixed hypergraph even for 3 -uniform planar bihypergraphs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the mortality rate of St. Petersburg population from external causes in 2010 – 2015 in comparison with similar indicators for the Northwest Federal District and the Russian Federation. Materials and methods. The authors used the following data for analysis: annual long-term monitoring of St. Petersburg trauma services status conducted by coordination and methodological center of trauma and orthopedics; government reporting on mortality; data of Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat); data of St. Petersburg Statistics Service (Petrostat); data of St. Petersburg Medical Information Analysis Center (MIAС); studies on mortality issues as well as methods of descriptive statistics.  Results. From 2003 to 2014 St. Petersburg population mortality rate demonstrated a steady decline as well as generally in Russia. 2015 featured a slight increase in absolute number of deaths per year (+ 1. 2 %) in St. Petersburg, while the similar indicator across the Russian Federation was still declining (- 5. 9 %). In 2015 mortality from external causes in St. Petersburg constituted 68 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants, which is 1. 6 times less than in the Northwest federal district (109. 6 per 100 thousand inhabitants), and 1. 7 times less than in the Russian Federation – 112 per 100 thousand population. In the overall mortality structure of St. Petersburg population the external causes have been consistently occupying third place within recent years. In 2015 the proportion of deaths from external causes in general mortality amounted to 5. 7 %. Conclusions. According to official statistics since 2000 in St. Petersburg the mortality rate from all the major external causes reduced gradually, as well as in the Northwest federal district and on the whole in Russia. Various national and regional programs that have been rolled out in Russia allowed to reduce by half the mortality of working age population from homicide and from suicide by almost 30 % in men and 40 % in women. The most reliable evaluation can be made by taking into account a consistent reporting data of overall traffic accidents mortality. In calculation of mortality rate from external causes there is a possibility to underreport injury and poisoning mortality rates described by the following ICD- 10 codes: X 40 -X 49, R 95 -R <b>99,</b> <b>Z</b> 57, Z 58, Z 63, R 54...|$|R

In this paper, we derive {{analytically}} the dynamical {{laws of the}} coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (CGPEs) without/with an {{angular momentum}} rotation term and an external magnetic field for modelling nonrotating/rotating spin- 1 Bose-Eintein condensates. We prove the conservation of the angular momentum expectation when the external trapping potential is radially symmetric in two dimensions and cylindrically symmetric in three dimensions; obtain a system of first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing {{the dynamics of the}} density of each component and solve the ODEs analytically in a few cases; derive a second order ODE for the dynamics of the condensate width and show that it is a periodic function without/with a perturbation; construct the analytical solution of the CGPEs when the initial data is chosen as a stationary state with its centerof-mass shifted away from the external trap center. Finally, these dynamical laws are confirmed by the direct numerical simulation results of the CGPEs. Key words.

Bhutto Agricultural College, Dokri, Sindh, Pakistan. The seeds of local turnip variety were planted during {{second week of}} October, 1998. The insect population observations were recorded one month after sowing. The population of cutworm remained on turnip crop from November, 1998 to February, 1999, which indicated one generation of the pest on turnip crop. The maximum population of Tobacco Cutworm (Spodoptera litura F.) was 11. 72 per plant, which recorded 12. 25 percent damage in the crop at 19. 97 �C temperature and 75. 85 % relative humidity. The population of Tobacco Cutworm was significantly correlated with {{the age of the}} turnip plants. During November-December (vegetative stage) the population percentage was positively correlated and showed increasing trend (b= 0. 24). However, population was negatively correlated and had decreasing trend (b= - 0. 249) when the crop was at maturity phase. This was {{due to the fact that}} crop early growth phase had sufficient number of green leaves containing chlorophyll which favoured the pest population for the food and survival...|$|R
