With regard to litter decomposition, N and P release in Moso bamboo forests is undoubtedly important; however, to date, no comprehensive analysis has been conducted. Here, we chose two dominant species (i. e., Cunninghamia lanceolata and Phoebe bournei), in addition to Moso bamboo, which are widely distributed in subtropical southeastern China, and created five leaf litter mixtures (PE 100, PE 80 PB 20, PE 80 CL 20, PE 50 PB 50 and PE 50 CL 50) to investigate species effects on leaf litter decomposition and nutrient release (N and P) via the litterbag method. Over a one-year incubation experiment, mass loss varied significantly with litter type (P 0. 94, P < 0. 001). N and P had different patterns of release; overall, N showed great temporal variation, while P {{was released from the}} litter continually. The mixture of Moso bamboo and Phoebe bournei (PE 80 PB 20 and PE 50 PB 50) showed significantly faster P release compared to the other three types, but {{there was no significant difference}} in N release. Litter decomposition and P release were related to initial litter C/N ratio, C/P ratio, and/or C content, while no significant relationship between N release and initial stoichiometric ratios was found.

40|$|Marketing {{strategies}} for successful <b>non-wood</b> <b>forest</b> <b>product</b> (NWFP) commercialization are important especially in those rural economies where NWFPs represent a considerable {{source of income}} for small and medium-scale forest-based enterprises. Two different organisational models in mushrooms marketing – a ‘traditional approach’ and a ‘net-system approach’ – are compared through a case-study research approach. The first model is usually based on single large-scale enterprises producing large quantities of standardized, mass-market oriented products; its main commercial goal is the improvement of the value-chain from producer to end-users, with no special links or integration between the production area and the producers. The second, quite new approach is based on several integrated small and medium-scale rural-based enterprises supplying relatively limited quantities of high quality products, oriented to niche markets. In this case, product specialty identification, complementary actions, integration and clustering among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) within the same production area are the most important goals. In the case studies, both organisational models have proved to be feasible and working with respect to the respective goals. Traditional large-scale enterprises, based on vertical integration and a short value chain, can achieve substantial economic performance; however, these are unlikely to have a significant positive impact on the socio-economic local context and are threatened by high business risk (mainly due to its strong specialization on a ‘climate-dependent’ NWFP). The analysed forest-based business model founded on networking, which involves not only forest-based SMEs but also other institutional, economic and social actors, has proved to be not only economically viable and less risky with respect to the traditional model, but also more equitable in distribution of benefits, and effective in stimulating the local economy as a whole, integrated system based on NWFPs and related environmental services...|$|R

Snowflake is collected from these populations as a <b>non-wood</b> <b>forest</b> <b>product.</b> It has been used as an ornamental and medicinal plant in the European countries for a long time. In this study, firstly, the effect of temperature on the germination of stratified snow flake seeds was investigated. After five weeks of warm stratification, the seeds were germinated at 20 and 25 ºC constant and, 30 / 20 ºC (8 / 16 h) variable temperature regimes. Temperature significantly affected germination percentage (GP) and the highest GP was determined both fresh and air dried seeds at 20 oC constant temperature (53. 2 % and 50. 9 %). The seeds at 20 ºC germination temperature were followed for further six months and total 90 % GP was determined. This result shows that snowflake seeds have a long germination period. Later, air dried seeds were stored at 20, 4 and – 5 ºC temperatures for six months, and then germinated at 20 ºC. Viability of the stored seeds was also determined. Results showed that the seeds stored at 4 and – 5 ºC had similar and higher GP than that of the seeds stored at 20 ºC temperature. The initially 50. 6 % GP was decreased at 15. 0 % level after six months of storage. However, the viability of the seeds was similar in initially and after six months (% 96. 8 and % 94. 3) ...|$|R
40|$|Research {{and debates}} on gender have {{shown in the}} past 20 - 30 years the {{importance}} of gender relations to the realisation or achievement of women's development or lack of advancement. This thesis addresses two major themes: firstly, it links a detailed study of intra-household social relations in rural household livelihood strategies; and secondly examines empirically the relationship between women's participation in <b>Non-Wood</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Product</b> (NWFP), in this case murta (a herbaceous reed) production and processing; and the position and status of {{women as well as}} men within their households through gender analysis of rural livelihood strategies among poor households in one village, in Sylhet district, Bangladesh. Murta {{is one of the major}} income generating activities in which women in poorer households are engaged to meet their subsistence needs. The research used a qualitative case study approach to understand gender and household livelihood strategies among the poor. A gender analysis of the division of labour was made relating to assets, access and activities; the culturally contracted terms about the division of resources and the pattern of negotiations that take place between household members among selected cases. The second section of this thesis examines women's and men's status defined in the following terms: i) their control over resources; ii) their decision-making power within their households; iii) the recognition women receive for their work from household members and the village community; iv) culturally constructed rules about social status. This study shows that income contribution has not improved women's relative well-being. The study on social relations improves understanding of the household's livelihood strategies more holistically by recognising gender inequalities in resources and status through the terms of cultural rules and negotiations. This study concludes with suggestions for policy interventions as follows: in future the government and NGOs planning for gender and development programmes in rural livelihoods need to look beyond the roles to understand the cultural rules as status signifiers that are placed on how people construct their livelihoods; but planning also need to address the joint interests of negotiations over gender relations at household level.

To address the changes in values in a <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> context, major wood and non-wood retailers {{are being asked to}} develop a wood procurement policy which defines the sources from which a company or organization will or will not obtain the wood or wood products it requires. Many interest groups are actively advising companies and organizations that are currently developing wood procurement policies, and continue to urge other retailers to commit to developing such policies. However, there is a welter of inconsistent and confusing wood procurement policy terminology that has been created, and is unlikely to successfully advance the cause of sustainable forest management in the medium and long term, at least in North America. In many cases, the broader objectives of the policies are not clear and this, as well as the lack of discussion between all relevant parties, is likely to create difficulties in policy implementation and in consumer acceptance. This paper describes and analyzes the current and emerging stakeholders and the processes that are necessary for successful wood procurement policy implementation. setting objectives, developing terms and definitions, identifying indicators, linking with data available and verifying data. Particular attention is given to exploring the problems with existing terms and definitions. We conclude that definitions and data collection standards need clarification, regional differences in forests need to be recognized, methods for data validation developed, and target deadlines for full implementation of a wood procurement policy possibly extended. The next steps could be a series of meetings between key stakeholders, including the wood and <b>non-wood</b> industries, <b>forest</b> <b>products</b> industry, certifying and standard-setting bodies, and ENGOs.

This has led to increased exploitation of forest trees {{to meet the needs}} for fuel wood, among others. However, Jatropha curcas plant has been identified as a potential fuel source. In the early 2000 s, profit-making organizations encouraged smallholder households to grow Jatropha for use as an alternative fuel source. This paper reports on a study conducted in Solwezi between 2011 and 2014 to evaluate the impact of Jatropha cultivation for biofuel production. A sample of 100 small-scale farmers involved in Jatropha cultivation and key informants were interviewed to evaluate the impact of growing Jatropha at the small-scale level. Results show that farmers lost out on time; income from sale of edible <b>non-wood</b> <b>forest</b> products; and experienced reduction in maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production, worsening household economic conditions. Farmers attributed this loss to unclear policy alignment on biofuel production by government. We therefore recommend that project implementation should involve interactions of all legislative bodies and any other concerned stakeholders. There is also a need to promote the value chain, from production to marketing, which focuses on minimizing detrimental effects on the livelihood of small-scale farmers...|$|R
