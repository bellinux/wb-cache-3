The exponential <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time assumption is justified for existing cellular systems, where wireless calls are charged {{based on the}} length of the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time. Future PCS systems may exercise flat rate billing, and consequently a more general distribution is desirable to model the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times. This paper models the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times by the Erlang distribution (a generalization of the exponential distribution) to investigate the effect of the variance of the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times on the call completion probability.

40|$|The <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time {{distribution}} in cellular systems {{is one of}} the main parameters that are used to study and analyze several system performance measures. Several statistical distributions have been used in the literature to model the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> {{time distribution}} in 3 rd and 4 th generations cellular systems, such as exponential, Erlang, Gamma, and generalized Gamma. In practice, the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time is affected by several factors such as the service plan, the class of the service area, and some of the system design parameters, however, the parameters of the distributions used to model the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time were assumed, and the effects of some factors on the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time are eliminated.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that due to the {{mobility}} of a portable and limited channel availability, calls of portables may not be completed due to being blocked or terminated during the call initiation or the handover process. The characteristics of the call completion and <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times for both a complete call and an incomplete call, are of critical importance for establishing the actual billing process in the PCS network. In this paper we derive the effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time distributions for complete/incomplete calls with a general cell residence times and a general <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times are analyzed and general computable formulae are obtained. We show that when <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times are Erlang distributed, easy-to-compute formulae for the probability of a call completion and the expected effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times for both a complete call and an incomplete call can be derived.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{personal}} communication service (PCS) network, the call completion probability and the effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times for both complete and incomplete calls are central parameters {{in the network}} cost/performance evaluation. These quantities {{will depend on the}} distributions of <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times and cell residence times. The classical assumptions made in the past that <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times and cell residence times are exponentially distributed are not appropriate for the emerging PCS networks. This paper presents some systematic results on the probability of call completion and the effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time distributions for complete and incomplete calls with general cell residence times and <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times distributed with various distributions such as Gamma, Erlang, hyperexponential, hyper-Erlang, and other staged distributions. These results provide a set of alternatives for PCS network modeling, which can be chosen to accommodate the measured data from PCS field trials. The application of these results in billing rate planning is also discussed.

In this work it is studied the effects of contemplating a <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time different from this classical exponential function. In particular, we analyse the influence of <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time {{on the performance of}} QoS (Quality of Service) routing algorithms. The experiments are performed in a realistic environment under different conditions of traffic load. The results prove that the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time just slightly impacts on routing efficiency.

40|$|As {{cellular}} {{networks are}} evolving to {{the direction of}} supporting multimedia connections the conventional assumption, that a connection lasts for an exponentially distributed time no longer holds.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the arrival}} of calls (i. e., new and handoff calls) in a {{personal}} communications services (PCS) network is modeled by a Markov arrival process (MAP) in which we allow correlation of the interarrival times among new calls, among handoff calls, {{as well as between}} these two kinds of calls. The PCS network consists of homogeneous cells and each cell consists of a finite number of channels. Under the conditions that both cell’s residence time and the requested <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time possess the general phase type (PH) distribution, we obtain the distribution of the channel holding times, the new call blocking probability and the handoff call failure probability. Furthermore, we prove that the cell residence time is PH distribution if and only if • the new <b>call</b> channel <b>holding</b> time is PH distribution; or • the handoff <b>call</b> channel <b>holding</b> time is PH distribution; or • the <b>call</b> channel <b>holding</b> time is PH distribution; provided that the requested <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time is a PH distribution and the total call arrival process is a MAP. Also, we prove that the actual <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time of a non-blocked new call is a mixture of PH distributions. We then developed the Markov process for describing the system and found the complexity of this Markov process. Finally, two interesting measures for the network users, i. e., the duration of new call blocking period and the duration of handoff call blocking period, are introduced; their distributions and the expectations are then obtained explicitly...|$|R

40|$|The Guard Channel (GC) {{scheme is}} an {{extensively}} deployed handover prioritization policy in wireless mobile networks {{due to its}} appealing properties of easy implementation and flexible control. Self-similar traffic has been demonstrated to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in modern communication networks and many measurement {{studies have demonstrated that}} the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times in wireless mobile networks follow heavy-tailed lognormal distributions. However, existing analytical models for the handover scheme usually assume that both new and handover calls can be modelled by traditional Markovian arrival processes and <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times can be characterized by exponential distributions. In order to obtain a deep understanding of the performance behaviour of the GC-based handover scheme under more realistic working conditions, this paper presents a new analytical model for this scheme in the presence of self-similar new call and handover call arrivals and heavy-tailed lognormal <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a novel discrete-time Markov chain model of book-ahead bandwidth-sharing mechanisms. We use this {{analytical}} model and a simulation model to understand the benefits of book-ahead (BA) bandwidth-sharing {{when compared to the}} immediate-request (IR) call-blocking mode of bandwidth-sharing in circuit-switched networks. We study two different BA schemes, BA-all, in which the caller accepts any set of available timeslots, and BA-n, in which the caller specifies n call-initiation time options. Numerical results show that the BA-all achieves 95 % utilization with a call-blocking probability of only 1 %, while in the IR mode, call blocking probability is 23 % even when utilization is only 80 %. TheBA-n schemes perform as well as theBA-all scheme if the call-initiation time options are restricted to fall on timeslot boundaries separated by the minimum <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time. The length of the advance-reservation horizon, K, is shown to increase linearly with <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time, H. The ratio K/H is primarily dependent on the link capacity in channels. For example, if the link is divided into 10 channels, to achieve a 2 % call blocking probability, the advance-reservation horizon needs to be a factor of 4 times the <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time. In other words, the extra data storage and processing required to accept and maintain advance reservations is not significant...|$|R
