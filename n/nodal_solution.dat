50|$|To {{accommodate}} the low or zero bending stiffness problem, very early versions of Flexcom {{were based on}} a 2D hybrid beam-column element. In this approach the axial force appeared as an explicit <b>nodal</b> <b>solution</b> variable, and was interpolated independently of the axial strain. The stress-strain compatibility relationship was applied outside of the virtual work statement by means of a Lagrangian constraint. This proved an accurate approach, and was subsequently extended to three dimensions. Further developments resulted in the addition of an extra Lagrangian constraint on the torque degree of freedom, {{in order to make the}} scheme more robust and accurate when this variable plays a significant role in the solution. This leads to a fourteen degree of freedom hybrid finite element with two end nodes, where the axial force and torque are added to the usual form of a three-dimensional beam element.|$|E
