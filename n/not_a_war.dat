The {{problems with the}} engines, failures of production priorities and Hitler's meddling are well known, but the long delay between operational testing, tactical and doctrinal development and training were largely Galland's fault.|$|E
5|$|Krüger hid at {{his home}} until November 1946 when he handed himself over to the British authorities. Forging an enemy's {{currency}} was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> crime; he faced no charges. He was detained until early 1947 when he was {{handed over to the}} French. They attempted to persuade him to forge passports for them, but he refused; he was released in November 1948. He underwent a denazification process, during which statements were produced from the forger-inmates whose lives he had been responsible for saving. He later worked for the Hahnemühle paper company. In 1965 the East German writer Julius Mader published , an attack on the West German government for harbouring Krüger.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{military}} architecture {{over the previous}} century had led to the construction or enhancement of fortresses that could withstand the pounding of cannonballs and mortar shells. For both Gebhard and Ernst, winning the war required mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless array of enemy artillery fortresses. These could be protected with relatively small garrisons, but taking them required both expensive artillery and enough men to storm the battlements. Furthermore, the victor had to maintain and defend all his possessions as they were acquired. Even the ruin of the Godesburg required a garrison and a defensive strategy; as a strategic point on the north-south road from Bonn to Koblenz, it came under siege in 1586 and again in 1588. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt, was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of assembled armies facing each other on a field, but a war of artillery sieges. It required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating.|$|E

25|$|Typically, little {{distinction}} was made between enemy combatants and enemy civilians, although {{women and children}} {{were more likely to be}} spared. Sometimes, the purpose of a battle, if <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war,</b> was to capture women, a practice known as raptio; the Rape of the Sabines was a large mass abduction by the founders of Rome. Typically women had no rights, and were held legally as chattel.|$|E
25|$|London {{is not a}} battlefield. Those innocents {{who were}} murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We {{need to be very}} clear about this. On the streets of London {{there is no such thing}} as a war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war.</b> It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.|$|E

500|$|As the British Band {{moved into}} Illinois, American {{officials}} urged Wabokieshiek to advise Black Hawk to turn back. Previously, the Winnebago Prophet had encouraged Black Hawk {{to come to}} Prophetstown, arguing that the 1831 agreement made with General Gaines prohibited a return to Saukenuk, but did not [...] forbid the Sauks from moving to Prophetstown. Now, instead of telling Black Hawk to turn back, Wabokieshiek told him that, {{as long as the}} British Band remained peaceful, the Americans would {{have no choice but to}} let them settle at Prophetstown, especially if the British and the area tribes supported the band. Although the British Band traveled with armed guards as a security precaution, Black Hawk was probably hoping to avoid a war when he reentered Illinois. The presence of women, children, and the elderly indicated that the band was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> party.|$|E
500|$|Journeying up the Missouri River, Lewis and Clark met Sacagawea, a {{woman of}} the Lemhi Shoshone tribe. [...] Sacagawea had been {{captured}} by another tribe and sold as a slave to Toussaint Charbonneau, a French-Canadian trapper, who made her one of his wives. Both Charbonneau and Sacagawea served as interpreters for the expedition and the presence of the Native American woman (and her infant son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau) helped convince hostile tribes that the Lewis and Clark Expedition was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> party. A great service Sacagawea rendered the expedition was to aid in the purchase of horses, needed so the group could cross the mountains after they had to abandon the Missouri approaching the Continental Divide. One reason for her success was that the Indian chief whose aid they sought proved to be Sacagawea's brother.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{career began}} winding down, {{and he made}} only one film in 1960, the {{critically}} acclaimed The Gallant Hours, in which he played Admiral William F. [...] "Bull" [...] Halsey. The film, although set during the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific Theater during World War II, was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> film, but instead focused {{on the impact of}} command. Cagney Productions, which shared the production credit with Robert Montgomery's company, made a brief return, though in name only. The film was a success, and The New York Times Bosley Crowther singled its star out for praise: [...] "It is Mr. Cagney's performance, controlled to the last detail, that gives life and strong, heroic stature to the principal figure in the film. There is no braggadocio in it, no straining for bold or sharp effects. It is one of the quietest, most reflective, subtlest jobs that Mr. Cagney has ever done." ...|$|E

500|$|Numerous critics {{take issue}} with the Bundeswehr's reverence towards Rommel as its primary role model. While [...] {{recognizing}} his great talents as a commander, they point out several problems like Rommel's involvement with a criminal regime, his political naivete, or {{that he can not}} teach the society modern values like democracy, pacifism, critical thinking or feminism. The politician scientist [...] calls for his replacement with Manfred von Richthofen. Cornelia Hecht opines that whatever judgement history will pass on Rommel – who was the idol of World War II as well as the integration figure of the post-war Republic – it is now the time the Bundeswehr should rely on its own history and tradition and not any Wehrmacht commander., a retired Bundeswehr officer, writes that the maintenance of the Rommel barracks' names and the definition of Rommel as a resistance fighter are capitulation before neo-Nazi tendencies. Heiducoff agrees with Bundeswehr generals that Rommel {{was one of the greatest}} strategists and tacticians, both in theory and practice, and a victim of contemporary jealous colleagues, but argues that such a talent for aggressive, destructive warfare is not a suitable model for the Bundeswehr, a primarily defensive army. Heiducoff criticizes Bundeswehr generals for pressuring the Ministry of Defence into making decisions in favour of the man they openly admire. The Green Party's position is that Rommel was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> criminal but still had entanglements with war crimes, and that he could not be the Bundeswehr's role model.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{battalion}} [...] "Mindoro", {{with two}} rifle companies, was formed {{under the command}} of Captain Ruperto Hernandez and Estanislao Cayton, both from Batangas. The revolutionary political reins were held by the elite, who also held the same reins under the Spaniards (and later under the Americans). The revolution, therefore, was for liberation against colonial rule but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> for social change, which was to be defeated late in the US-Filipino war that followed.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, {{responsibility}} for the British part of the attack lay with Churchill, {{which is why he}} has been criticised for allowing the bombings to occur. German historian Jörg Friedrich claims that Churchill's decision was a [...] "war crime", and, writing in 2006, philosopher A.C. Grayling questioned the whole strategic bombing campaign by the RAF, presenting the argument that although it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> crime it was a moral crime that undermines the Allies' contention that they fought a just war.|$|E

Pico added that [...] "To leave the exclusion zone was not to leave the combat zone to enter a protected area".
