40|$|AbstractHere we {{investigated}} the time course underlying differential processing {{of local and}} global shape information during the perception of complex three-dimensional (3 D) objects. Observers made shape matching judgments about pairs of sequentially presented multi­part novel objects. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to measure perceptual sensitivity to 3 D shape differences in terms of local part structure and global shape configuration – based on predictions derived from hierarchical structural description models of object recognition. There were three types of different object trials in which stimulus pairs (1) shared local parts but differed in global shape configuration; (2) contained different local parts but shared global configuration or (3) shared neither local parts nor global configuration. Analyses of the ERP data showed differential <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> {{as a function of}} shape similarity as early as the N 1 component between 146 – 215 ms post-stimulus onset. These <b>negative</b> <b>amplitude</b> deflections were more similar between objects sharing global shape configuration than local part structure. Differentiation among all stimulus types was reflected in N 2 <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> between 276 – 330 ms. sLORETA inverse solutions showed stronger involvement of left occipitotemporal areas during the N 1 for object discrimination weighted towards local part structure. The results suggest that the perception of 3 D object shape involves parallel processing of information at local and global scales. This processing is characterised by relatively slow derivation of ‘fine-grained’ local shape structure, and fast derivation of ‘coarse-grained’ global shape configuration. We propose that the rapid early derivation of global shape attributes underlies the observed patterns of N 1 <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations...</b>|$|R
