5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched on a <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band samplers were highly valued, often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations. These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 5.7-7.5 mm. The forewings of {{the females}} are dark brown with a <b>narrow</b> white <b>band</b> on the dorsum from the base to 1/4 of the entire length, medially with a <b>narrow</b> white <b>band</b> extending from the costa to the dorsum and {{with a pair of}} <b>narrow</b> white <b>bands</b> beginning at the costal and dorsal margin near 2/3 of the wing and extending obliquely toward the wing apex, terminating before reaching mid-width of the wing. There is a <b>narrow</b> silver <b>band</b> with metallic reflection extending from the costa to the dorsum at 5/6 length and the distal 1/6 is brown with a black dot centrally. The distal end is fringed with a <b>narrow</b> white <b>band</b> and terminating with a <b>narrow</b> black <b>band.</b> The hindwings {{of the females}} are dark brown.

There is a <b>narrow</b> silver <b>band</b> with metallic reflection extending from the costa to the dorsum at 5/6 length and the distal 1/6 is orange-brown with a black dot centrally, franked by a short white band near the dorsum.

5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
5|$|Later on August 11, {{the center}} of Etau became {{partially}} devoid of convection, with only a <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> of shower and thunderstorm activity persisting to the southeast of the center. Increasing wind shear prevented convection from redeveloping and the storm continued to weaken. Early the following day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well {{to the east of}} Japan. Roughly 24hours later, the JMA also downgraded the system to a tropical depression. The final advisory on Etau was issued by the JMA early on August14 as it slowly tracked northward.|$|E
5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> filter, Michelson interferometers {{exhibit a}} number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E
5|$|The Betsimisaraka {{constitute}} approximately 15 {{percent of}} the population of Madagascar and numbered over 1,500,000 in 2011. A sub-set of the population, the zana-malata, has partly European origins resulting from generations of intermarriage between the local Malagasy population and European pirates, sailors and traders who docked or settled along the eastern coast. Like the Sakalava to the west, the Betsimisaraka are composed of numerous ethnic sub-groups that formed a confederation in the early 18th century. Most Betsimisaraka are of mixed Bantu African and Asian Austronesian descent. The Betsimisaraka occupy a long, <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> of territory that stretches along the east coast of Madagascar from Mananjary in the south to Antalaha in the north, including the island's main port at Toamasina and the major towns of Fénérive Est and Maroansetra. They are often subdivided into northern Betsimisaraka (Antavaratra) and southern Betsimisaraka (Antatsimo), separated by the Betanimena Betsimisaraka sub-clan (called the Tsikoa before around 1710).|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E
