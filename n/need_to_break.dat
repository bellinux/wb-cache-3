5|$|In this episode, Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{look into}} the mysterious {{disappearance}} of a wealthy heiress and college board trustee, Selma Rose (Patty Hearst). The pair eventually find her in hiding {{in order to avoid}} a complex scam in which her husband would cheat her out of money in a divorce settlement. Meanwhile, Veronica investigates and eventually finds out some startling information related to the radical feminist Lilith House—that they faked several of the rapes supposedly perpetrated by the Hearst serial rapist. In addition, Logan and Veronica's relationship becomes even more tumultuous, with Logan eventually coming to the realization that they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up.|$|E
5|$|Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth {{to pitch}} two {{exhibition}} games in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, {{he was not}} restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for the screen in The Babe Ruth Story (1948)—that the young pitcher {{had a habit of}} signaling his intent to throw a curveball by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Perry portrays Chandler Bing, an {{executive}} in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one, but is lured {{back with a}} new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being {{the son of an}} erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor and bad luck in relationships. Chandler marries Monica in season seven, and they adopt twins {{at the end of the}} series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times. Matthew Perry has expressed his similarities to the character, such as his <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> an awkward silence with a joke and difficulties with women when first joining the show.|$|E

25|$|Seal: Depending on the season, Inuit {{hunt for}} {{different}} types of seal: harp seal, harbour seal, and bearded seal. Ringed seals are hunted all year, while harp seals are only available during the summer. Because seals <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the ice to reach air, they form breathing holes with their teeth and claws. Through these, Inuit hunters are able to capture seals. When a hunter arrives at these holes, {{they set up a}} seal indicator that alerts the hunter when a seal is coming up for a breath of air. When the seal comes up, the hunter notices movement in the indicator and uses his harpoon to capture the seal in the water.|$|E
25|$|According to Clayton Christensen, {{disruptive}} innovation {{is the key}} to future success in business. The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity. The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced {{to reduce the number of}} people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.|$|E
25|$|The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> German {{codes in}} World War II led to {{advances}} in cryptography and theoretical computer science, {{with the first}} programmable digital electronic computer being developed at England's Bletchley Park with the guidance of Alan Turing and his seminal work, On Computable Numbers. At the same time, military requirements motivated advances in operations research. The Cold War meant that cryptography remained important, with fundamental advances such as public-key cryptography being developed in the following decades. Operations research remained important as a tool in business and project management, with the critical path method being developed in the 1950s. The telecommunication industry has also motivated advances in discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory and information theory. Formal verification of statements in logic has been necessary for software development of safety-critical systems, and advances in automated theorem proving have been driven by this need.|$|E

25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E
25|$|Applied seals, by contrast, were {{originally}} used to seal a document closed: {{that is to}} say, the document would be folded and the seal applied {{in such a way}} that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels to indicate whether or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A letter writer would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by the top of the page, and then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on legal instruments applied directly to the face of the document, so that there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> them, and this use continues.|$|E

500|$|Even those who, like Debussy, opposed Wagner ("this old poisoner") {{could not}} deny his influence. Indeed, Debussy {{was one of}} many composers, {{including}} Tchaikovsky, who felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> with Wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming. [...] "Golliwogg's Cakewalk" [...] from Debussy's Children's Corner piano suite contains a deliberately tongue-in-cheek quotation from the opening bars of Tristan. Others who proved resistant to Wagner's operas included Gioachino Rossini, who said [...] "Wagner has wonderful moments, and dreadful quarters of an hour." [...] In the 20th century Wagner's music was parodied by Paul Hindemith and Hanns Eisler, among others.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Andrade was {{refining}} {{his theory of}} music. [...] He attempted to pull together his research into a general theory. [...] Concerned as always with Modernismo's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> from the past, he formulated {{a distinction between the}} classical music of 18th- and 19th-century Europe, and what he called the music of the future, which would be based simultaneously on modernist breakdowns of musical form and on an understanding of folk and popular music. [...] The music of the past, he said, was conceived in terms of space: whether counterpoint, with its multiple voices arranged in vertical alignment, or the symphonic forms, in which the dominant voice is typically projected on top of a complex accompaniment. [...] Future music would be arranged in time rather than space: [...] "moment by moment" [...] (in Luper's translation). [...] This temporal music would be inspired not by [...] "contemplative remembrance", but by the deep longing or desire expressed by the Portuguese word saudade.|$|E

Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted. But he was not attached to it... because he was searching for something much higher, much deeper. It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [...]" [...] Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation: [...] "The whole point to being here, really, is to figure a way to get out." ...|$|E

500|$|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 {{had been}} written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx {{recognised}} that the Manuscripts had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. [...] Accordingly, Marx recognised the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven [...] "Theses on Feuerbach". [...] The [...] "Theses on Feuerbach" [...] are best known for Thesis 11, which states that [...] "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, {{the point is to}} change it". This work contains Marx's criticism of materialism (for being contemplative), idealism (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world. It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's historical materialism, an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice. In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down Vorwärts!, with the interior minister, François Guizot, expelling Marx from France. At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.|$|E
