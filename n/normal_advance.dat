Most of the routing and data dissemination protocols of WSN assume a homogeneous network architecture, in which all sensors have the same capabilities in terms of battery power, communication, sensing, storage, and processing. However the continued advances in miniaturization of processors and low-power communications have enabled {{the development of a}} wide variety of nodes. When more than one type of node is integrated into a WSN, it is called heterogeneous. Multihop short distance communication is an important scheme to reduce the energy consumption in a sensor network because nodes are densely deployed in a WSN. In this paper M-EECDA (Multihop Energy Efficient Clustering & Data Aggregation Protocol for Heterogeneous WSN) is proposed and analyzed. The protocol combines the idea of multihop communications and clustering for achieving the best performance in terms of network life and energy consumption. M-EECDA introduces a sleep state and three tier architecture for some cluster heads to save energy of the network. M-EECDA consists of three types of sensor nodes: <b>normal,</b> <b>advance</b> and super. To become cluster head in a round normal nodes use residual energy based scheme. Advance and super nodes further act as relay node to reduce the transmission load of a normal node cluster head when they are not cluster heads in a round.

40|$|The Tordillo Formation is a {{continental}} clastic unit {{deposited in the}} Neuquén Basin during the Late Jurassic. This paper discusses the stratigraphy of the succession outcropping at the Quebrada del Sapo, with emphasis on the origin, dimensions and hierarchy of bounding surfaces of aeolian deposits. Field survey, supported by the measurement of three detailed stratigraphic sections and line drawings of photographic panels allow the identification of four unconformity bounded units within the succession, informally named as T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4. Units T 1 and T 3 are composed of conglomerates and pebbly sandstones deposited by density flows in a lacustrine environment. Paleocurrents indicate a source area located in the northeast while the presence of angular sandstone blocks suggests resedimentation processes. T 2 and T 4 units are composed of fine to medium grained sandstones of aeolian origin, characterized by large scale dunes and minor dry interdunes. Both units have sharp bases, and overlie a deflation surface characterized {{by the presence of}} ventifacts. Paleocurrents suggest a paleowind direction from the southwest. Internal bounding surfaces show a hierarchy of at least four discrete surfaces which were numbered according to their crescent extension. Type 1 surfaces are related to the <b>normal</b> <b>advance</b> of the dune front. Type 2 are reactivation surfaces within a single dune set. Type 3 surfaces relate to set superposition. Type 4 surfaces are related to extensive deflation of the dune complex, and define at least nine elementary aeolian sequences in the T 4 unit...|$|E
40|$|The early post-pollination {{phase of}} maize (Zea mays) {{development}} is particularly sensitive to water deficit stress. Using cDNA microarray, we studied transcriptional profiles of endosperm and placenta/pedicel tissues in developing maize kernels under water stress. At 9 d after pollination (DAP), placenta/pedicel and endosperm differed considerably in their transcriptional responses. In placenta/pedicel, 79 genes were significantly affected by stress and of these 89 % were up-regulated, whereas in endosperm, 56 genes were significantly affected and 82 % {{of these were}} down-regulated. Only nine of the stress-regulated genes were in common between these tissues. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that different sets of genes were regulated in the two tissues. After rewatering at 9 DAP, profiles at 12 DAP suggested that two regulons exist, one for genes responding specifically to concurrent imposition of stress, and another for genes remaining affected after transient stress. In placenta, genes encoding recognized stress tolerance proteins, including heat shock proteins, chaperonins, and major intrinsic proteins, were the largest class of genes regulated, {{all of which were}} up-regulated. In contrast, in endosperm, genes in the cell division and growth category represented a large class of down-regulated genes. Several cell wall-degrading enzymes were expressed at lower levels than in controls, suggesting that stress delayed <b>normal</b> <b>advance</b> to programmed cell death in the central endosperm. We suggest that the responsiveness of placenta to whole-plant stress factors (water potential, abscisic acid, and sugar flux) and of endosperm to indirect factors may play key roles in determining the threshold for kernel abortion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Directed cell {{migration}} {{is essential for}} normal development. In most of the migratory cell populations that have been analyzed in detail to date, all of the cells migrate as a collective from one location to another. However, there are also migratory cell populations that must populate the areas through which they migrate, and thus some cells get left behind while others advance. Very {{little is known about}} how individual cells behave to achieve concomitant directional migration and population of the migratory route. We examined the behavior of enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCCs), which must both advance caudally to reach the anal end and populate each gut region. RESULTS: The behavior of individual ENCCs was examined using live imaging and mice in which ENCCs express a photoconvertible protein. We show that individual ENCCs exhibit very variable directionalities and speed; as the migratory wavefront of ENCCs advances caudally, each gut region is populated primarily by some ENCCs migrating non-directionally. After populating each region, ENCCs remain migratory for at least 24 hours. Endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) signaling is known to be essential for the <b>normal</b> <b>advance</b> of the ENCC population. We now show that perturbation of EDNRB principally affects individual ENCC speed rather than directionality. The trajectories of solitary ENCCs, which occur transiently at the wavefront, were consistent with an unbiased random walk and so cell-cell contact is essential for directional migration. ENCCs migrate in close association with neurites. We showed that although ENCCs often use neurites as substrates, ENCCs lead the way, neurites are not required for chain formation and neurite growth is more directional than the migration of ENCCs as a whole. CONCLUSIONS: Each gut region is initially populated by sub-populations of ENCCs migrating non-directionally, rather than stopping. This might provide a mechanism for ensuring a uniform density of ENCCs along the growing gut. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three major}} contributions for WSNs. The {{first is a}} heterogeneous network model, the second is an energy consumption model, and the last is an EDDEEC routing protocol. The newly proposed routing protocol, EDDEEC, is evaluated using three types of nodes (three-level heterogeneous network model): <b>normal,</b> <b>advanced,</b> and super. The proposed protocol selects CHs {{on the basis of}} nodes’ residual energy. Super and advanced nodes have more energy than the normal ones. So, the super and advanced nodes are largely preferred to be selected as CHs for the initial transmission rounds, and when their energy decreases to the same level as that of the normal ones, these nodes will have the same CH election probability like the normal nodes. Therefore, energy is efficiently distributed over the network. EDDEEC prolongs the network lifetime, especially the stability period, by heterogeneity-aware clustering algorithm. Simulation results show that EDDEEC achieves longer stability period, network lifetime, and throughput than the other classical clustering algorithms in three-level and multi-level heterogeneous environments.|$|R
40|$|X {{irradiation}} of Pleurodeles embryos, at {{the beginning}} of cleavage, inhibits the lobulisation of the nuclei and the formation of small cytoplasmic invaginations which appear in the <b>normal</b> <b>advanced</b> blastulae. This inhibition seems to be closely linked to the inhibition of nuclear metabolism. An inhibition of the appearance of the outer granular constituent in the nucleoli would correspond to a decrease in rRNA synthesis. This inhibition is proportional to the X-ray dose. The lysis of the embryos is characterized by the existence of annulated lamellae either in or outside the nuclei and especially by the appearance of cytolysomes containing degenerated mitochondriae, vesicles of glycogen, lamellar structures. Finally, we have observed the presence of glycogen granules associated into chains in the intercellular spaces of both control and irradiated embryos. However, the irradiated embryos seem to be characterized by a higher content of glycogen; the inhibition of the utilisation of glycogen might explain this fact. © 1971 Academic Press Inc.

The effects of low or high hydraulic conductivity of the soil are also observed. The analyses were conducted with SEEP/W for the seepage and SLOPE/W for the slope stability. It is found that the lowest FS for gentle slope is reached under the application of advanced rainfall pattern and the lowest FS for steep slope is reached under the application of delayed rainfall pattern. Reduction of FS is known to be the largest for gentle slope rather than steep slope due to negative pore water pressure reduction and the rising of ground water level. The largest FS reduction caused by rainfall was achieved for gentle slope under advanced rainfall pattern...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} BEENISH protocol, where a network has four {{different}} energy levels of nodes: <b>normal,</b> <b>advanced,</b> super, and ultra-super. In this scheme, normal nodes have the less initial energy level {{as compared to}} ultra-super nodes that have the highest initial energy level. Following the same principle as of LEACH and DEEC, BEENISH rotates the CHs among nodes. In BEENISH, selection of CHs follow the probability that is the ratio between residual energy of each node and average energy of the network. Based on the residual energy, BEENISH chooses different epochs {{for each of the}} nodes. Nodes with higher energy are more often selected as CHs as compared to the lower energy ones. In some cases, ultra-super, super, and advanced nodes are more punished than the normal ones in BEENISH. iBEENISH solves this problem by dynamically adjusting the CH selection probability. Results show that BEENISH and iBEENISH achieve longer stability periods, enhanced network lifetime, and increased number of messages sent to the BS as compared to DEEC, DDEEC, and EDEEC, respectively. The sink mobility version of the proposed BEENISH and iBEENISH perform better than the non-sink mobility versions in terms of the selected performance evaluation parameters. This work is an extension of our previously published protocol BEENISH [15].|$|R
