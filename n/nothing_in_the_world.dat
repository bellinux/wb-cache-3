He also added that Gordon-Cumming was still protesting his innocence, despite signing a paper that [...] "practically admitted his guilt". The paper was then signed by the men present: the prince, Coventry, Williams, Wilson and his son, both Somersets, Lycett Green, Levett and Sassoon. Although the prince hoped that this would bring an end to the affair, Arthur Somerset pointed out that it would not remain secret. Edward asked him [...] "not even when gentlemen have given their word not to divulge it?"; Somerset replied that [...] "It is impossible, sir. <b>Nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> known to ten people was ever kept secret".|$|E

500|$|Inherit the Wind {{began an}} {{enduring}} collaboration between Stanley Kramer and Tracy—Kramer directed Tracy's three final films. Judgment at Nuremberg, released {{at the end}} of 1961, was their second feature together. [...] The film depicts the [...] "Judges' Trial", the trial of Nazi judges for their role in the Holocaust. Abby Mann wrote the role of Judge Haywood with Tracy in mind; Tracy called it the best script he had ever read. At the end of the film, Tracy delivered a 13-minute speech. He recorded it in one take, and received a round of applause from the cast and crew. Upon seeing the film, Mann wrote to Tracy: [...] "Every writer ought to have the experience of having Spencer Tracy do his lines. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> quite like it." [...] The film met with positive reviews and a large audience; Tracy received an eighth Oscar nomination for his performance.|$|E
500|$|Third Day, {{intending}} to [...] "shake things up", made some significant changes to its management {{prior to the}} production of Revelation. The band left Creative Trust Management and signed with Red Light, which represented such artists as Dave Matthews Band, Switchfoot, and Rodney Atkins. They also chose to work with mainstream producer Howard Benson, who had worked on projects with other bands that Third Day had enjoyed. Benson decided he wanted to work with Third Day after Chris Daughtry drew his attention to Mac Powell's vocal ability. Benson, who is Jewish, said that he enjoys working with Christian artists such as Third Day because they believe in something. He added that their different religious beliefs prompted discussions about faith between himself and the band, which Benson said [...] "comes out in the record because of the way I challenge them and they challenge me". Third Day were initially uncomfortable at first working with Benson, as the band's achievements in the Christian music realm meant <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of mainstream record production. Despite the band's insecurity at the start, they appreciated the experience the end of the process. The decision to use Benson led to the band recording the album in Los Angeles instead of Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 17, 1910. It states: [...] "Clara Moore is a society girl who has won the affections of Jack Cass, a young millionaire. He thinks she loves him, but it is really his money that she adores. Prompted by a letter of warning, Jack decides to prove his sweetheart's love. One reason is that he privately disapproves of the way Clara and her mother have treated a poor relation, an orphan girl, who has been left in their care. Instead of giving her a home, they make a servant of her. Jack's plot works like a charm. His faithful valet gives the newspapers {{the story of the}} failure of Jack's mind, and that young man's ruin. Clara reads it and when Jack calls and admits that the reports are correct, she returns his ring and says that all is over between them. In fact {{the only person in the}} house that shows any sympathy for Jack is the poor relation, May Dustin, and naturally he compares her with the heartless society girl. Jack wants to see more of May, and invents a unique way of doing so. He buys out the milkman who serves the family, and in that way is able to call on May everyday. Liking soon ripens into love, and May agrees to wed Jack, although thinking he has <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> but a meager salary. After marriage she is told the truth and finds that her husband has money enough to supply her every wish. As for Clara, she has lost her only chance to win a prized millionaire." ...|$|E

The Meiji era Japanese showed a contempt for other Asians. The Shōwa regime preached racial superiority and racialist theories, based on nature of Yamato-damashii.
