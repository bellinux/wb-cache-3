The modern approach is to fix {{once and for all}} the axiomatization of topological space and then speak of kinds of topological spaces.|$|E
25|$|Defining {{structure}} and detecting {{the emergence of}} complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analysed {{in terms of how}} model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in non-linear processes. An observer’s <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtly, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer’s chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data.|$|E

While the figures in his previous original paintings had been painted from sketches of models made in the studio or life classes, from now on he began to work from memory, {{and as a consequence}} his figures began to appear more idealised; Farr (1958) describes his figures from now on as [...] less to a particular aspect of the model than to a preconceived <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the model ought to look like".|$|E
500|$|McCain {{requested}} a combat assignment, and {{was assigned to}} the aircraft carrier [...] flying A-4 Skyhawks. His combat duty began when he was 30years old in mid-1967, when Forrestal was assigned to a bombing campaign, Operation Rolling Thunder, during the Vietnam War. Stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin, McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington, and he would later write that [...] "In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it took to win the war." ...|$|E

Blunkett was denied access to his seat at Olympic Stadium {{because there was no}} room for his guide dog, and had to watch the ceremony from seats in the stadium's gantry instead. However, Blunkett noted that this was an isolated incident and chose not to make an issue of it, simply advising organisers to [...] "seek to find a solution rather than impose a preconceived <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is or is not possible." ...|$|E

500|$|While he {{was working}} on vector {{analysis}} in the late 1870s, Gibbs discovered that his approach was similar to the one that Grassmann had taken in his [...] "multiple algebra". [...] Gibbs then sought to publicize Grassmann's work, stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to Hamilton's quaternionic algebra. [...] To establish priority of Grassmann’s ideas, Gibbs convinced Grassmann's heirs to seek the publication in Germany of the essay [...] "Theorie der Ebbe und Flut" [...] on tides that Grassmann had submitted in 1840 to the faculty at the University of Berlin, in which he had first introduced the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would later be called a vector space(linear space).|$|E
500|$|Punk {{rock bands}} often emulate the bare musical {{structures}} and arrangements of 1960s garage rock. Typical punk rock instrumentation includes {{one or two}} electric guitars, an electric bass, and a drum kit, along with vocals. Songs tend to be shorter than those of other popular genres. Punk songs were played at fast, [...] "breakneck" [...] tempos, an approach influenced by The Ramones. Most early punk rock songs retained a traditional rock 'n' roll verse-chorus form and 4/4 time signature. However, later bands have often broken from this format. In critic Steven Blush's description, [...] "The Sex Pistols were still rock'n'roll ... like the craziest version of Chuck Berry. Hardcore was {{a radical departure from}} that. It wasn't verse-chorus rock. It dispelled any <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> songwriting is supposed to be. It's its own form." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{publication}} of her novel, Margaret Mitchell was inundated with requests for a sequel but claimed {{to not have}} a <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened to Scarlett and Rhett, {{and that she had}} [...] "left them to their ultimate fate". Mitchell continued to resist pressure from Selznick and MGM to write a sequel until her death in 1949. In 1975, her brother, Stephens Mitchell (who assumed control of her estate), authorized a sequel to be jointly produced by MGM and Universal Studios on a budget of $12 million. Anne Edwards was commissioned to write the sequel as a novel which would then be adapted into a screenplay, and published in conjunction with the film's release. Edwards submitted a 775-page manuscript entitled Tara, The Continuation of Gone with the Wind, set between 1872 and 1882 focusing on Scarlett's divorce from Rhett; MGM was not satisfied with the story and the deal collapsed.|$|E

500|$|After Heppner {{introduced}} his bandmates to progressive rock, the band integrated minor influences from the genre in their songwriting and compositions, including touches of keyboards, while {{trying not to}} deviate too much {{from the sound of}} Hello Master. The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we want, the riffs and melodies just kind of come. The fact that Hello Master was a bit more on the poppy side and Prior to the Fire has a bit more edge to it is just where we're at right now with music."

500|$|On July 25, 1967, Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin {{and joined}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the 1965–1968 air interdiction and {{strategic}} bombing campaign against North Vietnam. [...] The alpha strikes flown from Forrestal were against specific, pre-selected targets such as arms depots, factories, and bridges. [...] They were quite dangerous, {{due to the}} strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses, which used Soviet-designed and -supplied surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and MiG jet interceptors. [...] McCain's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went without incident, and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations, McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator. McCain and his fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from Washington; he later wrote, [...] "The target list was so restricted that we had to go back and hit the same targets over and over again... Most of our pilots flying the missions believed that our targets were virtually worthless. In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it took to win the war." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Michael's birth, {{the family}} moved to Wetherden in Suffolk. Michael's {{education}} began in 1909, with a nursery governess and various private tutors who followed a [...] curriculum that included piano lessons—his first formal contact with music. There was a piano in the house, on which he [...] "took to improvising crazily... which I called 'composing', though I had only the vaguest <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> that meant". In September 1914 Michael became a boarder at Brookfield Preparatory School in Swanage, Dorset. He spent four years there, at one point earning notoriety by writing an essay that challenged the existence of God. In 1918 he won a scholarship to Fettes College, a boarding school in Edinburgh, where he studied the piano, sang in the choir, and began to learn to play the pipe organ. The school was not a happy place; sadistic bullying of the younger pupils was commonplace. When Michael revealed to his parents in March 1920 that he had formed a homosexual relationship with another boy, they removed him. He transferred to Stamford School in Lincolnshire, where a decade previously Malcolm Sargent had been a pupil.|$|E

500|$|In September 1960 Amazing {{began to}} carry Sam Moskowitz's series of author profiles, which {{had begun in}} Fantastic, the sister magazine. The {{following}} month the cover and logo were redesigned. In April 1961, the 35th anniversary of the first issue, Goldsmith ran several reprints, including stories by Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Goldsmith had little previous experience with science fiction, and bought what she liked, {{rather than trying to}} conform to a <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> science fiction should be. The result was the debut of more significant writers in her magazines than anywhere else at that time. She published the first stories of Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, Piers Anthony and Thomas M. Disch, among many others. Award-winning stories published during Goldsmith's editorship include Zelazny's [...] "He Who Shapes", a story about the use of dream therapy to cure phobias. It was serialized in the January and February 1965 issues, and won a Nebula Award, an annual award voted on by science fiction writers. Goldsmith often wrote long, helpful letters to her authors: Zelazny commented in a letter to her that [...] "Most of anything I have learned was stimulated by those first sales, and then I learned, and possibly even learned more, from some of the later rejections". Disch and Le Guin have also acknowledged the influence Goldsmith had on their early careers.|$|E
500|$|Fortitude South {{has been}} {{credited}} with ensuring the German 15th Army was not deployed against the Allied invasion force too soon and ensuring the success of Operation Overlord. Gerhard Weinberg stated that the Germans [...] "readily accepted the existence and location" [...] of FUSAG, believed {{the threat to the}} Pas de Calais was real and [...] "it was only at the end of July" [...] that they realized a second assault was not coming; [...] "by that time, {{it was too late to}} move reinforcements". However, Mary Barbier wrote [...] "it is time to consider that the importance of the deception has been overrated". She argues that 15th Army was largely immobile and not combat-ready, that despite the deception numerous German divisions – including the 1st SS Panzer Division, which was held in reserve behind the 15th Army – from across Europe were transferred to Normandy to repel the invasion, and that the Germans had realized as early as May that a real threat to Normandy existed. Barbier further commented that while the Germans believed the deception due to [...] "preconceived ideas about the importance of the Pas De Calais", the Allied staff had overestimated the effectiveness of the deception after the 15th Army's inaction because they held a [...] "preconceived <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> FORTITUDE would accomplish". Following the Battle of Normandy, the phantom 80th Division was [...] "transferred" [...] around the east coast of England, moving back and forth between VII Corps and the equally bogus II Corps. The division was eventually [...] "disbanded" [...] in April 1945.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{influential}} {{paper of}} Stalling is his 1983 article [...] "Topology on finite graphs". Traditionally, the algebraic structure of subgroups of free groups {{has been studied}} in combinatorial group theory using combinatorial methods, such as the Schreier rewriting method and Nielsen transformations. Stallings' paper put forward a topological approach based on the methods of covering space theory that also used a simple graph-theoretic framework. The paper introduced the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now {{commonly referred to as}} Stallings subgroup graph for describing subgroups of free groups, and also introduced a foldings technique (used for approximating and algorithmically obtaining the subgroup graphs) and the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now known as a Stallings folding. Most classical results regarding subgroups of free groups acquired simple and straightforward proofs in this set-up and Stallings' method has become the standard tool in the theory for studying the subgroup structure of free groups, including both the algebraic and algorithmic questions (see [...] ). In particular, Stallings subgroup graphs and Stallings foldings have been the used as a key tools in many attempts to approach the Hanna Neumann conjecture.|$|E
