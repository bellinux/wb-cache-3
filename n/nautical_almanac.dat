5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, {{the brightest star}} in Pavo. Its proper name — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was assigned by the British Her Majesty's <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac</b> Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.|$|E

25|$|Babbage's {{motivation}} to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation {{has been a}} commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance). The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account {{of the origin of}} the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac.</b> Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation. The issue of the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac</b> is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1869, while still {{serving as an}} officer in the United States Navy, Michelson started {{planning}} a repeat of the rotating-mirror method of Léon Foucault for measuring the speed of light, using improved optics and a longer baseline. He conducted some preliminary measurements using largely improvised equipment in 1878, about the same time that his work {{came to the attention of}} Simon Newcomb, director of the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac</b> Office who was already advanced in planning his own study. Michelson published his result of 299,910±50km/s in 1879 before joining Newcomb in Washington DC to assist with his measurements there. Thus began a long professional collaboration and friendship between the two.|$|E
25|$|President Ulysses S. Grant awarded Michelson {{a special}} {{appointment}} to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1869. During his four years as a midshipman at the Academy, Michelson excelled in optics, heat, climatology and drawing.

In 1879, he was posted to the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac</b> Office, Washington (part of the United States Naval Observatory), to work with Simon Newcomb. In the following year he obtained leave of absence to continue his studies in Europe. He visited the Universities of Berlin and Heidelberg, and the Collège de France and École Polytechnique in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Celestial {{navigation}} is {{a position}} fixing technique that was devised to help sailors cross the featureless oceans {{without having to}} rely on dead reckoning {{to enable them to}} strike land. Celestial navigation uses angular measurements (sights) between the horizon and a common celestial object. The Sun is most often measured. Skilled navigators can use the Moon, planets or one of 57 navigational stars whose coordinates are tabulated in <b>nautical</b> <b>almanacs.</b> Historical tools include a sextant, watch and ephemeris data. Today's space shuttle, and most interplanetary spacecraft, use optical systems to calibrate inertial navigation systems: Crewman Optical Alignment Sight (COAS), Star Tracker.|$|R

Edwards was introduced to the almanac project and Nevil Maskelyne, the fifth English Astronomer Royal, through her husband. John Edwards (c 1748-1784) had taken on piece-work as a computer to supplement the family income and received payment for work on 6 months' worth of each almanac from 1773 until his death in 1784. It was revealed that Edwards had done most of the calculations when she wrote to Maskelyne to ask if she could continue work to support herself and her daughters after her husband's death in 1784.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} was discontinued in 1920, when {{responsibility for}} the light was transferred to Trinity House, who decided {{to establish a new}} beacon at Burry Holms. However, after pleas from local yachtsmen, the light was relit in the 1980s. This gave an additional point of reference when navigating the waters between the Gower Peninsula and Burry Port: on dark nights, boat crews often found themselves on top of Whiteford Point before realizing the fact. The cost was £1,300, with £1,000 being funded by the Harbour Commissioners and the balance by Burry Port Yacht Club. The new light was fully automatic and switched on when daylight faded to a pre-determined level. Two <b>nautical</b> <b>almanacs</b> published in 1987, Reeds, and Macmillan and Silk Cut, listed Whiteford Lighthouse as flashing every five seconds.|$|R
500|$|Under optimal conditions, {{approximately}} 6,000 {{stars are}} {{visible to the}} naked eye of an observer on Earth. [...] Of these, 58 are known in the field of navigational astronomy as [...] "selected stars", including 19 stars of the first magnitude, 38 stars of the second magnitude, and Polaris.

[...] Criteria in the choice of stars includes their distribution across the celestial sphere, brightness, and ease of identification. [...] Information for another 115 stars, known as [...] "tabulated stars", is also available to the navigator. [...] This list provides information on the name, approximate position in the celestial sphere, and apparent magnitude of the 58 selected stars in tabular form and by star charts.|$|E
500|$|As a {{scientific}} {{member of the}} Board, Lax was one of eighteen men who were, according to Edmund Dews, [...] "ultimately responsible for the form and contents of the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac.</b> It {{would have been difficult}} in these years to select another group equally eminent in their field." [...] Lax was notable for his strong attendance record at the quarterly meetings, not missing a single meeting between 1822 – 25, a record equalled by only three other members, although non-attendance of meetings would have resulted in his not being paid his annual salary of £100. In 1828 Lax appended An easy method of correcting the lunar distance, on account of the spheroidal figure of the earth to the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac.</b> After the Board was dissolved in 1828 Lax unsuccessfully attempted to convince George Biddell Airy to aid in a campaign for its restoration. In 1834 a new edition of his nautical tables was published posthumously. Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor later concluded that all of Lax's works were [...] "of value to the art of navigation".|$|E

50|$|Celestial {{navigation}} {{is the use}} of angular measurements (sights) between celestial {{bodies and}} the visible horizon to locate one's position on the globe, on land as well as at sea. At a given time, any celestial body is located directly over one point on the Earth's surface. The latitude and longitude of that point is known as the celestial body’s geographic position (GP), the location of which can be determined from tables in the <b>Nautical</b> or Air <b>Almanac</b> for that year.|$|R
50|$|A {{fundamental}} ephemeris is {{the basis}} from which apparent ephemerides, phenomena, and orbital elements are computed for astronomical, <b>nautical,</b> and surveyors' <b>almanacs.</b> Apparent ephemerides give positions and motions of Solar System bodies as seen by observers {{from the surface of}} Earth, and are useful for astronomers, navigators, and surveyors in planning observations and in reducing the data acquired, although much of the work of latter two has been supplanted by GPS technology. Phenomena are events related to the configurations of Solar System bodies, for instance rise and set times, phases, eclipses and occultations, and have many civil and scientific applications. Orbital elements are descriptions of the motion of a body at a particular instant, used for further short-time-span calculation of the body's position when high accuracy is not required.|$|R
500|$|Lax {{was best}} known for his Remarks on a Supposed Error in the Elements of Euclid (1807) and his work {{regarding}} the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac,</b> which was an important reference for navigation in the period. An obituary claimed that [...] "To whatever Professor Lax applied, he made himself completely master of it". His daughter married Andrew Amos and through that line Lax is the grandfather of Sheldon Amos and the great grandfather of Maurice Amos, a notable legal dynasty.|$|E
500|$|Built by Trinity House in 1906, the foghorn {{building}} is a Grade II listed building. The siren was originally powered by a [...] engine, which gave two blasts in quick succession at two-minute intervals that could be clearly heard by people living on both coasts but for many years following World War II, the foghorn was heard as one long and one short blast and <b>nautical</b> <b>almanac</b> data as at 1965, stated that the interval was 1.5minutes. Volunteers from the Flat Holm Society, {{with help from the}} Prince's Trust, restored the horn and engines in the 1960s. The Foghorn Station was officially reopened by the Welsh Secretary and the Welsh Assembly First Secretary in May 2000 when the foghorn was sounded {{for the first time since}} 1988.|$|E
500|$|Navigators {{often use}} star charts to {{identify}} a star by its position relative to other stars. [...] References like the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac</b> and The American Practical Navigator provide four star charts, covering different portions of the celestial sphere. [...] Two of these charts are azimuthal equidistant projections of {{the north and south}} poles. [...] The other two cover the equatorial region of the celestial sphere, from the declination of 30° south to 30° north. [...] The two equatorial charts are mercator projections, one for the eastern hemisphere of the celestial sphere and one for the western hemisphere. [...] Note that unlike familiar maps, east is shown to the left and west is shown to the right. [...] With this orientation, the navigator can hold the star chart overhead, and the arrangement of the stars on the chart will resemble the stars in the sky.|$|E
500|$|Lax {{was elected}} to the Board of Longitude after he was {{nominated}} to the Lowndean chair in 1795, and remained on the board until it was dissolved in 1828. The Board was a governmental body charged with administering a scheme of prizes intended to encourage innovators {{to solve the problem of}} finding longitude at sea, which was vital for accurate navigation. Lax published a set of tables for use with the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Almanac</b> for finding latitude and longitude; these were published by the Board of Longitude in 1821, and whilst they were not considered to be of much practical use for seamen, they were described by The Nautical Magazine as a [...] "very meritorious attempt to solve the problems of nautical astronomy by one uniform system." [...] In 1821, the Board awarded Lax £1050 for his tables, which were intended to replace Nevil Maskelyne's Requisite Tables. However, the extraordinarily accurate chronometers of John Harrison were generally available from the 1820s onwards, rendering the lunar distance method, which Lax had used to create the tables, immaterial. Meanwhile, Edward Sabine criticised errors in Lax's work.|$|E
