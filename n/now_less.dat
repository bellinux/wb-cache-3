5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are <b>now</b> <b>less</b> popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
5|$|As the {{war began}} to draw to a close, the ships of Battleship Division Nine {{remained}} busy. With frequent gunnery drill, the ships showed marked improvement in performance compared to the early days with the Fleet.

5|$|Back at home, Quisling was <b>now</b> <b>less</b> {{concerned}} about Nasjonal Samling's membership and even wanted action {{to clean up}} the membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having to take this step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around to accept his government.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century various new {{industries}} were introduced, including lime quarrying. During {{the early decades}} of the 20th century the population exceeded 1,000; but this was followed by a lengthy decline. Although resident numbers are <b>now</b> <b>less</b> than 200, there was a small increase from 2001 to 2011. About a third of the population were recorded as Gaelic speaking at the former date. The modern economy is largely based on farming, fishing and tourism and the largest settlement is Achnacroish. Various shipwrecks have been recorded in the vicinity.|$|E

5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are <b>now</b> <b>less</b> likely to have long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it {{was believed to be}} a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
5|$|The Matriculation exam tested {{candidates}} on five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was <b>now</b> <b>less</b> than a week in which to catch up with a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{adventure}} games is {{the completion of}} the assigned quest. Early adventure games often had high scores and some, Zork, also assigned the player a rank, a text description based on their score. High scores provide the player with a secondary goal, and serve as an indicator of progression. While high scores are <b>now</b> <b>less</b> common, external reward systems, Xbox Live's Achievements perform a similar role.|$|E
25|$|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz {{has been}} adapted to other media {{numerous}} times, most famously in The Wizard of Oz, the 1939 film starring Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Bert Lahr. Until this version, {{the book had}} inspired a number of <b>now</b> <b>less</b> well known stage and screen adaptations, including a profitable 1902 Broadway musical and three silent films. The 1939 film was considered innovative because of its songs, special effects, and revolutionary use of the new Technicolor.|$|E

25|$|The eighth {{game was}} played on 18 November 2014. The opening was a Queen's Gambit Declined with 5.Bf4 which had won for Anand in game 3. Carlsen {{deviated}} from that game by playing 6...c5, an older line that was popular in the 1970s to 1990s but <b>now</b> <b>less</b> fashionable. During the game, Anand piled up a bishop and queen on the b1-h7 diagonal against Carlsen's king, but Carlsen was able to initiate a series of exchanges and obtain an easily drawn endgame.|$|E
25|$|Tallgrass prairies {{are found}} in the {{southern}} and eastern section of the great plains. It once covered 170 million acres in North America. <b>Now,</b> <b>less</b> than 4% remains, mostly in the Kansas Flint Hills. This area is lower and wetter than the High Plains and is warmer than many other regions. Some areas here receive more than 40 inches of annual precipitation. Grasses here include bluestems, along with many other species. Historically, many areas of the Midwest that are now forested were once tallgrass prairie. Fire is very important in maintaining the prairie. Without it, many areas can become forested.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} the drop {{in public and private}} {{investment}} in research is the economic slowdown. After peaking at 7.5% annual growth in 2010, the economy slowed before dipping into recession in 2015 (-3.7% growth). The government has been forced to adopt austerity measures and is <b>now</b> <b>less</b> able to collect revenue through the sectorial funds, since company profits are down in many quarters. Industrial output declined by 2.8% between November and December 2014 and by 3.2% over the entire year. The most recent data indicate that 2014–2015 {{may turn out to be}} the worst years in decades for industry, especially for the transformation subsector of the manufacturing industry’.|$|E

Also within Cheshire are manufacturing plants for Jaguar and Vauxhall Motors in Ellesmere Port. The county also has an aircraft industry, with the BAE Systems facility at Woodford Aerodrome, part of BAE System's Military Air Solutions division. The facility designed and constructed Avro Lancaster and Avro Vulcan bombers and the Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod. On the Cheshire border with Flintshire is the Broughton aircraft factory, more recently associated with Airbus.|$|E
25|$|Within Iraq, Annandale {{collected}} his specimens from a sandy lake-bed deposit, in {{the vicinity}} of Nasiriyah on the Euphrates. Eames and Wilkins found the species in borings made in the Hammar Marshes, and Plaziat and Younis found it in other localities of the Hammar Formation; they described it as a typical species of this formation. The deposits in Iraq where the species has been found are in brackish habitat (although Annandale believed the deposits to be freshwater, this was due to reworking), toward the outer edge of tidal influence in the Euphrates and Tigris. Much of the species' former habitat, as evidenced by subfossil remains, is <b>now</b> <b>less</b> brackish than it was when the fossils were deposited, meaning it is less likely to be extant in such places.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} a major gamble for Paxton, but {{circumstances}} were in his favour - he enjoyed a stellar reputation as a garden designer and builder, he was confident that his design was perfectly suited to the brief, and the Commission was now under enormous pressure to choose a design and get it built - the Exhibition opening was <b>now</b> <b>less</b> than a year away. In the event, Paxton's design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and {{it proved to be}} vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. Indeed, his submission was budgeted at a remarkably low £85,800 - by comparison, this was only about 2-1/2 times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth but it was only 28% of the estimated cost of Turner's design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over 770,000 sq.ft. (19 acres, or 7 hectares), would cover roughly twenty-five times the ground area of its progenitor.|$|E
