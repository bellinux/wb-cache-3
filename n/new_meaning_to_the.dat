5|$|Murphy {{hoped to}} produce a {{balanced}} depiction of religion, and he, Falchuk and series co-creator Ian Brennan worked {{to ensure that there}} was an equality between pro and anti-religious sentiments expressed. The episode features seven cover versions of songs, each of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the series' one-week debut high in the US.

By comparing {{the conflict of}} opposites present in The marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> approach given <b>to</b> it in other historically previous texts – as in Meister Ekhardt’s, Jacob Boheme’s and in some ancient Eastern traditions such as Taoism – <b>the</b> idea was <b>to</b> set a background to this spiritual conflict and to set Blake as an ‘inventor of his own precursors’, as Jorge Luis Borges would put. The study of these systems showed {{some of the reasons}} why Blake’s philosophy seems so outsider for post-Enlightment readers, filling a symbolic gap that I intended <b>to</b> diminish. Giving <b>new</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past is giving <b>new</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present. In this sense, the work of William Blake may dialogue with issues that have been intensely felt in post-modernity, such as the will for integration, expressed through polyvalence and environmentalism...|$|R

40|$|Metaphors are {{not only}} found in {{everyday}} use of language, but also in advertisements. The use of metaphorical expressions, specifically conceptual metaphors in advertisements, especially in the slogans, is very common because they can attract attention and they can give positive inferences for the advertisement messages.

The inference can be drawn by mapping the features of source domain on the target domain.

Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News.

Whatever effect this episode had upon the solitary,--and he had become so self-indulgent of his sorrow, and so careless of all that came between him and it, as to meet opposition with profound indifference,--the only appreciable result was a greater attraction for the solitude that protected him, and he grew even to love the bleak shore and barren sands that had proved so inhospitable to others.

He was accordingly [...] "approbated to preach" [...] by the Middlesex Association of Ministers on October 10, 1826. As a preacher, Emerson was interesting, though not particularly original. His talent seems to have been in giving <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old truths of religion.

[...] Although his sermons were always couched in scriptural language, they were touched with the light of that genius which avoids the conventional and commonplace. In his other pastoral duties Emerson was not quite so successful. It is characteristic of his deep humanity and his dislike for all fuss and commonplace that he appeared to least advantage at a funeral.

One cannot say but this is intensely interesting, and it affords the consolation which the humble (but not too humble) spirit may gather from witness of the past, that the fashion of this world and the pride of the eyes and all ruthless vainglory defeated themselves in ancient Rome, as they must everywhere when they can work their will. If one had thought that in magnitude and multitude some entire effect of beauty was latent, one had but to look at that huddle of warring forms, each with beauty in it, but beauty lost in the crazy agglomeration of temples and basilicas and columns and arches and statues and palaces, incredibly painted and gilded, and huddled into spaces too little for the least, and crowding severally upon one another, without relation or proportion. Their mass is supremely tasteless, almost senseless; that mob of architectural incongruities was not only without collective beauty, but it was without that far commoner and cheaper thing which we call picturesqueness. This has come to it through ruin, and we must give a <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> word vandalism if we would appreciate what the barbarians did for Rome in tumbling her tawdry splendor into the heaps which are now at least paint-able.

I mean the wander fever which suddenly displayed itself in the managing and editorial staffs of certain London newspapers. It began with the stampede of the entire staff of one of our most brilliant and enterprising weeklies to the banks of the Seine and the heights of Montmartre. The migration was a brief one, but it heralded an era of restlessness in the Press world which lent quite a <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> phrase ‘newspaper circulation.’ Other editorial staffs were not slow to imitate the example that had been set them. Paris soon dropped out of fashion as being too near home; Nürnberg, Seville, and Salonica became more favoured as planting-out grounds for the personnel of not only weekly but daily papers as well. The localities were perhaps not always well chosen; the fact of a leading organ of Evangelical thought being edited for two successive fortnights from Trouville and Monte Carlo was generally admitted to have been a mistake. And even when enterprising and adventurous editors took themselves and their staffs further afield there were some unavoidable clashings. For instance, the Scrutator, Sporting Bluff, and The Damsels’ Own Paper all pitched on Khartoum for the same week. It was, perhaps, a desire to out-distance all possible competition that influenced the management of the Daily Intelligencer, one of the most solid and respected organs of Liberal opinion, in its decision to transfer its offices for three or four weeks from Fleet Street to Eastern Turkestan, allowing, of course, a necessary margin of time for the journey there and back. This was, in many respects, the most remarkable of all the Press stampedes that were experienced at this time. There was no make-believe about the undertaking; proprietor, manager, editor, sub-editors, leader-writers, principal reporters, and so forth, all took part in what was popularly alluded to as the Drang nach Osten; an intelligent and efficient office-boy was all that was left in the deserted hive of editorial industry.” ...|$|E
