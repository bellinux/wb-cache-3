5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable <b>nozzles</b> close to its turbine. Two of these <b>nozzles</b> are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine <b>nozzles</b> only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled <b>nozzles</b> in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring <b>nozzles.</b> It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the <b>nozzles</b> are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the <b>nozzles</b> downwards.|$|E
5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable <b>nozzles.</b> The <b>nozzles</b> point rearward with the lever in the forward position for horizontal flight. With the lever back, the <b>nozzles</b> point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The usefulness of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a review}} on <b>nozzle</b> wear in abrasive water jet machining application. Wear of the <b>nozzle</b> becomes {{a major problem}} since it may affect the water jet machining performance. Design, materials, and life of the <b>nozzle</b> give significance effect to the <b>nozzle</b> wear. There are various parameters that may influence the wear rate of the <b>nozzle</b> such as <b>nozzle</b> length, <b>nozzle</b> inlet angle, <b>nozzle</b> diameter, orifice diameter, abrasive flow rate and water pressure. The wear rate of the <b>nozzle</b> can be minimized by controlling these parameters. The mechanism of wear in the <b>nozzle</b> is similar to other traditional machining processes which uses a cutting tool. The high pressure {{of the water and}} hard abrasive particles may erode the <b>nozzle</b> wall. A new <b>nozzle</b> using a tungsten carbide-based material has been developed to reduce the wear rate and improve the <b>nozzle</b> life. Apart from that, prevention of the <b>nozzle</b> wear has been achieved using porous lubricated <b>nozzle.</b> This paper presents a comprehensive review about the wear of abrasive water jet <b>nozzle...</b>|$|R
40|$|Static ground {{tests of}} a large scale lift/cruise thrust {{vectoring}} <b>nozzle</b> were conducted to establish: (1) vectoring performance 'in' and 'out' of ground effect; (2) thrust spoilage capability; (3) compatibility of the <b>nozzle</b> with a turbotip fan; and (4) the <b>nozzle</b> structural temperature distribution. Vectoring performance of a short coupled, vented <b>nozzle</b> design on a large scale, (60 %) basis was compared with small scale (4. 5 %) test <b>nozzle</b> results. The test <b>nozzle</b> was a "boilerplate" model of the MCAIR "D" vented <b>nozzle</b> configured for operation with the LF 336 /J 85 turbotip lift fan system. Calibration of the LF 336 /J 85 test fan with a simple convergent <b>nozzle</b> was performed with four different <b>nozzle</b> exit areas to establish reference thrust, <b>nozzle</b> pressure ratio, and <b>nozzle</b> corrected flow characteristics for comparison with the thrust vectoring <b>nozzle</b> data. Thrust vectoring tests with the 'D' vented <b>nozzle</b> were conducted over the range of vector angles between 0 and 117 deg for several different <b>nozzle</b> exit areas...|$|R
40|$|A <b>nozzle</b> {{assembly}} {{is described}} {{for use in}} a system that forms small gas-filled shells, which avoids the need for holding a miniature inner <b>nozzle</b> precisely concentric with a miniature outer <b>nozzle.</b> The outer <b>nozzle</b> has a diameter which is less than about 0. 7 millimeter, which results in fluid passing through the <b>nozzle</b> having a progressively greater velocity at locations progressively further from the walls of the outer <b>nozzle</b> across most of the <b>nozzle.</b> This highly variable velocity profile automatically forces gas {{to the center of the}} outer <b>nozzle.</b> The end of the inner <b>nozzle,</b> which emits gas, is spaced upstream from the tip of the outer <b>nozzle,</b> to provide a distance along which to center the gas. This self-centering characteristic permits the inner <b>nozzle</b> to be positioned so its axis is not concentric with the axis of the outer <b>nozzle...</b>|$|R
5|$|It was {{powered by}} two {{turbofan}} engines with each {{in a separate}} engine nacelle with S-ducts, to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine <b>nozzles,</b> instead of thrust vectoring <b>nozzles</b> as on the YF-22. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Design Bureau started {{research}} on thrust vectoring {{as early as}} 1983, when the Soviet government tasked the bureau with the separate development of the Su-27M, which was an upgrade of the Su-27. At the insistence of General Director Mikhail Simonov, {{who had been the}} chief designer of the Su-27, Sukhoi and the Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute studied axisymmetrical vectoring <b>nozzles.</b> This was in contrast to the prevailing focus on two-dimensional <b>nozzles</b> in the Western press. Lyulka (later Lyulka-Saturn) also began studies of thrust-vectoring engines in 1985. By the late 1980s, Sukhoi were evaluating their research using the its flying test beds.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, on 13April1961, HSA {{decided to}} conduct {{preliminary}} {{work on a}} supersonic derivative of the P.1127 {{under the guidance of}} Ralph Hooper. This would result in a new design, designated P.1150, which was 50% larger than the preceding P.1127; it was proposed that a new performance enhancing feature be adopted {{in the form of the}} plenum chamber burning (PCB)– essentially an afterburner – in the engine. The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four swivelling exhaust <b>nozzles,</b> the front <b>nozzles</b> of which were to be equipped with PCB. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the P.1150 was to have been capable of Mach 1.3.|$|E
50|$|The afterburners on combat {{aircraft}} require a bigger <b>nozzle</b> to prevent adversely affecting {{the operation of}} the engine. The variable area iris <b>nozzle</b> consists of a series of moving, overlapping petals with a nearly circular <b>nozzle</b> cross-section and is convergent to control {{the operation of the}} engine. If the aircraft is to fly at supersonic speeds, the afterburner <b>nozzle</b> may be followed by a separate divergent <b>nozzle</b> in an ejector <b>nozzle</b> configuration, as below, or the divergent geometry may be incorporated with the afterburner <b>nozzle</b> in the variable geometry con-di <b>nozzle</b> configuration, as below.|$|R

40|$|This project {{presents}} the study about development and analysing existing technology of designation in an indirect injection diesel injector of a diesel engine. The {{objective of this}} project is to design the new spray <b>nozzle</b> by using calculated data of the chosen aspect, fabricate the new <b>nozzle</b> and the new <b>nozzle</b> injector can be used and able to function. The scopes of this research are reviewing the important devices that related to the experiment, studying the properties of spray <b>nozzle</b> in fuel injector, fabricate the new fuel injector <b>nozzle</b> using the suitable process after design it using Solidworks and testing the performance and spray pattern of new <b>nozzle</b> injector using the <b>nozzle</b> tester. Experiment was done by supplying pressure at 104 bar and 124 bar by using <b>nozzle</b> tester. The image of spray from <b>nozzle</b> injector was captured and the result based on criteria shows that the new <b>nozzle</b> injector can function properly. The new <b>nozzle</b> injector occupies lesser space compared from previous <b>nozzle</b> injectors that are too bulky and large. The new <b>nozzle</b> injector offers improvements over the previous <b>nozzle</b> injector in installation...|$|R
5|$|During {{test flights}} of the Su-27Ms, {{which began in}} 1988, {{engineers}} discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high angles of attack due to the ineffectiveness of flight control surfaces at low speeds. The decision was therefore made to install thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association in the country's Far East and was {{being used as a}} radar test bed. Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the <b>nozzles</b> to the aircraft. Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight cleared. Therefore the aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring <b>nozzles</b> of the AL-37FU. The aircraft was rolled out in May. Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its <b>nozzles</b> could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the pitch axis, and can deflect together or differentially.|$|E
5|$|Following test Baker {{decontamination}} problems, the United States Navy equipped newly constructed {{ships with}} a CounterMeasure WashDown System (CMWDS) of piping and <b>nozzles</b> to cover exterior {{surfaces of the}} ship with a spray of salt water from the firefighting system when nuclear attack appeared imminent. The film of flowing water would theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{is used in}} alloys with iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, {{and other}} metals. An alloy used for liquid rocket {{thruster}} <b>nozzles,</b> for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nozzle</b> {{extension}} — <b>nozzle</b> expander of reaction/rocket engine. The {{application of}} <b>nozzle</b> extensions improves efficiency of rocket engines in vacuum by increasing <b>nozzle</b> ratio. As a rule, their modern design assumes use of carbon-carbon materials without regenerative cooling. Along with sliding expanders, stationary <b>nozzle</b> extensions have some applications too.|$|R

The vanes are circumferentially and rotatably mounted to the concentric support forming a <b>nozzle</b> infinitely positionable between a first position corresponding to a minimum area <b>nozzle</b> and a second position corresponding to a maximum area <b>nozzle.</b> A closer, which is preferably a shape memory alloy (SMA), urges the <b>nozzle</b> toward the first position corresponding to a minimum area <b>nozzle.</b> Periodically spaced openers act between adjacent vanes to urge the <b>nozzle</b> to a second position corresponding to a maximum area <b>nozzle...</b>|$|R
5|$|Su-37: Technology demonstrator, {{converted}} from the eleventh developmental Su-27M (T10M-11). The Su-37 featured a digital fly-by-wire flight-control system, a glass cockpit, the N011M radar, and AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring <b>nozzles.</b> The aircraft was later fitted with standard-production AL-31F engines, and had its flight-control system and cockpit systems revised.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier was {{typically}} {{used as a}} ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier {{is powered by a}} single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring <b>nozzles</b> for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction <b>nozzles</b> are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust <b>nozzles</b> to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the <b>nozzles</b> above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
40|$|A D vented thrust {{deflecting}} <b>nozzle</b> {{applicable to}} subsonic V/STOL aircraft was tested behind a simulated turbofan engine in the verticle thrust stand. <b>Nozzle</b> thrust, fan operating characteristics, <b>nozzle</b> entrance conditions, and static pressures were measured. <b>Nozzle</b> performance was measured for variations in exit area and thrust deflection angle. Six core <b>nozzle</b> configurations, {{the effect of}} core exit axial location, mismatched core and fan stream <b>nozzle</b> pressure ratios, and yaw vane presence were evaluated. Core <b>nozzle</b> configuration affected performance at normal and engine out operating conditions. Highest vectored <b>nozzle</b> performance resulted for a given exit area when core and fan stream pressure were equal. Its is concluded that high <b>nozzle</b> performance can be maintained at both normal and engine out conditions through control of the <b>nozzle</b> entrance Mach number with a variable exit area...|$|R
50|$|The Kolesov RD-36-51 had {{an unusual}} {{variable}} con-di <b>nozzle</b> for the <b>nozzle</b> pressure ratios at supersonic speeds. Without an afterburner {{there was no}} variable <b>nozzle</b> already available. A translating plug <b>nozzle</b> was used.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>nozzle</b> is the de Laval <b>nozzle,</b> a fixed geometry <b>nozzle</b> with a high expansion-ratio. The large bell- or cone-shaped <b>nozzle</b> extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.|$|R
5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the new engine controller unit; lower liquid oxygen temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust <b>nozzles.</b> New ablative insulation and heaters were to be tested during the series.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{were again}} {{hampered}} {{when it was}} discovered the pressure relief valves on the standpipes were improperly adjusted when installed in the building. The Philadelphia Fire Department <b>nozzles</b> allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene.|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default <b>nozzles</b> for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional <b>nozzles</b> for FLUDD which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's <b>nozzles</b> use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E
40|$|Rocket engines <b>nozzle</b> {{performance}} {{changes as}} a vehicle climbs through the atmosphere. An altitude compensating <b>nozzle,</b> ACN, is intended to improve on a fixed geometry bell <b>nozzle</b> that performs at optimum at only one trajectory point. In addition to <b>nozzle</b> performance, <b>nozzle</b> transient loads are an important consideration. Any <b>nozzle</b> experiences large transient toads when shocks pass through the <b>nozzle</b> at start and shutdown. Additional transient toads will occur at transitional flow conditions. The objectives of cold flow <b>nozzle</b> testing at MSFC are CFD benchmark / calibration and Unsteady flow / sideloads. Initial testing performed with 2 -D inserts to 14 " transonic wind tunnel.

5|$|Su-35UB: Two-seat trainer {{designed}} and built by KnAAPO. The single aircraft (T-10UBM-1) featured the canards and taller vertical tails of the Su-27M and a forward fuselage similar to the Su-30MKK. The Su-35UB also shared the avionics suite of the Su-30MKK, although it had a different fly-by-wire flight-control system to accommodate the canards. The aircraft was powered by AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring <b>nozzles.</b> Although a training aircraft, the Su-35UB {{was designed to be}} fully combat-capable.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine <b>nozzles</b> and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} P.1127s crashed, {{the second and}} third {{occurring}} during development. In 1963, the first prototype, XP831, publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by a speck of dirt in the air feed lines of the nozzle control motor, which had caused the engine <b>nozzles</b> to stick. XP831 was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.|$|E
