5|$|As the North West trade {{developed}} {{it became}} riskier to depend solely upon acquiring sea otter furs through {{trade with the}} indigenous people of the coast. Diversification began {{in the first decade}} of the 19th century if not earlier, and increased over time. Maritime fur trading voyages were no longer solely about taking sea otter furs from the North West Coast to Canton. Other commodities and markets throughout the Pacific were added to the system. Sandalwood, mainly from Hawaii, became an important item of the China trade. Just as the sea otter trade was waning the sandalwood trade boomed, peaking in 1821, then declined. Hawaiian sandalwood was depleted by 1830. Fiji and the Marquesas Islands were the other principal sources of sandalwood. Most had been cut by 1820. Fiji was also a source of bêche-de-mer, a gourmet delicacy in China. American traders began acquiring Fijian bêche-de-mer in 1804 and trepanging boomed there. Bêche-de-mer became Fiji's leading export by 1830. Depletion led to a decline and the end of the trade by 1850. Trepanging was also done from 1812 in Hawaii and from 1814 in the Marquesas. Other side trades included Chilean copper from Valparaíso, scrimshaw (whale teeth), tortoise shells and meat from the Galápagos Islands, sugar from Manila, and, from Java, areca nuts (so-called betel nuts) and coffee beans. Sealing boomed in the Juan Fernández Islands and the Juan Fernández fur seal was rapidly exploited to near-extinction. The <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> rookeries were controlled by Russia, so Americans acquired <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> skins through trade rather than sealing.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E
25|$|The Oregon Question {{originated}} in the 18th century during the early European or American exploration of the Pacific Northwest. Various Empires began to consider the area suitable for colonial expansion, including the Americans, Russians, Spanish and British. Naval captains such as the Spanish Juan José Pérez Hernández, British George Vancouver and American Robert Gray gave defining regional water formations like the Columbia River and the Puget Sound their modern names and charted in the 1790s. Overland explorations were commenced by the British Alexander Mackenzie in 1792 and later followed by the American Lewis and Clark expedition, which reached {{the mouth of the}} Columbia River in 1805. These explorers often claimed in the name of their respective governments sovereignty over the Northwest Coast. The knowledge of fur-bearing animal populations like the California sea lion, North American beaver and the <b>Northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> were used to create an economic network called the maritime fur trade. The fur trade would remain the main economic interest that drew Euro-Americans to the Pacific Northwest for decades. Merchants exchanged goods for fur pelts along the coast with indigenous nations such as the Chinookan people, the Aleuts and the Nuu-chah-nulth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal's</b> range {{overlaps}} {{almost exactly}} {{with that of}} Steller sea lions; occasional cohabitation occurs at reproductive rookeries, notably in the Kurils, the Commander Islands, and Tyulen'i Islands.

500|$|Adult male {{pinnipeds}} {{have several}} strategies to ensure reproductive success. Otariids establish territories containing resources that attract females, such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territorial boundaries are usually marked by natural {{breaks in the}} substrate, and males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually avoided. Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the Steller sea lion and <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> a dominant male can maintain a territory {{for as long as}} 2–3 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce them, but in some species such as the <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> South American sea lion and Australian sea lion, males can successfully contain females in their territories and prevent them from leaving. In some phocid species, like the harbor seal, Weddell seal and bearded seal, the males have underwater territories called [...] "maritories" [...] near female haul-out areas. These are also maintained by vocalizations. The maritories of Weddell seal males can overlap with female breathing holes in the ice.|$|E
500|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 35 {{pinniped}} species. With the Japanese {{sea lion}} and the Caribbean monk seal recently extinct, ten more are considered at risk, {{as they are}} ranked [...] "Critically Endangered" [...] (the Mediterranean and Hawaiian monk seals), [...] "Endangered" [...] (Galápagos fur seal, Australian sea lion, Caspian seal and Galápagos sea lion), and [...] "Vulnerable" [...] (<b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> hooded seal and New Zealand sea lion). Three species—the walrus, the ribbon seal, and the spotted seal—have a [...] "Data Deficient" [...] ranking. Species that live in polar habitats are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} recent and ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice. There has been some debate over the cause of the decline of Steller sea lions in Alaska since the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds {{conserve}} {{heat with}} their large and compact body size, insulating blubber and fur, and high metabolism. In addition, {{the blood vessels}} in their flippers are adapted for countercurrent exchange. Veins containing cool blood from the body extremities surround arteries, which contain warm blood received from {{the core of the}} body. Heat from the arterial blood is transferred to the blood vessels, which then recirculate blood back to the core. The same adaptations that conserve heat while in water tend to inhibit heat loss when out of water. To counteract overheating, many species cool off by flipping sand onto their backs, adding a layer of cool, damp sand that enhances heat loss. The <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> [...] to help stay cool, while monk seals often dig holes in the sand to expose cooler layers to rest in.|$|E

500|$|Otariids {{are also}} known as eared seals due to the {{presence}} of pinnae. These animals rely on their well-developed fore-flippers to propel themselves through the water. They can also turn their hind-flippers forward and [...] "walk" [...] on land. The anterior end of an otariid's frontal bones extends between the nasal bones, and the supraorbital foramen is large and flat horizontally. The supraspinatous fossas are divided by a [...] "secondary spine" [...] and the bronchi are divided anteriorly. Otariids consist of two types: sea lions and fur seals. Sea lions are distinguished by their rounder snouts and shorter, rougher pelage, while fur seals have more pointed snouts, longer fore-flippers and thicker fur coats that include an undercoat and guard hairs. The former also tend to be larger than the latter. Five genera and seven species (one now extinct) of sea lion are known to exist, while two genera and nine species of fur seal exist. While sea lions and fur seals have historically been considered separate subfamilies (Otariinae and Arctocephalinae respectively), a 2001 genetic study found that the <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> is more closely related to several sea lion species. This is supported by a 2006 molecular study that also found that the Australian sea lion and New Zealand sea lion are more closely related to Arctocephalus than to other sea lions.|$|E
2500|$|Slipping {{into the}} waters {{off the coast of}} California, we have the California sea lion, which can grow up to seven feet long and hangs out in shallow ocean water, beaches and rocks. With its habitat in the open ocean, a less {{commonly}} seen animal is the northern elephant seal which can grow up to a massive [...] and has a population of just over 150,000. The California ocean is home to six species of seals: Guadalupe fur seal, <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> northern sea lion, California sea lion, northern elephant seal and harbor seal.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable sights on the island are the <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> rookeries. The Pribilof Islands support {{about half of the}} global population, with some of the {{individual}} rookeries on Saint Paul Island containing over 100,000 seals. [...] In late May, the male seals begin to arrive and stake out their territories in preparation for the arrival of the females, who typically arrive during the third week of June. The females give birth soon after making landfall, and by mid-July there will be hundreds of young pups around the island. [...] On June 1, the rookeries are closed and remain off limits until mid-October. During the summer these marine mammals may be viewed, by permit, from blinds at two rookeries.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the composition and size of prey consumed by <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Callorhinus ursinus) in the eastern Bering Sea. Eighty three <b>northern</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> were collected in the summer and fall of 1981, 1982, and 1985 for examination of gastrointestinal contents. A total of 139 midwater and bottom trawls were collected to determine the availability of potential prey. Analysis of trawls confirmed that seals are size-selective midwater feeders during their breeding and haul-out season in the eastern Bering Sea. Juvenile walleye pollock and gonatid squid, 5 - 20 cm in body length, were the primary prey, but seal prey varied among years and between nearshore and pelagic sample locations. Interannual variation in body sizes of walleye pollock consumed by seals was related to pollock year class strength. The identification of pollock and gonatid squid as primary <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> prey in the eastern Bering Sea was consistent with previous reports.
