In the introduced pressurization strategy, a <b>non-condensable</b> <b>gas</b> was charged, and the steam generated, by the phase change of the working fluid during operation, was used as a pressurization source. The feasibility of the pressure control mechanism was experimentally studied using test sections containing nitrogen gas and water as <b>non-condensable</b> <b>gas</b> and working fluid, respectively. Consequently, it was confirmed that the internal pressure of the hybrid heat pipe was increased up to 19. 0 &# 8239;bar through the self-pressurization mechanism under the conditions in which the experiments were conducted.

The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and <b>non-condensable</b> <b>gases</b> are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section.

The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters.

We obtain that the number of parametersto be specified in the boundary conditions depends on whether the condensing vapor flow is subsonic or supersonic. Thisbehavior has earlier been found numerically. We want to stress that our results are valid for any finite number of velocities.
