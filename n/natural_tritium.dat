40|$|Environmental tritium {{was first}} {{observed}} in a helium fraction at a liquid air production facility in Germany in 1949. During the 1950 s and early 1960 s, huge amounts of artificial tritium were released into the atmosphere by nuclear testing. The environmental tritium level increased to more than 200 times the <b>natural</b> <b>tritium</b> level. Since the signing of a test ban treaty in 1963, the environmental tritium level has decreased, and analysis of recent Japanese rain samples {{has shown that the}} environmental tritium level is close to that before the nuclear testing. Tritium released from nuclear bombs into the atmosphere {{has been used as a}} global-scale tracer in studies on water mass movement in the ocean, groundwater flow and atmospheric air mass movement. Useful and valuable results have been obtained in those studies. In the atmosphere, tritium exists in three different chemical forms: hydrogen (HT), water vapor (HTO) and hydrocarbons (CH 3 T). The concentration of HT the highest, followed by those of CH 3 T and HTO. The most interesting feature of these chemical species is their significantly different specific activities. HT has 106 TU, CH 3 T has 104 TU and HTO has 10 TU, suggesting that HT and CH 3 T have been released from nuclear facilities. Vegetation is sensitively responds to a change in environmental HTO level by rapid exchange of water molecules between leaf water and atmospheric water vapor. HTO vapor released into the air slowly contaminates soil water. A nuclear fusion facility is planed to use a large quantity of tritium that is comparable to <b>natural</b> <b>tritium</b> on the earth, indicating the necessity to maintain tritium in a nuclear fusion facility and the necessity to carefully monitor the environmental tritium level...|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} configuration and hydrological {{dynamics of}} meromictic pit lakes is often complex {{and needs to}} be studied by different tools including stable and radiogenic isotopes. This study combines a multi-isotopic approach (3 Hw, δ 2 Hw, δ 18 Ow, δ 34 SSO 4) with meteorological, hydrological and hydrochemical monitoring to deduce the flooding history and hydrological dynamics of a meromictic and deeply stratified pit lake (Cueva de la Mora mine, SW Spain). The mine system is complex and includes horizontal galleries, shafts and large rooms physically connected to the mine pit. Specific conductance and temperature profiles obtained in the pit lake draw a physical structure with four monimolimnetic sub-layers of increasing density with depth. This characteristic stratification with m-scale layers separated by sharp transitional zones is rather unusual in other pit lakes and in most <b>natural</b> lakes. <b>Tritium</b> abundance in the different layers indicates that the deep lake water entered the pit basin between 1971 and 1972 which is coincident with the dates of mine closure. The oxygen and deuterium isotope composition of the different layers describes a marked and stable stratification, with an increasing evaporative influence towards the lake surface and a minimal influence of groundwater flow on the structure and composition of the monimolimnion. This study reveals that the initial stages of flooding (via influx of metal- and sulfate-loaded mine drainage from underlying galleries at different depths) may be essential to imprint a layered physical structure to pit lakes which {{would be very difficult to}} explain merely by physical processes. After reaching its present water level and morphology, the monimolimnion of this pit lake seems to have remained essentially isolated and chemically unmodified during decades...|$|R

Also, it can be a cause of leukemia or skeletal cancer. This is because of its chemical propinquity and alkaline earth metallic characteristics. For this reason, its characteristics and migration in the environment are widely studied. Drinking waters and fresh waters usually contain many <b>natural</b> radionuclides; Strontium, <b>tritium,</b> radon, radium and uranium isotopes, etc. In recent years, there has been an increase in the usage of zeolites in different compositions to remove and bury different radio-contaminations [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Zeolites are porous crystalline structurally— hydrated alumina silicates of group IA and IIA elements such as sodium, potassium, barium, magnesium and calcium. One of the most significant properties of zeolites is their ability to exchange cations. Clinoptilolite (Cp) is one of a very cheap, available and the most abundant natural zeolites is in the chemical class of family of Heulandite (HEU-type), easily obtained from mines, appropriate as a sorbent due to its natural characteristics [13, 14].|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper reviews diffuse {{recharge}} {{studies in}} (semi) arid northern China, which are mainly based on environmental tracers of the unsaturated zone (chloride mass balance, <b>natural</b> <b>tritium,</b> artificial tritium, and bromine). Diffuse recharge {{in the northwestern}} part is commonly less than 3. 6 mm/yr, where precipitation is less than 200 mm/yr and groundwater is mainly recharged by mountain runoff. The recharge rates increase in the rain-fed Loess Plateau, ranging from 30 - 100 mm/yr beneath the main crop (wheat). Due to enhanced irrigation in the North China Plain, it can reach thousands of millimeters per year. Due to the limited recharge and sometimes thick unsaturated zone, some shallow groundwaters (e. g., the western Ordos basin and desert area) in northwestern China are even palaeowaters (1. 6 - 30 ka). Insufficient groundwater recharge cannot make a mass balance aquifer under present water exploitation patterns. Mining unrenewable water resources has caused severe water-table subsidence (0. 5 - 2 m/yr). Several suggestions based on the limited groundwater recharge rate and water table subsidence in northern China were proposed for groundwater sustainable utilization...|$|E

We drilled an ice core through a 7. 1 m thick ice body filling a large cavern of the dynamic ice cave Eisenriesenwelt (Austria). In addition to visual core inspections, quasi-continuous measurements at 2 cm resolution comprised particulate matter, stable water isotope (&delta; 18 O, &delta;D) and electrolytic conductivity profiles supplemented by specifically selected samples analysed for tritium and radiocarbon. We found that recent ablation led to an almost complete loss of bomb derived tritium removing any ice accumulated, since at least, the early fifties leaving the actual ice surface even below the <b>natural</b> <b>tritium</b> level. The small particulate organic masses made radiocarbon dating inconclusive, though a crude estimate gave a maximum ice age {{in the order of}} several thousand years. The visual stratigraphy and all investigated parameters showed a clear dichotomy between the upper 4 m and the bottom 3 m of the core, which points to a substantial change in the ice formation process. Main features of the core comprise the changing appearance and composition of distinct cyro-calcite layers, a extremely low total ion content and a surprisingly high variability of the isotope signature.

40|$|The {{chemical}} and isotopic compositions of CO 2 -rich water (Pco 2 ≈ 1 atm) in Korea mainly occurring in granitic terrain were investigated. CO 2 -rich waters {{can be divided}} into three types based on chemical compositions: Na-HCO 3, Ca-Na-HCO 3 and Ca-HCO 3 types. Water chemistry indicates that these waters were evolved through a strong reaction of the host rocks with a supply of deep-seated CO 2 during deep circulation. The dissolution process of plagioclase is important in water/granite interactions and its solubility changes with reaction temperature {{played an important role in}} the determination of chemical composition. Multi-component mineral/water equilibrium calculations indicate that the CO 2 -rich water reaches temperature of 115 - 140 °C. δ 18 O and δD data indicate that CO 2 -rich waters were derived from local meteoric water and have a lighter isotope composition than other <b>natural</b> waters. The <b>tritium</b> contents show a long residence time and the possibility of CO 2 flux in an aquifer at great depth. There is a strong indication of mixing between deep CO 2 -rich water and recent fresh water during ascent to the surface.

40|$|The {{present study}} has been aimed for the {{assessment}} of isotope element Tritium (3 H). It is a great threat to human health and environment for lengthy duration. The tritium exists in earth in diverse forms such as (1) small amounts of <b>natural</b> <b>tritium</b> are produced by alpha decay of lithium- 7, (2) natural atmospheric tritium is also generated by secondary neutron cosmic ray bombardment of nitrogen, (3) atmospheric nuclear bomb testing in the 1950 s, although the contribution from nuclear power plants is small. Tritium or 3 H is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a half-life of 12. 32  ±  0. 02  years. Water samples from ground water, surface water, and precipitation were collected from different locations in Gujarat area and were analyzed for the same. Distillation of samples was done to reduce the conductivity. Deuterium and Hydrogen were removed by the process of physico-chemical fractionation in the tritium enrichment unit. The basis of physico-chemical fractionation is the difference in the strength of bonds formed by the light vs. the heavier isotope of a given element. A total of 10 cycles (runs) were executed using Quintals process. Tritium concentration files were created with help of WinQ and Quick start software in Quintals process (Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer).

40|$|International audienceImproving the {{representation}} of the hydrological cycle in atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) {{is one of the main}} challenges in modeling the Earth's climate system. One way to evaluate model performance is to simulate the transport of water isotopes. Among those available, tritium is an extremely valuable tracer, because its content in the different reservoirs involved in the water cycle (stratosphere, troposphere, and ocean) varies by order of magnitude. Previous work incorporated <b>natural</b> <b>tritium</b> into Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique Zoom (LMDZ) -iso, a version of the LMDZ general circulation model enhanced by water isotope diagnostics. Here for the first time, the anthropogenic tritium injected by each of the atmospheric nuclear bomb tests between 1945 and 1980 has been first estimated and further implemented in the model; it creates an opportunity to evaluate certain aspects of LDMZ over several decades by following the bomb tritium transient signal through the hydrological cycle. Simulations of tritium in water vapor and precipitation for the period 1950 – 2008, with both natural and anthropogenic components, are presented in this study. LMDZ-iso satisfactorily reproduces the general shape of the temporal evolution of tritium. However, LMDZ-iso simulates too high a bomb tritium peak followed by too strong a decrease of tritium in precipitation. The too diffusive vertical advection in AGCMs crucially affects the residence time of tritium in the stratosphere. This insight into model performance demonstrates that the implementation of tritium in an AGCM provides a new and valuable test of the modeled atmospheric transport, complementing water stable isotope modeling...|$|E

40|$|Fusion {{is seen by}} many as the {{ultimate}} energy source, capable of providing safe, clean and sustainable energy. Research has been carried out into fusion since the 1920 s and substantial progress has been made. While {{the ultimate}} goal of providing energy from fusion remains elusive there is a clear understanding of the tasks that must be achieved to make fusion energy a reality. Deuterium and tritium (DT) offer a high probability of fusion when compared to any other combination of isotopes. Consequently DT fusion is the focus of all large scale fusion research programmes. As there is no <b>natural</b> source of <b>tritium,</b> fusion reactors are being designed with tritium breeder blankets to ensure self-sufficiency. The research contained within this thesis contributes to the ongoing development of breeder blankets for fusion reactors in terms of reducing their cost and improving their performance. The thesis follows a general theme of varying material composition to better utilise the local neutron spectra within fusion breeder blankets. The novel contributions of this thesis are as follows: The first contribution of this thesis is a technique that improves the accuracy of simulations involving time varying tritium production [171]. The technique identifies a minimum spacial resolution that should be used when performing burn-up studies in solid-type breeder blankets. Previously the tritium production with respect to time has been overestimated due to lack of spatial segmentation within the breeder blanket. Following on from this a parameter study was carried out to ascertain a more optimal composition for breeder blankets. The results of this study allows blanket designers to minimise the cost of the blanket while increasing the heat generated or maximising the tritium produced. The composition of breeder blankets operating with a DD neutron source was also optimised. This allows breeder blankets to create tritium from DD plasmas more efficiently. The use of DD plasmas to generate tritium is a proposed method of negating the need for an external supply of tritium to start up reactors. The sustainability of fusion is investigated and a method of reducing the use of beryllium within breeder blankets is presented. Blankets utilising this method were also shown to generate more heat, produce more tritium and showed lower peak heating. Varying the isotopic composition of materials was considered as a method to reduce helium production and improve the material properties without additional activity [132]. For the first, time cost benefit analysis of isotopically tailored materials in fusion reactors has been carried out and various methods to offset the enrichment cost have been identified. Multilayer blankets are investigated as a method of increasing the tritium production and are shown to achieve tritium production levels that are unobtainable for blankets with a uniform composition. Higher tritium production from blankets is particularly necessary in reactor designs that involve a reduction in the blanket volume. The composition of structural materials used within breeder blankets was also investigated. New material compositions are considered that offer reduced helium production. Additionally, materials that potentially offer improved material properties (e. g. fracture toughness and yield stress) are shown to be achievable. This is achieved by the addition of enriched Ni or Mo; the enrichment of the natural element allows it to be reintroduced without significant increase in activity. The final chapter summarises the research carried out, makes recommendations with regards to the design of future breeder blankets and presents further research opportunities. ...|$|R
