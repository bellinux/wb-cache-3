25|$|Temporal {{aliasing}} is a {{major concern}} in the sampling of video and audio signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If a piece of music is sampled at 32000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components above 16000 Hz (the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequency</b> for this sampling rate) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital to analog converter (DAC). To prevent this, an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequency</b> prior to sampling.|$|E
25|$|Aliasing. Some {{amount of}} {{aliasing}} is inevitable because only theoretical, infinitely long, functions {{can have no}} frequency content above the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequency.</b> Aliasing can be made arbitrarily small by using a sufficiently large order of the anti-aliasing filter.|$|E
25|$|For {{a digital}} oscilloscope, {{a rule of}} thumb is that the {{continuous}} sampling rate should be ten times the highest frequency desired to resolve; for example a 20megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up to about 2megahertz. This allows the anti-aliasing filter to be designed with a 3dB down point of 2MHz and an effective cutoff at 10MHz (the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequency),</b> avoiding the artifacts of a very steep ("brick-wall") filter.|$|E

The resulting line-to-output and control-to-output transfer functions and the corresponding frequency responses can model some system behavior more truly than the classical s-domain averaged models, including special effects above the <b>Nyquist’s</b> <b>frequency.</b> As an example, a concrete SPICE subcircuit is shown together with the results of AC analysis...|$|R

25|$|In analog instruments, the {{bandwidth}} of the oscilloscope {{is limited}} by the vertical amplifiers and the CRT or other display subsystem. In digital instruments, the sampling rate of the analog to digital converter (ADC) is a factor, but the stated analog bandwidth (and therefore the overall bandwidth of the instrument) is usually less than the ADC's <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequency.</b> This is due to limitations in the analog signal amplifier, deliberate design of the Anti-aliasing filter that precedes the ADC, or both.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualitative}} {{effects of}} aliasing {{can be heard}} in the following audio demonstration. Six sawtooth waves are played in succession, with the first two sawtooths having a fundamental frequency of 440Hz (A4), the second two having fundamental frequency of 880Hz (A5), and the final two at 1760Hz (A6). The sawtooths alternate between bandlimited (non-aliased) sawtooths and aliased sawtooths and the sampling rate is 22.05kHz. The bandlimited sawtooths are synthesized from the sawtooth waveform's Fourier series such that no harmonics above the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequency</b> are present.|$|E
25|$|When the bandlimit is {{too high}} (or there is no bandlimit), the {{reconstruction}} exhibits imperfections known as aliasing. Modern statements of the theorem are sometimes careful to explicitly state that x(t) must contain no sinusoidal component at exactly frequency B, or that B must be strictly less than ½ the sample rate. The two thresholds, 2B and fs/2 are respectively called the Nyquist rate and <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequency.</b> And respectively, they are attributes of x(t) and of the sampling equipment. The condition described by these inequalities is called the Nyquist criterion, or sometimes the Raabe condition. The theorem is also applicable to functions of other domains, such as space, {{in the case of}} a digitized image. The only change, in the case of other domains, is the units of measure applied to t, fs, and B.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} of widely used regression-based tests for seasonal unit roots when the shocks are serially correlated. We show, in the quarterly case, that the common assumption that serial correlation may be accommodated by augmenting the test regression with appropriate lagged seasonal differences is only partially correct. The limiting null distributions of t statistics for unit roots at the zero and <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequencies</b> are corrected by the lag augmentation, but those of t statistics at the harmonic seasonal frequency are not. Fortunately, the joint F-type tests at the harmonic frequency, which are in widespread use, do remain pivotal and should therefore supplant the individual t statistics in applied work. That the latter are indeed badly behaved in finite samples, while the F-type tests are correctly sized, is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo experiment. ...|$|R

This motivated us to revisit the linear transformation for VTLN in [1] and propose modifications to undo the affect of half-filters during the feature extraction. We show through recognition experiments that the proposed modifications to the linear transformation have comparable performance as the conventional VTLN approach, still enabling us to perform VTLN using a linear transformation on conventional MFCC...|$|R
2500|$|Most sampled {{signals are}} not simply stored and reconstructed. [...] But the {{fidelity}} of a theoretical reconstruction is a customary measure {{of the effectiveness of}} sampling.

40|$|A phase-demodulation {{method for}} digital fringe-projection profilometry using the spatial and {{temporal}} <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequencies</b> is presented. It allows us to digitize tridimensional surfaces using the highest spatial frequency (π radians per pixel) and consequently with the highest sensitivity for a given digital fringe projector. Working with the highest temporal frequency (π radians per temporal sample), the proposed method rejects the DC component and all even-order distorting harmonics using a bare-minimum 2 -step phase shift. The proposed method is suitable for digitization of piece-wise continuous surfaces {{because it does not}} require spatial low-pass filtering. Gamma calibration is unnecessary because the projected fringes are binary, and the harmonics produced by the binary profile can be easily attenuated with a slight defocusing on the digital projector. Viability of the proposed method is supported by experimental results showing complete agreement with the predicted behavior. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|Guaranteed upper-lower bounds on homogenized coefficients, {{arising from}} the {{periodic}} cell problem, are calculated in a scalar elliptic setting. Our approach builds on the recent variational reformulation of the Moulinec-Suquet (1994) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) homogenization scheme by Vondřejc et al. (2014), {{which is based on}} the conforming Galerkin approximation with trigonometric polynomials. Upper-lower bounds are obtained by adjusting the primal-dual finite element framework developed independently by Dvořák (1993) and Wieckowski (1995) to the FFT-based Galerkin setting. We show that the discretization procedure differs for odd and non-odd number of grid points. Thanks to the Helmholtz decomposition inherited from the continuous formulation, the duality structure is fully preserved for the odd discretizations. In the latter case, a more complex primal-dual structure is observed due to presence of the trigonometric polynomials associated with the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>frequencies.</b> These theoretical findings are confirmed with numerical examples. To conclude, the main advantage of the FFT-based approach over conventional finite-element schemes is that the primal and the dual problems are treated on the same basis, and this property can be extended beyond the scalar elliptic setting.

40|$|We examine some {{fundamental}} theoretical {{limits on the}} ability of practical digital holography DH systems to resolve detail in an image. Unlike conventional diffraction-limited imaging systems, where a projected image of the limiting aperture is used to define the system performance, {{there are at least three}} major effects that determine the performance of a DH system: i The spacing between adjacent pixels on the CCD, ii an averaging effect introduced by the finite size of these pixels, and iii the finite extent of the camera face itself. Using a theoretical model, we define a single expression that accounts for all these physical effects. With this model, we explore several different DH recording techniques: off-axis and inline, considering both the dc terms, as well as the real and twin images that are features of the holographic recording process. Our analysis shows that the imaging operation is shift variant and we demonstrate this using a simple example. We examine how our theoretical model can be used to optimize CCD design for lensless DH capture.

Third, limiting distribution theory is given for these statistics where, in contrast to previous papers in the literature, in doing so it is not assumed that unit roots hold at all of the zero and seasonal frequencies.
