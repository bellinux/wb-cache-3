5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> would be able to effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E
500|$|Daniela Denby-Ashe had not {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Margaret Hale but for that of Fanny Thornton, and was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> would be participating on the project, but the producers had been looking for the right Margaret {{for a long time and}} Denby-Ashe's [...] "directness, energy and charm" [...] as well as the chemistry she had with would-be co-star Richard Armitage proved decisive. Armitage himself had been the first actor to read {{for the role}} of John Thornton and even though his performance had impressed producer Kate Bartlett and casting director Jill Trevellick, they still had to see many other possible Thorntons. Three weeks after casting had begun, Trevellick decided to recapitulate the first auditions, realising that Armitage was [...] "perfect".|$|E
500|$|Despite Mercedes' {{relationship}} with Russ Owen (Stuart Manning), she {{had sex with}} Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) and feeling guilty, proposed to Russ which he accepted. Metcalfe felt Mercedes might again stray with [...] "Warren hanging around on the sidelines" [...] although she hoped Mercedes would remain faithful to Russ. Mercedes and Russ marry despite the ceremony being interrupted by Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee). Looking back at the wedding, Metcalfe commented that the wedding [...] "didn't go smoothly". Warren was accused of attempting to murder Clare Devine (Gemma Bissix), but his innocence and her infidelity was established when {{it was revealed that}} they were together the night Clare was attacked. Metcalfe said that [...] "although Mercedes knew she was taking a risk by sleeping with Warren, she genuinely thought she'd get away with it". She opined that after her and Russ' [...] "honeymoon period" [...] ended, Mercedes felt guilty and considered [...] "spilling the beans", although Metcalfe was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> would tell the truth about her affair with Russ.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Pett was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether <b>she</b> was {{relieved}} or disappointed at this evidence that her suspicions had been without foundation. On the whole, relief {{may be said}} to have preponderated.|$|R

60|$|Mrs Denman {{appeared}} to meditate for a minute, {{and then said}} that she was <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>She</b> herself did not know, and she thought the servants might be ignorant on the point, but she rather thought there was an old one in the pantry, but they had long kept a cat, and so didn't require it.|$|E
6000|$|Alice got up {{and when}} he rose said quietly, but with {{something}} in her voice that thrilled him: [...] "I think you like my mother and she knows I meant to talk to you.

There is nobody else who could help us and we trust to you." ...|$|E
60|$|He woke {{surprisingly}} refreshed, {{but at the}} belated breakfast {{where he}} found Mrs. Yarrow still lingering he thought her looking not well. She confessed, listlessly, {{that she had not}} rested well. She was <b>not</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>she</b> said, whether the sea air agreed with her; she might try the mountains a little later. She was not inclined to talk, and that day he scarcely spoke with her except in commonplaces at the table. They had no return to the little mystery they had mocked together the day before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{may mean}} myself." [...] And Rosamond's peal of merry {{laughter}} was most amazing and inexplicable to her companion, who was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> was <b>not</b> presuming {{to laugh at}} her.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{regarded}} her with some faint indication of surprise. He was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> what <b>she</b> meant. Did she expect {{a reward for}} her warning, he wondered. Her words would seem to indicate something of the sort, and yet he was <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b>|$|R

60|$|Cornelia had no {{grudge against}} {{him for the}} past.

He was a respite from her own thoughts, and she lingered and lingered, and listened and listened, remotely aware that it was wrong, but somehow bewildered and constrained.|$|E
60|$|Edna, {{behind the}} stone barrier, {{had put her}} things in her bag, though she was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> had found {{all of them in}} the gloom, and she waited a long time, so it seemed to her, for Ralph's summons to come forth. But {{although}} the boy came to the wall several times, ostensibly to ask if she were not ready, yet he really told her to stay where she was, for the sailors were not yet gone. But at last he came with the welcome news that every one had departed, and they soon came out into the daylight.|$|E
6000|$|Isabel was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> saw, and she {{answered}} {{that she was}} very bad at following arguments. The Countess then declared that she herself detested arguments, but that this was her brother's taste--he would always discuss. [...] "For me," [...] she said, [...] "one should like a thing or one shouldn't; one can't like everything, of course. But one shouldn't attempt to reason it out--you never know where it may lead you. There are some very good feelings that may have bad reasons, don't you know? And then there are very bad feelings, sometimes, that have good reasons. Don't you see what I mean? I don't care anything about reasons, but I know what I like." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, Beholder took the Santa Lucia Stakes, run at a {{distance}} of [...] on April 10, 2015.

[...] "The game was pretty much over going into the first turn and it was sort of a glorified workout, which is something you hope for in a race like this," [...] Stevens said. [...] "She's the best filly I've ever sat on and I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she's</b> <b>not</b> the best horse I've ever ridden." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rowling {{stated that}} {{her efforts to}} halt the {{publishing}} of the Lexicon have been crushing her creativity, and said that <b>she</b> was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if <b>she</b> has [...] "the will or the heart" [...] to now publish her own encyclopedia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Isabel admitted, [...] "she doesn't {{sufficiently}} recognise {{the existence}} of knockers; and indeed I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> doesn't think them rather a pretentious ornament.
