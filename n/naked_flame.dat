25|$|The Lowthers' {{technological}} advances continued when their chief steward, Carlisle Spedding sunk Saltom Pit in 1729. Saltom Pit {{was the second}} pit to be sunk beneath the sea. At Saltom Pit, Carlisle Spedding pioneered the use of explosives in sinking shafts. He also invented the first form of 'Safety Lamp', {{it was called the}} Spedding Wheel or Steel Mill. On occasions the Spedding Wheel caused explosions or fires but it was a major improvement over the <b>naked</b> <b>flame.</b>|$|E
500|$|At 3:00am on 14 October 1913, the day firemen {{descended the}} pit {{to conduct the}} daily checks for gas; they had three hours to {{complete}} their investigations. The firemen for the Mafeking return had to travel more than {{two miles from the}} shaft bottom to the workface. It left insufficient time in which to make a thorough check of the workings—which involved placing a <b>naked</b> <b>flame</b> into cavities to see if the flame lengthened—although the historian Michael Lieven states that [...] "the company considered any other form of inspection to be too time-consuming". Between 5:10 and 6:00am 950 men descended the shaft for a shift that was due to last until 2:00pm.|$|E
2500|$|Spedding {{invented a}} [...] "steel mill", {{in which a}} flint was held against a rapidly rotated steel disc, {{producing}} a stream of sparks giving some illumination. A second worker was needed to operate the mill, since the disc was rotated by a hand crank, and its operation was tiring. The use of the mill as a safer alternative to <b>naked</b> <b>flame</b> spread to other coalfields; prior {{to the introduction of}} the Davy lamp, up to a hundred steel mills were in daily use at one Tyneside colliery despite a fatal firedamp explosion at Wallsend colliery in 1785 ignited by a steel mill[...]|$|E
5000|$|Coal mining {{was very}} hazardous. Shafts could {{collapse}} {{at any time}} and before the safety lamp was invented in 1815 <b>naked</b> <b>flames</b> carried by miners to light their way could ignite gas underground causing explosions and many deaths. Some mines even had shafts that stretched several miles out under the sea.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the very}} {{thorough}} {{nature of the}} report submitted by the Royal Commission, it was shelved and not acted upon until after the Mount Mulligan mine disaster killed 75 workers in 1921, in circumstances {{similar to those in}} Torbanlea. Following the Mount Mulligan disaster, many of the recommendations of the Royal Commission were adopted, including separate legislation for collieries and the prohibition of <b>naked</b> <b>flames</b> within coal mines.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} favoring both these hypotheses. Blasting {{was being done}} in the area {{believed to be the}} source of the explosion, after initial attempts to widen a gallery had been abandoned the previous day for lack of success.

50|$|Originally, {{prepared}} {{fish were}} upside hung in lines on racks, or tenters, within the kiln. Workers would climb up and straddle the racks while hanging the individual lines in ascending order.

The wood fire was damped with sawdust to create smoke; this was constantly tended as <b>naked</b> <b>flames</b> would cook the fish rather than smoke it. The required duration of smoking has always been gauged by a skilled or 'master smoker' who manually checks for optimum smoking conditions.|$|R

5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the <b>naked</b> <b>flames</b> of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|R
50|$|A Royal Commission {{into the}} {{accident}} {{confirmed that the}} disaster {{was caused by the}} accidental or negligent firing of an explosive charge on top of a block of coal, apparently in order to split it. No methane was ever detected in the mine and candles and <b>naked</b> <b>flames</b> were used throughout its history (Royal Commission: 1921). The investigation found that explosives were used, stored, distributed and carried underground in a careless manner. It was also determined that the lack of appropriate means to render the coal dust safe in the mine was a violation of law. The coal seams at Mt Mulligan are conspicuously dry, leading to the ignition of coal dust from the firing of the charge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{investigations}} commenced {{as soon as}} the air was safe. Significant damage {{had been}} done in both the number 2 and number 3 workings, though particularly in number 3 pit. Damage in number 2 pit was mainly in the south eastern part, that in communication with, and ventilated from, pit 3. This was the area where stooping was occurring, so that the place most likely to be liberating firedamp was being ventilated with firedamp laden air from number 3 pit. The official report notes that <b>naked</b> <b>flames</b> and blasting were allowed throughout the colliery, except in the area around the stooping. Near there no blasting was permitted and all lamps had to be [...] "gauze lamps".|$|R

Sixteen storage rooms serving as expense magazines for cartridges and shells are situated off the tunnel, with ammunition lifts linking them to the gun positions above. The main magazine consisted of two cartridge and shell stores, from where the ammunition would be transported along the tunnel to the smaller expense stores. To ensure that there was no possibility of sparks or <b>naked</b> <b>flames</b> causing explosions, safety lighting was provided from behind glass screens while the magazine workers had to wear special magazine slippers and safety clothing to ensure that they could not create sparks when they moved.|$|R

50|$|In 1815, {{aware of}} the explosions often caused in mines by <b>naked</b> <b>flames,</b> Stephenson began to {{experiment}} with a safety lamp that would burn in a gaseous atmosphere without causing an explosion. At the same time, the eminent scientist and Cornishman Humphry Davy was also looking at the problem. Despite his lack of scientific knowledge, Stephenson, by trial and error, devised a lamp in which the air entered via tiny holes, through which the flames of the lamp could not pass. A month before Davy presented his design to the Royal Society, Stephenson demonstrated his own lamp to two witnesses by taking it down Killingworth Colliery and holding {{it in front of}} a fissure from which firedamp was issuing. The two designs differed; Davy's lamp was surrounded by a screen of gauze, whereas Stephenson's prototype lamp had a perforated plate contained in a glass cylinder. For his invention Davy was awarded £2,000, whilst Stephenson was accused of stealing the idea from Davy, because he was not seen as an adequate scientist who could have produced the lamp by any approved scientific method.|$|R

50|$|These {{problems}} with gas lighting {{led to the}} rapid adoption of electric lighting. By 1881, the Savoy Theatre in London was using incandescent lighting.” As electric lighting was being introduced to theatre stages, people who still were using gas theatre lighting developed the gas mantle in 1885. “This was a beehive-shaped mesh of knitted thread impregnated with lime that, in miniature, converted the <b>naked</b> gas <b>flame</b> into in effect, a lime-light.” Electric lighting would slowly take over theatre lighting. In the twentieth century, electric lighting would lead to even better and safer theater productions. These productions would be comfortable to watch with no smell, relatively very little heat, and more freedom for designers.|$|R
