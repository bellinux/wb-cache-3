40|$|The {{research}} goal is estimating Saudi Arabia imports demand {{during the}} period 1994 - 2000 {{on the basis of}} quarterly data for all imports by broad economic category which contain seven groups, food and beverages, materials and supplies, fuels and lubricants, machinery and capital equipment, transportation equipment and accessories, consumer goods <b>not</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>specified</b> and goods <b>not</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>specified.</b> Rotterdam demand differential approach has been estimated using iterative seemingly unrelated regression technique to estimate the model parameters. Estimated coefficients were used to calculate the compensated and uncompensated price elasticities and expenditure elasticity. The study achieves some results as follows: 1. 	The price variable has significant effect on demanding all groups whit negative sign which consist with economic theory. 2. 	The expenditure variable has significant effect on demanding all groups' whit positive sign which consist with economic theory. 3. 	the demand of food and beverages is effected by changes in the own price and the prices of materials and supplies, machinery and capital equipment, and goods not elsewhere specifies, while the demand of materials and supplies sensitive for all groups prices except goods not specified. On other hand, demand for fuels and lubricants affected by the price of consumer goods not specified whereas demand of machinery and capital equipments is effected by the prices of food and beverages and materials and supplies. Further, demand for transportation equipment and accessories sensitive to change in materials and supplies prices where the demand for goods not specified is sensitive for changes in materials and supplies prices and fuels and lubricants prices. 4. 	The expenditure elasticities of all groups included in the study are positive and significant. Expenditure elasticities for fuels and lubricants, transportation equipment and accessories, goods not specified are grater than one meaning they are luxury goods. Also, expenditure elasticities for food and beverages, materials and supplies, machinery and capital equipment and good not specified are less than one meaning they are necessity goods. 5. 	The uncompensated own price elasticities have negative sign for all groups included in this study and significant. The absolute values of elasticities are range between zero and one for all groups except machinery and equipment which means inelastic demand for these groups. For machinery and equipment groups the elasticity absolute value is grater than one which means an elastic demand for this group. 6. 	 the demand for goods and beverages group, fuels and lubricants groups, machinery and equipment group, transportation equipment group and goods not specified group are more sensitive for change in expenditure than change in prices while demand for materials and supplies group and consumer goods not specified are more sensitive for changes in prices than changes in expenditur...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} to assist people making a submission to the Productivity Commission 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry into the import of processed fruit products. About the inquiry On 21 June 2013, the Australian Government asked the Commission to inquire into whether safeguard action under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules is justified against imports of selected processed fruit products falling within subheading 2008 of the Australian Customs Tariff. The subheading is defined as: Fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise prepared or preserved, {{whether or not containing}} added sugar or other sweetening matter or spirit, <b>not</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>specified</b> or included. As specified in the terms of reference, the inquiry covers products under the following tariff classifications: 	 2008. 30. 00 (citrus) 	 2008. 40. 00 (pears) 	 2008. 50. 00 (apricots) 	 2008. 70. 00 (peaches) 	 2008. 97. 00 (mixtures) 	 2008. 99. 00 (other). The terms of reference are reprinted {{at the beginning of this}} report. Safeguard action is temporary, ‘emergency action’ (using tariffs, tariff-quotas or quotas) implemented in situations where a surge of imports causes or threatens to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. Safeguard measures may be applied for up to four years, and may be extended for a further four years, subject to several conditions. The Commission is to provide a report to the Australian Government by 20 December 2013 on whether safeguard measures are justified. In addition, the Commission is to provide an ‘accelerated report’ by 20 September 2013, as to whether provisional safeguard measures should be put in place...|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of external cause of injury codes (E codes) for work‐related and non‐work‐related injuries in Massachusetts emergency department data were evaluated. Medical records were reviewed and coded by a nosologist {{with expertise in}} E coding for a stratified random sample of 1000 probable work‐related (PWR) and 250 probable non‐work‐related (PNWR) cases. Cause of injury E codes were present for 98 % of reviewed cases and accurate for 65 % of PWR cases and 57 % of PNWR cases. Place of occurrence E codes were present in less than 30 % of cases. Broad cause of injury categories were accurate for about 85 % of cases. Non‐specific categories (<b>not</b> <b>elsewhere</b> classified, <b>not</b> <b>specified)</b> accounted for 34 % of broad category misclassifications. Among specified causes, machinery injuries were misclassified most often (39 / 60, 65 %), predominantly as cut/pierce or struck by/against. E codes reliably identify the broad mechanism of injury, but inaccuracies and incompleteness suggest areas for training of hospital admissions staff, providers, and coders...|$|R
