5|$|The {{plan was}} to begin again in 1976, and seed typhoons by flying out of Guam. However, {{political}} issues blocked the plan. The People's Republic of China {{announced that it would}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores, while Japan declared itself willing to put up with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones.|$|E
25|$|Their {{parents were}} against the match. Alexander II {{did not want}} to lose his daughter, to whom he was deeply attached. The Tsar also objected to a British son-in-law, due to the general anti-English feeling in Russia {{following}} the Crimean War. The Tsarina regarded the British customs as peculiar and the English people as cold and unfriendly. She was convinced that her daughter would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> there. However, marriage negotiation began in July 1871, only to be stalled in 1872.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, {{producers}} {{created an}} extended family for Grace. First they cast the roles of half-brothers Liam (Maxim Baldry), Jesse (Luke Jerdy) and Adam Donovan (Jimmy Essex). It was revealed that on-screen Grace would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with them being in her life again. During the casting process the three actors had to complete a day long acting workshop with Wall. They conversed about Grace's history within Hollyoaks to help with their introduction to the show. Liam is introduced to the show first. Grace is annoyed when she notices him and gives him money to leave the village for good.|$|E
25|$|Rocco tells Fidelio {{that as soon}} as the {{governor}} has left for Seville, Marzelline and Fidelio can be married. He tells them, however, that unless they have money, they will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b> (Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben—"If you don't have money on you"). Fidelio demands to know why Rocco will not allow for help in the dungeons, especially as he always seems to return short of breath. Rocco says that there is a dungeon down there where he can never take Fidelio, which houses a man who has been wasting away for two years. Marzelline begs her father to keep Leonore away from such a terrible sight. Rocco and Leonore sing of courage (Gut, Söhnchen, gut—"All right, sonny, all right"), and Marzelline joins in their acclamations.|$|E
500|$|One {{evening in}} July 1986, Charlene {{came home with}} a newborn baby and shocked her mother by {{claiming}} that he was her son. Charlene told Madge a story, so convincing that Madge believed {{she had become a}} grandmother. However, Charlene soon revealed that the baby was actually her half-brother Sam (Thomas Hamston; Scott Wealands). She explained to Madge that she had been helping to care for him, after his mother Susan (Gloria Ajenstat), turned to Charlene for help. Susan had had an affair with Charlene's father Fred, until he threw her out. Charlene knew Madge would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> looking after another woman's child, so she claimed he was her son. Soap Box author Hilary Kinglesy noted the situation helped expose Charlene's [...] "soft heart" [...] and her sensitive side.|$|E

500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of IGN felt that the album's dramatic hooks seem [...] "bloated" [...] at times: [...] "The band does a great of focusing on what they do best, but the album does drown itself a bit with all the overwhelming enormity of it all." [...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "I've Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they don't handle that style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the album's various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> but they haven't forgotten to be catchy." [...] Barry Nicholson of NME found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's [...] "infectious" [...] nature.|$|E

Not long after, the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said that [...] "The International media, as they are supported by Israel, would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with the continuation of the AKP government". The Hurriyet Daily News quoted Erdoğan at the time as claiming [...] "The Economist is part of an Israeli conspiracy that aims to topple the Turkish government".|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, David Satcher, the Surgeon General of the United States said [...] "We clearly {{associate}} media {{violence to}} aggressive behavior. But the impact {{was very small}} compared to other things. Some may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with that, but that's where the science is." [...] In 2001, a meta-analysis review was conducted at Iowa State University {{in order to determine}} a relationship between video game violence and aggression in teenagers. Out of 3,033 participants, the effect size was positive, deducing that high video game violence does in fact lead to heightened aggression amongst teenagers. [...] Another meta-analysis conducted the same year by John Sherry was more skeptical of effects, specifically questioning whether the interactivity of video games made them have more effect than other media.|$|E

5000|$|After {{watching}} {{a rough cut}} of the film on November 12, 2010, Michael Connelly, {{author of the book}} The Lincoln Lawyer, said: The movie comes out March 18. A couple days ago I saw an unfinished cut of it and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier.</b> I thought it was very loyal to the story and the character of Mickey Haller. Matthew McConaughey nails him. Those who loved the book will love the movie, I think. Those who don't know the book will love it just the same. The casting and acting is really superb. Like I said, I could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier.</b> I'm very excited and can't wait to see what fans of the book think.|$|R

2500|$|It was in {{this vision}} that Jazani {{explained}} in {{the relationship of the}} group and the Soviet Union: [...] "The group had many reasons to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with the idea of Soviet Union being the leader of the world revolutionary movements. The Soviet Unions policies in Iran in the past twenty years and the few years of bad relationship between the Soviet Union and the Tudeh party were known {{to the members of the}} group." [...] It was because of this that Jazani came to the conclusion when seeing the relationship of the Soviet Union and Tudeh and Eastern Europe at the end of the decade of 1950 that: [...] "... if the left movement wins the struggle in Iran, it must be aware of the Soviet Union's wanting of power. Failing to do so will lead to Iran becoming another satellite of the Soviets." [...] Jazani said that if the power of the leftist movement falls in the hands of the Soviets, before anything else it will get rid of us. He believed that geographically Iran is too close to the Soviet Union to ignorantly come close to it without understanding the harms involved.|$|E
