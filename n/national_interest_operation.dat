40|$|Grand Paris is a {{new global}} plan for the Paris {{metropolitan}} region; it has lead to a new transportation master plan and to development of several areas around Paris. Our case study is the project of <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> (<b>Opération</b> d’Intérêt National) by EPA ORSA (public institution of town planning Orly-Rungis-Upstream Seine river), located in the south-east of Paris suburbs, including Seine and Marne rivers. The urban sustainable development of this area should be finished in 2050, its aim is to “live with the river ” {{but at the same}} time increase the resilience. We have created a 2 D model (with TELEMAC 2 D) of the EPA ORSA territory, and run several urbanization scenarios for different stages of the project (2011, 2018, 2025 and 2050) and ten flood events. The redevelopment of the Seine Valley has to respect the French Water Act and then cause zero impact. Also, we have built a 1 D model (with HEC-RAS) to spread the water level and discharge impact in the Seine Valley (upstream and downstream of the 2 D area). Through the “Grandes Ardoines”, located in Vitry example, we can see that a...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1940 s, {{the nature}} of space {{operations}} {{and the need to}} develop a space power theory has been debated. In an attempt to formulate such a theory, both theorists and strategists have noted the similarities of space operations with those of air and naval operations. Consequently, many have attempted to derive a theory of space warfare through analogy to either air or naval models. This thesis concludes, however, that both air and naval models fail to capture the true breadth of pertinent national and strategic issues regarding space operations and activities. Yet by expanding the purview of naval operations to include maritime operations, which incorporates the interaction between the land and sea, the full extent and nature of space operations can be adequately modelled. Furthermore, by using a maritime theory based predominantly on the work of Sir Julian Corbett, a suitable strategic framework can be defined and relevant principles extrapolated. The resulting strategic principles, although not entirely in agreement with conventional wisdom, encompass many of the current observations and ideas regarding <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> and military <b>operations</b> in space. Moreover, from these resulting strategic principles of space warfare, the best space strategies, along with specific tactical recommendations, for emerging, medium, and super powers can be deduced.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. government {{relies heavily on}} security cooperation and security assistance programs to build partner-nation capacity {{as a means of}} furthering U. S. <b>national</b> security <b>interests.</b> Special <b>Operations</b> Forces (SOF) have contributed to this effort, particularly in the training and advising of foreign forces. However, the overall alignment of these efforts can sometimes be problematic. Furthermore, in a fiscally austere environment, planners will be forced to make difficult decisions about which countries will yield the best results when SOF are employed to build capacity. This thesis uses two RAND reports—What Works Best When Building Partner Capacity and The RAND Security Cooperation Prioritization and Propensity Matching Tool, published in 2014, to assess which factors are most critical for SOF efforts to build partnership capacity. It then relates these factors to countries where SOF training and advising might be employed. It finds that the countries best suited to SOF training and advising are the ones that the RAND reports suggest are the least likely to build capacity. Given this insight, this thesis recommends that Theater Special Operations Commands continue to explore new and creative solutions for security cooperation programs while working with interagency actors and industry to build partnership capacity.

40|$|Nigeria has {{an ambitious}} foreign policy but an ambiguous, unscripted, not well defined and {{inconsistent}} <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b> Aside {{the fact that}} this is not good for a country that pursues an ambitious external agenda and incongruent with its stature in global politics; it also makes the concept and reality of <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> susceptible to personalized interpretations, manipulations and distortions by the different political regimes. In other words, <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> becomes different strokes for different folks, depending on how each perceives and wishes it. Like every other sovereign country of the world, Nigeria's <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> have been largely determined and defined by the various leaderships that have over the years ruled the country. This paper builds its argument on the premise that a country's <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> is pivotal to its foreign policy and national development. Using the <b>National</b> <b>Interest</b> Theory (NRT) for a historical-descriptive discourse, the underlying issues found include the fact that in the case of Nigeria, as vital as the concept is both to the existence of a nation and as a source for the analysis of foreign policy behaviour of states, <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> has been subject to exploitation. Successive leadership of the country has hidden under the cover of <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> to perpetuate their individual interests. The probability for carrying out such acts is very high because Nigeria's <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> lacks proper codification and documentation. This paper thus makes a case for the codification and documentation of Nigeria's <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b> It does not suggest what the "interests" should be, but argues for intelligible <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> for direction, focus and attention to topmost priorities in the country's external relations...|$|R

40|$|In 2009 the European Union {{introduced}} the Lisbon Treaty. One {{of the changes}} this brought about was {{the introduction of a}} permanent president of the European Council. With this transformation the former EU presidency no longer exists and this thesis investigates the implications of this change. This is done by specifically looking at the <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> discussed in the European Council. Before the Lisbon Treaty Member States were able to influence the European Council by pushing their <b>national</b> <b>interests,</b> but based on the new institutional settings of the permanent presidency, this seemed after Lisbon more unlikely. An analysis of nine rotating presidencies of the Council of the European Union after Lisbon has been made and compared to the respective European Council conclusions of that period. The results show that in fact <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> have been discussed in the European Council. Nevertheless, only a third of all <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> has been discussed. On the other hand, the analyses also reveal that on average the discussed <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> in the European Council have significant similarity with the <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> of the Member States. Furthermore, the analysis brought also forward that certain <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> that seem not significant for the European Council have been discussed in the European Council, which could indicate that Member States can still push their <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> In conclusion, <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> were discussed only to a low extent in the European Council, answering the research question of this thesis: to what extent are <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> of Member States presiding over the Council of the European Union discussed during European Council meetings...|$|R

The <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> is a complex concept consisting of many interests that occur at several levels, converging towards assuring security, freedom, justice and welfare. The state is the main defender of the <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b> The <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> has as objective the definition of the national development priorities in order to ensure the survival and the prosperity of the country concerned, by following a trend of sustainable development and it is based on several factors, including foreign direct investments. These are a necessity for the development of an economy, especially when national savings do not meet the needs of capital for investments. But in order to serve the <b>national</b> <b>interest,</b> foreign direct investments have to be channeled towards the areas of <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b> After the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> is defined, there are presented the characteristics of the economic <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> and the ways through which foreign direct investments can support the achievement of the economic interest of an economy.

40|$|The 1976 {{amendments}} to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) were primarily aimed at enabling the statute to better accommodate the demands placed on coastal resources {{by an increase in}} domestic energy exploration and production. The <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision (Section 306 (c) (8) confronts the problem of potential conflicts arising out of the pursuit of equally important coastal zone management goals as stated in the CZMA. The CZMA states that there is a <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> in the 2 ̆ 2 effective management, beneficial use, protection and development of the Coastal Zone 2 ̆ 2. Due to the increasing likelihood of more energy facility sittings in the coastal zone Congress {{wanted to make sure that}} 2 ̆ 2 adequate consideration 2 ̆ 2 was given to energy facility siting proposals. The <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision and attendant federal regulations are designed to ensure that each federally approved coastal zone management program treats such proposals in a comprehensive fashion. Congress 2 ̆ 7 wording of the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision is the cause of much controversy. 2 ̆ 2 Adequate consideration 2 ̆ 2 is subject to various interpretations by state and federal officials and private industry. Chapter I reviews the CZMA 2 ̆ 7 s legislative history, court proceedings, state and federal records and private industry comments to display the complexity involved in interpreting the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision. Chapter II evaluates how well Massachusetts and Rhode Island coastal zone management programs comply with the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> clause. Both states compliance procedures are subject to question as there have not been any specific cases involving the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> to this date. Massachusetts and Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s programs are ambiguous with regard to how final decisions on <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> facility sittings are made. Chapter III presents findings and conclusions with regard to Massachusetts and Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s compliance with the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision. Program recommendations are made pursuant to the goals as stated by Congress in the CZMA. The major finding in both states is that there is a lack of adequate <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> assessment criteria. Decision makers presently review federal and private industry impact assessments, however, they have nothing to base their evaluations on. It is advocated here that a facility should be subject to <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> scrutiny, whenever a NEPA assessment is required. After such designation, federally promulgated <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> assessment guidelines should be available for state and local decision makers. Such standards will unify each state 2 ̆ 7 s approach to <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> facility siting and ensure equal treatment of project proposals. Specifically, Massachusetts should provide for better consideration of <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> facilities valued at less than five million dollars. Presently, the Energy Facility Siting Council is responsible for fulfilling the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision, but is not legally bound to do so. Measures should be taken to depoliticize the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> process in Massachusetts. Rhode Island does not have an energy facility siting body and is in need of an adequate energy facility planning process. The Coastal Resources Management Council is the best mechanism available for implementing this planning process. Rhode Island also needs a stronger regulatory mechanism to ensure that the regional benefit clause of the CZMA is not ignored. Non-compliance with the regional benefit clause could undermine the effects of the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision. An energy facility siting process similar to Massachusetts Energy Facility Siting Council would ensure such compliance. Lastly, regional consideration of <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> proposals is advocated in an effort to improve upon the comprehensive approach now attempted in considering the <b>national</b> <b>interest...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{shows how}} <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> in price-changing {{international}} commodity agreements {{can be measured}}. Two approaches are distinguished. Firstly, changes in <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> can be measured that are caused {{by the introduction of}} an international commodity agreement in an otherwise unregulated world market. This approach is based on a comparison of the situations with and without a commodity agreement.

This approach compares the situation of participation with that of non-participation in an existing commodity agreement.

According to the author, {{the implementation of the}} security policy of European Union is often opposite to one’s own <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> However, a pragmatic question for political leaders is how to resolve the following dilemma: „is the created european security identity more important at the moment than the preservation of immediate or some permanent national interests“? The author points {{to the fact that the}} notion of <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> is a variable both historically and theoretically. Political, economic, security and other objectives determine vital <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> in some historical periods. At the same time, not rarely, some states alter their strategies and objectives for their own interests assessing whether the conditions prevailing in the internal and external surroundings have changed.

Referring to the {{timeframe}} from 2012 to 2017, this thesis tries {{to answer questions}} regarding the construction of Russian <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> and seeks {{to understand how the}} annexation of Crimea changed discourses on <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> formation. As a territory represents {{one of the most important}} constitutive parts of each state, when a government decides to change the borders, it goes through the process of legitimisation for the particular move. This legitimisation is usually done through the reference to <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> therefore additional focus of the research is on the discursive coherence behind RNI. Rejecting the realist assumptions on <b>national</b> <b>interests,</b> and by combining a constructivist approach in foreign policy analysis and poststructuralist methods of discourse analysis, this thesis seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of the RNI during Putin’s third term. The main analysis refers to the official speeches and interviews of the Russian President, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. This thesis finds that several changes have occurred. Firstly, Russia has changed discourses on national sovereignty. Secondly, Russian world doctrine in its expansionist form has played an important role in <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> redefinition. Thirdly, discursive portrayal of Russia as a great power after the annexation of Crimea went into status maintainer direction. Finally, the annexation of Crimea has accelerated Russian devotion to Eastern dimension of foreign policy.
