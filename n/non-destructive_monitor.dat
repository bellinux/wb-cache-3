40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{fabricated}} Acoustic Emission (AE) sensor using {{polyvinylidene fluoride}} (PVDF) film and its application for lubricated bearing monitoring on a rotodynamic machine are presented. The {{advantages of a}} PVDF sensor are not only flexibility in terms of complex shapes but also low acoustic impedance leading to efficient energy coupling and broad frequency range. The calibrated resonance frequency of the sensor is 38 kHz using an artificial AE source (number E 976 - 84) obtained from American Standard Testing Materials (ASTM). The experiment on a rotodynamic test rig at different machine conditions showed that the fabricated AE sensor can identify different machine operating conditions. Therefore, the fabricated AE sensor offers a potential alternative as a <b>non-destructive</b> <b>monitor</b> lubricated bearings...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} Bloch oscillations of ultracold atoms {{stored in}} a one-dimensional vertical optical lattice and simultaneously interacting with a unidirectionally pumped optical ring cavity whose vertical arm is collinear with the optical lattice. We find that the feedback provided by the cavity field on the atomic motion synchronizes Bloch oscillations via a mode-locking mechanism, steering the atoms to the lowest Bloch band. It also stabilizes Bloch oscillations against noise, and even suppresses dephasing due to atom-atom interactions. Furthermore, it generates periodic bursts of light emitted into the counter-propagating cavity mode, providing a <b>non-destructive</b> <b>monitor</b> of the atomic dynamics. All these features may be crucial for future improvements of the design of atomic gravimeters based on recording Bloch oscillations. Comment: 14 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of copper nanoparticles in alumina and silica modifies their luminescence, {{and the changes}} in spectra are influenced by variations in the nanoparticle size distributions. Luminescence signals {{are sensitive to the}} total defect population. Thus the luminescence not only reflects changes caused by thermal annealing, which can modify both intrinsic defects and the copper nanoparticles, but also responds to the method of preparation of thin film layers. Copper nanoparticle influence on luminescence is reported both for ion-implanted bulk silica and for copper in pulsed laser deposition within alumina. Luminescence thus potentially offers a <b>non-destructive</b> <b>monitor</b> of the layer quality, reproducibility and growth conditions, as well as the state and size of the copper nanoparticles.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a non-destructive single-shot 3 -D electron bunch monitor based on EO sampling, using the yearlong stable femtosecond laser source developed for the SPring- 8 RF gun. The probe laser for spectral decoding EO sampling has been prepared as radial polarized and completely linearly chirped bandwidth (~ 500 nm) supercontinuum generation. The EO-probe element is made of 8 EO-crystals with the assembling of each EO-crystal’s optical axes along radial beam axes. The linearly chirped probe laser is longitudinally shifted in 8 transverse sectors for spectral decoding. We are planning to use organic polymer film as a femtosecond resolution EO-probe instead of crystals. This 3 -D bunch monitor with spectrograph detects and analyzes the Coulomb field of electron bunches as longitudinally spectral decoding and transversely multi-pole expansion. Our single-shot bunch monitor can characterize the 3 -D (both longitudinal (1 D) and transverse (2 D)) distribution and position of an electron bunch with femtosecond resolution. This <b>non-destructive</b> <b>monitor</b> {{can be used as}} an electron energy chirping monitor at a dispersive region for XFEL commissioning.
