40|$|Julia Gillard’s prime ministership {{was under}} {{relentless}} pressure {{during the entire}} first half of 2013. Opinion polls did not markedly improve for her government and dissatisfaction remained pronounced with her performance as prime minister. Her ministers began to lose confidence in her stoic leadership; caucus became increasingly nervous as the election drew closer; and the media were incessantly critical of her performance, especially the metropolitan tabloids. Some sections of the media even began to publish a regular “Ruddwatch” to monitor the every move the former PM made, likening it to a cat stalking its ill-fated prey. To make matters worse, Gillard’s party colleagues repeatedly questioned her political judgment, especially after she announced on 30 January that the next federal election would be held on 14 September 2013, giving over seven months’ <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> and throwing away one of the tactical advantages of incumbency. The plan was cooked up in her private office and she apparently had not told her cabinet colleagues...|$|E

25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} <b>of</b> unpredictability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> a political poll. Usually, such <b>polls</b> happen because <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> is not already known. In other words, <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> and learning <b>the</b> results gives some new information; these are just different ways <b>of</b> saying that <b>the</b> a priori entropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> results is large. Now, consider the case that <b>the</b> same <b>poll</b> is performed a second time shortly after <b>the</b> first <b>poll.</b> Since <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>poll</b> is already known, <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; {{in this case the}} a priori entropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> result is small relative to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first.|$|R
25|$|While {{investigating}} complaints, constituency electoral committees or Central Electoral Commission may recount ballot papers, and, in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> discrepancies, draw up {{an additional}} vote counting record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> district and attach {{it to the}} vote counting record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> district.|$|R
50|$|Because no {{sampling}} frame {{is used to}} draw <b>the</b> sample <b>of</b> participants, open access polls may not have participants that represent the larger population. Indeed, they may be composed simply of individuals who happen to hear about <b>the</b> <b>poll.</b> As a consequence, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> cannot be generalized, but are only representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll.</b>|$|R
