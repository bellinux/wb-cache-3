500|$|Most comics sold to {{specialty}} {{stores in the}} direct market are <b>non-returnable.</b> To reduce the financial risk for retailers who were uncertain about its sales potential, unsold copies from qualifying orders {{of the first three}} issues of Lazarus could be returned to the publisher. The first issue went on sale on June 26, 2013 and the 35,000 copy print run sold out at the distributor level within one day. A second printing was announced to coincide with the release of issue two. After a second sellout, it was included in the discounted [...] "Image Firsts" [...] line of first-issue reprints that are continuously available for retailers to order. By the end of 2013, the first issue had sold an estimated 50,200 copies. The second issue, which also went through multiple printings, sold an estimated 30,600 copies. Over the next two years, sales fell steadily to about 14,500 copies.|$|E
500|$|Previews of {{the first}} issue were {{included}} in The Walking Dead #99 and alongside five other upcoming comics in Image's 2012 Free Comic Book Day sampler before the first issue was released on July 11, 2012. It had an initial print run of about 18,000 copies and was available with two covers: the standard version by Frison and a 1-in-10 alternate cover by Craig Thompson. As an added incentive to retailers who normally order on a <b>non-returnable</b> basis, unsold copies of qualifying orders could be returned to Image {{in exchange for a}} credit to their account. It quickly sold out at the distributor level and went through at least four printings by December 2012, including one as part of the [...] "Image Firsts" [...] line of $1 reprints in November. By the end of the year, the first issue had sold an estimated 29,100 copies.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the trend of interlibrary loans (ILLs) through the {{experiences}} of Edinburgh University Library (EUL). A preliminary study aims to consider how the purchase of one e-journal package impacted on the number of ILL requests processed. Design/methodology/approach – The article describes the experience of EUL. Findings – The article finds that total ILLs, both returnables and <b>non-returnables,</b> rose to a peak in 1998 and have declined significantly since then. Full desk-top delivery has not yet been achieved, but this is in the forefront of the library's strategy. Originality/value – The paper gives a detailed insight into the impact of e-journals and other factors on the use of the document supply service for both returnables and <b>non-returnables</b> in a large UK university...|$|R
50|$|The new bill, House Bill 1036, banned <b>non-returnables</b> {{and placed}} a five-cent deposit on bottles and cans {{containing}} beer, malt beverage, mineral and soda waters and carbonated soft drinks. More than 20 corporations sent lobbyists (some from the eastern United States) to fight the bill, and rumors of bribing state legislators circulated. Oregon legislators were put off by what they considered condescending Eastern tactics. One senator detailed her offer of a bribe while speaking on the Senate floor, which helped strengthen support for the Bottle Bill. The law into effect on October 1, 1972.|$|R
50|$|Chambers began a letter-writing campaign, using non-ordinary {{stationery}} and stamps to {{draw the}} attention of his intended audience. Oregon House Bill 1157 was introduced and assigned to the House State and Federal Affairs Committee. Chambers brought in people to testify for the bill, including a river guide to testify {{about the amount of}} beverage package litter in the water, and a farmer who lost four cows because of ingestion of glass and metal shards from beverage containers. Beverage container materials companies and bottling companies fought the bill. Hanneman offered the compromise of not banning <b>non-returnables</b> but instead requiring a five-cent deposit as an incentive for return. By a 5 to 4 vote, the bill was sent to the House floor, where it fell 3 votes short of passage, with 27 of 60 members voting for it. Governor Tom McCall had already offered his support for the bill, so Hanneman asked McCall to help sway the House's vote in favor of passage. McCall refused, advising {{that he did not want}} a Bottle Bill in that legislative session. McCall planned to endorse the anti-littering campaign espoused by the Keep America Beautiful non-profit in 1970 and wait until 1971 to support the Bottle Bill. It has been written that this delay was intentional on McCall's part to make the bill his. After its defeat, Chambers continued his letter writing campaign.|$|R

5000|$|High profile {{campaigns have}} {{included}} the return of 1500 <b>non-returnable</b> bottles to Schweppes in 1971, and the successful [...] "Alice's Meadow" [...] campaign of 1983 - which helped force the diversion of the proposed M40 motorway around Otmoor.|$|E
5000|$|Cut-outs are {{typically}} wholesaled to retailers as <b>non-returnable</b> items, {{meaning that the}} store cannot send {{them back to the}} distributor for a refund; the reason for the cut or hole in the packaging is to mark the item as <b>non-returnable.</b> [...] The marking also serves to prevent the retailer from selling the discounted item at full price. [...] Recording artists also typically do not get full royalties from cut-outs, since they're sold at a [...] "promotional" [...] cost, far less than the retail price. Except for the physical damage to the liner notes and outer case, the inner disc (LP or CD) is generally unharmed by the cut-out process, and sounds the same as the originally sold recording.|$|E
50|$|Many {{potential}} {{factors are}} involved in environmental comparisons of returnable vs <b>non-returnable</b> systems. Researchers have often used life cycle analysis methodologies to balance the many diverse considerations. Often the comparisons show no clear winner but rather show a realistic view of a complex subject.|$|E
50|$|The {{premiums}} {{for a return}} premium term life plan are usually much higher than for a regular level term life insurance policy, since the insurer needs to make money by using the premiums as an interest free loan, {{rather than as a}} <b>non-returnable</b> premium.|$|E
50|$|More recently, many bottles {{have been}} {{designed}} for single-use. This often allows for thinner glass bottles and less expensive plastic bottles and aluminum beverage cans. Recycling rates have been increasing, particularly for aluminum. On a cost basis, the decision has often been made for <b>non-returnable</b> bottles.|$|E
5000|$|Geppi {{named his}} new company 'Diamond' [...] "after the imprint Marvel Comics used on <b>non-returnable</b> comics," [...] and {{although}} the [...] "publisher discontinued the symbol" [...] months later, the name remained.

50|$|The Keep America Beautiful narrow {{focus on}} litter, and indeed {{construction}} of the modern concept of litter, {{is seen as an}} attempt to divert responsibility from industries that manufacture and sell disposable products to the consumer that improperly disposes of the related <b>non-returnable</b> wrappers, filters, and beverage containers.|$|E
50|$|A primary tool used {{in hunting}} is the spear, {{launched}} by a woomera or spear-thrower in some locales. Boomerangs {{were also used}} by some mainland indigenous peoples. The <b>non-returnable</b> boomerang (known more correctly as a Throwing Stick), {{more powerful than the}} returning kind, could be used to injure or even kill a kangaroo.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{retailers}} ordering comics through Seuling's Sea Gate Distributors (and {{within two}} years, through other companies) {{were able to}} set their own orders for each issue of each title, something which many local IDs did not allow. This ability to fine-tune an order was crucial {{to the establishment of}} a <b>non-returnable</b> system.|$|E
50|$|It {{is sold in}} 350 ml {{aluminum}} cans, 355 ml returnable bottles, 355 ml <b>non-returnable</b> bottles, and 1 L returnable bottles. In {{recent years}} Gallo has been exported to other Central American countries, Mexico, France and the United States. It is sold under the name Famosa ("Famous") in the latter two. The label's design features a cockerel (gallo).|$|E
50|$|In February 1974 he was {{appointed}} as Minister of Environment. During his time as Environment Minister he was criticized for failing to ban <b>non-returnable</b> bottles and for refusing to place restrictions {{on the use of}} snowmobiles. In October 1975, he {{was appointed}} as Minister of Agriculture and Food. In this capacity Newman was responsible for the creation of the Foodland Ontario program, which continues to today, designed to promote the sale of Ontario-grown agricultural products.|$|E
5000|$|Content: direct-only stores could {{cater to}} older, more mature audiences, {{and thus can}} market {{material}} deemed too offensive (due to graphic violence, nudity, language, drug use, etc.) for grocery/drug/convenience/toy stores. In addition, due to the <b>non-returnable</b> nature of direct sales, typical direct-only stores contain a substantial archive of back issues. These retailers could also stock ancillary merchandise such as figurines, posters, toys, and novelties {{that would not be}} expected to be stocked by newsstands, etc.|$|E
50|$|Some {{clearance}} merchandise is <b>non-returnable</b> at some stores, as {{the intent}} is of course {{to get rid of}} the items. This is especially the case with liquidation and store-closing sales. However, in many jusrisdictions such as the United Kingdom, consumers retain their usual rights during a sale, such as the right to return faulty goods (under the Sale of Goods Act 1979) and the right to return goods granted by the Distance Selling Regulations.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1980, Marvel Comics saw the growth {{potential}} of the direct market, and by 1981 was putting {{out a number of}} titles geared specifically to that market (including Dazzler). By the early 1980s, all the major publishers were producing material specifically for the new market, series that would probably not sell well enough on the newsstand, but sold well enough on a <b>non-returnable</b> basis to the more dedicated readers of the direct market to be profitable.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, in the post-Civil War era, ANC in its {{position}} as the middleman between publishers and newsstand dealers would allow the newsstand dealers to keep between 5 and 10 cents {{on the sale of}} a 35-cent magazine like the monthly Harper's, and three cents on a 10-cent magazine like Harper's Weekly. Unsold copies of most titles were fully returnable, although some titles were sold to the dealers as <b>non-returnable</b> at a steeper discount, similar to today's [...] "direct sale" [...] comic book market.|$|E
50|$|After Ceaușescu's fall in 1989 and German Reunification in 1990, {{almost all}} the {{remaining}} Banat Germans in Romania left for Germany. As a consequence, the ethnic German population in Romania is greatly reduced. Some are returning, generally entrepreneurs with economic ambitions supported by the German <b>non-returnable</b> grants for development projects outside Germany. Some former Banat Swabians have a renewed desire {{to return to their}} long-term home, but most had sold their properties when they emigrated and have no home to which they might return.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} damage or fault in the {{manufacture}} which may constitute an item being resold as a second varies widely; in clothing, for example, it may simply refer to a single pulled thread or mis-sewn seam, whereas {{in a set of}} items (such as crockery) it may mean there is one piece missing from the set. Generally, an item listed as a factory second will have failed quality inspection for cosmetic, rather than functional, reasons. Such items are often heavily discounted, but may not have as all-encompassing a warranty or guarantee as a full-quality item (for example, the product may be <b>non-returnable).</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1907, the {{manuscript}} of The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp {{drew the attention}} of George Bernard Shaw, who agreed to write a preface (largely through the concerted efforts of his wife Charlotte). It was only because of Shaw that Davies' contract with the publishers was rewritten to allow the author to retain the serial rights, all rights after three years, royalties of fifteen per cent of selling price and a <b>non-returnable</b> advance of twenty five pounds. Davies was also {{to be given a}} say on the style of all illustrations, advertisement layouts and cover designs. The original publisher, Duckworth and Sons, refused to accept these demands and so the book was placed instead with London publisher Fifield.|$|E
50|$|The TEEP {{entrepreneurs}} {{undergo a}} 9-month programme {{which includes a}} 12-week online business plan development training and mentoring programme, followed by a two-day Bootcamp. Following a successful completion of their business plan, the entrepreneurs receive a <b>Non-returnable</b> Seed capital investment of $5,000 for their businesses. The entrepreneurs are also entitled to second round of funding, structured as loan or equity of $5,000. The seed capital disbursements were concluded in September 2015. On completion of the 9-month programme cycle, TEEP entrepreneurs graduate to become TEEP Fellows with full access to the TEEP Resources Centre and TEEP Alumni. Application for TEEP 2016 opened on the 1st of January, 2016 and closed on the 1st of March, 2016.|$|E
50|$|The {{direct market}} {{as we know}} it was created in the early 1970s in {{response}} to the declining market for mainstream comic books on newsstands. Fan convention organizer and comic dealer Phil Seuling approached publishers in 1972 to purchase comics directly from them, rather than going through traditional periodical distribution companies. Unlike the newsstand, or ID (for independent distributor) market, which included drugstores, groceries, toy stores, convenience stores, and other magazine vendors, in which unsold units could be returned for credit, these purchases were <b>non-returnable.</b> In return, comics specialty retailers received larger discounts on the books they ordered, since the publisher did not carry the risk of giving credit for unsold units. Instead, distributors and retailers shouldered the risk, in exchange for greater profits.|$|E
50|$|Later in 2002 {{he joined}} Hull City on loan, before then Hull manager, Peter Taylor, signed {{him on a}} three-and-half-year contract, in a £150,000 deal just before the club moved to the KC Stadium. Green scored in the first league game at the stadium on 26 December 2002, in a 2-0 victory over league-leaders Hartlepool United. Following a dip in form, Peter Taylor {{informed}} Green {{that he would be}} left out of the Hull team to face Lincoln City. When Green then attended a Carlisle United match rather than the Lincoln City match, Green was initially disciplined by the club, and then on 19 February he was sent on loan to Carlisle United {{until the end of the}} 2002-03 season with a view to a permanent move. Carlisle had to pay a <b>non-returnable</b> £30,000 fee.|$|E
50|$|The {{move from}} {{newsstand}} distribution to the direct market (<b>non-returnable,</b> heavily-discounted, direct purchasing of comics from publishers) {{happened in the}} 1970s, in large {{part due to the}} work of Phil Seuling and his Sea Gate Distributors company (founded in 1972), {{as well as a number}} of individuals, including the Schanes brothers and Bud Plant. The direct-market went hand-in-hand with the creation of specialist comics shops to cater to the collectors who could then buy back issues months after a newsstand issue had disappeared. By the late 1970s, thanks partly to the success of films such as Star Wars and Superman: The Movie, comics were selling well, and Pacific expanded its distribution system nationwide, raising $200,000 by closing its four San Diego retail locations and selling off inventory, rising rapidly to the top of the new distribution system.|$|E
50|$|When using cash, a RFID token (NXP Mifare Classic) is {{purchased}} {{and used for}} a single, <b>non-returnable</b> journey. There are {{two different types of}} tokens that showing in yellow or green color. Yellow RFID tokens is used for business coach of line 11 only. All ticket vending machines offer both English and Chinese interface. The purchaser touches a station name to calculate the fare. After payment, a green token is dispensed, which must be scanned at the entrance station and deposited at the exit station. A penalty fare applies should a token be lost. Also, people who purchased Green tokens will NOT ALLOWED to take the business coach in line 11 directly. Instead, they must get off at any transfer stations with line 11 and purchase a separate yellow token in order to ride the business coach.|$|E
50|$|While many {{vehicles}} do {{not require}} the customer to pay anything above their higher rate Mobility component, the customer may choose to opt for a higher specified model on payment of an Advance Payment which is <b>non-returnable.</b> Motability pricing is independently assessed as being more than 40% cheaper than retail lease agreements which is possible because of the unique VAT concessions that the Motability Scheme enjoys. In addition Means tested grants are available from Motability the charity for those who, {{due to the nature}} of their disability, have no option but to choose a vehicle which attracts an advance payment, or who may need special adaptations not already funded through the scheme. Many adaptations, such as push/pull brake/accelerator levers, are now also funded directly through the scheme so that the customer does not have to pay extra.|$|E
50|$|Friends of the Earth {{was founded}} in England in 1971, {{two years after the}} group was first founded in San Francisco in 1969. Its first leader was Graham Searle, a former vice {{president}} of the National Union of Students. One of the first campaigns was to dump 1,500 glass bottles in front of the HQ of soft drinks giant Schweppes in Connaught House, London in protest at the company's policy of having <b>non-returnable</b> bottles. The group had eight local branches in 1971. By 1976 there were 140, and by 1980 it had 250 and 17,000 registered supporters. Between 1984 and 1993 its director was Jonathan Porritt a former teacher and chairman of the Ecology party. Porritt left in 1993, by which time its membership hit 226,000. The next executive director was Charles Secrett who held the position till 2003. Between 2003 and 2008, FoE EWNI's executive director was Tony Juniper.|$|E
50|$|George Bernard Shaw {{had become}} {{interested}} in Davies, a literary unknown at the time, and had agreed to write a preface for the book, largely through the concerted efforts of his wife Charlotte. It was only because of Shaw that Davies' contract with the publishers was re-written to allow the author to retain the serial rights, all rights after three years, royalties of fifteen per cent of selling price and a <b>non-returnable</b> advance of £25 (equivalent to £).. Davies was also {{to be given a}} say on the style of all illustrations, advertisement layouts and cover designs. The original publisher, Duckworth and Sons, refused to accept these demands and so the book was placed instead with Fifield. Shaw was also instrumental in keeping the unusual title of the book, of which Davies himself was unsure, and which later proved to be controversial with some reviewers.|$|E
