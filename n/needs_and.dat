40|$|PURPOSE: Patients' {{oral health}} needs are {{estimated}} through dialogue and professional assessment. The concepts of <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand {{are vital to}} studies of dental care <b>and</b> oral health. <b>Need</b> does not always lead to demand for treatment or to utilization, depending on the gatekeeping processes between <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand and between demand and utilization. Demand must be accepted {{with the understanding that}} there is no objective <b>need</b> <b>and</b> that demand depends on the patient's opinion. In accordance with this, the need for prosthodontic treatment is highly individual and is not automatically related to oral health status, making <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand difficult to measure in that respect. Therefore, sociodental factors should be included and evaluated in studies of <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand for utilization of prosthodontic care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This theoretical and analytic paper focuses on the gatekeeping processes between <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand and between demand and utilization of prosthodontic care. RESULTS: The concept of gatekeeping refers to the social and psychologic processes that transform <b>need</b> into demand <b>and</b> demand into utilization. It implies that they are complex processes that can render great differences between demand and actual utilization. CONCLUSION: It is not possible to estimate a patient's needs for prosthodontic care, since there is no objective <b>need.</b> Demand <b>and</b> utilization are factors that {{play an important role in}} the gatekeeping process. These factors are dependent on the patient's opinion, which is influenced by numerous factors...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:This study aims to {{describe}} the supportive care needs of informal caregivers (ICG) of adult bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients. In addition, we explored relationships between levels of unmet <b>need,</b> psychological morbidity <b>and</b> patient and ICG characteristics. Methods and sample: We invited patients within 24 months of BMT {{to participate in a}} cross-sectional survey. Consenting patients asked their ICG to complete and return the questionnaire booklet. Measures included the Supportive Care <b>Needs</b> Survey Partners <b>and</b> Carers and General Health Questionnaire. Key results: Two hundred patients were approached, and 98 completed questionnaires were received (response rate?=? 49 %). We found high unmet <b>need</b> <b>and</b> psychological morbidity among ICGs and an association between ICG unmet <b>need</b> <b>and</b> psychological morbidity. Patient functioning, particularly anxiety and depression, sexual dysfunction and resumption of usual activities impacted on ICG unmet <b>need</b> <b>and</b> psychological morbidity. No associations were found between ICG unmet <b>need</b> <b>and</b> psychological morbidity and the following variables: type of BMT, time from BMT, ICG gender, number of dependents and patient age. Conclusion: ICG of BMT patients have high levels of unmet <b>need</b> <b>and</b> psychological morbidity in the months that follow a BMT.
