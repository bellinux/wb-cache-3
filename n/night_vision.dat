5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} <b>night</b> <b>vision,</b> its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.|$|E
5|$|Includes full {{automatic}} firearms, military firearms and ammunition not inspected and marked for civilian use, {{some types of}} ammunition such as armor-piercing and incendiary ammunition, <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> scopes, suppressors. The use of hollow point ammunition in pistols is also restricted, however, hollow points are legal to purchase for rifles and pistol carbines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> Live is {{the second}} live album by American rock band Imagine Dragons. Recorded during a live {{performance}} at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre on May 16, 2013, during the <b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> Tour, the album was released by KIDinaKORNER and Interscope Records on February 25, 2014. Physical copies of the album and video include the 2012 documentary The Making of <b>Night</b> <b>Visions,</b> and the band's music videos produced during the <b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> album cycle.|$|R
5000|$|Beckel’s {{first true}} non-jazz {{composition}} was <b>Night</b> <b>Visions.</b> Erich Kunzel, the long-time Cincinnati Pops Orchestra director, appreciated <b>Night</b> <b>Visions,</b> {{but it was}} too long and too serious for a pops audience. Beckel was up against a similar wall in the symphonic world: <b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> was not [...] "serious enough" [...] for an orchestral environment. Beckel unintentionally learned how marketing and composition can be large influences that determine performing opportunities.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the demand}} for {{germanium}} for fiber optic communication networks, infrared <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> systems, and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% of worldwide germanium consumption in 2000. The US government even designated germanium as a strategic and critical material, calling for a 146ton (132t) supply in the national defense stockpile in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Most sights {{have either}} active or passive {{adjustments}} for the reticle brightness, which help the shooter adapt to different lighting conditions. A very dim reticle will help prevent loss of <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> in low-light conditions, while a brighter reticle will display more clearly in full sunlight.|$|E
5|$|The eyes {{can focus}} independently, and are {{specialized}} with a duplex retina that contains {{two types of}} visual cells for both day and <b>night</b> <b>vision,</b> and a tapetum lucidum which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark. There is also a third eyelid on each eye, the nictitating membrane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> is a {{biannual}} {{film festival}} focusing on horror, fantasy, science fiction and cult cinema. The festival is held {{twice a year}} in Helsinki, Finland. The festival also showcases documentaries and short films. The first <b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> festival was organized in November 1997.|$|R

5|$|Vehicle {{camouflage}} techniques {{begin with}} paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised {{materials such as}} blankets and vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near infrared and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide concealment from <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> devices.|$|E
5|$|A nocturnal animal, the Bengal slow loris has {{excellent}} <b>night</b> <b>vision,</b> {{enhanced by}} a tapetum lucidum—a layer of {{tissue in the}} eye that reflects visible light back through the retina. It sleeps during the day {{curled up in a}} ball in dense vegetation or in tree holes. Males and females mark their territory with urine. The species is known to live in small family groups. Animals may practice social grooming.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations to <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> {{include the}} large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E

5000|$|The {{show was}} one of many that were {{recorded}} during the <b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> Tour on audio-visual for a potential release during or after the tour, {{before the end of the}} <b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> release cycle. The performances recorded include the opening night of the <b>Night</b> <b>Visions</b> Tour on December 30, 2012 at The Joint in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was later used for a live video of [...] "Radioactive" [...] and parts of the music video for [...] "Demons", which, in part, was combined with footage of the February 9, 2013 performance at the same venue.|$|R
5|$|After Operation Credible Sport {{ended the}} Army {{leadership}} decided the unit {{was needed for}} future contingency operations. Thusly, on October 16, 1981 Task Force 158 became the 160th Aviation Battalion, with Brown a founding member. The choice of the unit's name was accepted by the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry as a logical progression of the 101st's 158th and 159th Battalions. The 160th Aviation Battalion was later renamed the 160th Special Operations Aviation Group in 1986; {{it was not until}} 1990 when it would take on its current name, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. In October 1983, Brown participated in the invasion of Grenada, during which his unit became the first aviation unit to use <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> goggles in combat. In the late 1980s, Brown led all U.S. forces assigned to Operation Prime Chance, which provided escort security for American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers during the Iran-Iraq War. During Operation Prime Chance Brown's unit became the first aviation unit to engage in combat using <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> devices when they engaged an Iranian-flagged ship, Iran Ajr, that was seen deploying mines in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|During the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, multiple Sea King ASaC7 from 849 NAS were operated from HMS Ark Royal. On 22 March 2003, two AEW Sea Kings from 849 NAS operating from Ark Royal collided over the Persian Gulf, {{resulting in the}} death of seven personnel. A report into the collision called for Sea Kings to be outfitted with <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> goggles, as well as better onboard safety equipment, and recommended changes to procedure regarding the use of radar at night.|$|E
5|$|Eight Chinook HC Mk3s {{were ordered}} in 1995 as {{dedicated}} special forces helicopters, which {{were intended to}} be low-cost variants of the US Army's MH-47E. The Mk3s include improved range, <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> sensors and navigation capability. The eight aircraft were to cost £259million and the forecast in-service date was November 1998. Although delivered in 2001, the Mk3 could not receive airworthiness certificates as {{it was not possible}} to certify the avionics software.|$|E

5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E
5|$|P90 Laserex models:The P90 LV (Laser Visible) and P90 IR (InfraRed) models, both {{of which}} were {{introduced}} in late 1995, have an integrated laser sight manufactured by Laserex Technologies in Australia. The P90 LV model projects an 8 mW visible laser intended {{to be used as a}} low-light shooting aid or for dissuasive effect, while the P90 IR model projects a 4.5 mW infrared laser that can only be seen with <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> equipment. Both laser systems are compact, consisting of a small, flat panel integrated into the front end of the weapon's frame.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{three is}} broken into two {{separate}} parts, phase 3.1 of the HUG project {{will see the}} fleet undergo a structural refurbishment program {{with a number of}} aircraft undergoing the replacement of centre barrels and adjacent structural components. In addition, phase 3.2 started with an Aging Aircraft Audit (AAA), ongoing R3 Deeper Maintenance (DM) and minor projects such as <b>Night</b> <b>Vision</b> Capability (NVC) will also be undertaken to ensure that the fleet can continue to perform its air defence tasks through to the Planned Withdrawal Date.|$|E

5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile <b>night</b> <b>vision,</b> and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> goggles, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on <b>night</b> <b>vision</b> and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
