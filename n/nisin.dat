25|$|Food {{safety is}} {{a major focus of}} food microbiology. Numerous agents of disease, pathogens, are readily {{transmitted}} via food, including bacteria, and viruses. Microbial toxins are also possible contaminants of food. However, microorganisms and their products {{can also be used to}} combat these pathogenic microbes. Probiotic bacteria, including those that produce bacteriocins, can kill and inhibit pathogens. Alternatively, purified bacteriocins such as <b>nisin</b> can be added directly to food products. Finally, bacteriophages, viruses that only infect bacteria, can be used to kill bacterial pathogens. Thorough preparation of food, including proper cooking, eliminates most bacteria and viruses. However, toxins produced by contaminants may not be liable to change to non-toxic forms by heating or cooking the contaminated food due to other safety conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} these {{promising}} advantages, <b>nisin</b> is the only bacteriocin {{generally recognized as safe}} by the Food and Drug Administration and is currently used as a food preservative in several countries.This limitation in bacteriocins availability in the market as preservatives and antimicrobials can be attributed to multiple factors, including: (i) the high cost of their commercial production; (ii) the loss of their activity by proteolytic enzymes; (iii) their unfavorable interactions with other food constituents, which decreases the availability and necessitates a huge amount of the peptide to be added; (iv) the alterations of the chemical and physical properties of these compounds during the various food-processing stages; (v) the low yield of these compounds due to ineffective recovery by traditional purification methods; and (vi) the narrow spectrum of activity observed for most of the tested bacteriocins against pathogenic bacteria. In the last years, several studies on bacteriocins have demonstrated that the optimization of their production conditions, their purification methods, their combinations with other antimicrobial agents, the hurdle technology approach, and nanotechnology formulations, could all represent solutions to some of the previously mentioned problems.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, winemakers can use {{chemical}} and biological inhibitors such as lysozyme, <b>nisin,</b> dimethyl dicarbonate (Velcorin), and fumaric acid, though some (like Verlcorin) are restricted in winemaking countries outside the United States. Fining agents, such as bentonite, and putting the wine through cold stabilization will also remove potential nutrients for LAB, thus inhibiting malolactic fermentation. Some experimentation {{with the use of}} bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) has been conducted [...] to limit malolactic fermentations, but disappointing results in the cheesemaking industry have led to skepticism about the practical use of bacteriophages in winemaking.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nisin</b> {{is used in}} {{processed}} cheese, meats, beverages, etc. during {{production to}} extend shelf life by suppressing Gram-positive spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. In foods, {{it is common to}} use <b>nisin</b> at levels ranging from ~1-25 ppm, depending on the food type and regulatory approval. As a food additive, <b>nisin</b> has an E number of E234.|$|E
5000|$|While {{in general}} most {{bacteriocin}}s inhibit only closely related species, <b>nisin</b> {{is a rare}} example of a [...] "broad-spectrum" [...] bacteriocin effective against many Gram-positive organisms, including lactic acid bacteria (commonly associated with spoilage), Listeria monocytogenes (a known pathogen), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, etc. It is also particularly effective against spores. Gram-negative bacteria are protected by their outer membrane but may become susceptible to <b>nisin</b> action after a heat shock or when this is coupled with the chelator EDTA. <b>Nisin</b> is soluble in water and can be effective at levels nearing the parts-per-billion range. <b>Nisin</b> concentration can be measured using various techniques such as chromatography or by a simple agar diffusion bioassay.|$|E

50|$|Lantibiotics are lanthipeptides {{that have}} known {{antimicrobial}} activity. The {{founding member of}} the lanthipeptide family, <b>nisin,</b> is a lantibiotic that has been used to prevent the growth of food-born pathogens for over 40 years.|$|E
5000|$|Bisin is a {{naturally}} occurring lantibiotic (an antibacterial peptide) discovered by University of Minnesota microbiologist Dan O'Sullivan.

50|$|A modern approach, biopreservation, adds {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} to the fish to be fermented. This produces active antimicrobials such as lactic and acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and peptide bacteriocins.

50|$|Each hurdle aims to eliminate, {{inactivate}} or {{at least}} inhibit unwanted microorganisms. Common salt or organic acids {{can be used as}} hurdles to control microbials in food. Many natural antimicrobials such as <b>nisin,</b> natamycin and other bacteriocins, and essential oils derived from rosemary or thyme, also work well.|$|E
50|$|Bacteriocins have immense {{potential}} to treat human disease. For example, diarrhea in humans {{can be caused}} by a variety of factors, but is often caused by bacteria such as C. difficile. Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 secretes the bacteriocin microbisporicin, which kills clostridia by targeting prostaglandin synthesis. Additionally, bacteriocins are particularly promising because they kill bacteria differently than antibiotics do. As a result, many antibiotic-resistant bacteria succumb to death at the hands of bacteriocins. For example, in vitro growth of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was inhibited by the bacteriocin <b>nisin</b> A, produced by Lactococcus lactis. <b>Nisin</b> A inhibits methicillin-resistant S. aureus by binding to the precursor to bacterial cell wall synthesis, lipid II. This hinders the ability to synthesize the cell wall, resulting in increased membrane permeability, disruption of electrochemical gradients, and possible death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nisin</b> and epidermin {{are members}} of a family of lantibiotics that bind to lipid II, a cell wall {{precursor}} lipid component of target bacteria and disrupt cell wall production. The duramycin family of lantibiotics binds phosphoethanolamine in the membranes of its target cells and seem to disrupt several physiological functions.|$|E

Additionally, the hurdle effect of food preservation, such as by adding lactic acid bacteria and salt to a food product, is illustrated and described.|$|E
50|$|Of special {{interest}} are {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB). Lactic acid bacteria have antagonistic properties that make them particularly useful as biopreservatives. When LABs compete for nutrients, their metabolites often include active antimicrobials such as lactic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and peptide bacteriocins. Some LABs produce the antimicrobial <b>nisin,</b> which is a particularly effective preservative.|$|E
50|$|DuPont produce Nisaplin (E234), a {{commercial}} {{formulation of the}} natural bacteriocin <b>nisin,</b> at a factory in the town. It was first isolated by Aplin and Barret and produced in the 1950s in the factory laboratory then situated in 11-15 North Street. The Clipper tea company is based in Beaminster. It is currently held by the Dutch company Royal Wessanen.|$|E
50|$|RiPPs in {{commercial}} use include <b>nisin,</b> a food preservative, thiostrepton, a veterinary topical antibiotic, and nosiheptide and duramycin, which are animal feed additives. Phalloidin functionalized with a fluorophore {{is used in}} microscopy as a stain due to its high affinity for actin. Anantin is a RiPP used in cell biology as an atrial natriuretic peptide receptor inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|There can be {{significant}} synergistic effects between hurdles. For example, Gram-positive bacteria {{include some of}} the more important spoilage bacteria, such as Clostridium, Bacillus and Listeria. A synergistic enhancement occurs if <b>nisin</b> is used against these bacteria in combination with antioxidants, organic acids or other antimicrobials. Combining antimicrobial hurdles in an intelligent way means other hurdles can be reduced, yet the resulting food can have superior sensory qualities.|$|E
50|$|Brötz-Oesterhelt´s {{research}} {{focuses on}} discovering and characterizing new antibiotics. She studies molecular mechanisms of antibiotic action and the workings of new antibiotic targets. Her department is dedicated to finding new mechanisms for killing multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens. She discovered, for example, that <b>nisin</b> and other lantibiotics use the cell wall precursor lipid II as a docking molecule to form pores in the bacterial membrane and that acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics deregulate the bacterial Clp protease.|$|E
50|$|Microbial {{growth and}} {{proliferation}} can be inhibited by {{a technique called}} biopreservation. Biopreservation is achieved by adding antimicrobials or by increasing the acidity of the fish muscle. Most bacteria stop multiplying when the pH is less than 4.5. Acidity is increased by fermentation, marination or by directly adding acids (acetic, citric, lactic) to fish products. Lactic acid bacteria produce the antimicrobial <b>nisin</b> which further enhances preservation. Other preservatives include nitrites, sulphites, sorbates, benzoates and essential oils.|$|E
5000|$|In 1941, lanthionine {{was first}} {{isolated}} from the treatment of wool with sodium carbonate and was first synthesized from cysteine and β-chloroalanine. [...] Lanthionines are found widely in nature and have been isolated from human hair, lactalbumin, and feathers. Lanthionines have also been found in bacterial cell walls and are the components {{of a group of}} gene-encoded peptide antibiotics called lantibiotics, which includes <b>nisin</b> (a food preservative), subtilin, epidermin (effective against staphylococcus and streptococcus), and ancovenin (an enzyme inhibitor).|$|E
