5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, <b>not</b> <b>white.</b> The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a {{large and}} long-tailed Oryzomys. The upperparts are brightly ochraceous, {{becoming}} grayer toward the front. The hairs on the underparts are pale gray near the bases and white in the outer half, so that the underparts appear pale grayish according to Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales (<b>not</b> <b>white</b> as claimed by Merriman). The tail is dark above and light below. The skull and molars are relatively robust. O.albiventer has broad zygomatic arches (cheekbones), long incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars), and long nasal bones that extend behind the premaxillary bones. Compared to its lowland relative O.couesi mexicanus, O.albiventer is larger and more brightly colored and has larger molars but narrower incisive foramina.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} models exist for gusts but only two, the Dryden and von Kármán models, are {{generally}} used for continuous gusts in flight dynamics applications.

25|$|Many items have {{attribute}} minimums {{to be used}} effectively. White-colored {{items are}} normal items, blue-colored items are magic items and gold-colored items are unique items. Any items that are <b>not</b> <b>white</b> in color must be identified {{to make use of}} their magical effects, however, characters can use unidentified items as they would the base item. Items wear down through use and only have a certain amount of durability. When an item's durability is zero, it is destroyed. Players can return to the town and pay a fee to an NPC, Griswold the Blacksmith, to have the items restored, while the Warrior can repair objects in his possession at the cost of overall durability.|$|E
25|$|Marian Anderson {{was born}} on February 27, 1897, in Philadelphia, the {{daughter}} of John Berkley Anderson and the former Annie Delilah Rucker. Her father sold ice and coal at the Reading Terminal in downtown Philadelphia and eventually opened a small liquor business as well. Prior to her marriage, Anderson's mother had briefly attended the Virginia Seminary and College in Lynchburg and {{had worked as a}} schoolteacher in Virginia. As she did not obtain a degree, Annie Anderson was unable to teach in Philadelphia under a law that was applied only to black teachers and <b>not</b> <b>white</b> ones. She therefore earned an income caring for small children. Marian was the eldest of the three Anderson children. Her two sisters, Alice (later spelled Alyse) (1899–1965) and Ethel (1902–1990), also became singers. Ethel married James DePreist and their late son, James Anderson DePreist was a noted conductor.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2010, Amazon {{released}} the Kindle DX Graphite (DXG) globally. The DXG has an E Ink display with 50% better contrast ratio due to using E Ink Pearl technology and comes {{only in a}} graphite case color. It is speculated the case color change is to improve contrast ratio perception further, as some users found the prior white casing highlighted that the E Ink background is light gray and <b>not</b> <b>white.</b> Like the Kindle DX, {{it does not have}} a Wi-Fi connection. The DXG is a mix of third-generation hardware and second-generation software. The CPU has the same speed as Kindle Keyboard's CPU, but the DXG has only half the system memory, 128MB. Due to these differences, the DXG runs the same firmware as Kindle 2. Therefore, DXG cannot display international fonts, like the Cyrillic, Chinese, or any other non-Latin font and PDF support and the web browser are limited to matching the Kindle 2's features.|$|E

500|$|Cope's {{views on}} human races would today be {{considered}} racist, and his beliefs {{were used by}} scientists of the time to justify imperialism. He believed that if, [...] "a race was <b>not</b> <b>white</b> then it was inherently more ape-like". He was not opposed to blacks {{because of the color}} of their skin but their [...] "degrading vices", believing that the [...] "inferior Negro should go back to Africa." [...] He did not blame blacks for their perceived [...] "poor virtue", but wrote, [...] "A vulture will always eat carrion when surrounded on all hands by every kind of cleaner food. It is the nature of the bird." [...] Cope was against the modern view of women's rights, believing in the husband's role as protector; he was opposed to women's suffrage, as he felt they would be unduly influenced by their husbands.|$|E
500|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is a {{medium-sized}} rice rat, smaller than O.couesi, with thick, glossy fur and velvety underfur. The {{hairs on the}} back are about 6mm in length. The upperparts are gray-brown with some dark hairs, appearing darker overall than in O.couesi; [...] the color becomes more yellowish towards the sides. According to Thomas, a faint [...] line extends from the sides to the inner sides of the hindlegs. The underparts are grayish, contrasting with the buffy underparts of O.couesi. The snout is short and the well-haired ears are partly hidden by the fur. The hands and feet are off-white or brownish above, <b>not</b> <b>white</b> as in O.couesi. The hindfeet show small interdigital webs, but they lack long tufts of hair on the digits {{and some of the}} pads are reduced or absent. The tail is about as long as the head and body and contains about 15 rings per centimeter. It is slightly darker (grayish) above than below (whitish), but the difference in color is much less pronounced than in O.couesi.|$|E
500|$|Another {{source of}} the musical is the eighth story, [...] "Our Heroine", which is thematically paired with the 12th, [...] "A Boar's Tooth", as both involve American {{encounters}} with local cultures. [...] "Our Heroine" [...] tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter, [...] Frenchman Emile De Becque. [...] After {{falling in love with}} Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story #4, [...] "An Officer and a Gentleman") learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that [...] "any person... who was <b>not</b> <b>white</b> or yellow was a nigger" [...] to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile's household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns that this woman is dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile's [...] "nigger children." [...] Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.|$|E

500|$|On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a {{televised}} speech including what became his most quoted utterance. [...] "I don't believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia—not in 1,000 years," [...] he said. [...] "I repeat that I believe in {{blacks and whites}} working together. If one day it is white {{and the next day}} it is black, I believe we have failed {{and it will be a}} disaster for Rhodesia." [...] The first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that Smith was a crude racist who would never compromise with the black nationalists, even though the speech was one in which Smith had said that power-sharing with black Rhodesians was inevitable and that [...] "we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, <b>not</b> <b>white</b> as opposed to black and vice versa". The [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] comment was, according to Peter Godwin, an attempt to reassure the RF's right wing, which opposed any transition whatsoever, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn comments that regardless of whether the statement was [...] "taken out of context, or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted", this was one of his greatest blunders as Prime Minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors.|$|E
500|$|Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, {{has said}} that {{there appear to be}} many [...] "inaccuracies and contradictions" [...] in {{accounts}} of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £ as of [...] ) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and {{one of the founders of}} the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£ as of [...] ), and that £400 (£ as of [...] ) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick's will and that he received the £400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid. Having Beswick embalmed therefore allowed him to keep the whole amount. Alternatively it has been suggested that White was considerably in debt to Beswick, a debt that would have to be repaid after the funeral, which was avoided by her embalming, but Beswick's will names Mary Graeme and Esther Robinson as her executors, <b>not</b> <b>White.</b> In 1866, more than 100years after her death, the details of Beswick's will were still being disputed.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith and his {{mostly white}} {{government}} unilaterally declared a unilateral {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. The nation was invited to send a team to the 1968 Winter Olympics, but declined {{in the belief that}} its athletes were not sufficiently competitive. Despite political machinations from the United Kingdom, which expended considerable effort to exclude its former colony from gaining legitimacy by participating at the Games, Rhodesia was invited to participate at the 1968 Summer Olympics. The threat of an African boycott (supported by the British) of the Games, however, added further pressure from the Mexican government on the organizing committee to withdraw its invitation. Although South Africa had been barred from competing in 1964, Rhodesia's sports institutions were not de jure segregated, and thus the same rationale could not be applied. The British government also decided against adding Rhodesian Olympians to a [...] "stop-list" [...] of select Rhodesians who were banned entirely from international travel. Thus, the organizing committee used the pretense of United Nations Security Council Resolution 253, published May 29, 1968, which called on member nations to refuse to accept Rhodesian passports, to block Rhodesian athletes from participating. Although most potential participants had more than one passport, Mexico created bureaucratic delays that prevented Rhodesian athletes from attending, despite the Rhodesian government's repeated protests. Rhodesia's team had included at least nine individual athletes, a five-man yachting team, and a field hockey squad. Only two, track and field competitors Bernard Dzoma and Mathias Kanda, were <b>not</b> <b>white,</b> but both were considered medal contenders.|$|E
