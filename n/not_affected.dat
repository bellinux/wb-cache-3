5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually <b>not</b> <b>affected,</b> but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is <b>not</b> <b>affected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Curator of Birds Gary R. Graves of the Smithsonian Institution spent 18 years {{scouring}} {{the island for}} evidence of the taxon without success. He is doubtful of its survival as it is diurnal and Jamaica is a popular destination for birdwatchers. The exact cause of the likely extinction is unknown, but predation by introduced mammals, especially the black rat but possibly also the Indian mongoose, {{is thought to be}} a factor. Graves points out that {{there is little evidence that}} habitat loss has played a role. It is noted that this swallow is <b>not</b> <b>affected</b> by being near human disturbance. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is <b>not</b> <b>affected</b> by being near human disturbance. It is proposed that nest boxes be used to counter habitat loss and predation.|$|E

30|$|First, {{there is}} a set of {{variables}} that do <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> efficiency scores in any estimation. First, school location does <b>not</b> seem to <b>affect</b> the efficiency (RURAL and CITY). On average, schools in rural areas or small villages have worse educational outcomes than those located in bigger cities. The fact that the town size does <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> significantly the efficiency implies that the higher results are due to a greater allocation of educational resources and not to a better use of them. Likewise, the teacher–student ratio (TEACHSTU) does <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> either school’s efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Result {{shows that}} {{innovation}} has affected quality significantly. Cost strategy has also affected quality significantly and also cost strategy has affected flexibility significantly. However, the cost strategy did <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> quality. Beside, quick delivery system did <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> the flexibility. The quality did <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> firm performances whereas the flexibility has affected firm performance significantly. This study attempts {{to investigate the}} effect of innovation, cost strategy and delivery system on the quality and flexibility in achieving high firm???s performances in foods and drinks industry. This research was undertaken in Makassar on 120 firms which are represented by staff, managers, directors, owners and HRD, using questionnaires. Types of firms which participated in the survey are individually owned firm, sole proprietary, commanditer and corporation which operate in the several Makassar suburb. The data were collected and analyzed by implementing Structural Equation Modeling. It shows that innovation has affected quality significantly. Cost strategy has also affected quality significantly and also cost strategy has affected flexibility significantly. However, the cost strategy did <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> quality. Beside, quick delivery system did <b>not</b> <b>affect</b> the flexibility.
