40|$|The paper {{explores the}} effects of the {{reconstruction}} schemes of the twelve banks of issue which suspended payment in early 1893 on the behaviour of monetary aggregates. Earlier estimates of narrow and broad measures of money seriously underestimate the contraction in the money stock by not netting out all of the significant proportion of deposit liabilities whose terms of maturity are so lengthened that they are effectively debentures. The paper proceeds by discussing the treatment of this matter in earlier calculations of the money stock. It then constructs an amended series that adjusts for the ‘locked up’ deposit liabilities and interminable deposit stock. Finally, a further adjustment is made by calculating the market value of the deferred <b>deposit</b> <b>receipts</b> and adding that back into the money supply. Thus a lower and upper bound of an alternative series of Australian monetary aggregates is provided. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aiming at observing the {{privatization}} {{trend of the}} state-owned enterprises after the declaration of the privatization of {{a great number of}} the state-owned enterprises in 1998. This thesis analyzed and made comments on this issue, and got an enlightenment on the overseas sale of the state-owned enterprises, according to a deep analysis of POSCO’s and KEPCO’s achievement on privatization by issuing Depositary Receipts. To issue DR (<b>deposit</b> <b>receipt</b> of stock) in overseas did not restrict the holding limitation of foreigners; it also has the advantage of getting the domestic premium in Korea. So it is considered to be the principal method of the overseas sale of the state-owned enterprises. The result of this thesis shows that, generally speaking, the recent issue of the DR of state-owned enterprises is successful as a blueprint of privatization. But in order to maximize the scale of sales financing, it is necessary to implement sale strategies by way of taking the pre-market stabilization, using financial experts, accepting various skills of selling...|$|R

60|$|As I {{tossed in}} my bed, I could see three {{possible}} courses, all extremely perilous. First, Rowley {{might have been}} mistaken; the bank might not be watched; it might still be {{possible for him to}} draw the money on the <b>deposit</b> <b>receipt.</b> Second, I might apply again to Robbie. Or, third, I might dare everything, go to the Assembly Ball, and speak with Flora under the eyes of all Edinburgh. This last alternative, involving as it did the most horrid risks, and the delay of forty-eight hours, I did but glance at with an averted head, and turned again to the consideration of the others. It was the likeliest thing in the world that Robbie had been warned to have no more to do with me. The whole policy of the Gilchrists was in the hands of Chevenix; and I thought this was a precaution so elementary that he was certain to have taken it. If he had not, of course I was all right: Robbie would manage to communicate with Flora; and by four o'clock I might be on the south road and, I was going to say, a free man. Lastly, I must assure myself with my own eyes whether the bank in George Street were beleaguered.|$|R

To do this, money would be necessary; and after leaving my paper in the hands of Flora I had still a balance of about fifteen hundred pounds. Or rather I may say I had them and I had them not; for after my luncheon with Mr. Robbie I had placed the amount, all but thirty pounds of change, in a bank in George Street, on a <b>deposit</b> <b>receipt</b> in the name of Mr. Rowley. This I had designed to be my gift to him, in case I must suddenly depart. But now, thinking better of the arrangement, I despatched my little man, cockade and all, to lift the fifteen hundred.|$|R

Bookkeeping first involves recording the details of all of these source documents into multi-column journals (also known as books of first entry or daybooks). For example, all credit sales are recorded in the sales journal; all cash payments are recorded in the cash payments journal. Each column in a journal normally corresponds to an account. In the single entry system, each transaction is recorded only once.
