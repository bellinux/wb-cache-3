However, the fast-moving Somali Current reduces the residence time of the upwelled nutrient-rich water, thus limiting biological productivity in this region somewhat. A major part of this unutilized nutrient is transported to the southern Arabian Sea, supporting biological production there.

The study was carried out in triplicate groups of flowthrough channels placed in the stream. Treatments in each group of channels included enrichments with potassium phosphate, ammonium chloride, both <b>nutrient,</b> and no <b>enrichment.</b> During the study, ambient nutrient concentrations in the stream were: nitrate-N 20 - 35 ug/L; ammonium-N 5 - 60 ug/L, and phosphate-P 0 - 11 ug/L. Decomposition rate of yellow poplar leaf disks was greater than that of oak and was stimulated in treatments enriched by N+P as well as P. Oak decomposition rates varied little among treatments. Fungal growth rates calculated from increases in ergosterol concentrations were faster on yellow poplar than on oak. Ergosterol concentrations associated with both leaf types increased more rapidly in the treatments enriched by N+P and P suggesting that phosphorus was potentially limiting fungal activity in the stream. Objective The main objective was to examine experimentally whether dissolved inorganic P, N, or both nutrients in the water limited the activity of aquatic fungi colonizing leaves and, if so, whether the response of fungi differed on leaves of different quality. Yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) was chosen as the fast decomposing leaf type and white oak (Quercus alba) as the slow decomposing leaf type.

The main goal of this work is to understand ecosystem susceptibility to eutrophication, by evaluating the isolated and combined effects of nutrient (N, P and Si) and light enrichments on phytoplankton growth and community composition during autumn, winter and spring. Microcosms of natural phytoplankton collected in the lagoon were subjected to different nutrient and light treatments and incubated in situ for 48 h. Nutrient consumption, and phytoplankton growth and community structure were evaluated using spectrophotometric methods, and inverted and epifluorescence microscopy. Diatoms were the only group potentially limited by nitrogen, and only during spring. Increased nutrient consumptions were observed for all nutrient additions in all seasons, not associated with phytoplankton growth, suggesting that luxury consumption was used to build up intracellular nutrient pools. Responses to light enrichment were inconsistent among phytoplankton groups, probably due to a high taxonomic seasonal variability. Positive responses to light enrichment were mostly observed during winter. Negative synergistic interactions between nutrients and light were also observed.
