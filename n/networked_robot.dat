40|$|Abstract—A major {{barrier to}} {{advancing}} modern wireless networking {{research is the}} lack of an effective wireless network simulation platform that simultaneously offers high fidelity, scalability, reproducibility and ease of use. MiNT [8], [7] is an innovative wireless network emulation platform that is specifically designed to satisfy all these desirable properties. To support reconfigurable network topology and wireless node mobility, MiNT is built on a <b>networked</b> <b>robot</b> system that carries wireless networking equipments and is designed to be completely tetherless, capable of supporting 24 X 7 operation, and low-cost. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of this <b>networked</b> <b>robot</b> system. Each robot node in MiNT is an iRobot’s Roomba, which is modified to house an embedded PC equipped with multiple wireless networking interfaces and to re-charge the embedded PC through Roomba’s built-in self-charging mechanism. For robot navigation and movement, MiNT’s <b>networked</b> <b>robot</b> system supports a computer vision-based robot positioning mechanism and a collision avoidance-driven trajectory planning component. Finally, MiNT provides an interactive control interface and visualization interface to give users real-time visibility into and full control over the MiNT testbed. I...|$|E

40|$|Networked robotic systems {{consist of}} a {{collection}} of interconnected components (being multiple robots working together or robots working with external systems such as wireless sensor networks or servers). These components require cooperation and collaboration to achieve a common goal. However application development for such collaborative distributed systems composed of many robots with sensors, embedded computers, and human users is very difficult. Therefore, middleware services can provide advanced approaches offering many possibilities and drastically enhancing the development process and the overall functionalities needed for networked robotic systems. This paper provides an overview study of <b>networked</b> <b>robot</b> middleware in this domain.

Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) with particle filtering is a popular method for localizing robots with laser range finders. In maps featuring long, uniform corridors though, a PF can produce low confidence estimates. When used as feedback to control an unstable vehicle this can prove fatal.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we discuss}} how <b>networked</b> <b>robot</b> {{architectures}} can facilitate the realization, deployment, management and adaptation of distributed robotic applications. Our {{aim is to}} modularize applications by factoring out environment-, task-, domain-, and robot-specific knowl-edge components and representing them explicitly in a formal knowledge base that is shared between the robots. Robot control decisions can then be formulated in terms of inference tasks that are evaluated based on this knowledge during task execution. The explicit and modular knowl-edge representation allows operators with different areas of expertise to adapt the respective parts of the knowledge independently. We re-alized this concept by integrating knowledge representation methods of the RoboEarth project with the distributed task execution capabilities of the Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wirelessly <b>networked</b> <b>robots</b> having unknown loca-tions and {{different}} individual heading directions cannot accom-plish a unified task as a group. Therefore, {{it is necessary}} to generate a set of common coordinates among them and to notify each robot of its heading direction in the generated common coordinates. However, when the robots are not equipped with sensors to identify their locations or bearings, we can use only a function in wireless communication protocol to network them as a tool to generate a set of common coordinates among them. The present paper proposes a set of common coordinates and a heading direction generation method for wirelessly <b>networked</b> <b>robots</b> with only ranging capability, which is supported in wireless communication protocol. We explain the principle of the proposed method and show some computer simulation results on the location and direction estimation errors. Finally, we outline our prototype wirelessly <b>networked</b> <b>robots</b> system to experimentally evaluate the proposed method. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{new class}} of {{low-cost}} teleoperated pan-tilt-zoom robotic video cameras can provide high resolution panoramic displays of remote sites for disaster response, environmental monitoring, and security applications. While the camera is teleoperated, the resulting video is transmitted back and inserted into an evolving panoramic display. Since small errors in camera position can produce large registration errors in the panoramic display, we address the image alignment problem. To quantify alignment error, we introduce a new metric based on motor error and image overlap. We use this metric to develop a fast minimal variance image alignment algorithm. We have implemented the algorithm and describe experiments demonstrating panoramic quality and that optimal alignment can be computed {{as fast as the}} camera can be tele-operated.
