Different distribution of maternal and paternal sequences could be observed in different sectors of the same leaf, in different leaves of the same plant, and in different plants indicating random segregation and sorting-out of maternal and paternal plastids and mitochondria in the hybrids.

50|$|Prions {{act as an}} {{alternative}} form of <b>non-Mendelian,</b> phenotypic <b>inheritance</b> due to their self-templating ability. This makes prions a metastable, dominant mechanism for inheritance that relies solely on the conformation of the protein. Many proteins containing prion domains {{play a role in}} gene expression or RNA binding, which is how {{an alternative}} conformation can give rise to phenotypic variation. For example, the psi- state of Sup35 in yeast is a translation termination factor. When Sup35 undergoes a conformational change to the PSI+ prion state, it forms amyloid fibrils and is sequestered, leading to more frequent stop codon read-through and the development of novel phenotypes. With over 20 prion-like domains identified in yeast, this gives rise to the opportunity for a significant amount of variation from a single proteome. It has been posited that this increased variation gives a selectable advantage to a population of genetically homogeneous yeast.|$|R

40|$|Several well-characterized fungal {{proteins}} act as prions, proteins {{capable of}} multiple conformations, each with different activities, {{at least one}} of which is self-propagating. Through such self-propagating changes in function, yeast prions act as protein-based elements of phenotypic inheritance. We report a prion that makes cells resistant to the glucose-associated repression of alternative carbon sources, [GAR[superscript +]] (for “resistant to glucose-associated repression,” with capital letters indicating dominance and brackets indicating its non-Mendelian character). [GAR[superscript +]] appears spontaneously at a high rate and is transmissible by <b>non-Mendelian,</b> cytoplasmic <b>inheritance.</b> Several lines of evidence suggest that the prion state involves a complex between {{a small fraction of the}} cellular complement of Pma 1, the major plasma membrane proton pump, and Std 1, a much lower-abundance protein that participates in glucose signaling. The Pma 1 proteins from closely related Saccharomyces species are also associated with the appearance of [GAR[superscript +]]. This allowed us to confirm the relationship between Pma 1, Std 1, and [GAR[superscript +]] by establishing that these proteins can create a transmission barrier for prion propagation and induction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The fact that yeast cells employ a prion-based mechanism for heritably switching between distinct carbon source utilization strategies, and employ the plasma membrane proton pump to do so, expands the biological framework in which self-propagating protein-based elements of inheritance operate.

50|$|Gene {{conversion}} {{can be one}} of {{the major}} forms of <b>non-Mendelian</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Gene conversion arises during DNA repair via DNA recombination, by which a piece of DNA sequence information is transferred from one DNA helix (which remains unchanged) to another DNA helix, whose sequence is altered. This may occur as a mismatch repair between the strands of DNA which are derived from different parents. Thus the mismatch repair can convert one allele into the other. This phenomenon can be detected through the offspring non-Mendelian ratios, and is frequently observed, e.g., in fungal crosses.|$|E
5000|$|Trinucleotide repeat {{disorders}} also {{follow a}} <b>non-Mendelian</b> pattern of <b>inheritance.</b> These diseases are all {{caused by the}} expansion of microsatellite tandem repeats consisting of a stretch of three nucleotides.

Those who progress to affected status will exhibit symptoms of their particular disease. Prominent trinucleotide repeat disorders include Fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease. In the case of Fragile X syndrome it is thought that the symptoms result from the increased methylation and accompanying reduced expression of the fragile X mental retardation gene in individuals with a sufficient number of repeats.|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{elimination}} of iodine deficiency, {{the rates of}} both permanent and transient congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in our study were higher than the comparable worldwide rates, which emphasize the major role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of CH and many studies in this regard confirm this possibility.

40|$|Epigenetic {{information}} can be passed on {{from one generation to}} another via DNA methylation, histone modifications and changes in small RNAs, a process called epigenetic memory. During a mammal’s lifecycle epigenetic reprogramming, or the resetting of most epigenetic marks, occurs twice. The first instance of reprogramming occurs in primordial germ cells and the second occurs following fertilization. These processes may be both passive and active. In order for epigenetic inheritance to occur the epigenetic modifications must be able to escape reprogramming. There are several examples supporting this <b>non-Mendelian</b> mechanism of <b>inheritance</b> including the prepacking of early developmental genes in histones instead of protamines in sperm, genomic imprinting via methylation marks, the retention of CenH 3 in mammalian sperm and the inheritance of piwi-associated interfering RNAs.

50|$|Inheritance of {{extrachromosomal}} DNA {{differs from}} the inheritance of nuclear DNA found in chromosomes.

Mutations in mtDNA or other cytoplasmic DNA will also be inherited from the mother. This uniparental inheritance is an example of <b>non-Mendelian</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Plants also show uniparental mtDNA inheritance. Most plants inherit mtDNA maternally with one noted exception being the redwood Sequoia sempervirens that inherits mtDNA paternally.|$|E
5000|$|Another form of <b>non-Mendelian</b> <b>inheritance</b> {{is known}} as {{infectious}} heredity.

[...] Because this phenotype is dependent only on the presence of the invader in the host cell’s cytoplasm, inheritance will be determined only by the infected status of the maternal parent.

50|$|In addition, a Chinese {{scientist}} {{has proposed}} possible molecular mechanisms that {{may account for}} telegony; however, his work is predicated on the beliefs of pre-Mendelian breeders to reinforce the idea that traits are passed from earlier matings. The proposed mechanisms include the penetration of spermatozoa into the somatic tissues of the female genital tract, the incorporation of the DNA released by spermatozoa into maternal somatic cells, the presence of fetal DNA in maternal blood, incorporation of exogenous DNA into somatic cells, presence of fetal cells and fetal DNA in maternal blood and sperm RNA-mediated <b>non-Mendelian</b> <b>inheritance</b> of epigenetic changes.|$|E
50|$|Uniparental <b>inheritance</b> is a <b>non-mendelian</b> form of <b>inheritance</b> that {{consists}} of the transmission of genotypes from one parental type to all progeny. That is, all the genes in offspring will originate from only the mother or only the father. This phenomenon is most commonly observed in eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. This is because such organelles contain their own DNA and are capable of independent mitotic replication that does not endure crossing over with the DNA from another parental type. Although uniparental inheritance {{is the most common}} form of inheritance in organelles, there is increased evidence of diversity. Some studies found doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) and biparental transmission to exist in cells. Evidence suggests that even when there is biparental inheritance, crossing-over doesn't always occur. Furthermore, there is evidence that the form of organelle inheritance varied frequently over time. Uniparental inheritance can be divided into multiple subtypes based on the pathway of inheritance.|$|R
40|$|Several well-characterized fungal {{proteins}} act as prions, proteins {{capable of}} multiple conformations, each with different activities, {{at least one}} of which is selfpropagating. We report a protein-based heritable element that confers resistance to glucosamine, [GAR⁺]. Genetically it resembles other yeast prions: it appears spontaneously at a rate higher than mutations and is transmissible by <b>non-Mendelian,</b> cytoplasmic <b>inheritance.</b> However, [GAR⁺] is in other ways profoundly different from known prions. [GAR⁺] propagation involves Pmal, the plasma membrane protein pump, and [GAR⁺] formation is induced by Stdl, a member of the Snf 3 /Rgt 2 glucose signaling pathway. Also, [GAR⁺] does not appear to involve the formation of an amyloid template and the prion state represents {{only a fraction of the}} Pmal protein in the cell,· consistent with the prion form constituting a complex between Pmal and Stdl, a much lower abundance protein. [GAR⁺] propagation is subject to a strong species barrier, as substitution of PMAl from other Saccharomyces species blocks propagation to s [...] cerevisiae PMAl. Direct competition between [gar-] and [GAR⁺] cells indicate that cells carrying [GAR⁺] have an advantage under certain environmental conditions. [GAR⁺] appears spontaneously in a yeast isolated from a variety of sources and can be induced by co-culturing yeast and a number of Staphylococcus species. Overall, [GAR⁺] expands the conceptual framework for self-propagating protein-based elements of inheritance to include non-amyloid, potentially multicomponent systems such as transmembrane proteins and signal transducers. by Jessica C.

50|$|Building on the {{approach}} of evolutionary developmental biology, and recent findings of molecular and behavioral biology, they argue {{the case for the}} transmission of not just genes per se, but heritable variations transmitted from generation to generation by whatever means. They suggest that such variation can occur at four levels. Firstly, at the established physical level of genetics. Secondly, at the epigenetic level involving variation in the “meaning” of given DNA strands, in which variations in DNA translation during developmental processes are subsequently transmitted during reproduction, which can then feed back into sequence modification of DNA itself. These epigenetic changes - chemical modifications and markers that change the way enzymes and regulatory proteins have access to DNA - are currently being studied to explain many <b>non-Mendelian</b> patterns of <b>inheritance.</b> The best understood mechanism is nucleotide methylation that silences a gene. Methylation can be inherited during cell division, both asexually (mitotic) during development and wound healing, but in some instances also sexually (meiotic). Methylation is linked in some instances to RNA interference, the new and emerging science of RNA regulation of gene expression.|$|R
50|$|<b>Non-Mendelian</b> <b>{{inheritance}}</b> is {{a general}} term that refers to any pattern of inheritance in which traits do not segregate in accordance with Mendel's laws. These laws describe the inheritance of traits linked to single genes on chromosomes in the nucleus. In Mendelian inheritance, each parent contributes one of two possible alleles for a trait. If the genotypes of both parents in a genetic cross are known, Mendel’s laws {{can be used to}} determine the distribution of phenotypes expected for the population of offspring. There are several situations in which the proportions of phenotypes observed in the progeny do not match the predicted values.|$|E
5000|$|Extranuclear {{inheritance}} (also {{known as}} cytoplasmic inheritance) {{is a form}} of <b>non-Mendelian</b> <b>inheritance</b> first discovered by Carl Correns in 1908. [...] While working with Mirabilis jalapa Correns observed that leaf color was dependent only on the genotype of the maternal parent. Based on these data, he determined that the trait was transmitted through a character present in the cytoplasm of the ovule. Later research by Ruth Sager and others identified DNA present in chloroplasts as being responsible for the unusual inheritance pattern observed.

5000|$|Like {{all other}} genetic concepts, the {{discovery}} of uniparental inheritance stems {{from the days of}} an Augustinian priest known as Gregor Johann Mendel. The soon-to-be [...] "father of modern genetics" [...] spent his days conducting hybridization experiments on pea plants(Pisum sativum) in his monastery's garden. During a period of seven years (1856 to 1863), Mendel cultivated and tested some 29,000 pea plants which led to him deducing the two famous generalizations known as Mendel's Laws of Heredity. The first, the law of segregation, states that [...] "when any individual produces gametes, the copies of a gene separate, so that each gamete receives only one copy". The second, the law of independent assortment, states that [...] "alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation". Although his work was published, it lay dormant until it was rediscovered in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns {{but it was not until}} 1909 that <b>non-mendelian</b> <b>inheritance</b> was even suggested. Carl Erich Correns and Erwin Baur, in separately conducted researches on Pelargonium and Mirabilis plants, observed a green-white variation (later found as the result of mutations in the chloroplast genome) that did not follow the Mendelian laws of inheritance. Nearly twenty years later, <b>non-mendelian</b> <b>inheritance</b> of a mitochondrial mutation was also observed and, in the sixties, it was proven that chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own DNA and that they are capable translation, transcription, and replication independent of the nucleus. Soon after, the discoveries of uniparental and doubly uniparental inheritance came.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{discovery}} of prion disease transmission in mammals, {{as well as}} a <b>non-Mendelian</b> type of <b>inheritance</b> in yeast, has led to the establishment of a new concept in biology, the prion hypothesis. The prion hypothesis postulates that an abnormal protein conformation propagates itself in an autocatalytic manner via recruitment of the normal isoform of the same protein as a substrate, and thereby acts either as a transmissible agent of disease (in mammals) or as a heritable determinant of phenotype (in yeast and fungus). Although reconstitution of fully infectious PrPSc in vitro from synthetic components has not yet been achieved, numerous lines of evidence indicate that the prion protein is the major and essential component, if not the only one, of the prion infectious agent. This article summarizes our current knowledge about the chemical nature of the prion infectious agent, describes potential strategies and challenges related to the generation of prion infectivity de novo, proposes new hypotheses to explain the apparently low infectivity observed in the first synthetic mammalian prions, and describes plausible effects of chemical modifications on prion conversion...|$|R
