5|$|Subramaniam {{is a rich}} {{businessman}} managing his own construction company. He {{lives with}} his wife Shanthi and sons Sanjay and Santosh. Subramaniam cares for his family a lot and excessively dotes upon his children. Santosh, the younger son, does not like this as he wants to be independent and free from his father’s guidance and control. But Santosh acts normally to avoid hurting his father. Santosh has in mind that both his career and wife should be of his choice only and not of his father. Subramaniam wants Santosh to assist him in managing the company but Santosh dreams of starting a new company on his own and does <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> to work in his father’s company. Meanwhile, Subramaniam arranges Santosh’s wedding with Rajeshwari, daughter of his friend Ramamoorthy. Santosh is shocked as he has no other option rather than agreeing for this wedding.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through agricultural and industrial expansion; moreover, the animal apparently requires a large area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. The cheetah appears to be less capable than the leopard of coexisting with humans. As such, human interference can disturb the activities, such as hunting and feeding, of cheetah. With 76% of their range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah are often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock. However, cheetahs typically do <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> livestock for prey. Game hunters may also try to harm cheetah as these carnivores can deprive them of valuable game. Roadkill can be another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near the natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Tūrān, and Bafq. The threat is posed by infectious diseases is minor, given the low population densities and hence the minimal chance of infection.|$|E

Consequently, when the estate under administration consists wholly or mainly of land, the court will grant administration to {{the heir to the}} exclusion of the next of kin. In the absence of any heir or next of kin, the Crown has the right to property (other than land) as bona vacantia, and to the land by virtue of the historic land rights of the Crown (and the Duchy of Cornwall and Duchy of Lancaster in their respective areas).

25|$|Harrison {{would indeed}} soon witness the Declaration's consequences, both {{politically}} and personally. He {{returned to the}} re-convening Congress in Philadelphia in November and assumed duties required {{in the conduct of}} the war. He, along with a number of other delegates, went to Cambridge with George Washington to plan the continuing, supporting and regulating of the Continental army. Harrison also worked closely with fellow delegates specifically for the defense of South Carolina, New York and Massachusetts. His service was requested {{as a member of the}} Committee of Secret Correspondence for the Congress, and also as Chairman of the Board of War during the Revolution. From December 1776 until March 1777 the Congress was forced by threat from British forces to remove itself to Baltimore, a location which Harrison did <b>not</b> <b>prefer.</b> A similar relocation was again required the following fall, to Pennsylvania on that occasion.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons that {{wildlife}} is seen on airports is an abundance of food. Food resources on airports can be either removed or made less desirable. One of the most abundant food resources found on airports is turfgrass. This grass is planted to reduce runoff, control erosion, absorb jet wash, allow passage of emergency vehicles, and to be aesthetically pleasing (DeVault et al. 2013) However, turfgrass is a preferred food source for species of birds that pose serious risk to aircraft, chiefly the Canada goose (Branta canadensis). Turfgrass planted at airports should be a species that geese do <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> (e.g. St. Augustine grass) and should be managed {{in such a way}} that reduces its attractiveness to other wildlife such as small rodents and raptors (Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010, DeVault et al. 2013). It has been recommended that turfgrass be maintained at a height of 7-14 inches through regular mowing and fertilization (U.S. Air Force 2004).|$|E

[...] In a series of cases {{in the first decade of}} the 2000s—Van Orden v. Perry (2005), McCreary County v. ACLU (2005), and Salazar v. Buono (2010)—the Court considered the issue of religious monuments on federal lands without reaching a majority reasoning on the subject.|$|E
500|$|In economics, a consumer's {{preferences}} are defined over all [...] "baskets" [...] of goods. Each basket is {{represented as a}} non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set of baskets, an indifference curve is defined for each consumer; a consumer's indifference curve contains all the baskets of commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair of baskets on the same indifference curve, the consumer does <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> one basket over another. Through each basket of commodities passes one indifference curve. A consumer's preference set (relative to an indifference curve) is the union of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the indifference curve. A consumer's {{preferences are}} convex if all such preference sets are convex.|$|E
500|$|Meiklejohn saw {{books as}} the main {{instrument}} of a liberal education, and chose a great books curriculum so as to model the human intellect he wished to impart and to connect the timeless philosophical questions that occupy all such works. He wanted his college to read the same books and to debate the same questions simultaneously. Meiklejohn did <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> one [...] "great book" [...] over another and saw them as interchangeable and {{in pursuit of the}} same essential questions about goodness, justice, and truth. Freshmen studied ancient Athens in the age of Pericles, reading authors such as Aeschylus, Herodotus, Homer, Plato, Thucydides, and Xenophon. Meiklejohn's curriculum accentuated the author's thoughts behind the work as related to general questions about society, and forewent emphasis on the texts themselves.|$|E

500|$|The {{distribution}} of prey may influence habitat preferences; {{in a study}} in the Kruger National Park, female cheetahs were found to spend a significant amount of time in woodlands, where impala occurred. It was suggested that though the forested area was unsuitable for hunting, the females preferred woodlands to encounter more impala. Male coalitions, on the other hand, shunned dense habitats and spent most of the time in open savannahs. An explanation given for this was that the coalitions prefer larger prey than impala. Though they do <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> montane regions, cheetahs can occur at elevations as high as [...] An open area with some cover, such as diffused bushes, is probably ideal for the cheetah because it needs to stalk and pursue its prey over a distance, exploiting its speed. This also minimises the risk of encountering larger carnivores. Complete lack of cover, however, can be a cause of prey loss and mortality.|$|E
500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} merit-making may have affected the economies of Buddhist countries in a negative way, because spending savings on the local temple would prevent consumption and investment and therefore stunt economic growth. Other researchers have disagreed, pointing out that spending resources on a Buddhist temple does stimulate economic growth through the investment in goods for the temple. It has also been suggested {{that even if the}} economy of Buddhist countries would be better off without merit-making, it would result in an economy {{that the majority of the}} population would <b>not</b> <b>prefer.</b> Another criticism often leveled at merit-making in modern times is that it prevents people from using their resources to help the poor and needy. Very often, however, temples do have many social roles in society, and offer help to many groups in society—resources are therefore redistributed widely. Moreover, since merit-making is often done as a community, merit-making may strengthen social ties, which Walters calls [...] "sociokarma".|$|E

In {{regard to}} Final Fantasy VIII, Uematsu did <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> to use multiple sources to find MIDI instruments—"I could {{be coming up}} with a great melody in the very moment"—instead using a Roland SC-88 synthesizer for the entire score. Uematsu wrote notes based on character designs and screenplays, creating a general picture of the pieces' moods. He could not express a character's emotions solely with plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game".|$|E

500|$|The greater noctule bat is a tree-dwelling bat that roosts {{in trees}} all year round. It is found {{throughout}} the deciduous forests of Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the Bosporus region of Turkey. [...] The largest concentration of greater noctule bat is in the south western portion of Spain. The greater noctule bat is a tree-obligate species that prefers oak or beech trees that have a hollow space for day roosting. [...] Greater noctule bats also roost in pine trees {{if there are no}} other options. [...] Other studies have shown that this bat greatly prefers birch trees. [...] This suggests that the greater noctule bat does <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> a specific tree, but perhaps looks for the physical condition of the tree. [...] It has been noted in several studies of greater noctule bat roosting behavior that different trees have different functions for the greater noctule bat, and that these tree-specific needs could affect roost selection for communities of greater noctule bats. Studies in Hungary (Ke´ kes peak, 1014 m a.s.l.) indicates that greater noctules prefer high roost locations. The study also hypothesizes that older, decayed trees are preferred by the species.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{was directed by}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who had previously directed Madonna's videos for [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] and [...] "Justify My Love". It was shot over two days, May 6 to 7, 1995 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and was created under Palomar Productions' Anita Wetterstedt. The video was choreographed by Jamie King, who later directed Madonna's concert tours. [...] "She wanted me to dance in her 'Human Nature' video. I didn't want to do it, but she begged", he stated. King {{was one of the}} dancers in the S attires hanging down from a swinging trapeze in the video. Her dancer Luca Tommassini was the choreography assistant. Madonna's main inspiration behind the video was the work of artist Eric Stanton who did S inspired drawings. The singer enlisted Mondino to direct the video and wanted to be about the fun aspects of Stanton's work and more dance-oriented than her previous videos from Bedtime Stories. For Mondino, the main problem was that he did <b>not</b> <b>prefer</b> too much dancing in the videos, because that resulted in extra editing.|$|E
