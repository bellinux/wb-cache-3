5|$|The {{emperor penguin}} {{is a social}} animal in its nesting and its {{foraging}} behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing. Individuals may be active day or night. A mature adult travels {{throughout most of the}} year between the <b>nesting</b> <b>area</b> and ocean foraging areas; the species disperses into the oceans from January to March.|$|E
5|$|In the Indian Ocean, loggerheads feed {{along the}} coastlines of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, {{and in the}} Arabian Sea. Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago to South Africa's St Lucia estuary. The largest Indian Ocean nesting site is Oman, on the Arabian Peninsula, which hosts around 15,000 nests, giving it the second largest nesting {{population}} of loggerheads in the world. Western Australia is another notable <b>nesting</b> <b>area,</b> with 1,000–2,000 nests per year.|$|E
5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the <b>nesting</b> <b>area</b> {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie {{down on top of}} the nest and try to blend in with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, {{a clutch}} of seven 190-million-year-old Massospondylus eggs was found in Golden Gate Highlands National Park in South Africa by James Kitching, who {{identified}} them as most likely belonging to Massospondylus. It was nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15-centimetre- (6in-) long embryos. They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found. By early 2012, at least 10 egg clutches from at least four fossiliferous horizons had been found, with up to 34 eggs per clutch. This indicates that this nesting site {{may have been used}} repeatedly (site fidelity), by groups of animals (colonial nesting); in both cases, these represent the oldest evidence of this behaviour. Sedimentary structures indicate that the <b>nesting</b> <b>area</b> was in the vicinity of a lake. The eggshells were very thin (about 0.1 mm), allowing gas exchange even in a low oxygen and carbon dioxide rich environment, which indicates that the eggs were at least partly buried in the substrate. There are no hints that Massospondylus constructed nests; however, the arrangement of the eggs in tight rows indicates that the eggs were pushed in this position by the adults.|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel {{has a very}} {{restricted}} {{range on}} the mountaintops of a single island, and is the most endangered European seabird. The birds, already confined to a limited area when discovered, {{were thought to be}} extinct by the mid-twentieth century. Two freshly fledged juveniles were found within the walls of the governor's palace in Funchal in the early 1940s, presumably attracted there by lights, but the species was not seen again until 1969. In 1969, Paul Zino played a tape of Fea's petrel from Bugio to a shepherd from Curral das Freiras; he immediately recognised the call, and led the researchers to the remaining <b>nesting</b> <b>area.</b> Predation by introduced rats meant that breeding success in the small population was low, and no young at all fledged in 1985. The Freira Conservation Project was founded in 1986 with the aim of increasing the population of Zino's petrel by controlling rats and human interference; the control was extended to cats after the mass predation of 1990.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} {{was found}} in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise xeric (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the ostrich, emu, and black-breasted buzzard, which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of sustenance. Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to heat stress. The choice of <b>nesting</b> <b>area</b> may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it {{may be related to the}} presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping.|$|E

40|$|Artificial {{light at}} night poses a {{significant}} threat to multiple taxa across the globe. In coastal regions, artificial lighting close to marine turtle nesting beaches is disruptive to their breeding success. Prioritizing effective management of light pollution {{requires an understanding}} of how the light exposure of <b>nesting</b> <b>areas</b> changes over time in response to changing temporal and spatial distributions of coastal development. We analyzed multitemporal, satellite night-light data, in combination with linear mixed model analysis, to determine broadscale changes in artificial light exposure at Australian marine turtle <b>nesting</b> <b>areas</b> between 1993 and 2010. We found seven marine turtle management units (MU), from five species, have experienced significant increases in light exposure over time, with flatback turtles nesting in east Australia experiencing the fastest increases. The remaining 12 MUs showed no significant change in light exposure. Unchanging MUs included those previously identified as having high exposure to light pollution (located in western Australia and southern Queensland), indicating that turtles in these areas have been potentially exposed to high light levels since at least the early nineties. At a finer geographic scale (within-MU), nine MUs contained <b>nesting</b> <b>areas</b> with significant increases in light exposure. These <b>nesting</b> <b>areas</b> predominantly occurred close to heavily industrialized coastal areas, thus emphasizing the importance of rigorous light management in industry. Within all MUs, <b>nesting</b> <b>areas</b> existed where light levels were extremely low and/or had not significantly increased since 1993. With continued coastal development, nesting females may shift to these darker/unchanging 'buffer' areas in the future. This is valuable information that informs our understanding of the capacity and resilience of marine turtles faced with coastal development: an understanding that is essential for effective marine turtle conservation...|$|R
25|$|With their height {{averaging}} 1.5 m (5ft), {{their large}} size deters most predators. As a result, red-crowned cranes often react indifferently {{to the presence}} of other birds such as small raptors; with harriers, falcons, owls, and small buzzards being allowed to hunt small prey near a crane nest without any of these parties harassing each other. However, birds more likely to be egg or nest predators, such as corvids, some buzzards, and various eagles, are treated aggressively and are threatened until they leave the crane's territory. Mammalian carnivores, including gray wolves, red foxes, badgers, raccoon dogs, Eurasian lynxes, and domestic dogs, are attacked immediately, with the parent cranes attempting to jab them in the flanks until the predators leave the vicinity, sometimes killing smaller enemies such as foxes. Occasionally, losses at the nest occur to some of the above predators. Introduced American mink on Hokkaido {{are one of the most}} successful predators of eggs and nestlings. Also, immature and unwary adult cranes may be killed by the largest raptors, such as sea eagles, or mammalian carnivores, though this is rare, especially with adults. White-naped cranes often nest near red-crowned cranes, but competition between these species for food in a common <b>nesting</b> <b>area</b> is lessened due to the greater portion of vegetation in the white-naped crane's diet. In cases where interactions turn aggressive between white-naped and red-crowned cranes, red-crowned cranes are dominant, as expected due to their considerably larger size.|$|E

500|$|All {{sea turtles}} have similar basic nesting behaviors. Females return to lay eggs at {{intervals}} of 12–17 days during the nesting season, {{on or near}} the beach where they hatched. They exit the water, climb the beach, and scrape away the surface sand to form a body pit. With their hind limbs, they excavate an egg chamber in which the eggs are deposited. [...] The females then cover the egg chamber and body pit with sand, and finally return to the sea. This process takes one to two hours, and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes, preferably near dune grasses that the females can use to camouflage the nest. The <b>nesting</b> <b>area</b> must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness, emergence ratio, and vulnerability to nest predators. Loggerheads have an average clutch size of 112.4 eggs.|$|E

The burrows are lined with either dry grass or sheep's wool. They may sometimes share burrows with Daurian pikas, {{but only in the}} steppes and semideserts of northern Manchuria. In parts of Mongolia, the hamsters may also share burrows with species of Meriones to save them from digging their own. In Tuva, Campbell's dwarf hamsters have been found living with other hamsters, such as the Chinese striped hamster, the Roborovski hamster, and the long-tailed dwarf hamster. The diets of the three types of hamsters are different to avoid fighting over the same type of food, which is why they live together.|$|E
500|$|Pacific loggerheads live in {{temperate}} to tropical regions. They forage in the East China Sea, {{the southwestern}} Pacific, {{and along the}} Baja California Peninsula. Eastern Australia and Japan are the major nesting areas, with the Great Barrier Reef deemed an important <b>nesting</b> <b>area.</b> Pacific loggerheads occasionally nest in Vanuatu and Tokelau. Yakushima Island {{is the most important}} site, with three nesting grounds visited by 40% of all nearby loggerheads. After nesting, females often find homes in the East China Sea, while the [...] Kuroshio Current Extension's Bifurcation region provides important juvenile foraging areas. Eastern Pacific populations are concentrated off the coast of Baja California, where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and subadults. Nesting sites along the eastern Pacific Basin are rare. mtDNA sequence polymorphism analysis and tracking studies suggest 95% of the population along the coast of the Americas hatch on the Japanese Islands in the western Pacific. The turtles are transported by the prevailing currents across the full length of the northern Pacific, one of the longest migration routes of any marine animal. The return journey to the natal beaches in Japan has been long suspected, although the trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities. Evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named Adelita, which in 1996, equipped with a satellite tracking device, made the 14,500 km (9,000 mi) trip from Mexico across the Pacific. Adelita was the first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin.|$|E
