5|$|After the First Test, Ring {{returned}} to action as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 1/31 in the hosts' first innings of 119, before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken stand of 39 as Australia declared at 8/352. In the second innings, he took {{four of the}} last five wickets and ended with 4/31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5/142 to be all out for 169. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Ring scored three runs and was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> bowl in the first innings. Yorkshire were bowled out for 206 from 90.1overs; Bradman called on Ernie Toshack and Johnston to bowl 81.1overs and did not entrust the other bowlers with substantial work. Ring then took 1/22 in the second innings as the match petered out into a draw.|$|E
5|$|When fit, Miller {{opened the}} Test bowling with Lindwall, and the pair bowled in short and fiery bursts {{with the new}} ball. The English cricket {{authorities}} had agreed {{to make a new}} ball available every 55 overs. The pre-existing rule stipulated that a replacement ball would be available every 200 runs, which usually took much more time to accumulate. This played directly {{into the hands of the}} Australians with their vastly stronger pace attack, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice bowlers for a fresh attack every 55 overs. With 13 wickets in the Tests, Miller was third among the Australians behind Lindwall and Johnston, who took 27 apiece. Owing to his fragility, Miller was used sparingly compared to the other four Australian frontline bowlers: Toshack and Johnson each delivered more than 170 overs despite playing in one less Test, while Lindwall bowled 224 and Johnston 306 in five matches. In all first-class matches, Miller took 56wickets at 17.58 and held onto 20 catches. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no intervening rest day, so Bradman ensured that his leading pace duo remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a smaller proportion of the bowling during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4 and Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Doug Ring—who was only selected in one Test—bowled 542.4 overs, while all rounders Colin McCool and Loxton bowled 399.4 and 361.2 overs respectively. McCool did not play in any Tests, while Loxton was only entrusted with 63 overs against England. As such, in some tour matches, Miller was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> bowl at all, in order to keep him fresh for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to go through}} a tour of England without defeat. Johnson returned and made 15 of 361 as Australia batted first against Kent. Johnson was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> bowl as the first four bowlers used cut down the hosts' first innings for 51 in just 23 overs. It was a similar tale in the second innings after Australia enforced the follow on. The pacemen did the early damage and Johnson bowled only briefly, sending down 4.5 overs and removing the last two batsmen to end with 2/15 as the hosts fell for 124 in 32.5 overs to seal another Australian victory by an innings in two days. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Johnson did not bat before Australia declared at 5/610 against a team featuring eight Test players. When the tourists bowled, Johnson took three consecutive wickets to reduce the hosts from 1/76 to 4/121. He ended with 4/60 from 23 overs as the Gentlemen made 245. Johnson's victims included Donnelly, future England opener Reg Simpson and former England captain Walter Robins. Bradman enforced the follow on, and Johnson took the last three wickets to end with 3/69 from 28.5 overs, including the scalps of Robins and Test player Freddie Brown. This completed another innings victory for the tourists. Johnson broke through for his first century of the tour in the next match against Somerset. Australia batted first and Johnson came in at No. 6 with the score at 4/306 to join Ron Hamence, who was also looking for his first ton of the season. The pair put on 195 runs, before Hamence fell at the closest possible point to his century, stumped for 99. Miller came out and helped Johnson add another 59 before Australia declared at 5/560, with the latter undefeated on 113. Following his innings, Johnson only bowled 10 overs in taking 1/19 for the match. The hosts were bowled out twice for a combined total of 186 from a sum of just 81.3 overs as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 374 runs. Johnson was rested for the fixture against the South of England. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 when rain ended the match.|$|E

25|$|In February 2009 Israel held {{elections}} for the Knesset. Livni, foreign minister {{and head of the}} Kadima party, campaigned against Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud party to lead the new government. While election results gave Kadima the most seats in the Knesset, parties to the right in Israel's political spectrum gained enough seats that a coalition government under Kadima leadership was unlikely. As a result, Israeli president Shimon Peres asked Netanyahu and Likud (which received one fewer seat than Kadima in the elections) to form a government; {{this was the first time}} in Israel's history that the party with the most seats was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> attempt to form a government.|$|E

He contested, and by some accounts, won a by-election to the seat of Downton in Wiltshire, but Denzil Holles, soon to rise to prominence {{as a leader of}} the opposition to the King and a personal rival of Sir Anthony, blocked Cooper's admission to the Parliament.

25|$|In the Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance (1959), the {{investigators}} Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith {{asked students to}} spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor), and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. One group of subjects were paid twenty dollars ($20); a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and the control group were <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> speak with the imposter-subject.|$|E
25|$|Lindros {{never again}} wore a Flyers uniform, {{as he sat}} out the season {{awaiting}} a trade. Craig Ramsay retained the head coaching position as Neilson was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> return, which became {{a matter of some}} controversy. Ramsay lasted only until December when he was replaced by former Flyer great Bill Barber. Brian Boucher, who as a rookie backstopped the Flyers' playoff run the previous season, could not duplicate his performance in 2000–01 and lost the starting goaltending job to Roman Cechmanek, a former star in the Czech Republic. The performance of Cechmanek, worthy of a Vezina nomination, helped the Flyers stay afloat, but they lost in the first round to Buffalo in six games.|$|E

Chalmers and Arthur were excused from the camp because of the incident and were later fined $20,000 each for missing the rookie camp, but were not fined or suspended for any drug-related violations. Both later denied any involvement with marijuana. Originally, ESPN reported that Beasley was also present in the room, but was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> leave camp.

25|$|Respondent {{was convicted}} of storing {{hazardous}} liquid mercury without a permit, “on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004,” {{in violation of the}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq.). The jury was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> determine the exact duration of the violation. In sentencing, the probation office set a maximum fine of $38.1 million, calculated by assessing the $50,000 maximum daily fine for each of the 762 days between September 19, 2002 and October 19, 2004. Respondent appealed on the basis that the jury never determined the exact duration of the violation. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the sentence, agreeing that the jury had not determined the duration of the violation, but holding that Apprendi did not apply to criminal fines.|$|E
25|$|He {{also took}} his first wicket of the tour in the second innings, ending with 1/21 from 14 overs. After batting {{for much of the}} first and second day, Miller was rested from his bowling duties during the first innings and was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> roll his arm over until the third day, once the other Australian bowlers had done most of the damage after asking the hosts to follow on. At this point, Miller had scored 421runs in the first seven days of May without being {{dismissed}} by a bowler, and the media began to speculate that he could score 1000runs in one month, something that had been done on a tour only by Bradman. This was hampered when he was rested from the match against Surrey at The Oval after playing in three consecutive first-class matches. Australia easily won the match by an innings.|$|E

Thwarted in his mission, he had some consolation in discovering a valuable fleet of Dutch merchants, and capturing most of them. Returning to politics in England after the war he spoke on a number of issues, but was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> join an administration.

25|$|In 1517, {{the town}} council hired Bernhard Burenfind from Solothurn {{to build the}} stalls. He began {{selecting}} and cutting oak wood for the stalls. However, for an unknown reason, he did not complete the work and was <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> complete any other projects in Bern. On 26 September 1522, Bern tried to hire a master carpenter from Schaffhausen for 30 pounds. In the same year, Niklaus Manuel and three others were sent to Geneva to examine the choir stalls there. On 5 December 1522, Jacob Ruess and Heini Seewagen from Schaffhausen were hired to complete {{the work on the}} stalls. They were paid much more than the 30 pounds that Bern had wanted to pay. They were paid 300 pounds in 1522, followed by 150 in the next year, 300 in 1524. They finished the work in 1525. The original stalls were repaired and renovated in 1863–64 and the carvings were repaired in 1897.|$|E
25|$|In August 1907, {{during the}} cricket season, Hobbs was {{selected}} to tour Australia with an MCC team—at the time, England teams toured under the name and badge of the MCC. Hobbs later remarked that until the improvement in his batting, he simply aimed to play for Surrey, but he realised during 1907 that {{a place in the}} England team was achievable. However, his chances of selection were increased through the rejection by four leading professional cricketers, including Hayward, of the financial terms offered for the tour. In addition, several amateur batsmen including C. B. Fry were either <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> tour or proved unavailable. It was acknowledged at the time, and by subsequent writers, that the team was not a strong one given the quality of English cricket at the time. Even so, Hobbs was not a certain choice; the influential Archie MacLaren was critical of his batting at the time, and Hobbs may have owed his selection to the support of the Surrey amateur H. D. G. Leveson Gower.|$|E
25|$|One {{experiment}} that {{was conducted to}} test the mere-exposure effect used fertile chicken eggs for the test subjects. Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks {{while they were still}} unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it. Zajonc tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were asked to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen. In a similar experiment, the individuals were <b>not</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rate the connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment. Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive {{than those who did not}} receive repeated exposure.|$|E
