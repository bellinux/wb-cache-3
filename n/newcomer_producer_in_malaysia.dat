40|$|Purpose – Price {{satisfaction}} is an influential factor in competitive performance and business success. Strong price satisfaction enhances and sustains high quality business relationships, leading to improved profits for chain participants. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to explore the dimensions of price satisfaction in the context of the Malaysian dairy industry. The aim is to determine which dimensions of price satisfaction affect relationship performance between Malaysian dairy producers and the dairy processers who purchase their milk. Design/methodology/approach – In total, eight hypotheses are tested using partial least square methods on survey results from 133 dairy <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> Findings – The study results suggest that relative price, price-quality ratio and price fairness influence producers’ loyalty and improved business relationship performance. Practical implications – To achieve long-term, sustainable business relationships involving consistent high quality supplies, milk buyers need to understand and capture the price satisfaction dimensions. Originality/value – The paper provides insights into the important linkages between price satisfaction and business performance in an agriculture industry.

The moisture content ranged between 9. 37 and 13. 83 %, whereas fat and ash content ranged from 0. 85 to 3. 38 % and 3. 39 to 5. 94 %, respectively. However, the protein content, which was 5. 53 - 15. 80 %, differentiates products with high fish content and those with low fish content. The carbohydrate content varied between 53. 62 and 80. 43 %, reflecting high use of starch in the formulation. The calcium (Ca) content in fish crackers varied between 9. 75 and 381. 50 mg/ 100 g, indicating that a small amount of fish was used or that bony fish were used in the crackers. Furthermore, sodium (Na) content was between 1183 and 1888 mg/ 100 g. The L*, a* and b* values of fish crackers ranged from 18. 69 - 47. 99, 1. 03 - 5. 89 and 7. 77 - 20. 62, respectively. The linear expansion of samples varied between 37. 55 and 145. 95 %, which is inversely proportional to the protein content but linearly correlated with the carbohydrate content.

The consequences of this will be great to the extent that sometimes will cause the company involved to wind up the operation and close the business. The impact of such incidents can be minimized if power plant operators are equipped with the relevant skills, knowledge, methodologies and suitable tools to evaluate the cause and source of these problems and at the same time, take remedy to rectify the problems and make sure it will not recur in the future.

The outcome is about the background of the restructuring of Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) especially for Malaysia Electricity Supply Industry (MESI). Before the restructuring of the MESI, Tenaga Nasional Berhad, (TNB) was monopolized electricity market from generation, transmission, and distribution sector. It comes to the end when Independent Power Producer, (IPP) introduced by the Malaysian Government with the aim to avoid shortage and facilitate competitions among generators and the first IPP <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> is YTL Corporation Sdn.

From the literature review which has displayed the weakness of this model, this Master Project thus has proposed two other models in deregulated electricity market that can be applied for MESI which are the Bilateral Market Model and Hybrid Market Model in order to carry on the MESI previous plan towards restructuring. In this project, the proposed models are designed to carry out the power generation revenue for selected Independent Power <b>Producers</b> (IPPs) <b>in</b> <b>Malaysia</b> <b>in</b> order to accommodate a fair competitive trading between power producers and produce win-win situation to all involved market participants. The analysis from the results obtained in the proposed model illustrates guaranteed incomes for all selected IPPs, the pattern of the profits for each IPP and the factors that determines those incomes and profits.
