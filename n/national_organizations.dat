5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, <b>national</b> <b>organizations</b> {{on both the}} gun rights and gun control sides became involved by providing mailings and donations. Once {{the petition}}s were submitted, Morse and Giron challenged the effort in court, but were denied the injunction that they had requested from the court. A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather than by mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E

In 1968, she was elected the {{president}} of the New York chapter of the <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> for Women; she came out as a lesbian later that year. In 1969, she designed the logo for the <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> for Women which is still their logo today. Also in 1969, she held a public forum titled [...] "Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?", which was the first time lesbian concerns were introduced into the <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> for Women. In 1970, she led a demonstration at the Statue of Liberty where she and others from the <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> for Women's New York chapter draped an enormous banner over a railing which read [...] "WOMEN OF THE WORLD UNITE!" [...] During her time at the <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> for Women's New York chapter she also introduced feminist consciousness raising, which was later adapted for all chapters in the organization to participate in. However, later in 1970 Betty Friedan engineered the expulsion of lesbians from the <b>National</b> <b>Organization</b> for Women's New York chapter, including Ivy Bottini.|$|R
5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, <b>national</b> <b>organizations</b> {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in. On the recall, pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, while on the gun control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights and abortion.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some <b>national</b> <b>organizations</b> for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E
5|$|About 30% of {{undergraduate}} men and about 40% {{of undergraduate}} women at Duke {{are members of}} fraternities and sororities. Most of the 17 Interfraternity Council recognized fraternity chapters live in sections within the residence halls. Starting in 2012, the nine Panhellenic Association sorority chapters decided to live in houses (clusters of apartments) on Central Campus. Not all sorority members live with their chapters, though, as membership exceeds house space. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters at Duke. In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that {{are a part of}} the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization. Duke also has Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students seeking informal residential communities often built around themes. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any <b>national</b> <b>organizations.</b> Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members.|$|E

5|$|The Mérens or Cheval de Mérens, still {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} by the older name of Ariégeois pony, is a small, rustic horse native to the Pyrenees and Ariégeois mountains of southern France, where the Ariège River flows, and northern Spain, near Andorra. Two general types, a small, light traditional mountain horse and a taller, sportier modern type, are found. Always black in color, Mérens must meet strict physical standards {{in order to be}} registered in the stud book. The breed is known for its sure-footedness on mountain terrain, as well as for its endurance, hardiness and docility. The French breed registry organizes regional offices, and partners with other <b>national</b> <b>organizations</b> in Europe to preserve and promote the breed. The organization enforces rigorous selection of breeding stock, with a goal of increasing quality in the breed. In the past, the Mérens was used for farm work, draft work and as pack horses. Today it is mainly used as a saddle horse, although some members of the breed have been successful in carriage driving. Many Mérens are taken on an annual transhumance (seasonal migration), in which they are moved higher in the mountains during the summer and into the valleys for the winter. An old practice, it fell into disfavor, but has recently re-emerged.|$|E
