60|$|About {{this period}} of the year changes of {{temperature}} are sometimes very abrupt, and their consequences curious. During the <b>night</b> <b>frost</b> had again set in with great intensity. Fatigue had compelled the party to sleep longer than usual, despite their anxiety to press forward, and when they awoke the rays of the rising sun were sweeping over the whole landscape, and revealing, as well as helping to create, a scene of beauty which is seldom, if ever, witnessed elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|Since, {{owing to}} the {{overhanging}} conformation of the place, it was quite impossible for us to descend in front where pressure had made the snow hard as stone, we were obliged to risk a march over the looser material upon its flank. As {{there was nothing to}} be gained by waiting, off we went, Leo leading and step by step trying the snow. To our joy we discovered that the sharp <b>night</b> <b>frost</b> had so hardened its surface that it would support us. About half way down, however, where the pressure had been less, it became much softer, so that we were forced to lie upon our faces, which enabled us to distribute our weight over a larger surface, and thus slither gently down the hill.|$|E
60|$|Soon after this, {{signs of}} {{approaching}} winter {{began to make}} their appearance in the regions of the North Pole. The sun, which at first had been as a familiar friend night and day, had begun to absent himself not only all night, but during {{a large portion of}} each day, giving sure though quiet hints of his intention to forsake the region altogether, and leave it to the six months' reign of <b>night.</b> <b>Frost</b> began to render the nights bitterly cold. The birds, having brought forth and brought up their young, were betaking themselves to more temperate regions, leaving only such creatures as bears, seals, walruses, foxes, wolves, and men, to enjoy, or endure, the regions of the frigid zone.|$|E

60|$|Hours later, {{when the}} crowd had {{forgotten}} him, he stole out again into the garden. He sat down amid the ruins of his hope, and wondered what could have caused the fiasco. Still puzzled, he drew from his pocket a box of matches, and, lighting one, he held it to the seared end of a rocket he had {{tried in vain to}} light four hours ago. It smouldered for an instant, then shot with a swish into the air and broke into a hundred points of fire. He tried another and another with the same result. He made a fresh attempt to fire the set piece. Point by point the whole picture--minus the captain and one mast--came out of the night, and stood revealed in all the majesty of flame. Its sparks fell upon the piled-up heap of candles, wheels, and rockets that a little while before had obstinately refused to burn, and that, one after another, had been thrown aside as useless. Now with the <b>night</b> <b>frost</b> upon them, they leaped to light in one grand volcanic eruption. And in front of the gorgeous spectacle he stood with only one consolation--his mother's hand in his.|$|E

5000|$|In 1972, Macmillan Publishers {{invited him}} to write a book, and he wrote Frost at Christmas. This was {{rejected}} and not published until the early 1980s in Canada. Wingfield had originally planned to kill Frost in the first book, but he was persuaded instead to leave it as an open ending. Following this, two more Frost books were written: A Touch of Frost and <b>Night</b> <b>Frost.</b> In 1977 Frost appeared in a radio play called Three Days of Frost, in which Frost was played by Leslie Sands, a friend of Wingfield's. The books were first published in the United Kingdom in early 1989, and in 1992 Frost first appeared on television in A Touch of Frost, played by David Jason.

50|$|Superpáramo is at {{the highest}} {{elevation}} and is usually {{considered to be the}} transition zone between the higher, permanent snow region and the lower grass páramo zone. The superpáramo zone is generally narrow and exists atop loose stones and sandy soils at about 4500 - 4800 m. It has the lowest air temperature, precipitation level, soil water-holding capacity, and nutrient content of all the zones. Being the highest in altitude, it also has the highest levels of solar radiation and <b>night</b> <b>frost.</b> For this reason, vegetation in the superpáramo must be highly resistant to such severe fluctuations in weather. Air temperatures are low - cold at night and cool during the day with daily oscillations greater than the oscillations of monthly averages. Due to its localization on high mountains, this area is the least disturbed by humans and contains the most endemic species of all the zones. Flora includes Azorella pedunculata of the Apiaceae family and species from the Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Ericaceae families.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{his poems}} deal with life in rural Finland.

Three times, a frosty night destroys his crops.

50|$|Although {{the main}} {{objectives}} of the German Army before winter fell were to capture Leningrad, Moscow and the approaches to the Caucasian oilfields, Kharkov was an important secondary objective. Besides {{the need to protect}} the flanks of its motorized spearheads, the OKH, the German Army high command, (Oberkommando des Heeres), also saw the importance of Kharkov as an industrial center and railroad hub. Capturing the city meant that the Southwestern and Southern Front had to fall back on Voronezh and Stalingrad as their major transport hubs. When, in the second week of October, the rainy season of the Rasputitsa (the 'mud' season) and the poor logistics in the area between the Dnepr and the front, (all the bridges had collapsed during combat and ice threatened the pontoons), caused the offensive to stall. Hitler personally allocated resources from the 17th Army to the 6th Army to ensure the capture of Kharkov. This, however, weakened the 17th Army's effort to protect the flank of the 1st Panzer Army and contributed to the German defeat at the Battle of Rostov. After 17 October, <b>night</b> <b>frost</b> improved the roads, but snow storms and the cold started to hamper the Germans, who were insufficiently equipped for winter operations (the German Army had planned that Barbarossa would be over before winter fell).|$|E
40|$|Four Solanum tuberosum L. cultivars (Nicola, Pito, Puikula, Timo) {{and somatic}} hybrids between {{freezing}} tolerant S. commersonii and freezing sensitive S. tuberosum were evaluated for their tolerance to freezing and low temperature photoinhibition. Cellular freezing tolerance was studied using ion leakage tests and {{the sensitivity of}} the photosynthetic apparatus to freezing and high light intensity stress by measuring changes in chlorophyll fluorescence (FV/FM) and oxygen evolution. Exposure to high light intensities after freezing stress increased frost injury significantly in all genotypes studied. Compared with S. tuberosum cultivars, the hybrids were more tolerant both of freezing and intense light stresses. In field experiments the mechanism of frost injury varied according to the severity of <b>night</b> <b>frosts.</b> During <b>night</b> <b>frosts</b> in 1999, the temperature inside the potato canopy was significantly higher than at ground level, and did not fall below the lethal temperature for potato cultivars (from - 2. 5 to - 3. 0 °C). As a result, frost injury developed slowly, indicating that damage occurred to the photosynthetic apparatus. However, as the temperature at ground level and inside the canopy fell below - 4 °C, cellular freezing occurred and the canopy was rapidly destroyed. This suggests that in the field visual frost damage can follow from freezing or non-freezing temperatures accompanied with high light intensity. Therefore, in an attempt to improve low temperature tolerance in potato, it is important to increase tolerance to both freezing and chilling stresses...|$|R
50|$|Like most of Iraqi Kurdistan, Rawanduz has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) {{with very}} hot dry summers and cool, wet winters. The winters see lows below {{freezing}} in many <b>nights,</b> making <b>frost</b> prevalent. Snowfall occurs occasionally.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{ice-free}} Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, {{with the long}} nights often staying above freezing {{in the south of}} the country due to the abundant cloud cover. By the time winter finally breaks through, daylight hours rise quickly, ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring. With the greater number of clear <b>nights,</b> <b>frosts</b> remain commonplace quite far south as late as April. The cold winters occur when low-pressure systems are weaker. An example is that the coldest ever month (January 1987) in Stockholm was also the sunniest January month on record.|$|R
