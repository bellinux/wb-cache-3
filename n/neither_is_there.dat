5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

Adjunctive antibiotics in the form of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, {{but is a}} cold work lacking in the {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E

2500|$|Jews in Medina are {{singled out}} as [...] "men whose malice and enmity was aimed at the Apostle of God". The Yahūd in this {{literature}} appear not only as malicious, but also deceitful, cowardly and totally lacking resolve. However, they have none of the demonic qualities attributed to them in mediaeval Christian literature, <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> anything comparable to the overwhelming preoccupation with Jews and Judaism (except perhaps in the narratives on Muhammad's encounters with Medinan Jewry) in Muslim traditional literature.

2500|$|Queens, a {{borough of}} New York City, was {{supposedly}} named after Catherine of Braganza, {{since she was}} queen when Queens County was established in 1683. Queens' naming is {{consistent with those of}} Kings County (the borough of Brooklyn, originally named after her husband, King Charles II) and Richmond County (the borough of Staten Island, named after his illegitimate son, the 1st Duke of Richmond). However, there is no historical evidence that Queens County was named in her honor, <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> a document from the time proclaiming it so. Some written histories of Queens skip over the monarch entirely and make no mention of her or her supposed namesake county. Historians furthermore argue that Catherine [...] "probably didn't even know Queens existed" [...] and point out that [...] "Catherine herself ... played no role in the settlement of Queens." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{non-traditional}} view is {{that the}} betrothal was effected simply by purchasing the girl from her father (or guardian). The price paid for her (bride price) is known by the Hebrew term mohar (מוהר). The girl's consent is not explicitly required by any statement in the Bible, <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> explicit permission to ignore it. Yet, as the servant of Abraham was seeking a Bride for Isaac, and discovered Rebekah living in Haran, {{it should be noted that}} her father Bethuel, and her brother Laban, said, [...] "Let us call the young woman and ask her." [...] And they called Rebekah and said to her, [...] "Will you go with this man?" [...] She said, [...] "I will go."(Genesis 24:57, 58) It was customary in biblical times for the bride to be given part of the mohar. Gradually it lost its original meaning, and the custom arose of giving the mohar entirely to the bride, rather than to her father.|$|E

2500|$|Evidence that is {{consistent}} with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Recent statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal. <b>Neither</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on [...] "the Resource Curse" [...] that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy. The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the [...] "deep" [...] determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic. More inclusive institutions lead to democracy because as people gain more power, they are able to demand more from the elites, who in turn have to concede more things to keep their position. This virtuous circle, may end up in democracy.|$|E
2500|$|Plugs and sockets {{are usually}} {{designed}} together, with the contacts of the socket part designed {{to accept the}} specific pin diameter, pin length, and pin spacing of the mating plug part. However, there is no socket defined by EN50075; <b>neither</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> a socket specified in CEE7 to accept only [...] pins or {{the profile of a}} Europlug. (There are examples of sockets on the market which accept only such plugs, sometimes in multiples, but these meet no recognized standard.) Instead of being designed with a matching socket, the Europlug was designed to be compatible with a range of sockets in common use throughout mainland Europe. These sockets, including the CEE7/1, CEE7/3 (German/"Schuko"), CEE7/5 (French), and most Israeli, Swiss, Danish and Italian sockets, were designed to accept pins of various diameters, mainly 4.8mm but also 4.0mm and 4.5mm, and are usually fed by final circuits with either 10 A or 16 A overcurrent protection devices. To improve contact with socket parts intended to receive pins having a diameter larger than 4.0mm, the Europlug has two round, slightly flexible pins which converge slightly towards their free ends.|$|E
