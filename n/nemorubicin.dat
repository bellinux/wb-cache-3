5000|$|Anthracyclines {{are used}} to treat various cancers and as of 2012 {{were among the most}} {{commonly}} used chemotherapeutic agents. [...] Doxorubicin and its derivative, epirubicin, are used in breast cancer, childhood solid tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and aggressive lymphomas. Daunorubicin is used to treat acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemias, and its derivative, idarubicin is used in multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and breast cancer. Other anthracycline derivates include <b>nemorubicin,</b> used for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, pixantrone, used as a second-line treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, sabarubicin, used for non-small cell lung cancer, hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer, and platinum- or taxane-resistant ovarian cancer, and valrubicin, which is used for the topical treatment of bladder cancer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Drug {{resistance}} {{is one of}} the major obstacles limiting the activity of anticancer agents. Activation of DNA repair mechanism often accounts for increase resistance to cancer chemotherapy. Results We present evidence that <b>nemorubicin,</b> a doxorubicin derivative currently in clinical evaluation, acts through a mechanism of action different from classical anthracyclines, requiring an intact nucleotide excision repair (NER) system to exert its activity. Cells made resistant to <b>nemorubicin</b> show increased sensitivity to UV damage. We have analysed the mechanism of resistance and discovered a previously unknown mechanism resulting from methylation-dependent silencing of the XPG gene. Restoration of NER activity through XPG gene transfer or treatment with demethylating agents restored sensitivity to <b>nemorubicin.</b> Furthermore, we found that a significant proportion of ovarian tumors present methylation of the XPG promoter. Conclusions Methylation of a NER gene, as described here, is a completely new mechanism of drug resistance and this is the first evidence that XPG gene expression can be influenced by an epigenetic mechanism. The reported methylation of XPG gene could be an important determinant of the response to platinum based therapy. In addition, the mechanism of resistance reported opens up the possibility of reverting the resistant phenotype using combinations with demethylating agents, molecules already employed in the clinical setting. </p...|$|E
40|$|The DNA alkylating {{mechanism}} of PNU- 159682 (PNU), a highly potent metabolite of the anthracycline <b>nemorubicin,</b> was investigated by gel-electrophoretic, HPLC-UV, and micro-HPLC/mass spectrometry (MS) measurements. PNU quickly reacted with double-stranded oligonucleotides, {{but not with}} single-stranded sequences, to form covalent adducts which were detectable by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (DPAGE). Ion-pair reversephase HPLC-UV analysis on CG rich duplex sequences having a 5 ′-CCCGGG- 3 ′ central core showed the formation of two types of adducts with PNU, which were stable and could be characterized by micro-HPLC/MS. The first type contained one alkylated species (and possibly one reversibly bound species), and the second contained two alkylated species per duplex DNA. The covalent adducts were found to produce effective bridging of DNA complementary strands through the formation of virtual cross-links reminiscent of those produced by classical anthracyclines {{in the presence of}} formaldehyde. Furthermore, the absence of reactivity of PNU with CG-rich sequence containing a TA core (CGTACG), and the minor reactivity between PNU and CGC sequences (TACGCG·CGCGTA) pointed out the importance of guanine sequence context in modulating DNA alkylation...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} <b>nemorubicin</b> (MMDX), an investigational antitumor drug, {{is converted to}} an active metabolite, PNU- 159682, by human liver cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A 4. The objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate MMDX metabolism by liver microsomes from laboratory animals (mice, rats, and dogs of both sexes) to ascertain whether PNU- 159682 is also produced in these species, and to identify the CYP form(s) responsible for its formation; (2) to compare the animal metabolism of MMDX with that by human liver microsomes (HLMs), {{in order to determine}} which animal species is closest to human beings; (3) to explore whether differences in PNU- 159682 formation are responsible for previously reported species- and sex-related differences in MMDX host toxicity. The animal metabolism of MMDX proved to be qualitatively similar to that observed with HLMs since, in all tested species, MMDX was mainly converted to PNU- 159682 by a single CYP 3 A form. However, there were marked quantitative inter- and intra-species differences in kinetic parameters. The mouse and the male rat exhibited V(max) and intrinsic metabolic clearance (CL(int)) values closest to those of human beings, suggesting that these species are the most suitable animal models to investigate MMDX biotransformation. A close inverse correlation was found between MMDX CL(int) and previously reported values of MMDX LD(50) for animals of the species, sex and strain tested here, indicating that differences in the in vivo toxicity of MMDX are most probably due to sex- and species-related differences in the extent of PNU- 159682 formation...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Nemorubicin</b> (3 '-deamino- 3 '-[2 "(S) -methoxy- 4 "-morpholinyl]doxorubicin; MMDX) is an {{investigational drug}} {{currently}} in phase II/III clinical testing in hepatocellular carcinoma. A bioactivation product of MMDX, 3 '-deamino- 3 ", 4 '-anhydro-[2 "(S) -methoxy- 3 "(R) -oxy- 4 "-morpholinyl]doxorubicin (PNU- 159682), has been recently identified in an incubate {{of the drug}} with NADPH-supplemented rat liver microsomes. The aims {{of this study were}} to obtain information about MMDX biotransformation to PNU- 159682 in humans, and to explore the antitumor activity of PNU- 159682. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human liver microsomes (HLM) and microsomes from genetically engineered cell lines expressing individual human cytochrome P 450 s (CYP) were used to study MMDX biotransformation. We also examined the cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of PNU- 159682 using a panel of in vitro-cultured human tumor cell lines and tumor-bearing mice, respectively. RESULTS: HLMs converted MMDX to a major metabolite, whose retention time in liquid chromatography and ion fragmentation in tandem mass spectrometry were identical to those of synthetic PNU- 159682. In a bank of HLMs from 10 donors, rates of PNU- 159682 formation correlated significantly with three distinct CYP 3 A-mediated activities. Troleandomycin and ketoconazole, both inhibitors of CYP 3 A, markedly reduced PNU- 159682 formation by HLMs; the reaction was also concentration-dependently inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to CYP 3 A 4 / 5. Of the 10 cDNA-expressed CYPs examined, only CYP 3 A 4 formed PNU- 159682. In addition, PNU- 159682 was remarkably more cytotoxic than MMDX and doxorubicin in vitro, and was effective in the two in vivo tumor models tested, i. e., disseminated murine L 1210 leukemia and MX- 1 human mammary carcinoma xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: CYP 3 A 4, the major CYP in human liver, converts MMDX to a more cytotoxic metabolite, PNU- 159682, which retains antitumor activity in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Pre{{clinical}} {{and clinical}} studies of CYP gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy have {{been focused on}} anticancer prodrugs activated by CYP 2 B enzymes, which have low endogenous expression in human liver; however, the gene therapeutic potential of CYP 3 A enzymes, which are highly expressed in human liver, remains unknown. This study investigated methoxymorpholinyl doxorubicin (MMDX; <b>nemorubicin),</b> a novel CYP 3 A-activated anticancer prodrug. Retroviral transfer of CYP 3 A 4 increased 9 L gliosarcoma cell chemosensitivity to MMDX 120 -fold (IC 50 0. 2 nM in 9 L/ 3 A 4 cells). In CHO cells, overexpression of P 450 reductase in combination with CYP 3 A 4 enhanced chemosensitivity to MMDX, and to ifosfamide, another CYP 3 A 4 prodrug, 11 - to 23 -fold compared with CYP 3 A 4 expression alone. CYP 3 A 4 expression and MMDX chemosensitivity were increased in human lung (A 549) and brain (U 251) tumor cells infected with replication-defective adenovirus encoding CYP 3 A 4. Coinfection with Onyx- 017, a replication-conditional adenovirus that coamplifies and coreplicates the Adeno- 3 A 4 virus, led to large increases in CYP 3 A 4 RNA but only modest increases in CYP 3 A 4 protein and activity. MMDX induced remarkable growth delay of 9 L/ 3 A 4 tumors, but not the P 450 -deficient parental 9 L tumors, in immunodeficient mice administered low-dose MMDX either intravenous or by direct intratumoral (i. t.) injection (60 mg kg 1, every 7 days 3). Notably, the i. t. route was substantially less toxic to the mouse host. No antitumor activity was observed with intraperitoneal MMDX treatment, suggesting a substantial hepatic first pass effect, with activated MMDX metabolites formed in the liver having poor access to the tumor site. These studies demonstrate that human CYP 3 A 4 has strong potential for MMDX prodrug-activation therapy and suggest that endogenous tumor cell expression of CYP 3 A 4...|$|E
