If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section.

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects {{the elderly and}} {{accounts for more than}} half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl {{making up the}} remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both have nuclear spin 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance,</b> although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear quadrupole moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine.|$|E

In this field, nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells.

The field is beginning {{to be used as}} a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures.

They identified the substances involved (the calcium salts), as well as the chemical reactions that originated them. They concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originating from the immediate environment in which the specimens are stored.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has two stable isotopes, 79Br and 81Br. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes, with 79Br making up 51% of natural bromine and 81Br {{making up the}} {{remaining}} 49%. Both have nuclear spin 3/2− and thus {{may be used for}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance,</b> although 81Br is more favourable. The other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are 80Br (t1/2 = 17.7min), 80mBr (t1/2 = 4.421h), and 82Br (t1/2 = 35.28h), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural bromine. The most stable bromine radioisotope is 77Br (t1/2 = 57.04h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 79Br is electron capture to isotopes of selenium; that of isotopes heavier than 81Br is beta decay to isotopes of krypton; and 80Br may decay by either mode to stable 80Se or 80Kr.|$|E

5|$|Crystal {{structures}} of proteins (which are irregular {{and hundreds of}} times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal {{structures of}} proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E

It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre.

In the oxidized form of HiPIP (formally S = 1 / 2), contact-shifted resonances attributed to the β-CH 2 groups of two cysteine residues display approximate Curie law behavior, while contact-shifted resonances assigned to the two other cysteine residues continue to exhibit a temperature dependence characteristic of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling.
