Portugal's nationalized sector in 1980 included a core of fifty non-financial enterprises, which were entirely government owned. This so-called public <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprise</b> group included the Institute of State Participation, a holding company with investments in some seventy subsidiary enterprises; a number of state-owned entities manufacturing or selling goods and services grouped with nationalized enterprises for national accounts purposes (arms, agriculture, and public infrastructure such as ports); and a large number of over 50 percent EPNF-owned subsidiaries operating under private law. Altogether, these public enterprises accounted for 25 percent of VA in GDP, 52 percent of GFCF, and 12 percent of Portugal's total employment. In terms of VA and GFCF, the relative scale of Portugal's public entities exceeded that of the other western European economies, including the EC member countries.|$|E

The main goal of this thesis is an evaluation of the economic behavior of <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the ownership of the government (NPVV) in the selected sector of the national economy. The theoretical part is dealing with a short description of these enterprises and with issues with their efficiency. This was analysed in separate studies. The practical part deals with a development of the individual types of the profitability (type of an income of the production) in the context of the national economy and industry type if the of selected national accounts during the 1999 - 2010 period. The conclusions of the individual chapters are interconnected at the end of this thesis. The method is to compare the conclusions from the industry subsectors with the conclusions from the national economy subsector. The conclusions are compared with the NPVV informations extracted from the related studies. The <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> subsector indicator results are also evaluated in this thesis. The analysed branch was the ground and pipeline transportation branch due to substantial share of the public <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> NPV (13. 3 %) and the national private <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> NPS (3. 74 %) production in 2010 (these were the main subsectors of the researched <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises).</b> The production and the income have been approsimately developed at the same average as in the sector and the national economy also. Their output is comparable due to that. The comparation of the profitability by using the gross added value shows us that the NPV have better results. However the position of NPV and NPS switches and the differences become deepen when we use the net added value and other sources of income. There is even a regular negative profitability if we use the net disposable income of the NPV. There is an issue with the salary of the employees mainly in the NPV according to the research. But it is interesting that issues related to the financial crisis are not affecting the NPV as fast as the NPS. The NPS is affected by the problems almost immediately, however the NPV are affected with a delay and with a less intensity.

Empirical studies, such as Petersen and Rajan (1997), have been ambiguous about which of these two hypotheses is being tested. By using data where individual trading companies supply both loans and trade credit we examine the importance of the different financial instruments for trading company finance. By controlling for these instruments, we also examine how the differing characteristics of financial and non-financial institutions affect the flow of credit to firms.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a new accounting standard for financial instruments, has raised {{a number of issues}} related to the application of fair value principles. This paper discusses some of these issues which are generally related to the fact that "fair values" are not always easily defined or readily available. It concludes that the application of fair value for financial liabilities might present fewer complications if it is matched by similar valuation principles for financial assets. The issue of measurement error is more complicated as it can be related to whether valuations refer to exit value, as postulated by the IASB, or deprival value, which is more closely related to firm-specific valuation. Measurement error is magnified in the income statement and so will be any biases from the application of historical accounting for derivatives. Despite any measurement issues, the problem of institution-specific dimensions of value that looms so large in the case of <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> and makes the systematic application of fair value accounting fraud with difficulty there, would seem to be much more manageable for financial institutions because of their familiarity with risk measurement and management techniques for financial instruments. financial statements, institution-specific value, fair value, financial reporting...|$|R

40|$|Cost {{and price}} have a {{misunderstood}} relationship. Whenever cost and price exceed expected values, public opinion wants an explanation. Usually {{it is said}} that price increases in some areas cause the increase in the price level. Additionally higher labor cost or big margins are said to be the underlying cause. But higher costs of any kind and bigger profits only imply an increase in cost and price when demand is rigid and the supply is monopolized without close substitutes, or when there is a gap in the reaction of supply to the new demand. In other cases the result is a reduction in profits, and as a reply, changes in the combination of productive factors and the {{reduction in the number of}} supplies. Labor cost is an agreed fixed cost in the most European countries and Spain. An increase in that cost exceeding an improvement in performance results in the medium term in a lower demand for labor. In the short term the result is a reduction in profits. Labor costs have absorbed around 20 % of total sales volume in <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the last 20 years. Net margins of <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises,</b> as an average, represented 3 % of sales volume. This has several implications: Big relative changes in margins, even if the result of deliberate actions, should have a very limited impact in cost and price; empirical evidence shows that statistical correlation between cost and margins price and are negligible and show rather that price creates a good environment for entrepreneurial profits; when profits decrease, there is no influence on cost and price; and the link between cost and price and in other European countries has the same shape as in Spain. Price stability helps profits to increase. The level of profits is determined by the increase in GDP through two effects: more sales give more profits while fixed costs are spread over more sales and unit costs decrease which improve the margin: more demand pushes prices up, but only temporarily until new supply matches demand. Only when the gap between demand and supply can be covered rapidly or when monetary policy is expansive, the movement of prices can be sustained. Economic authorities have three ways to contribute to price stability: Monetary policy, control of their current expenses so to avoid a big increase in aggregate demand, and supply side policies to allow a rapid answer to changes in demand and to increased competition in markets. Changes in relative prices and cost and price are different things. Attempts so control the first create expectations of monetary stability, which help to promote economic growth. Attempts to control the second disturb the efficiency in the assignation process of productive factors and deteriorates the potential rate of GDP growth. Direct price control is condemned to failure because it means controlling the cost of productive factors and the economic activity as a whole, but requires non-available information and an intervention power that does not exist. Furthermore it results in repressed inflation, decreases in quality, double pricing and a reduction in the volume of activity. Moral admonitions have no effects at all. It is not costs that form prices but the opposite. The expectation of prices makes the entrepreneur accept costs and, if the forecast proves to be correct, the margin appears as a residual rent. To promote price stability is far better in educating consumers in order to use their purchasing power to avoid price increases than blaming activities where prices have the biggest propensity to grow...|$|R

The objective is firstly to assess whether {{it is useful to}} create a so-called standard model, i. e. a solution model, which could be used repeatedly in independent BI project implementations. The objective is to analyse whether there are similarities among the implemented BI projects in terms of content requirements (measures and dimensions), or what are the differences. The objective is then to design a standard solution model (design relational and dimensional model for data structures). Another objective is to create a functional prototype solution based on the designed model, i. e. to create the actual data structures and fill them with data. A part of this prototype solution should be a set of demonstrative reports. The objectives will be achieved first of all by analysing the theoretical foundations, which provides the literature, and by analysing available real project documentation. Considered BI projects have been implemented within several non-financial commercial institutions. That means that the outputs of this thesis are applicable primarily in <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> environments. In the next step, the dimensional modelling techniques will be used to create the schema. Then, leveraging the knowledge of BI solution development techniques on Microsoft SQL Server platform, the prototype solution will be deployed. Reports will be developed using the Microsoft Excel client tool. The benefit of this thesis consists in the model added value, which can be used as the core of newly developed financial BI solutions. The implementation process should by this spare some time.

In light of the particular interest in the access of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to financing, the report also analyses how financing patterns differ across large, medium-sized and small enterprises. Finally, the report discusses the recent trends observed in the corporate finance landscape of the euro area over the past few years. Although it is still too early to pass final judgement, vast structural changes are underway that could have already influenced in a positive way in the availability of external funds for firms. All in all, a comprehensive understanding of corporate finance in the euro area is important from a monetary policy perspective, given its impact on the transmission mechanism and for productivity and economic growth. Moreover, such an understanding is also relevant from a financial stability perspective. A first assessment is now possible eight years into the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), given that sufficient data have been accumulated during this period. This assessment is particularly important as the introduction of the single currency has had significant structural effects on the working of financial markets, increasing their size and liquidity, and fostering cross-border competition.

40|$|The {{portfolio}} balance approach, on which KOFI is based, {{as well as}} its formal structure, has been described in an earlier Working Paper. The purpose of the present paper is to place the model in its institutional context and to illustrate its properties by simulations. Furthermore, previous work with Swedish and foreign financial models has shown that the statistical input has been a bottleneck hampering full exploitation of the {{portfolio balance}} approach. In order to widen the bottleneck as far as possible, extensive work has been undertaken in order to supply KOFI with relevant unpublished statistics. The number of sectors in KOFI is less than in the Swedish financial accounts, but larger than in similar foreign models, and thus requires a relatively large volume of statistics. That volume is manifold as data are collected on a yearly as well as a half-yearly and quarterly basis. To link up with KOSMOS - which is a semi-annual model - yearly statistics had to be transformed into half-yearly data. Another comlication has been frequent incompatibility between the data from Statistics Sweden and from other sources. The statistical work has focused on capital markets and foreign exchange markets i. e. on the areas which represent the core of a financial model. The selection of sectors and of the variables in the sector portfolios has been made with regarded to their importance in simulations of financial macroprocesses. In practice the handling of the model has required that - compared to the financial accounts - a number of items are excluded because they are relatively small, relatively constant or difficult to interpret. To the latter category belong the residuals ("other assets and liabilities") that appear on both the debit and the credit side of the balance sheets of the portfolios. The accounting framework of the model is shown in section 2. Section 3. 1 contains an overview of the development in the Swedish financial markets. As a starting point is used a table of the changes of the portfolio of the total economy distributed between the various components: money, certificates, bonds and loans. This gives an idea about the structural changes in later years caused particularly by deregulation. Long run changes in supply are otherwise not so easily revealed in an analysis which centers on the demand behaviour of individual sectors. As further background material, the section contains tables of historical changes of demand and supply in the markets for bonds and certificates. These tables are derived from KOFI sector balances. Such tables are of vital importance for the interpretation of the simulations. Section 3. 2 - 5 deals with various institutional aspects of KOFI`s sectors that are relevant for their modelling. Subsections 3. 2 and 3. 3 give brief accounts of the borrowing behaviour of mortgage institutions and of Central Government. Subsection 3. 4 raises the question whether the model should distinguish or not between private insurance companies and the National Pension Fund. It appears there are good reasons for aggregating the two subsectors. The design of the "residual sector" of the model is described in subsection 3. 5. The residual sector contains households, <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises,</b> local authorities, investment companies and finance companies. There are arguments both for and against having households and <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises</b> in a common sector. Some problems concerning the modelling of the foreign sector are treated in subsection 3. 6. In section 4 certain formal aspects of KOFI are discussed as well as the econometric properties of the model. The latter concerns the determination of the long and the short term rates of interest, the exchange rate and the portfolio choice of the various actors. (These relationships are updated versions of those which have been more extensively described in the report referred to in footnote 1). Section 5 contains four simulations undertaken with KOFI. They concern the effects of respectively, a change of the strategy of government borrowing, an increase of the domestic short term rate, an increase of the foreign interest rate and, finally, an increase of the budget deficit. The simulations are desribed in the form of deviations from a given basic scenario and limited to developments within the financial markets. The developments are registered as changes of the balance sheets of the various sectors. The emphasis is mainly on the processes generated by the interaction between the sectors and not so much on the decision making by each actor. A typical outcome of simulation i the volume of open market operations required by the Central Bank to defend a targeted short-term rate of interest. Other outcomes concern e. g. the paths followed over a number of periods by lending and borrowing by various sectors. Section 6 gives some indications of the future development and use of KOFI. ...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{analysis}} {{and assessment of}} the company’s activity in the market economy {{plays an important role}} as an indicator of the organization reliability and its competitiveness. For a commercial bank, a positive opinion on its financial position becomes even more important as not only the effectiveness of the bank’s operation, but also its clients interest depend on the degree of the bank’s reliability. A comprehensive activity assessment of a commercial bank in addition to financial analysis is the analysis of risks, strengths and weaknesses of the bank and the business valuation of a commercial bank. Business valuation – topical areas of financial management, and eventually its importance will only increase. Financial institution should be regarded not only from the view of financial statements as an entity, but also from the view of the investment attractiveness as a business unit for a comprehensive idea of its activity. The economic activity of the banking sector is considered by the authors as an operating business unit – bank. The article considers the modern approaches to the valuation of a commercial bank, the necessity of taking into account the specifics of banking activities in the evaluation, the difficulties of assessment, typical for the financial services’ sector. The authors note that the business valuation of a commercial bank shall apply a single method: estimate the cost of equity capital (and not the company, as it is customary in order to apply standard accounting rules), and use only cash flows that could be traced – dividends. For the purposes of evaluating the absolute value of the bank it can be applied the model of discounted dividends, provided that only equity will play the role of capital, and cash flows, except for the dividend, can be omitted (due to the complexity of the calculation). In comparison with <b>non-financial</b> <b>enterprises,</b> some of multipliers for comparative approach to evaluation cannot be adequately applied to banks. To assess financial institutions using the comparative method, it can be mainly used the multipliers based on the value of own capital – the ratio «price/earnings» (PE), and the ratio of «price/book value» (PBV). The authors emphasize that the evaluation of the market value of the business or assets is needed today not only in the framework of transactions of sale and purchase or in determining of the collateral value of the object, but also to make competent strategic and management decisions. A comprehensive analysis determines the competitiveness, reliability and attractiveness of the bank for the customer and for the investor. Thus, after analyzing the financial situation of any bank, with a considerable degree of confidence among banks-counterparts we can choose the most attractive and ensure its reliability, a further operation and for the bank’s customers, feeling more safe in cash transferring for the management and effectiveness of services. </p...|$|R
