50|$|Gallery Arcturus was {{established}} in 1994 by The Foundation for the Study of Objective Art, a Canadian federally registered charitable organization, to provide {{members of the public}} with an opportunity to view and study works by contemporary <b>North</b> <b>American</b> artists <b>free</b> of charge and without commercial motives. The Gallery was first located in rented space on Parliament Street in Toronto. The Gallery began acquiring an extensive permanent art collection for display and study, starting with a significant purchase of works by members of the School of Reductionism in Grass Valley, California, including paintings by E.J. Gold, Della Haywood, Heather Valencia, Robert Trice and Kelly Rivera. The permanent art collection has continued to grow every year and now totals over 227 works of art.|$|R

50|$|Longfellow's poem {{was taken}} as the first American epic to be {{composed}} of <b>North</b> <b>American</b> materials and <b>free</b> of European literary models. Earlier attempts to write a national epic, such as The Columbiad of Richard Snowden (1753-1825), ‘a poem on the American war’ published in 1795, or Joel Barlow's Vision of Columbus (1787) (rewritten and entitled The Columbiad in 1807), were considered derivative. Longfellow provided something entirely new, {{a vision of the}} continent's pre-European civilisation in a metre adapted from a Finnish, non-Indo-European source.|$|R
50|$|Japan {{emerged from}} the Tokugawa - Tennō (Keiō-Meiji) {{transition}} in 1868 as the first Asian industrialized nation. Domestic commercial activities and limited foreign trade had met the demands for material culture until the Keiō period, but the modernized Meiji period had radically different requirements. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced {{the concept of a}} market economy and adopted British and <b>North</b> <b>American</b> forms of <b>free</b> enterprise capitalism. The private sector - in a nation with an abundance of aggressive entrepreneurs - welcomed such change.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the dot-com}} boom, stable {{monetary}} policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001. Beginning in 1994, the U.S. {{entered into the}} <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement into law. Throughout {{his first year}} in office, Clinton {{consistently}} supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of I-69 in the 1980s, and {{the approval of}} the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement, increased traffic at the Blue Water Bridge. A new toll and customs plaza was built in 1991, and later the next year, an international task force determined that traffic on the existing structure was exceeding capacity. Environmental planning started in 1993, and construction started on the second span between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario in 1995. In July 1997, the second span opened. The original span was closed for rehabilitation, and both were opened to traffic in 1999.|$|E

40|$|The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> Agreement on <b>Free</b> Trade (NAFTA) {{has stirred}} passionate debates in Canada. Proponents {{predicted}} that increased trade liberalization would create more jobs, greater multinational investment, and an overall better standard of living. Opponents, however, argued that NAFTA {{would lead to}} wage cuts, job losses, the erosion of labor standards, and the harmonization of labor laws to the lowest common denominator. I systematically examined the evidence and found that with some exceptions, the predicted negative effects have not materialized. Furthermore, the NAFTA labor side agreement has enjoyed moderate success in bringing labor concerns to the fore. ...|$|R
5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} received American {{news coverage}} during the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primaries after {{the details of}} a conversation between Barack Obama's economic advisor Austan Goolsbee, and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
25|$|Woolman worked {{within the}} Friends' {{tradition}} of seeking {{the guidance of}} the Spirit of Christ and patiently waiting to achieve unity in the Spirit. As he went from one Friends' meeting to another, he expressed his concern about slaveholding. Gradually various Quaker Meetings began to see the evils of slavery; their minutes increasingly reflecting their condemnation of the practice. Quaker records bear witness to his and a few others' success – by the time the 1776–1783 revolution was over, almost all <b>North</b> <b>American</b> Quakers had <b>freed</b> their slaves, and those few Quakers who had been engaged in the trading or shipment of slaves had ceased such activities as well.|$|R
50|$|Japan {{emerged from}} the Tokugawa-Meiji {{transition}} as the first Asian industrialized nation. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced {{the concept of a}} market economy and adopted British and <b>North</b> <b>American</b> forms of <b>free</b> enterprise capitalism. Rapid growth and structural change characterized Japan's two periods of economic development after 1868. Initially, the economy grew only moderately and relied heavily on traditional Japanese agriculture to finance modern industrial infrastructure. By the time the Russo-Japanese War began in 1904, 65% of employment and 38% {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP) were still based on agriculture, but modern industry had begun to expand substantially. By the late 1920s, manufacturing and mining amounted to 34% of GDP, compared with 20% for all of agriculture. Transportation and communications developed to sustain heavy industrial development.|$|R
40|$|This article {{with minor}} revisions, was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} paper {{at the annual meeting}} of the Canadian Political Science Association in Victoria, B. C., May 27, 1990. Since then, Canada has been accused of simply following Washington's lead in sending troops to the Gulfand in seeking to join United States-Mexico free trade negotiations. These developments do not alter the paper's challenging conclusion : namely, that the current bilateral free-trade regime neither obliges nor justifies a subordinate Canadian foreign policy — however much the terms of the Free Trade Agreement may impinge on the international dimensions of some Canadian policies (e. g., on energy and investment), and notwithstanding the potential momentum (but uncertain prospects) of <b>North</b> <b>American</b> integration. <b>Free</b> trade, in fact seems to have increased, not reduced, the salience of the national question in Canada. As well, the Gulf crisis is a test more of United Nations resolve than bilateral solidarity. And on the trade front, Canada has been reminded of the extent to which it remains on its own. U. S. negotiators were angered by Canada's middle-ground position on agricultural subsidies - the issue over which GATT talks collapsed, increasing Canadian vulnerability. Moreover, Canadian participation in U. S. Mexico trade negotiations has been privately less welcome than the official public rhetoric suggests. More than ever perhaps, Canadian national interests depend on strong international diplomacy mode no less necessary, if arguably encumbered, by the evolving context of continental free trade...|$|R

5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E
