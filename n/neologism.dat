5|$|A common <b>neologism</b> in the Python {{community}} is pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other great}} {{scholars}} {{of the age}} he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but {{in the second half}} of his life he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his Atlas of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in a geographical context but Mercator used it as a <b>neologism</b> for a treatise (Cosmologia) on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of a King Atlas of Mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer. This King Atlas was a son of the Titan Atlas but the two myths very quickly coalesced.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} to examine and {{investigate}} the Korean <b>neologisms</b> patterns, influenced by the foreign language(English). To achieve {{the aims of the}} study, we has outlined various definitions and parameter of <b>neologisms,</b> collected about Korean <b>neologisms</b> and classified them into typology in English sources. These <b>neologisms</b> have been divided into two levels. Level one includes <b>neologisms</b> that have both appeared in English and been used frequently in Korean. Level two <b>neologisms,</b> on the other hand, have not been found in neology processing systems or translational instances though most of them are frequently used by Koreans. The collected <b>neologisms</b> have been included in the following categories: a) phonological <b>neologisms</b> b) morphological <b>neologisms.</b> Each of these Korean <b>neologisms</b> has been analyzed and compared with the original meanings of such <b>neologisms,</b> as well as with reference to creative ability, in other words, rendering of <b>neologisms</b> and culture-specific terms. Korean neologisms; phono-morphological neologisms; derivation; compounding; borrowing and shortening...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} issue of 1984 of Lexicographical studies, Lü Shuxiang invocated all his fellow {{linguists}} to draw their attention to <b>neologisms.</b> Ever since, the production of dictionaries of <b>neologisms</b> has increased: until 2007, more than 50 dictionaries of <b>neologisms</b> have been reportedly put out. Since 1990 s, the official list of <b>neologisms</b> has even become a task of the State Language Commission: it has published Yearbooks of <b>Neologisms</b> from 1991 to 1994; from 2005 on, it has published an annual report on Language situation in China, which comprehends the Yearbook of <b>Neologisms.</b> In the meanwhile, other institutes have published dictionaries of <b>neologisms</b> for the years 1995 - 2005; finally, many other dictionaries, republishing and commenting the <b>neologisms</b> of the Yearbook, have been appearing on the market. An inverse relation exists between dictionaries of <b>neologisms</b> and dictionaries of borrowings. Although not many, all along twentieth century several dictionaries of borrowings have been published until the 1990 s; then, dictionaries of <b>neologisms</b> have absorbed borrowings. Yet the debate over borrowings, even in non-academic press, is perhaps even harsher than that over <b>neologisms.</b> The reason of this fierce contraposition of standpoints is that borrowings touch more than native <b>neologisms</b> on the matter of linguistic standardization and purity. The present contribution aims at shedding a light on the standpoints in Chinese academy and Chinese society over borrowings, by means of the analysis of academic and non-academic press; secondly, it carries out researches on treatment of the borrowings in the latest dictionaries of <b>neologisms,</b> according to the latest theoretical categorization...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{research}} perspective towards {{the reasons for}} devising <b>neologisms.</b> Instead of reflecting upon this topic {{from the perspective of}} "a word", the language user's psychological requirements for devising <b>neologisms</b> are being used. This methodology introduces us to some distinct observations, especially regarding the user's inner motivations for devising and using <b>neologisms.</b> Although "functional" and/or "denotative" descriptions of <b>neologisms</b> are mentioned, much regard is paid to distinct psychological needs of the ones devising <b>neologisms.</b> In sum {{it can be said that}} some <b>neologisms</b> are not devised for the purpose of describing new objects, but are set up in accordance to user's descriptive tastes and his sense of language...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{and compares}} several semi-automatic {{methods used to}} extract <b>neologisms</b> from linguistic corpora. All the methods {{are based on the}} concept of discriminants, or textual features (both lexis and punctuation), that either precede (lexical discriminants) or confine (punctuation discriminants) phrases in which the occurrence of <b>neologisms</b> is higher than elsewhere in the text. Excerption and comparison was conducted on a corpus of 45 million words, articles from Nature scientific magazine. The putative <b>neologisms</b> were extracted using morphological analysis and frequency of their occurrence in the Google search engine. The result is a list of 1000 <b>neologisms</b> and assessment of the efficacy of each method. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} {{understand}} the style of the original author, the translation of the text should be the true reproduction of it. One aspect which helps translators to achieve the author style is accomplished by the translation of <b>neologisms.</b> Newmark [7] defined <b>neologisms</b> as newly coined lexical units or existing lexical units that acquire a new sense. The present study was an attempt to consider the most common translational norm and procedure applied in the translation of computer <b>neologisms</b> from English into Persian in 2000 s. To achieve the aims, a parallel corpus of computer texts was selected; the instances of <b>neologisms</b> were identified in them and compared with their Persian counterparts. The findings of the research suggested that transference and lexical synonymy were the major translational norms and transference was also the most frequent translation procedure in the translation of <b>neologisms</b> in this specific period...|$|R

Only words and grammatical forms introduced by Marc Okrand are considered canonical Klingon by the KLI and most Klingonists. However, as {{the growing number}} of speakers employ different strategies to express themselves, it is often unclear as to what level of <b>neologism</b> is permissible.

40|$|This article proposes the {{establishment}} of a variable called neologic value to determine the inclusion and censorship of <b>neologisms</b> in the general dictionary. In order to do so, the variable must pass the widespread condition in the use of <b>neologisms</b> and incorporate another variable such as denominative necessity. Calculating the value is the function of neologicity parameters established in the neology field, and the result is integrated in a neologicity escale proposed as lexicographic criteria to consider in the registry of <b>neologisms.</b> The proposal has been applied to ten <b>neologisms</b> of various sources not documented in the DRAE to show how this neologic value may contribute to its positive assessment for inclusion in the dictionary. ...|$|R

25|$|The English-language <b>neologism</b> omics informally {{refers to}} a field of study in biology ending in -omics, such as genomics, {{proteomics}} or metabolomics. The related suffix -ome is used to address the objects of study of such fields, such as the genome, proteome or metabolome respectively. The suffix -ome as used in molecular biology {{refers to a}} totality of some sort; similarly omics has come to refer generally {{to the study of}} large, comprehensive biological data sets. While the growth {{in the use of the}} term has led some scientists (Jonathan Eisen, among others) to claim that it has been oversold, it reflects the change in orientation towards the quantitative analysis of complete or near-complete assortment of all the constituents of a system. In the study of symbioses, for example, researchers which were once limited to the study of a single gene product can now simultaneously compare the total complement of several types of biological molecules.|$|E

40|$|Background: It is a {{well-documented}} {{finding that}} phonemic speech errors in aphasia reflect certain characteristics of their intended targets. However, only {{few studies have}} investigated spontaneous speech productions of jargon-aphasic patients, in which lexical targets may be completely unrecognisable (abstruse phonemic <b>neologisms).</b> There {{is some evidence that}} these <b>neologisms</b> correspond to the standard language concerning phonemic content and structure. Aims: The present study further explores similarities of aphasic <b>neologisms</b> and the standard language, to contribute to the discussion about the origin of non-target-related errors in jargon aphasia. It investigates whether similarities at the phoneme level can be confirmed even in connected, severely jargonised speech that does not allow identification of lexical targets. Moreover, it raises the question whether other sublexical units like syllables contribute to the formation of phonemic <b>neologisms.</b> Methods & Procedures: <b>Neologisms</b> in spontaneous speech of a German-speaking jargon-aphasic patient were compared to the standard language concerning phoneme and syllable inventory, structural aspects, and distributional frequencies of sublexica...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} <b>neologisms</b> {{in the novel}} The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy. It aims at {{describing}} their morpho-syntactic features, the word-formation processes from which they result, and their contextual function in the analysed text. The original text is compared with the Czech translation and the ways of translating <b>neologisms</b> in Czech are explored. The thesis explores three hypotheses. Firstly, the predominant word-formation process employed in creating <b>neologisms</b> in the text {{is likely to be}} compounding. Secondly, the Czech translation is expected to contain fewer <b>neologisms</b> than the original. Thirdly, it is supposed that the distribution of <b>neologisms</b> is not balanced throughout the book, and that their frequency will increase in those chapters which offer the children's perspective. Out of these three hypotheses the first and the third one were confirmed. The validity of the second hypothesis could be neither confirmed nor refuted, for that would require further research on the Czech translation of the text, which was {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis...|$|R

500|$|Formation of new words, called neologisms, {{based on}} Greek or Latin roots (for example {{television}} or optometry) {{is a highly}} productive process in English and in most modern European languages, {{so much so that}} {{it is often difficult to}} determine in which language a <b>neologism</b> originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the [...] "international scientific vocabulary" [...] (ISV) when compiling Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms, words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. NATO, laser).|$|E
