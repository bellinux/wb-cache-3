25|$|In 1977, Sir Keith Holyoake, {{a former}} National Party Prime Minister and a serving Minister of State was {{controversially}} appointed as Governor-General. It was suggested by many commentators {{that it would}} be inappropriate to entrust the office to a former party leader or anyone who is closely allied with a political party. However, despite his background, Holyoake could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have discharged his duties in a partisan way, and he served for only three years. Since the 1970s, the Prime Minister has always confided with the Leader of the Opposition during the nomination process, in an attempt to reduce partisan influence.|$|E
25|$|Leopold fought three wars against France: the Dutch War, the Nine Years' War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In this last, Leopold {{sought to}} give his younger son the entire Spanish inheritance, {{disregarding}} {{the will of the}} late Charles II. Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe. The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria, with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, but the war would drag on till 1714, nine years after Leopold's death, which barely had an effect on the warring nations. When peace returned, Austria could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have emerged as triumphant as it had from the war against the Turks.|$|E
25|$|Agreeing {{with the}} Attorney General's submission, the Court of Appeal {{held that the}} {{mandatory}} death penalty satisfied the reasonable classification test {{used to assess the}} constitutionality of legislation with respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Reiterating the Privy Council's holding in Ong Ah Chuan, the Court found that the 15-gram differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be purely arbitrary, and bore a rational relation to the social object of the MDA which was to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. There was nothing unreasonable in the legislature concluding that a wholesale dealer operating higher up in the distributive pyramid required a stronger deterrent than smaller scale dealers. It was up to the legislature to determine where the appropriate quantitative boundary was to lie between the two classes of dealers. The Court also held that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked was broadly proportionate to both the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the market, as well as the likely harm suffered by society {{as a result of the}} offender's crime.|$|E

25|$|By {{virtue of}} his belief that human history and {{collective}} praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the metaphysical materialism and 'copy' theory of perception advanced by Engels and Lenin, though he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself, independent of humanity. The concept of an objective universe outside of human history and human praxis was, in his view, analogous to belief in God. Gramsci defined objectivity {{in terms of a}} universal intersubjectivity to be established in a future communist society. Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. In his view philosophical materialism resulted from a lack of critical thought, and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> oppose religious dogma and superstition. Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism. Marxism was a philosophy for the proletariat, a subaltern class, and thus could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense. Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise, and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents’ views.|$|E
25|$|Chua J. {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the basic features doctrine in Singapore. He reasoned that a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, can never be invalid if the procedure for amendment is complied with. If the framers of the Constitution had intended limitations on the power of amendment, they would have expressly provided for such limitations. Furthermore, if the courts were allowed to impose limitations on the legislative power to amend, they would be usurping Parliament's legislative function, contrary to Article 58. In any case, Chua J. did not agree that Parliament had violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The subjective test reinserted into the ISA had served the national security interests of Singapore for a long time. The amendments merely reaffirmed the law which the courts had followed since Lee Mau Seng, and ensured that the legislative intent behind the ISA was not disregarded. Moreover, nothing in the amendments was unrelated to national security. A reaffirmation of the original principles could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be objectionable as usurping judicial power or being contrary to the rule of law. The rule of law had not been abolished by legislation, as Parliament had done no more than to enact the rule of law relating to judicial review. The legislation did not order the court to decide a case in a particular way or to dismiss it – the court was left to deal with the case {{on the basis of the}} amendments.|$|E

Secondly, the Chagossians had {{a constitutional right to}} inhabit their land under the Magna Carta, one which could not be abridged with delegated legislation, and third, the Commissioner of BIOT's duty to legislate [...] "for the peace, order and good government" [...] of BIOT's inhabitants could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be fulfilled by relocating those inhabitants.|$|E
500|$|Several {{philosophers}} {{had strong}} {{objections to the}} claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was John Lucas, who argued that Gödel's incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system (such as a computer program) could never see the truth of certain statements, while a human being could. Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 60s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little [...] "symbol processing" [...] {{and a great deal}} of embodied, instinctive, unconscious [...] "know how". John Searle's Chinese Room argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> [...] "understand" [...] the symbols that it uses (a quality called [...] "intentionality"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as [...] "thinking".|$|E
500|$|The court {{considered}} that Thomas had been regularly informed by {{all those who}} had interrogated him that {{the degree to which}} he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that {{they would be able to}} help Thomas. The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family. Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying [...] " [...] might give you another look at that later", comments which were [...] "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours." ...|$|E

By not investigating the contradictory evidence, the DG could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have taken [...] "reasonable steps to acquaint himself with the relevant information" [...] to enable him to determine whether the goods had been exported.

2500|$|Vittorio Messori {{claims that}} the ties between Escrivá and Francoism {{are part of a}} black legend {{propagated}} against Escrivá and Opus Dei.

According to Allen, there is no statement from Escrivá for or against Franco. Escrivá's devotees and some historians have emphasized his personal effort to avoid partiality in politics. Professor Peter Berglar, a German historian, asserts that Franco's falangists suspected Escrivá of [...] "internationalism, anti-Spainism and Freemasonry" [...] and that during [...] "the first decade of Franco's regime, Opus Dei and Escrivá were attacked with perseverance bordering on fanaticism, not by enemies, but by supporters of the new Spanish State.

2500|$|At the Court of Final Appeal, the {{constitutionality}} of the entire statutory notification scheme was challenged. Chief Justice Li, Justice Chan PJ, Justice Ribeiro PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, having considered all the statutory restrictions on the freedom of assembly and the statutory safeguards listed above, held that the notification system was constitutional. However, they held that the norm of [...] "ordre public", which existed as a statutory legitimate purpose at that time, was too vague at a statutory level and hence could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be prescribed by law. [...] "Ordre public" [...] was as a result severed, but the term [...] "public order" [...] was sufficiently precise to survive. They also remarked in dicta that the norm of [...] "protection of the rights and freedoms of others" [...] was too wide and did not satisfy the legal certainty requirement. They affirmed the convictions as the severance did not affect the conviction. Justice Bokhary PJ dissented, noting in his judgment that the whole statutory scheme should be struck down except the entitlement to notification.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} as to whether the Governor General has the power to summon Parliament without, or in disregard of the advice of Cabinet and, if so, the circumstances which could allow the use of that power was considered in Amasone v Attorney General. The Chief Justice stated that “In a country whose Constitution seeks to achieve a fair and democratic government, it must be contrary to the spirit of the Constitution for a Prime Minister who knows that he has actually lost his support in the House to try and stay in power by delaying the meeting of Parliament at which the loss of confidence would be confirmed. … Whether it is unfair or undemocratic will, of course, depend on the circumstances of the case. Thus, in the present case, the Prime Minister could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have flouted the aspirations of section 4 by remaining in power prior to the by-elections in May even though at that time he had clearly lost his majority but, once those elections appeared to have changed the balance of power, it would accord with the principles of fair and democratic government to allow Parliament to decide as soon as possible.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{well-known}} {{example of this}} occurs in the power-struggle between the sky-god Horus, and his uncle Set, the destructive god of the desert. Set's attempts to prove his superiority include schemes of seduction, in which he compliments Horus on his buttocks and tries to anally penetrate him. Unknowingly failing, Set ejaculates between Horus's thighs, allowing Horus to collect his semen to use against him. Set believes that he has conquered Horus by having [...] "performed this aggressive act against him". Horus subsequently throws it in the river, so that he may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have been inseminated by Set. Horus then deliberately spreads his own semen on some lettuce, which was Set's favorite food (the Egyptians thought that lettuce was phallic). After Set has eaten the lettuce, {{they go to the}} gods to try to settle the argument over the rule of Egypt. The gods first listen to Set's claim of dominance over Horus, and call his semen forth, but it answers from the river, invalidating his claim. Then, the gods listen to Horus' claim of having dominated Set, and call his semen forth, and it answers from inside Set. The association with an evil god such as Set reinforces the negativity of homosexual relationships, even for the active, participant.|$|E
2500|$|For example, in Sumpter v Hedges {{a builder}} {{performed}} £333 worth of work, but then abandoned {{completion of the}} contract. The Court of Appeal held he could not recover any money for the building left on the land, even though the buyer subsequently used the foundations to complete the job. This rule provides a powerful remedy in home construction cases to a customer. So in Bolton v Mahadeva Mr Bolton installed a £560 heating system in Mahadeva's house. However, it leaked and would cost £174 to correct (i.e. 31% of the price). Mahadeva did not pay at all, and the Court of Appeal held this was lawful because the performance was so defective that there could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be any substantial performance. However where an obligation in a contract is [...] "substantially performed", the full sum must be paid, only then deducting an amount to reflect the breach. So in Hoenig v Isaacs Denning LJ held a builder who installed a bookcase poorly, with a price of £750 but costing only £55 to correct (i.e. 7.3% of the price), had to be paid minus the cost of correction. If a contract's obligations are construed as consisting of an [...] "entire obligation", performance of it all will be a condition precedent (a requirement before) to performance {{from the other side}} falling due, and allowing a breach of contract claim.|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> take care of everything. On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is {{able to take care of}} everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take care of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take care of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E
