500|$|The 2011 {{release of}} the Nintendo 3DS, the {{successor}} to the Nintendo DS series of handhelds, was announced on March 23, 2010, to preempt impending news leaks by the Japanese press and to attract potential attendees to the Electronic Entertainment Expo. According to industry analysts, the timing drew attention from the North American launch of the DSi XL. M2 Research senior analyst Billy Pigeon argued the [...] "XL is old news ... in Japan– and Nintendo is a very Japan-centric organization. This is just the corporate parent in Japan maybe not acting {{in the best interest}} of Nintendo of America."

2500|$|For 1971 the top-of-the-line Caprice was {{completely}} redesigned on a longer [...] wheelbase and featured bold, Chrysler-like fuselage styling.

The <b>new</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> national scene) party UDAR also enjoyed noticeable great success with its third place in the election. The Communist Party of Ukraine almost tripled its numbers of voters but because of the mixed election system used in the election it only won five more seats compared with the previous election.

2500|$|Aluminum {{capacitors}} {{with liquid}} electrolytes based on borax or organic solvents {{have a large}} range of types and ratings. Capacitors with water-based electrolytes are often found in digital devices for mass production.

Polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors with solid conductive polymer electrolytes are becoming increasingly important, especially in devices with a flat design, such as tablet PCs and flat panel displays. Electrolytic capacitors with hybrid electrolytes are relatively <b>new</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market. With their hybrid electrolyte system they combine the improved conductivity of the polymer with the advantage of liquid electrolytes for better self-healing property of the oxide layer, so that the capacitors have the advantages of both low ESR and low leakage current.|$|E

2500|$|Large stone high crosses, usually erected outside monasteries or churches, first {{appear in}} the 8th century in Ireland, perhaps at Carndonagh, Donegal, a monastic site with Ionian foundations, {{apparently}} later than the earliest Anglo-Saxon crosses, which may be 7th-century. Later insular carvings found throughout Britain and Ireland were almost entirely geometrical, as was the decoration on the earliest crosses. [...] By the 9th century figures are carved, and the largest crosses have very many figures in scenes on all surfaces, often from the Old Testament on the east side, and the <b>New</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west, with a Crucifixion at {{the centre of the}} cross. [...] The 10th-century Muiredach's High Cross at Monasterboice is usually regarded as the peak of the Irish crosses. [...] In later examples the figures become fewer and larger, and their style begins to merge with the Romanesque, as at the Dysert Cross in Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|As {{fuel economy}} became a bigger {{priority}} among Americans following the Arab Oil Embargo of late 1973 and early 1974, Chevy made the smaller [...] small block V8 with two-barrel carburetor standard on all Caprice models except wagons for 1975. In California, the four-barrel [...] 350 V8 was the base engine and this engine was unavailable elsewhere. Optional engines included the [...] small block V8 (standard on wagons) and [...] big block, the last {{was not available}} in California. All engines except for the 454 were single exhaust systems {{with the introduction of}} the catalytic converter. Station wagons that used the 454 now featured dual exhaust as well. Also introduced this year were GM's [...] "High Energy" [...] electronic ignition and radial tires that were advertised as part of [...] "Chevrolet's New Efficiency System." [...] The theme of economy continued through to the new options this year: A new [...] "Econominder" [...] gauge package included a temperature gauge and a [...] "fuel econominder", the second being a gauge alerting drivers as to when their driving habits caused the engine to use more or less fuel. Also <b>new</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> options list: intermittent windshield wipers, and 50/50 seating options on the Impala coupe/sedan and Caprice Classic convertible models.|$|E

2500|$|The updated VQ35HR is more {{powerful}} ( [...] at 6,800 rpm and [...] at 4,800 rpm), more fuel efficient, and more responsive than the previous VQ35DE. The [...] "HR" [...] stands for [...] "High Revolution" [...] or [...] "High Response". A dual-path intake (two air cleaners, throttle bodies, etc.) lowers intake tract restriction by 18 percent and new equal-length exhaust manifolds lead into mufflers that are 25 percent freer flowing. The intake is said to benefit from a ram-air effect adding three horsepower at 60mph. Electrically actuated variable valve timing is <b>new</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exhaust cams which broadens the torque curve. The new engine block maintains the same bore and stroke, but the connecting rods were lengthened and the block deck was raised by 8.4mm to reduce piston side-loads. 80% of the internal components have been strengthened or redesigned to handle the increased 7,500 rpm red line, along {{with the use of}} larger crank bearings with main bearing caps reinforced by a rigid ladder-type main cap girdle. With an increase in compression ratio from 10.3:1 to 10.6:1 these changes add 26 more horsepower. Torque is down [...] from the old DE engine (268 vs. 270). The engine now sits 15mm lower in the chassis for a lower center of gravity.|$|E
2500|$|Themes of {{religion}} and spirituality appear in much of Clarke's writing. He said: [...] "Any path to knowledge is a path to God—or Reality, whichever word one prefers to use." [...] He described himself as [...] "fascinated by the concept of God". J.B.S. Haldane, {{near the end of}} his life, suggested in a personal letter to Clarke that Clarke should receive a prize in theology for being one of the few people to write anything <b>new</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject, and went on to say that if Clarke's writings did not contain multiple contradictory theological views, he might have been a menace. When he entered the Royal Air Force, Clarke insisted that his dog tags be marked [...] "pantheist" [...] rather than the default, Church of England, and in a 1991 essay entitled [...] "Credo", described himself as a logical positivist from the age of ten. In 2000, Clarke told the Sri Lankan newspaper, The Island, [...] "I don't believe in God or an afterlife," [...] and he identified himself as an atheist. He was honoured as a Humanist Laureate in the International Academy of Humanism. He has also described himself as a [...] "crypto-Buddhist", insisting that Buddhism is not a religion. He displayed little interest about religion early in his life, for example, only discovering a few months after marrying that his wife had strong Presbyterian beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953 the Imperial {{model was}} renamed the Imperial Custom. Although the Imperial Custom resembled the New Yorker, {{it had a}} {{different}} wheelbase, taillights, and side trim. Clean front fenders and higher rear fender stone shield set it apart from the [...] "ordinary" [...] Chryslers. This {{was also the first}} year for the stylized eagle hood ornament. Power brakes, power windows, center folding armrests (front and rear) and a padded dash were standard. Parking lights on all Imperials were positioned between the top and center grille moldings, a variation from the design used on other Chrysler cars. A new model was the six-passenger Imperial Custom limousine which had as standard equipment electric windows, electric division window, floor level courtesy lamps, rear compartment heater, fold-up footrests, seatback mounted clock and special luxury cloth or leather interiors. On March 10, 1953, the exclusive Imperial Custom Newport hardtop was added to the Imperial line at $325 over the price of the eight-passenger sedan. The 2-door Club coupe was discontinued. Imperial Custom sedans now rode on a wheelbase [...] longer than the 2-door hardtops. The eagle ornament was about the only thing <b>new</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1953 [...] Imperial Crown. The nameplate was changed slightly and the limousine featured moldings on top of the rear fenders. Imperial Crowns came with a 12-volt electrical system (Imperial Customs still had a 6-volt system) and Chrysler's first fully automatic transmission, called PowerFlite, became available late in the model year, being installed in a limited number of cars for testing and evaluation. Power steering was standard on Imperial Crowns. Also, 1953 was the first year that the Imperial had a one-piece windshield, instead of a two-piece one. A padded dash was standard.|$|E
