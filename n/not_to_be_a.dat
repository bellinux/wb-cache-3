5|$|Hassett {{struggled}} in two warm-up matches against Tasmania before the Australians left for England, and despite winning both fixtures, it was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> happy tour on the field. In the first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia’s leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke {{down with a}} serious knee injury. Hassett {{struggled in}} the opening first-class matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he hit an unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.|$|E

Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, but this was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>A</b> third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's.

5|$|The Fijian parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} a single country; {{although}} its population is unknown, it is described as uncommon or locally common. In the absence of evidence for any decline in numbers, its population {{is believed to be}} stable, and it is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction, but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated. In the early 20th century, Europeans in Fiji kept these finches as cagebirds, calling them croton finches because of their liking for the croton bush, but the pet trade appears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> significant factor at present.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} controversy surrounding triple-doubles made when a player achieves the feat with a late rebound. Players with nine rebounds {{in a game}} have sometimes been accused of deliberately missing a shot {{late in the game}} in order to recover the rebound; a few have even gone so far as shooting off their opponent's basket trying to score a triple-double. To deter this, NBA rules allow rebounds to be nullified if the shot is determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> legitimate scoring attempt.|$|E
5|$|Mechner's main preoccupation {{for this}} new storyline was keeping the {{narrative}} simple and engaging, using his preferred writing style of keeping cutscenes short and working {{as much of the}} story as possible into the gameplay. He also aimed to mix narrative and gameplay genres that might normally clash with one-another. The three main characters he created were the hero (the Prince), the villain (the Vizier) and the love interest and sidekick (Farah). Two non-playable authority figures (the Prince's father Shahraman and the Sultan of Azad) were included to add weight to the Prince's burden as they were transformed into monsters by the Sands. The three artefacts each character used (the Dagger, Farah's medallion and the Vizier's staff) were created to explain their survival of the Sands' release, with the Dagger also becoming integral to gameplay. The Prince's narration was both difficult and satisfying for Mechner. It needed to be written to work on two levels: first to be understandable for first-time players, and to gain greater significance upon future playthroughs. The narration also served to give gentle hints to the player, and expand upon the setting and add depth to the experience. Among his cited reference points for the narration were the 1940s version of The Thief of Bagdad, the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and films such as Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. The Prince's interactions with Farah were also an important factor. As part of the character interaction, Farah was deliberately designed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> perfect archer, sometimes hitting the Prince if he strayed into her line of fire. Despite this, unspecified features planned for her needed to be cut.|$|E

Mercedes tells Malachy and they {{secretly}} plan to reconcile. Lynsey learns of this and discovers Mercedes has lied. Lynsey tells Malachy, who punches Mercedes. Mercedes and Malachy reconcile. However, Malachy is badly injured in an explosion and Mercedes is forced to turn off his life support, and he subsequently dies. Malachy's family are forced by Myra to invite Mercedes to his funeral despite discovering her infidelity. Mercedes gets into an argument with Billy Alexander (Richard Graham) at her aunt Kathleen McQueen's (Alison Burrows) fundraising event, after she accuses him of touching her. Carmel apologises for Mercedes' behaviour and agrees {{to have lunch with}} Billy. When Billy visits Carmel, Myra slaps him and reveals that he is the father of Mercedes and Jacqui. He tells Mercedes and Jacqui that he needs a kidney transplant and that they are the only likely donors. When Mercedes and Jacqui refuse to be donors, Kathleen tells Billy that he is the father of her daughter Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), confirming that Theresa is actually Mercedes and Jacqui's half-sister. Billy is later revealed to not be needing a kidney, and that it is actually Mercedes, Jacqui and Theresa's secret half-sister, Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). However, Mercedes is not interested in Billy nor Emily and declines to be a donor, although Jacqui later agrees to be a donor but is revealed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> match, so Billy and Emily disown her and leave.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Capitals then signed Brashear on July 14, 2006, to a one-year, $1 million contract. The signing was {{to provide}} Alexander Ovechkin with some on-ice protection. Capitals {{management}} felt that Brashear was skilled enough <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> liability on the team while bringing an intimidating presence. During the 2006–07 season, the Capitals decided to extend Brashear's contract, signing him to a one-year, $1.1 million contract extension. He was suspended one game by the NHL {{during the regular season}} for punching New York Rangers defenceman Aaron Ward following a fight between Brashear and Brendan Shanahan. In the game, Shanahan felt Brashear was taking liberties with Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr, and subsequently challenged Brashear to a fight. Brashear won the fight and motioned as if he was dusting off his hands. Ward then approached him and had words with Brashear, who responded by punching him in the face, earning Brashear a game misconduct for intent to injure and eventually the suspension. At season's end, his point total increased from the previous season to 13 and his 156 PIMs ranked him in the top ten (sixth) in the League for the sixth time in his career. In the 2007–08 season, Brashear played in 80 games for the Capitals, but his offensive production slipped down to eight points while registering only 119 PIMs. However, he served as one of the Capitals' alternate captains. On January 24, 2008, the Capitals once again re-signed Brashear, this time to a one-year, $1.2 million extension.|$|E
