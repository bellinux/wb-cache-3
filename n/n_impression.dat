40|$|PURPOSE: System-specific {{scanning}} {{strategies have}} been shown to influence the accuracy of full-arch digital impressions. Special guided scanning procedures have been implemented for specific intraoral scanning systems with special regard to the digital orthodontic workflow. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the precision of guided scanning procedures compared to conventional impression techniques in vivo. METHOD: Two intraoral scanning systems with implemented full-arch guided scanning procedures (Cerec Omnicam Ortho; Ormco Lythos) were included along with one conventional impression technique with irreversible hydrocolloid material (alginate). Full-arch impressions were taken three times each from 5 participants (<b>n</b> = 15). <b>Impressions</b> were then compared within the test groups using a point-to-surface distance method after best-fit model matching (OraCheck).

40|$|Group {{membership}} {{can have}} {{a profound impact on}} perceptions of group characteristics; yet how group membership influences the accuracy of personality impressions for specific individuals remains unclear. In small groups, participants (<b>N</b> 519) formed <b>impressions</b> via naturalistic, dyadic interactions. We then investigated whether impressions of in-group members differed from out-group members based on participant’s ethnicity and acculturation (Euro-Canadian, Acculturated East Asian, or Semi-Acculturated East Asian). Impressions of in-group members were more distinctively accurate and individuated. Further, in-group members were viewed with greater distinctive assumed similarity in that perceivers used their own idiosyncratic traits more when forming impressions of in-group members. However, in-group members, despite being liked more, were viewed less socially desirable. Discussion focuses on cultural differences in impressions and implications for in-group favoritism, in-group self-anchoring, and the out-group homogeneity effect for North Americans and East Asians.

40|$|The use {{of images}} of older people in the British {{advertising}} media has been under-researched to date. Further, previous research in any country has tended to examine such images from an a priori framework of general impressions and stereotypes of older people. This study addresses these issues with British consumers' (<b>n</b> = 106) <b>impressions,</b> trait ascriptions, and similarity-between-images ratings of {{a representative sample of}} U. K. magazine advertisements featuring older characters. After a series of sorting task laboratory sessions, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses revealed four clearly defined groups representing types of portrayals. These types emerged from the advertisements and from the views of the consumers themselves. These emergent groupings are: (1) Frail and Vulnerable, (2) Happy and Affluent, (3) Mentors, (4) Active and Leisure-oriented older adults. These groupings seem to be a logical context-appropriate derivation from previous findings on generally held stereotypes of older persons. It is argued that the groupings have the potential to contribute to a reliable typology of advertising portrayals of older people, with potential heuristic leverage in social scientific research of intergenerational communication, lifespan concerns, and the aging process...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of 7 different implant impression techniques for full-arch prostheses. Materials and Methods: A master cast simulating an edentulous arch with 4 implants was used. Seven impression techniques were tested: open tray with polyether Impregum (OTI); open tray with splint-polyether Impregum (OTSI); closed tray with polyether Impregum; open tray with polyether Ramitec; open tray with splintpolyether Ramitec; closed tray with polyether Ramitec (CTR); open tray with impression plaster (OTP). Five impressions of the master cast were taken for each technique using an impression simulator device. Casts were realized based on those <b>impressions</b> (<b>n</b> = 35). Median values of deviation from the master cast were recorded for each cast through a 3 -dimensional laser scanner. Results: Only OTI (P = 0. 028) and OTSI (P < 0. 001) presented a statistically significant difference compared to the master cast. OTP (P = 0. 99) and CTR (P = 0. 10) showed median values of deviation close to zero (- 0. 001 and- 0. 003 mm, respectively). Conclusion: Stiff impression materials (such as plaster or rigid polyether) guarantee greater accuracy in cases of multiple implant impressions of patients with full-arch rehabilitations. Splinting of impression copings with acrylic resin did not improve accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} dies obtained from single-step and 2 -step double-mix impressions. Material and Methods. <b>Impressions</b> (<b>n</b> = 10) of a stainless steel die simulating a complete crown preparation were performed using a polyether (Impregum Soft Heavy and Light body) and a vinyl polysiloxane (Perfectim Blue Velvet and Flexi-Velvet) in two consistencies, {{in one or two}} (without relief) steps. Accuracy of the stone dies was accessed at a measuring microscope, using a metallic crown with perfect fit to the reference crown preparation. Data were submitted to 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey test (α = 0. 05). Results. The single-step technique resulted in slightly larger dies, while the 2 -step technique without relief produced significantly smaller dies, when compared to the original stainless steel die. Stone dies obtained from 2 -step polyether impressions were significantly smaller when compared to dies obtained from 2 -step vinyl polysiloxane impressions (Impregum 2 -step: − 290. 94 ± 71. 64 [*]μm; Perfectim 2 -step: − 201. 86 ± 28. 58 [*]μm). No significant differences were observed in dies obtained from either polyether or vinyl polysiloxane with the single-step technique (Impregum single-step: 63. 52 ± 16. 60 [*]μm; Perfectim single-step: 79. 40 ± 14. 11 [*]μm).

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} 50 % autologous serum drops against conventional treatment in ocular surface disorders refractory to normal treatments in a prospective randomised crossover trial. Method: Patients fulfilling ophthalmological and haematological entry criteria were randomised to either 3 months of autologous serum 50 % followed by 3 months of their conventional treatment, or 3 months of conventional treatment, followed by 3 months of autologous serum. Clinical assessments, including Schirmer’s test, rose Bengal, and fluorescein staining, were carried out on entry and at monthly intervals. Impression cytology was performed at entry, 3 and 6 months. Grading was carried out on degrees of squamous metaplasia and goblet cell density. Subjective comfort was recorded daily using the "faces" scale. These categorical scores were converted to linear measurement using Rasch analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon’s signed rank test and ANOVA. Results: 16 patients were recruited with 31 eyes studied. The ocular surface diseases chiefly included Sjögren’s syndrome (n = 6) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (<b>n</b> = 5). <b>Impression</b> cytology available in 25 of 31 eyes showed significant improvement on serum treatment, p< 0. 02. Rasch weighted faces scores were statistically significantly better with serum, p< 0. 01. Conclusion: The results of this randomised study provide {{further evidence of the}} beneficial effects of autologous serum in severe ocular surface disorders. For most of these patients, autologous serum was superior to conventional treatment for improving ocular surface health and subjective comfort...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} drying times of two total-etch & rinse adhesives on the resin bond strength to a feldsphatic ceramic, before and after aging. Material and Methods: Feldsphatic-ceramic CAD-CAM bars were cut into blocks (12 × 10 × 4 mm) with a cutting machine (<b>N</b> = 32). <b>Impressions</b> were made of each ceramic block with silicone putty material and the negative space {{was filled with a}} composite resin. The bonding ceramic surface was etched with hydrofluoric acid, silanized, and the adhesive system (SB- Single Bond 2, 3 M-ESPE; or PB- Prime & Bond NT, Dentsply) was applied. The samples were dried at different times (5, 10 and 15 s) before the cementation. The resin and ceramic blocks were cemented by a dual cure resin cement. All samples were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h. For the μ-TBS test, the samples were sliced into microbars. Half of the bars of each block was tested after 24 h and, the other bars were submitted to thermocycling (12, 000 ×) and water storage (150 d). For the 24 h groups, the longer drying time increased (p < 0. 05) the bond strength of SB (water/alcohol adhesive), while reduced (p < 0. 05) for the PB group (acetone based adhesive). Results: For the aged groups, the bond strength for the different drying times had no significant difference, for the both adhesives. Conclusion: Longer drying times increased the bond strength values of SB. Smaller drying times increased the bond strength values of PB. The aging protocol influenced the bond strength of SB groups.  Keywords: Microtensile; Adhesion; Feldspar ceramic; Drying time; Adhesive system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the quality of written {{instructions}} and choice of impression trays and materials for removable partial dentures (RPDs) in the Kingdom of Bahrain. All six private dental laboratories in Bahrain were contacted and invited to participate in the study. Five laboratories participated, and submitted written instructions received by them for fabrication of both acrylic (A-RPDs) and cobalt-chromium (CC-RPDs) RPDs. These were examined for evidence of selected design variables. Types of impression trays and materials used were also recorded. One hundred and thirty-one written instructions were examined. Eleven percent (n = 14) were for CC-RPDs, 89 % (n = 117) for A-RPDs. All treatments were provided on a private basis. Fifty-seven percent (n = 1 8) of CC-RPD instructions requested the technician to design the prosthesis, 43 % (n = 6) contained a diagram and 43 % (n = 6) mentioned all design variables. Seventy-nine percent (n = 92) of A-RPDs requested the technician to design the denture, and only 1 % (n = 1) mentioned all design variables. Alginate impression material was most commonly used for master impressions (83 % of <b>impressions</b> (<b>n</b> = 109); 85 % (n = 99) of A-RPDs, and 71 % (n = 10) of CC-RPDs). Master casts were poured after a minimum of 24 h. Acrylic custom trays were used in 14 % (n = 19) of cases (43 % (n = 6) of CC-RPDs; 13 % (n = 15) of A-RPDs). The quality of written instructions to dental laboratories for the fabrication of RPDs was found to be inadequate in Kingdom of Bahrain. There was widespread use of inappropriate impression trays and materials...|$|R
