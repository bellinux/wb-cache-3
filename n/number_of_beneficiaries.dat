2500|$|Discretionary trusts {{and powers}} in English law are {{elements}} of the English law of trusts, specifically of express trusts. Express trusts are trusts expressly declared by the settlor; normally this is intended, although there are situations where the settlor's intentions create a trust accidentally. Normal express trusts are described as [...] "fixed" [...] trusts; the trustees are obliged to distribute property, with no discretion, to the fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Discretionary trusts, however, are where the trustee has discretion over his actions, although he is obliged to act. The advantages of discretionary trusts are that they provide flexibility, and that the beneficiaries hold no claim to the property; as such, they cannot seek to control it, and it cannot be claimed for their debts. A power, or [...] "mere power", on the other hand, is where {{not only does the}} holder have discretion over his actions, he has discretion over whether to act in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|Discretionary trusts can be {{discretionary}} in two respects. First, {{the trustees}} usually {{have the power}} to determine which beneficiaries (from within the class) will receive payments from the trust. Second, trustees can select the amount of trust property that the beneficiary receives. Although most discretionary trusts allow both types of discretion, either can be allowed on its own. It is permissible in most legal systems for a trust to have a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and for the trustees to have discretion as to how much each beneficiary receives, or to have a class of beneficiaries from whom they could select members, but provide that the amount to be provided is fixed. [...] Most well-drafted trust instruments also provide for a power to add or exclude beneficiaries from the class; this allows the trustees greater flexibility to deal with changes in circumstances (and, in particular, changes in the revenue laws of the applicable jurisdiction).|$|E
2500|$|Normal express trusts are [...] "fixed" [...] trusts; the {{property}} is held for a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> and the trustee is obliged to distribute property without any discretion over who gets what. In a discretionary trust, however, the trustee has discretion over his actions, although he is obliged to use it. Alastair Hudson gives {{the example of a}} trust [...] "that [...] shall divide the £1,000 between any of my sons who become unemployed, with the power to retain the whole of that £1,000 for the remainder beneficiary". This is a discretionary trust; the word [...] "shall" [...] means the trustee is forced to exercise his power, while the [...] "power to retain the whole of that £1,000" [...] gives him discretion over whether to retain the money. Discretionary trusts are regularly used, because they provide flexibility; in this situation, for example, the money could be retained and redistributed in a different form if one beneficiary develops some urgent need for it. They also help protect the trust fund. In fixed trusts, the potential beneficiaries have the equitable ownership of their property; in discretionary trusts, this is not the case. Because of this, {{the property}} cannot be made liable for their debts or controlled by them.|$|E

30|$|To {{precisely}} {{estimate the}} impact of the proximity to the payment date on labor supply outcomes we need a representative sample of all municipalities which are beneficiaries from Juntos. By 2009, 638 municipalities were part of the program. Given that the ENAHO follows a stratified sampling procedure, this survey collected information in 260 municipalities enrolled in Juntos in this particular year. This represents roughly 40.8 % of the municipalities in which the Juntos program was present in 2009. Nevertheless, when expanding the sample using the survey weights from the sampling design, Perova and Vakis (2012) find that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> households which report receiving cash transfers from Juntos surveyed in the ENAHO 2009 is very close to the actual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> households listed in the program’s official records. We therefore use sample weights in all of our regressions and correct standard errors taking into account ENAHO’s sampling design.|$|R
