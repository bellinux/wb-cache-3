In particular, ZIP code 10021 on Manhattan's Upper East Side, with more than 100,000 {{inhabitants}} and a per capita income of over $90,000, {{has one of the}} largest concentrations of income in the United States.

25|$|Note {{that the}} above income {{thresholds}} may vary greatly based on region due to {{significant differences in}} average income based on region and urban, suburban, or rural development. In more expensive suburbs, the threshold for the top 15% of income earners may be much higher. For example, in 2006 the ten highest income counties had median household incomes of $85,000 compared to a national average of about $50,000. The top 15% of all US income earners nationally {{tend to be more}} concentrated in these richer suburban counties where the cost of living is also higher. If middle-class households earning between the 50th percentile ($46,000) and the 85th percentile ($62,500) tend to live in lower cost of living areas, then their difference in real income may be smaller than what the differences in <b>nominal</b> <b>income</b> suggest.|$|E
2500|$|As economists Friedman and Schwartz have noted, {{the decade}} from 1869 to 1879 saw a growth of 3 {{percent per year}} in money {{national}} product, an outstanding real national product growth of 6.8 percent per year in this period and a rise of 4.5 percent per year in real product per capita. Even the alleged [...] "monetary contraction" [...] never took place, the money supply increasing by 2.7 percent per year in this period. From 1873 through 1878, before another spurt of monetary expansion, the total supply of bank money rose from $1.964 billion to $2.221 billion, a rise of 13.1 percent or 2.6 percent per year. In short, a modest but definite rise, and scarcely a contraction.

50|$|According to the {{classical}} dichotomy theory, real variables and nominal variables are separate in the long run, so they are not influenced by each other. In other words, if the nominal starting income was 100 and there was 10% inflation (general rise in prices, for example, what cost 10 now costs 11), then with <b>nominal</b> <b>income</b> of still 100, one can buy 10% less; so if <b>nominal</b> <b>income</b> was not adjusted for inflation (did not rise by 10%), real income has dropped 10%.http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realincome.asp#axzz1p7SswT9y But if {{the classical}} dichotomy holds, <b>nominal</b> <b>income</b> will eventually go up by 10%, leaving real income unchanged from its original value.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects on}} the degree of {{equality}} of reforms in indirect taxation are analysed by using a microsimulation model of the Norwegian economy subsequent to a CGE model. The two main reforms studied are substitution of a uniform VAT rate on all goods and services and substitution of the non-uniform Norwegian VAT reform of 2001 for the previous, differentiated system. A main characteristic of the non-uniform reform is the halving of the VAT rate on food. All reforms are made public revenue neutral by changes in the VAT rate. Producer prices, pre-tax <b>nominal</b> <b>incomes,</b> wealth and transfers are all exogenous in the microsimulation model. In this paper we feed percentage changes in corresponding variables from the CGE model into the microsimulation model in order to enrich the microsimulation analyses. The non-uniform VAT reform leads to a clear increase in equality while the change in equality concerning the uniform reform is close to 0. With the uniform VAT reform, as opposed to the non-uniform, decompositions show that taking CGE effects into account has a large impact {{on the degree of}} equality. Changed producer prices and changed pre-tax <b>nominal</b> <b>incomes,</b> wealth and transfers both contribute to this.

40|$|This paper, {{based upon}} a case-study of three Indian villages, studies whether {{households}} within the same market pay different prices for identical goods. It is found that not only are unit prices for food heterogeneous, but that the poor pay more for the same goods than the rich. This is because liquidity constraints force poorer households to purchase goods in small quantities and consequently subject them to quantity premiums. Household specific index numbers are used to adjust <b>nominal</b> <b>incomes</b> to real values and {{it is found that}} Gini coefficients of real incomes are between 12 % to 23 % greater than the Gini for <b>nominal</b> <b>incomes.</b> An econometric analysis of the determinants of prices shows that incomes are negatively correlated with prices, as is family size, but that the amount of land owned shows a positive relationship.

5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, Sumner began authoring a blog where he vocally criticized the view that the United States economy was stuck in a liquidity trap.
