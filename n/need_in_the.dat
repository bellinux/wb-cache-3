5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality {{parallel to the}} living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up {{in the realm of}} the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The School of Law's inaugural class began {{classes on}} August 16, 2006. Due to a {{shortage}} of construction materials in 2006, caused {{in part by the}} <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gulf coast due to Hurricane Katrina, construction on the building was delayed, resulting in classes being held on Drexel University's Main Campus and within the Jenkins Law Library and the auditorium of the National Constitution Center. The first class was expected to be composed of 120 students; ultimately, the inaugural class consisted of 183 students with an incoming median GPA of 3.4 and a median LSAT score of 156. The newest admitted class, the class of 2014, consists of 147 students with an incoming GPA of 3.38 and a median LSAT score of 159. On May 1, 2008, the Drexel University College of Law was renamed the Earle Mack School of Law in honor of Earle I. Mack, a Drexel University alumnus, after a donation of $15 million dollars.|$|E

25|$|The {{dairy barn}} remains an iconic image of Vermont, but the 87% {{decrease}} in active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003 means that {{preservation of the}} dairy barns has increasingly become dependent upon a commitment to maintaining a legacy rather than basic <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> agricultural economy. The Vermont Barn Census, organized by a collaboration of educational and nonprofit state and local historic preservation programs, has developed educational and administrative systems for recording the number, condition, and features of barns throughout Vermont.|$|E

25|$|The university's origins {{date back}} to the Mechanics Institute, founded in 1832, formed in {{response}} to the <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city for workers with cutting-edge skills relevant to the workplace. In 1882, the institute became the Bradford Technical College. In 1957, the Bradford Institute of Technology, was formed as a College of Advanced Technology to take on the running of higher education courses. Construction of the Richmond Building, the largest building on campus, began in 1963. The Horton Building and Chesham building were subsequently added, {{on the opposite side of}} Richmond Road.|$|E

25|$|Another {{thread that}} would be woven into {{the story of the}} Gloucestershire Regiment {{concerns}} the civilian administered auxiliary forces that supported the army in times of <b>need.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-18th century county militias were raised for home defence and as a pool of reserves for the regular army. By 1760 Gloucestershire had raised two battalions of militia, and in 1763 these were organised as the South Gloucestershire Militia based at Gloucester and the North Gloucestershire Militia at Cirencester. In 1795 both militias were granted the 'Royal' prefix. In 1859 the raising of county-based volunteer rifle corps was authorised, leading to the formation of the 1st (City of Bristol) Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers and the 2nd Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the example}} of salat, since salat is {{commanded}} in the Qur'an, all Muslims agree that salat is an obligatory part of Islamic religious practice. According to hadithists, {{the details of how}} to correctly perform salat, to validly fulfill the Qur'anic commmand of salat, can only be found in the ahadith. Despite this, salat is performed differently by different hadithist Islamic sects, depending on which hadith collection each sect relies upon. Quranists, for their part, leave the detail of salat to be a matter between each individual Muslim and Allah, with salat performance done to each Muslim's own individual understanding, interpretation and <b>need.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Quranists' view, correctly performed salat lies not in any supposed correct details of the prayers' performance, but on a correct intention to perform the prayers, valid however it may be individually performed.|$|E
25|$|Governors of {{the various}} Toltec regions {{were taken from the}} ranks of the nobles. They took part in the councils convened on the death of each king to {{determine}} the fitness of candidates hoping to be named heir. This was a usual Mesoamerican pattern in the historical era of the Toltec, one adopted by the Aztec and later cultures. These same aristocrats would also have been instrumental in the collection of tribute from the vassal or allied cities and regions. Such tribute was a hallmark of the Toltec Empire, providing increased economic stability. The tribute received from other groups was distributed as part of the wealth of the Toltec upper classes or provided to those in <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower ranks of society. Some tribute, however, was set aside as a resource to be utilized in the vast Toltec trade enterprises.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{planning}} stages commenced for a Marmion Town Centre with 17,000 m² of retail space by 1986 {{in the southwestern}} corner of the suburb to be developed by the Lands Department {{in conjunction with the}} Rural and Industries Bank. A mining lease for sand and limestone was held by Thiess Brothers over part of the land in question (Reserve 8018), so the Lands Department suggested a road (now Burragah Way) be built to separate the proposed centre from the lease. A detailed submission for the centre was made in 1977 by T.S. Martin and Associates, but Warwick, Karrinyup and small local centres had filled the retail <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area and population had developed somewhat differently from original expectations, so the plan was shelved. Plans to develop a large retail centre were resurrected in the late 1980s to local protest, after which the area was the last to be developed for residential use.|$|E

25|$|The New Industrial State {{not only}} {{provided}} Galbraith with another best-selling book, it also extended once again, {{the currency of}} institutionalist economic thought. The book also filled a very pressing <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s. The conventional theory of monopoly power in economic life maintains that the monopolist will attempt to restrict supply {{in order to maintain}} price above its competitive level. The social cost of this monopoly power is a decrease in both allocative efficiency and the equity of income distribution. This conventional economic analysis of the role of monopoly power did not adequately address popular concern about the large corporation in the late 1960s. The growing concern focused {{on the role of the}} corporation in politics, the damage done to the natural environment by an unmitigated commitment to economic growth, and the perversion of advertising and other pecuniary aspects of culture. The New Industrial State gave a plausible explanation of the power structure involved in generating these problems and found a very receptive audience among the rising American counterculture and political activists.|$|E
25|$|The first snowmobiles were large, multipassenger {{vehicles}} {{designed to}} help people get around during the long winter months. Snowmobiles were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. His invention filled a very particular <b>need</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region and soon business was booming. In1941 Armand opened a new factory in Valcourt. Then a major setback hit the growing business: the Second World War was well underway and the Canadian government issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. To keep his business going, Armand shifted his focus and developed vehicles for the military. After the war, Bombardier experienced another setback in his snowmobile business. In1948, the Quebec government passed a law requiring all highways and local roads to be cleared of snow; the Bombardier company's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized specifically for use on municipal sidewalks (replacing horse-drawn vehicles), then by making all-terrain vehicles for the mining, oil, and forestry industries.|$|E
