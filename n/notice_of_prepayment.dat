Using {{data from the}} period 1985 - 1992, the analysis indicates that the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> thirty year FRMs was determined primarily by house price appreciation and personal income growth and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fifteen year FRMs was determined primarily by interest rate changes.

40|$|This paper does a {{valuation}} {{analysis of}} senior-subordinated structure tranches backed by non-agency mortgages. The valuation is done using Monte Carlo simulation and employs the CIR interest rate process {{in conjunction with}} an empirical model estimated for non-agency mortgage prepayments and defaults. The sensitivity {{of the value of}} tranches to a number of variables are analyzed. We find that the interest rate process parameters significantly affect prepayments and defaults but not the relative value of the senior tranche. It is found that with the shifting <b>of</b> <b>prepayments,</b> the senior trances does not dominated all the junior tranches at all interest rates. The shifting <b>of</b> <b>prepayments</b> has the unintended effect of providing stability to the junior tranches by making their cashflows less sensitive to prepayments. Our main conclusion is that while the shifting <b>of</b> <b>prepayments</b> increases protection from default to the senior tranche for a given level of subordination, it has the unwanted effect of lowering its value through increased contraction risk. The value loss should be taken into account in determining the optimum level of subordination. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> data {{based on the}} historical <b>prepayment</b> experience <b>of</b> two banks in Hong Kong. One of the most distinctive features of mortgages as an asset class is the existence <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> risk. Research in prepayment has matured into a coherent body of work that has a sound theoretical framework and consistent empirical validation. Previous research in prepayment has identified certain important causes for prepayment. However, most studies on prepayment were based on fixed-rate mortgages in the USA, while little work on variable-rate mortgages and even less work on prepayment in other countries has been conducted. In this paper, the <b>prepayment</b> pattern <b>of</b> variable-rate mortgages in Hong Kong are examined. Following {{the logic of the}} option-based/optimal model, certain variables have been identified for inclusion in an empirical model on prepayment. As variable-rate mortgages are the custom in Hong Kong, it is considered that {{there will not be a}} refinancing incentive with decreases in interest rates as in the case with fixedrate mortgages. In this study, interest rates are however found to be an important determinant <b>of</b> <b>prepayment,</b> with prepayments sensitive to real interest rates and borrowers sensitive to the prospect of an increase in interest rates. The explanation proposed for this behaviour is consistent with findings in the field of quasi-rational and behavioural economics. It is thus considered fruitful to incorporate concepts from this field into mortgage prepayment research...|$|R

40|$|We model {{competing}} risks of mortgage termination where the borrower faces a repeated choice {{to continue to}} pay, refinance the loan, move or default. Most previous empirical work on mortgage prepayment has ignored the distinction between prepayments triggered by refinancing and moving, combining them into a single prepayment rate. We show that financial considerations are the primary drivers of the refinance choice while homeowner characteristics have more influence on the move decision. We demonstrate that these differences are statistically significant and that combining these two distinct choices into a single measure <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> shifts coefficients toward zero and produces inaccurate predictions of aggregate termination rates. For example, a combined model underestimates {{the effect of the}} market price of the loan on refinancing; it misses entirely the opposite effects of borrower income on moving and refinancing.

40|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of mortgages as assets is the existence <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> risk, typically {{viewed as a}} borrower’s call option to pay the outstanding mortgage balance {{at any time during}} the term. While previous research identified important causes for prepayment, these studies are mostly based on fixed-rate mortgages, with little work on variable-rate or floating-rate mortgages and even less work on prepayment in countries other than the USA. This paper presents an analysis <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> based on the historical aggregate pre-payment experience of a sample of variable rate mortgages in Hong Kong, which func-tions under a Currency Board Mechanism that determines exogenously the level and term structure of interest rates. With variable rate mortgages, it is expected that there will not be a prepayment incentive with decreases in interest rates, unlike the case with fixed-rate mortgages. However, we argue that observed interest rate movements remain a key factor that affects prepayment decisions, because current interest changes influence expected future interest rates. Furthermore, drawing on quasi-rational and behavioral economics concepts, we expect the effect on <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> expected upward movement in interest rates to be stronger than that of expected downward movements. Empirical evidence from the adjustable rate residential mortgage sample from Hong Kong supports these expected relationships...|$|R

We find that the amount <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> by younger individuals that {{would be necessary to}} cover future claims is mitigated by three factors: high-risk individuals will either recover or die, low-risk expected expense increases with age, and the likelihood of developing a high-risk condition increases with age.
