5|$|Although the Grand Fleet {{made several}} sorties {{over the next}} few years it is not known if Agincourt participated in them. On 23April 1918, Agincourt and Hercules were {{stationed}} at Scapa Flow to provide cover for the Scandinavian convoys between Norway and Britain when the High Seas Fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy the convoy. The reports from German Intelligence were slightly off schedule, as both the inbound and outbound convoys were in port when the Germans reached their <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> so Admiral Scheer ordered the fleet to return to Germany without spotting any British ships.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{just below}} Northwich, the Anderton Boat Lift {{is now the}} <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> for leisure boats to reach the river. Following its closure in 1983, a Trust was created to {{campaign}} for its restoration. The lift became a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1994, and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999. It reopened in 2002, and is once more hydraulically powered. The use of modern hydraulic fluids is expected to prevent the problem of corrosion suffered when it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Ridge Route, grade IV, {{was first}} climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935 and {{is listed as}} one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. The Liberty Ridge Route is a {{considerably}} more challenging and objectively dangerous route than the <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> to the summit. This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers on the mountain, but accounts for approximately 25% of deaths on the mountain. The Liberty Ridge Route runs up the center of the North Face of Mount Rainier and crosses the very active Carbon Glacier.|$|E

5|$|Double deck buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's double decker buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 double-deck deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when road closures cause a service to be diverted from its <b>normal</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

Queens-bound super express buses follow the <b>normal</b> QM8 <b>route</b> within Queens.|$|R
25|$|Messner {{had already}} {{attempted}} Dhaulagiri in 1977 and 1984, but failed. In 1985 he finally summited. He climbed with Kammerlander up the <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> along the northeast ridge. After {{only three days}} of climbing they stood on the summit in a heavy storm on 15 May.|$|E
25|$|Messner climbed {{his last}} eight-thousander, Lhotse, on 17 October 1986 {{together}} with Hans Kammerlander, using the <b>normal</b> <b>route.</b> Both climbers {{had to contend}} with a strong wind in the summit area. To reach the summit that year and before winter broke, they took a direct helicopter flight from the Makalu base camp to the Lhotse base camp.|$|E
25|$|Messner tried {{four times}} to climb Makalu. He failed in 1974 and 1981 on the South Face of the {{south-east}} ridge. In winter 1985/1986 he attempted the first winter ascent of Makalu via the <b>normal</b> <b>route.</b> Even this venture did not succeed. Not until February 2009 was Makalu successfully climbed in winter by Denis Urubko and Simone Moro.|$|E
50|$|A French {{expedition}} led by Lionel Terray first {{climbed the}} mountain on 31 July 1956 (Chakrarahu Oeste) and on 5 August 1962 (Chakrarahu Este) on what after {{have become the}} <b>normal</b> <b>routes</b> (northeast face and northeast ridge). Greg Mortimer was badly injured during a later attempt to climb the mountain.|$|R
5000|$|The context was the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War; <b>normal</b> <b>routes</b> from China westwards for British {{shipping}} were {{hampered by}} the Dutch East Indies.

25|$|At {{the end of}} July 1930, Shipton and Bill Tilman {{made the}} first {{traverse}} of the peaks. They ascended by the West Ridge of Batian, traversed the Gate of Mists to Nelion, and descended the <b>Normal</b> <b>Route.</b> During this trip, Shipton and Tilman made first ascents of several other peaks, including Point Peter, Point Dutton, Midget Peak, Point Pigott and either Terere or Sendeyo.|$|E
25|$|Austrian Hut is {{the highest}} hut on Mount Kenya, with the {{exception}} of Howell Hut on Nelion. It is a good base for the ascent of Lenana, or for exploring the surrounding area. Peaks that can be ascended with Austrian Hut as a base camp include Point Thompson, Point Melhuish and Point John. It is also the starting point for the <b>Normal</b> <b>Route</b> up Nelion, as well as other routes up to the summits.|$|E
25|$|On 6 January 1929 {{the first}} ascent of Nelion {{was made by}} Percy Wyn-Harris and Eric Shipton. They climbed the <b>Normal</b> <b>Route,</b> then descended to the Gate of Mists before {{ascending}} Batian. On the 8 January they reascended, this time with G. A. Sommerfelt, and in December Shipton made another ascent with R. E. G. Russell. They also made the first ascent of Point John. During this year the Mountain Club of East Africa was formed.|$|E
50|$|The recent {{construction}} of the Kingskerswell bypass along the Aller valley, required various environmental measures to be included due to the local wildlife. This included the {{construction of}} a specially designed tunnel for otters, which will help them navigate beneath the new carriageway when their <b>normal</b> <b>routes,</b> such as culverts are flooded and inaccessible due to high brook levels.|$|R
50|$|The {{local bus}} {{service of the}} city, which are {{operated}} by TMC. The internal places of Thane city which are far from the Thane Rly Stn are connected by TMT. The major concentration has always been Thane city & with vast growing population in the city. The <b>normal</b> <b>routes</b> as well as inter city routes provide the services to the commuters.|$|R

25|$|Whymper was {{convinced}} that the Matterhorn's precipitous appearance when viewed from Zermatt was an optical illusion, and that the dip of the strata, which on the Italian side formed a continuous series of overhangs, should make the opposite side a natural staircase. This party of four was joined by Hudson and Croz, and the inexperienced Douglas Hadow. Their attempt by what is now the <b>normal</b> <b>route,</b> the Hörnli ridge, met with success on 14 July 1865, only days before an Italian party. On the descent, Hadow slipped and fell onto Croz, dislodging him and dragging Douglas and Hudson to their deaths; the rope parted, saving the other three.|$|E
25|$|In 1862 Whymper made further attempts, still {{from the}} south side, on the Lion ridge (or Italian ridge), where the route seemed easier than the Hörnli ridge (the <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> today). On his own he reached above 4,000 metres, but was injured on his way down to Breuil. In July John Tyndall with Johann Joseph Bennen and another guide overcame most of the {{difficulties}} of the ridge that seemed so formidable from below and successfully reached the main shoulder; but at a point not very far below the summit they were stopped by a deep cleft that defied their utmost efforts. The Matterhorn remained unclimbed.|$|E
25|$|Broad Peak was {{the third}} eight-thousander scaled by Messner in 1982. At the time, {{he was the only}} person with a permit to climb this mountain, but he came across Jerzy Kukuczka and Wojciech Kurtyka, who had permits to climb K2, but used its {{geographic}} proximity to climb Broad Peak illegally. In early descriptions of the ascent, Messner omitted to mention this encounter, but he referred to it several years later. On 2 August, Messner was reunited with Nazir Sabir and Khan again on the summit. The three mountaineers had decamped and made for Broad Peak immediately after their ascent of Gasherbrum II. The climb was carried out with a variation from the <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> at the start.|$|E
50|$|The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) {{operates}} a bus system that {{reaches into the}} city (including two <b>normal</b> <b>routes,</b> three FLEX routes, and one ski service route). Bus routes serve nearby light rail stations, commercial districts (including the Shops at South Town and the State Street commercial district), office parks, and government offices. The ski bus route operates from Historic Sandy TRAX station to Alta Ski Area and Snowbird and runs seasonally.|$|R

25|$|In 1170, {{during the}} Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland, Strongbow and Dermot MacMurrough successfully laid siege to Dublin by following a high route through the Wicklow Mountains, avoiding the defences along the <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> {{to the west}} of the mountains. The Norman invasion displaced two important Gaelic clans from Kildare, the O'Byrnes and the O'Tooles, who moved into the Wicklow Mountains, the O'Byrnes in the east and the O'Tooles in the west. From their mountain strongholds both families conducted a persistent campaign of harassment against the invaders and the Wicklow Mountains became known as the terra guerre (“land of war”), as opposed to the terra pacis (“land of peace”) of the settled lowlands.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Messner {{returned}} and succeeded in reaching the summit using the <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> with Kammerlander and Mutschlechner. Although they had turned back twice during this expedition, {{they made the}} summit on the third attempt on 26 September. During this expedition, Messner witnessed the death of Marcel Rüedi, for whom the Makalu was his 9th eight-thousander. Rüedi {{was on the way}} back from the summit and was seen by Messner and the other climbers on the descent. Although he was making slow progress, he appeared to be safe. The tea for his reception had already been boiled when Rüedi disappeared behind a snow ridge and did not reappear. He was found dead a short time later.|$|E
25|$|Although {{both the}} Dunedin and Marlborough were sighted in the Southern Ocean after leaving New Zealand, neither were seen again. No trace was found of the Dunedin {{and it was}} presumed both she and the Marlborough hit icebergs in the Southern Ocean. RMS Rimutaka had {{reported}} that there were great quantities of ice in the Southern Ocean on their <b>normal</b> <b>route</b> between the Chatham Island and Cape Horn when she sailed through the area in early to mid February. The Board of Enquiry concluded that apart from hitting an iceberg another possibility was that the Dunedin had come to grief in a storm. They found that the ship was seaworthy, appropriately laden, and sailed by an experienced Captain and crew.|$|E

It consists of 120 paratransit buses {{that does not}} run on <b>normal</b> <b>routes.</b> This service provides over 55,000 trips each month to customers with disabilities in Missouri. This program guarantees mobility for disabled citizens in St. Louis City and County {{who are unable to}} drive and cannot use MetroBus or MetroLink. Call-A-Ride provides service within 1/4 of a mile from a bus stop.|$|R
50|$|BET is {{a system}} where the buses utilize less {{congested}} highways to link between heavily populated areas and city centers in Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. Naturally, by using the highways, travel time is reduced as the highways are less congested than the <b>normal</b> <b>routes.</b> The service will have limited stops and rely on feeder buses and park-n-ride facilities to ensure sufficient ridership. With BET, travel time {{is expected to be}} reduced by up to 50 percent on certain BETs.|$|R
50|$|The current 16th {{edition of}} the Alpine Club Guide only {{contains}} routes up to climbing grade II. This means that in the literature today only the two <b>normal</b> <b>routes</b> to the Hochvogel are described. In 2006, however, the Allgäu-Immenstadt DAV Section put forward a DAV hut guide for the Prinz Luitpold Haus that presents the four current climbing routes on the northern side of the Hochvogel on one photograph and describes and assesses them in the text.|$|R
