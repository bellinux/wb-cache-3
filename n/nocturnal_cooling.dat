40|$|AbstractThe {{microclimate}} and {{air quality}} in urban spaces {{are of a}} great interest {{for the well-being of}} citizens. Mitigating urban heat island is a major concern for human health by improving comfort especially in desert regions. While the thermal comfort is relatively easy to obtain in indoor spaces, it is more difficult to provide in outdoor ones. It is often sought by passive means. Vegetation could {{play an important role in}} ameliorating urban microclimates. It should be used judiciously in urban planning and designing outdoor spaces. The objective of this work is to explore the influence of green cover during summer on microclimate in the region of Ben-Isguen, a city of a hot-arid climate in the M’ zab valley, Ghardaïa (Algeria). Many studies have proved that vegetation can produce a cooling effect of 2 to 3 °C on average. Gardens and urban parks in particular, in and around cities contribute to alleviating heat stress by creating the so-called “oasis effect” through public spaces. They improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling energy consumption. The microclimate of different locations, in both green and built-up areas (old town, palm grove, etc.) was characterized with the help of field measurements carried out during summer days. The results confirmed the presence of an important cooling effect of vegetation (PCI). It was shown that it is essentially a nocturnal phenomenon by displaying a maximum value of 10 °C. This result is very important regarding the results of similar studies. The research demonstrated that the oasis effect is best developed around dawn in calm and clear sky conditions. Maximum daytime cooling effect of the green cover was 4. 5 °C in reference to old town. Nevertheless this effect showed fluctuation so that it displayed negative values by moments. The cooling effect of the palm grove is due to shade foliage, evapotranspiration, low heat capacity of vegetation and high aerodynamic roughness. In fact the oasis acts as a “heat sink”. The old town of Ben-Isguen presented a diurnal heat island and a <b>nocturnal</b> <b>cool</b> island with maximum intensity of 3. 5 °C and 4 °C respectively. The investigation of the oasis microclimate revealed that densely vegetated areas display higher cooling effect.

40|$|A {{number of}} events that lead to nocturnal {{turbulent}} mixing between the Amazon rain forest and the atmosphere were observed. Two mechanisms that weaken the stable nocturnal thermal inversion at canopy top are identified with nocturnal release {{of carbon dioxide and}} concurrent heat flux into and moisture flux out of the Amazon forest canopy. In the first mechanism, abrupt onset of cloudiness interrupts <b>nocturnal</b> radiative <b>cooling,</b> leading to a period with lowered Richardson number and enhanced heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide fluxes. Significant exchange between the forest canopy and the atmosphere can also occur even on totally clear nights. On these nights, occasional nocturnal increases in the wind speed above the canopy stimulate vertical oscillations in the canopy layer that are both amplitude- and frequency-modulated during the event. A simple model is presented to support the postulate that these oscillations result from a resonant interaction, hypothesized to be a consequence of a vertically fluctuating pressure gradient force operating on a deepening stable layer near canopy top. Model results indicate that the recovery of the layer takes approximately twice as long as the period of enhanced wind that produced the event...|$|R

Data from the instrument, in combination with predictive equation derived from results from the MODTRAN radiative transfer model, yield the full broadband radiation fluxes that are needed for the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>cooling</b> calculations. Results of a field measurement program are presented, including comparison of predicted and measured cooling rates on calm clear nights in May, June and July of 2002.

Causes for this underestimation were explored by modeling various atmospheric conditions, without a conclusive result. Comparison of predicted and measured cooling rates yielded a favorable comparison in their trends and a reasonable quantitative comparison.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{very stable}} {{boundary}} layer is {{a region of}} the atmosphere typified by large vertical gradients of temperature and momentum. Analysis of very stable atmospheric flows {{is complicated by the}} presence of nonlinear interactions among gravity waves, shear-driven overturning circulations, two-dimensional vortical modes and intermittent turbulence in various stages of development. This study examines the horizontal structure of a very stable atmospheric boundary layer, using data obtained primarily from terrain-following aircraft flights over central Oklahoma. Several diagnostic procedures are applied to the aircraft data, including classical and rotary spectral analysis, principal component analysis, and structure functions. Coherent structures with sharp boundaries are examined with a new conditional sampling technique which requires little a priori specification of sampling criteria. Because the flows involve sharp boundaries, spectral techniques do not provide as much useful information as other more localized procedures. The edges of the coherent structures are regions of significant vertical heat transport, a feature not often emphasized in studies of gravity waves and vortical modes in the stable boundary layer. The presence of significant turbulence even for large stability has implications for modelling of the very stable boundary layer. Forecasts of minimum temperature, boundary layer height, inversion characteristics, and pollutant dispersal are all significantly affected by turbulent mixing. Many models of the stable boundary layer artificially arrest the mixing under stable conditions, resulting in, for example, overestimates of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>cooling.</b> A new parameterization of the stable boundary layer is studied here by incorporating it into an existing model of the planetary boundary layer.

Field measurements were carried out in two traditional timber Malay houses and two traditional masonry Chinese shophouses to investigate their indoor thermal environments and passive cooling techniques. The results of the former showed that the indoor air temperatures were higher than the outdoor air temperatures by 1 °C during daytime under open window conditions and 2 °C at night under closed window conditions on average. The results of the latter revealed that indoor air temperatures adjacent to small courtyards were lower than immediate outdoors by up to 5 - 6 °C during daytime; at night, the indoor air temperatures maintained values similar to the outdoors.

The canopy surface temperature of the LAI = 1 model was the lowest among the three models, whereas the convective heat exchange between the canopy surface and the air traveling into the chamber was the smallest for the LAI = 1 model. The convective heat exchange did not differ significantly between the LAI = 2 and 4 canopy models. The results showed that the air traveling through the canopy was cooled more at night, when the canopy LAI was large and the canopy surface temperature was relatively high. This air-cooling effect tended to approach an asymptotic value as the LAI became large. We were able to simulate these phenomena with a simple heat balance analysis of the heat exchange between the canopy surface and the air...|$|R
