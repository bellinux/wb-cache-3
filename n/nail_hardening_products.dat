The obtained magnesia binders possess the increased flexural and compressive strength which values are close to ones of natural materials.

The work includes Finite Element (FE) calculations of the distribution of the residual stresses after metal forming and a heat treatment. The evolution of the residual stress state is predicted employing a creep model which was calibrated through creep experiments ranging between 500 and 700 °C. The creep model is implemented in the FE software together with material specific parameters to simulate a thermal treatment of the product including residual stresses. The complete simulation is validated by a comparison of the predicted shape change with the actual cold-formed and <b>hardened</b> <b>product.</b> An important message of this paper is that, in contrast to what is commonly believed, residual stresses play a crucial role during creep and that a shape change may occur at lower temperatures, i. e. not at higher temperatures and in fact below the transformation temperature in this AISI 420 steel. This surprising conclusion is essential for keeping the shape change during product manufacturing minimal...|$|R

40|$|Spray dryer {{absorber}} (SDA) material, {{also known}} as spray dryer ash, is a byproduct of coal combustion and flue gas scrubbing processes that has self-cementing properties {{similar to those of}} class C fly ash.

40|$|The {{setting and}} {{strengthening}} properties of beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) [...] {{dicalcium phosphate dihydrate}} (DCPD) [...] calcite blends upon admixture with water were investigated at 25 and 37 degrees C. Setting was accelerated by seeding the system with hydroxyapatite (HAp), and strengthening improved when the solids were mixed with a solution saturated with DCPD and HAp. The relationship strength versus ageing time in wet conditions was correlated with mineralogical changes of the material. X-Ray diffraction, thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy observations showed that DCPD and calcite react together to form small HAp crystals acting as bridges between the beta-TCP aggregates present in the paste. Both gaseous CO 2 released by the reaction of calcite and the conversion of lower (DCPD, calcite) to higher-density phases (HAp) contributed to increase the porosity of the material. Nevertheless, quite acceptable diametral strengths (around 1. 5 MPa) could be achieved, despite the high porosity of the <b>hardened</b> <b>product</b> (up to 54 vol%).

40|$|Magnesium {{phosphate}} cement (MPC) {{has been}} widely used in civil engineering as fast-setting repair material. Recently, the biomedical applications of MPC have attracted much attention. MPC has the advantages of fast setting, high early strength and good degradability in vivo. Due to its higher adhesive strength than calcium phosphate cement (CPC), MPC is suggested be used as bone adhesive for unstable fracture treatment. The conventional MPC employed water as the setting liquid and the paste normally showed poor washout resistance when {{came in contact with}} water immediately after mixing. This disadvantage might compromise its clinical performance. The aim of this work was to improve the anti-washout property of MPC by incorporating polylactide (PLA) into the liquid phase. The mixing liquid was prepared by dissolving 20 % w/w PLA in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP). The PLA-modified MPC paste exhibited excellent water resistance, without disintegration even being contact with water immediately after mixing. The setting time ranged from 25 to 56 minutes with varying powder to liquid ratios. The maximum compressive strength reached 27 MPa which was suitable for non-load-bearing applications. XRD and IR analysis indicated that the <b>hardened</b> <b>product</b> was a mixture of NH 4 MgPO 4 • 6 H 2 O and PLA. In vitro Tris-HCl immersion tests revealed that the degradation of PLA-modified MPC was faster than the conventional MPC.

The application of disintegrator technology in the processing of clay powders which are one of the main components used to produce washing liquids has shown the high efficiency of this technology. One of the main multi-tonnage materials used in the construction of deep wells for oil and gas is Portland cement. However, the specific conditions of the well and work performance technology establish additional requirements for both grouting cement and also mortar and stone which are obtained from this binder. That refers to high water-cement ratios, rigid frames for density, water loss, sedimentation stability of solutions, high strength and low permeability of the stone.
