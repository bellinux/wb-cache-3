40|$|The {{stronger}} young immigrants {{identify with}} the host country, the more native friends they have–and vice versa. While this association between emotional and social integration has been well established by cross-sectional studies, {{little is known about}} how and why it emerges. Do immigrants select their friends based on their <b>national</b> <b>identification?</b> Or does having native friends influence immigrants’ identification with the host country? This cumulative dissertation offers four longitudinal studies in order to answer these overarching questions and respective follow-up questions. In the first study, four broad theoretical scenarios are introduced and longitudinally examined using three-wave panel data for adolescents of Turkish origin in Germany. Lagged first-difference models that account both for stable unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality reveal that changes in immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and the share of native friends did not affect one another. This finding cautions researchers to interpret the cross-sectional association between immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and their friendships with natives in a causal manner. The second study tries to get closer to the micro-level processes underlying the ambiguous association between friends and identification. For this purpose, two respective selection and influence mechanisms are distinguished and empirically tested with two waves of Dutch social network data. Stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) for the co-evolution of networks and behavior show that strong <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> did not make immigrants more likely to befriend native peers. Native students, however, preferred to befriend immigrants with stronger rather than weaker <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> There was <b>no</b> evidence of any kind of social influence. The third study suggests that earlier research may have failed to identify social influence mechanisms because these might be conditional on the nature of ethnic boundaries. Related hypotheses are developed and tested for Turkish and ethnic German adolescents, for whom ethnic boundaries are particularly bright and blurred, respectively. Using lagged first-difference models on two three-wave German panel data sets, the results confirm that Turkish students’ <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> was not affected by their native friends. There is some indication, however, that friends did affect the development of ethnic Germans <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> The fourth and final study revisits the unexpected findings of the second study. For one thing, the analysis is replicated with newly collected three-wave German network panel data that have various advantages over earlier datasets. For another, a theoretical argument is developed and tested about the role of opportunity structure in the form of relative group size. Using SAOM, it is found that in ethnically highly diverse schools, immigrants with stronger host country identification were more likely to befriend native peers; but there were no respective selection effects for natives. Again, friends did not influence immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> In sum, the key conclusion of this dissertation is that the association between immigrants’ friendships with natives and their <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> is mainly a selection story. Depending on relative group size, immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> seems to affect friendship choices of both immigrants and natives. However, except under very specific favorable social conditions, {{there is little evidence that}} friends in turn influence immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} immigrants' {{identification with the}} host country. We use survey data of more than 1, 700 Turkish and Moroccan immigrants and more than 2, 200 natives in the Netherlands. We answer four main questions in this study. First, do immigrants have lower <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> than natives? Second, does the level of <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> differ between immigrant groups? Third, do economic and social integration similarly affect <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> among immigrants and natives? And fourth, what are important additional determinants of <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> among immigrants? The results show that, compared to Dutch natives, Turkish but not Moroccan immigrants have lower <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> Being employed and socially integrated is associated with higher <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> among immigrants as well as natives, but only among immigrants is higher occupational status associated with higher <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> For immigrants, Dutch language proficiency, perceived discrimination, and contact with natives proved to be important conditions for <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> © 2014 by the Center for Migration Studies of New York.

This thesis aims at restructuring Nigeria <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> system {{so as to make}} it effective in addressing its political and civil problems, which ranges from manipulated census count figures and electoral fraud to economic fraud and civil problems. These problems are arguably due to Nigeria’s ineffective <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> system. We proposed in this thesis, a restructured Nigeria <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> system to help address these political and civil problems. The proposed identification system is designed such that it will help to address identification problems in general, reduce elections and census count fraud to a minimum and be useful for the execution of policies in sectors of the economy...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to examine}} the relationship between <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and reactions towards immigrants. More specifically, in several countries of the European Union (EU) we investigate how <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> by young members of the national majority group relates to their reactions towards the most devalued non-EU immigrant group in their country. Our main research question is: When and how is stronger <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> associated with more negative reactions towards immigrants? Our main explanatory focus is on the way in which citizenship is represented (i. e., the criteria someone needs to fulfill to be regarded as a citizen). Citizenship representations can be seen as an important part of the content of national identity and previous studies have shown that national identity content may affect the relationship between <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and reactions towards immigrants. While some representations of citizenship exclude immigrants (categorizing them as members of ethnic or cultural outgroups), citizenship can also be represented in such a way that immigrants are included as fellow citizens. These different ways of representing citizenship may affect the outcome of <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> on reactions towards immigrants. In this dissertation we consider the classic ethnic and civic citizenship representations and also investigate the possibility of a distinct cultural representation. We take an intergroup relations perspective and apply a cross-national comparative approach in order to establish the construct validity of ethnic, civic, and cultural citizenship representations and to replicate theoretical associations of <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> with reactions towards immigrants across countries with varying citizenship and immigration regimes. To this end, we collected cross-national survey data among high school students in collaboration with colleagues in seven EU countries (i. e., Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden). The empirical findings of this dissertation are presented in four co-authored research articles (chapters 2 - 5), preceded by an introduction (chapter 1), which gives a general overview of the total research project, and followed by the main conclusions (chapter 6). Chapter 2 focuses on the relationships between Flemish <b>national</b> <b>identification,</b> Flemings# preferred way of representing citizenship (i. e., ethnic or civic), and their perception of how citizenship is commonly represented by fellow Flemings. It was found that <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and a preference for a more ethnic (less civic) citizenship representation reinforce each other over time. In addition, <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> depends on the match between preferred and perceived citizenship representations. <b>National</b> <b>identification</b> is stronger when people perceive citizenship to be commonly represented in the same way as they prefer to represent it. Chapter 3 examined cross-nationally whether a distinct cultural citizenship representation exists besides the ethnic and civic representations. First-time evidence was found for a distinct cultural representation. Furthermore, the three-factor model of citizenship representations (i. e., ethnic, civic, and cultural factors) was partially metric invariant across countries. When the three citizenship representations were analyzed simultaneously, in relation to multiculturalism and exclusion attitudes, the ethnic representation was no longer significantly related to these attitudes (despite significant correlations). This suggests that civic and cultural citizenship representations are more relevant in explaining reactions towards immigrants than the ethnic representation. The civic representation related to positive attitudes towards immigrants, while, in contrast to expectations derived from the citizenship literature, the cultural representation related to negative attitudes. Chapter 4 studied citizenship representations in relation to migration policy preferences. Only civic and cultural representations were robustly related to these preferences. The civic representation related to a preference for more inclusive migration policies, while the cultural representation related to a preference for more restrictive policies. Chapter 5 investigated mediation and moderation by citizenship representations, of the relationship between <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and perceived threat posed by immigrants. In all countries, the evidence pointed overwhelmingly in the direction of mediation. Stronger <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> was associated with a more cultural citizenship representation, which, in turn, related to higher perceived threat. Stronger <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> was also associated with a less civic citizenship representation, which, in turn, related to lower perceived threat. To summarize, we found that <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and citizenship representations reinforce each other over time and that <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> also depends on the match between preferred and perceived citizenship representations. We developed partially metric invariant measurement scales for citizenship representations. We obtained cross-national evidence of a distinct cultural representation of citizenship and demonstrated that this representation relates to negative rather than positive reactions towards immigrants. We argued and found that an ethnic citizenship representation has become less relevant in explaining reactions towards immigrants than civic and cultural representations. Finally, we obtained cross-national evidence for mediation rather than moderation by citizenship representations, of the relationship between <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and perceived threat posed by immigrants. Overall, the studies in this dissertation contribute to the literature on <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and citizenship. The wider implications of our findings, as well as some limitations of our empirical studies and suggestions for future research, are summarized in chapter 6. status: publishe...|$|R
