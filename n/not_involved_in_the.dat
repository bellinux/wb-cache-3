5|$|At 9a.m. on July4, Berger {{left her}} {{apartment}} for the Mother Earth offices. Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place. The bomb had exploded prematurely, shaking the sixth story of Berger's tenement building, wrecking the three upper floors and killing Berg, Caron, Hanson, and a woman, Marie Chavez, who apparently was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conspiracy. Berkman arranged the dead men's funerals.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for Saturday Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they were <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writing process. Saturday Night Live cast members did not enjoy working with The Land of Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given to Saturday Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E

5|$|Henry VIII {{gave the}} ruins to the Carey family, who {{retained}} {{it until it}} passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families. The castle was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> events of the English Civil War in the 17th century, and escaped the slighting that affected many similar properties, probably because {{the collapse of the}} outer walls had already made it indefensible and of little military value. In 1737, after the death of Edward Coke, the castle and the surrounding manor were bought by Thomas Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, for £22,500.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{spin-off}} series entitled Hi-5 House {{was created}} under new management {{to continue the}} Hi-5 concept with a refreshed appeal. The new series remained similar to the original concept, but featured a new setting; a house in which the cast members would live and present the show. The Nine Network were <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> follow-up series. The series premiered on Nick Jr. on 4 November 2013, and ran until 2016.|$|E

The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I came {{to call it the}} Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E

5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses.

South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu {{to sign the}} agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu's government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.|$|E
5|$|The {{record is}} {{primarily}} based on DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The recording sessions were particularly difficult for him, {{as he had}} recently undergone back surgery. The record is a concept album detailing {{the end of the}} world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus—the only member of that band <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project—felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} four video game adaptations of Attack on Titan {{developed}} by Nitroplus staffers {{in collaboration with}} Production I.G.

The games are visual novels and {{were included in the}} first copies of the third and sixth Blu-ray Disc volumes of the anime.

5|$|A {{version for}} the PlayStation Portable, {{developed}} by SuperVillain Studios, {{was released in}} March 2008. The company coded it from scratch, as the PlayStation 3 version's code and art were too platform-specific to reuse. The add-on pack for the PlayStation 3 version was also developed by SuperVillain. Thatgamecompany was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of either project beyond a design influence and art direction role, as they were creating their next title, Flower. Sony Santa Monica created ports of the PlayStation 3 game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were published in November 2013 to correspond {{with the release of}} the PlayStation 4. Although no album of music specifically for Flow has been released, in 2012 Austin Wintory released Journey Bonus Bundle as a download-only album on Bandcamp, containing variations on themes from Flow and Journey, a 2012 PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany.|$|E

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control of the pathway.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{was married}} twice. His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse (1853–1885), the {{daughter}} of William Prowse, a piano manufacturer, music publisher and booking agent. As a teenager, she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte. They married in 1870 and had two sons, Lucas (1872–1907) and Rupert. Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885, and in 1888, Carte married his assistant, Helen. Their wedding {{took place in the}} Savoy Chapel, with Arthur Sullivan as the best man. Rupert received training in an accounting firm and then became his father's assistant in 1894. Lucas, who was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family businesses, became a barrister. He was appointed Private Secretary to Lord Chief Justice Charles Russell in 1899 in connection with the Venezuelan boundary arbitration in Paris. There he contracted tuberculosis and later died of that disease at the age of 34.|$|E
5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> actual design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E
