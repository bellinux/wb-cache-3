Upon cessation of spawning, the ovaries still contained some oocytes at various stages of development but with a greater number of atretic oocytes. The simultaneous occurrence of oocytes at different stages of development in the ovary indicates asynchronous oocyte development. Oocyte size frequency distributions do not show a gap in size between cortical alveoli and vitellogenic oocytes during the spawning season.

40|$|Worldwide, river {{fragmentation}} {{is primarily}} responsible for the decline of populations of migrating fish. In particular, anadromous fish species, which necessarily migrate to fresh water to reproduce, are endangered since many are {{no longer able to}} reach their natural spawning sites. In addition, pollution of rivers effectively prevents upstream or downstream movements and blocks access to spawning grounds. This article investigates how poor water quality interferes with the life history cycle of <b>twaite</b> <b>shad</b> Alosa fallax fallax (Lacépède, 1803), an anadromous clupeid fish, in the watershed of River Scheldt, a heavily impacted environment in West Europe. We used two models based on known ecological and environmental information to explain past and present <b>twaite</b> <b>shad</b> distribution within the watershed and to make inferences about a future population recovery and juvenile habitat value. We demonstrated that historical spawning areas satisfy water quality conditions necessary to support spawning and successful development of early life history stages of the <b>twaite</b> <b>shad.</b> However, poor water quality conditions just upstream the freshwater-saltwater boundary still act as an effective migration barrier for upstream movement. As a consequence, spawning grounds are inaccessible and the population is dominated by seasonal adults occurring in the lower estuarine part of the watershed.

Furthermore, eggs, embryos and larvae were only found in the upstream stations of River Mira from late-March until mid- June. As expected, no habitat selection occurs at either the egg or embryonic life stages. Conversely, shad larvae abundances were related to several environmental co-variates through a complex non-linear generalised additive model (GAM). Paired translucent and opaque rings in a regularly-recurring sequence deposited around the sagittae of A. fallax fallax were readily visible. The high proportion of sagittae used suggests the usefulness of otolith microstructural analysis to estimate age and to study growth and morality of larvae. Growth and mortality rates varied seasonally (ranging from 0. 36 to 0. 60 mm d - 1 and from 16 to 30 % d - 1, respectively).

40|$|Abstract. The <b>twaite</b> <b>shad,</b> Alosa agone, {{is still}} quite common in Italy {{and the western}} Balkans, but locally is {{endangered}} or extinct. Two eco-phenotypes are recognized: the migratory‘Cheppia’or‘Laccia’and the landlocked‘Agone’. The two forms {{have never been in}} contact, at least in Italy. The migratory form is more endangered since barriers and dams prevent it from reaching upstream spawning grounds. A few reproductive communities are documented, e. g. in the Po River in Italy and Neretva River in Croatia. Resident stocks have increased to substantial populations in the large lakes of Italy, especially in the last ten years, probably as a result of improved water quality. The landlocked form from northern Italy was successfully introduced into lakes of central Italy about 75 years ago. In Sardinia a population derived from the migratory form was established about 80 years ago in the artificial Lake Omodeo. In Croatia the‘Cheppia’seems to live only in the lower course of the Neretva River. In Montenegro,‘Cheppia’and‘Agone’live in sympatry in Lake Skadar, but a dam built in 1960 caused a strong decline of both forms. The <b>twaite</b> <b>shad</b> is a very variable species, able to modify its morphology and biology according to its adaptation to freshwater or marine biotopes. In the Mediterranean area, only one taxon should be then recognized, Alosa agone (Scopoli, 1786). This will replace Alosa fallax (Lacépède, 1803), a taxon described from the Atlantic drainage area which seems to be distinct from Mediterranean populations. A survey of the distribution of reproductive communities of the migrating form in the Mediterranean area must be carried out...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} past, {{present and future}} of eight {{anadromous}} fish species inhabiting the Lower Rhine (The Netherlands), viz. -sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), whitefish and houting (Coregonus lavaretus, C. oxyrinchus), smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), allis and <b>twaite</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa alosa, A. fallax), sea trout (Salmo trutta) and salmon (Salmo salar). All species are under threat or became extinct (e. g. sturgeon, allis shad). It {{is not possible to}} single out a specific factor for the decline or disappearance. A combination of factors is responsible, as the degradation of the spawning and nursery areas, river correction for shipping, building of sluices and hydropower dams, extraction of sand and gravel and river pollution. The likelihood that a species will return via natural recovery, or restocking is assessed. The return of the sturgeon is unlikely. Present observations of sturgeon can be attributed to releases of unwanted sturgeon hybrids. A natural stock of coregonids in Dutch waters seems not feasible any more due to irreversible habitat degradation. Present day catches originate from German releases. The anadromous smelt, heavily reduced in numbers, still inhabits some of our waters, the non-migratory smelt is still very common. The allis shad is extinct and unlikely to recover. The species never spawned in the Dutch part of the Rhine. <b>Twaite</b> <b>shad,</b> declining in numbers, are still observed in the lower reaches of Rhine and Meuse. Sea trout is presumably still present in the same varying numbers as before. Spawning in our waters has not been documented.

However, although the presence of eggs was established in spring, no larvae were caught in summer or autumn. Apparently recruitment was not successful this year. During the autumn campaign juvenile anchovy, herring and seabass were caught indicating that marine species use the estuary as a nursery habitat. Presence of glass eel confirms observations that this year was a good year for glass eel migration into our estuaries. The capture of houting is at least remarkable as this species is considered extirpated in the Zeeschelde. Shrimps and prawns are, even far upstream, abundant in the Zeeschelde...|$|R
40|$|Two fish cestodes, the little-known Eubothrium fragile (Rudolphi, 1802) and E. rugosum (Batsch, 1786), {{the type}} {{species of the}} genus Eubothrium Nybelin, 1922, are redescribed {{on the basis of}} new {{material}} from <b>twaite</b> <b>shad,</b> Alosa fallax (Lacépède, 1803), from England and burbot, Lota lota (Linnaeus, 1758), from Russia, respectively. The tapeworms are compared with two other species of the genus, E. crassum (Bloch, 1779) and E. salvelini (Schrank, 1790), common parasites of salmonid fish in the Holarctic. The most notable differential characters are the size and the shape of the scolex (smaller and oval in E. fragile), the shape of the apical disc (four or more indentations in E. crassum), the number and size of the testes (the largest and least numerous in E. rugosum), and the position and size of the vitelline follicles (almost entirely cortical in distribution in E. fragile and E. crassum versus largely medullary in E. rugosum and E. salvelini). A comparison of species has also shown the morphological similarity of the freshwater species (E. rugosum and E. salvelini) on one hand and those of marine origin, E. fragile and E. crassum, on the other, with the latter species occurring also in fresh waters. A key to the identification of the species studied is also provided...|$|R

We describe the development of 13 microsatellite markers for both species, based on 454 pyrosequencing technology. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 11 in A. alosa and from 4 to 13 in A. fallax. Gene diversity ranged from 0. 364 to 0. 800 for A. alosa and 0. 226 to 0. 849 for A. fallax. These markers will help in conservation genetics studies such as assessing the extent of population decline, defining appropriate conservation units and monitoring reintroduction programs...|$|R
40|$|Spawning {{individuals}} of allis shad, Alosa alosa (Linnaeus, 1758), and <b>twaite</b> <b>shad,</b> Alosa fallax (Lacépède, 1803), were sampled from three rivers on the Atlantic {{coast of the}} Iberian Peninsula (Ulla,Minho,Mondego) during 2008 to 2013 to assess {{the presence of the}} zoonotic marine parasite Anisakis spp. larvae. The results revealed that both shad species were infected by third-larval stage Anisakis simplex s. s. and Anisakis pegreffii. The latter is reported in mixed infections in both shad species ofWestern Iberian Peninsula for the first time. In A. alosa, the prevalence of Anisakis infection can reach 100 %, while in A. fallax, prevalence was up to 83 %. Infected {{individuals of}} the former species also often contain much higher number of parasites in theirs internal organs and flesh: from 1 to 1138 Anisakis spp. larvae as compared to 1 to 121 larvae, respectively. In general, numbers of A. pegreffii were higher than those of A. simplex s. s. Our results suggest that in the marine environment of the Western Iberian Peninsula, both anadromous shad species act as paratenic hosts for A. simplex s. s. and A. pegreffii, thus widening the distribution of the infective nematode larvae from the marine to the freshwater ecosystem. This finding is of great epidemiological relevance for wildlife managers and consumers, considering the zoonotic and gastroallergic threats posed of these parasites...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between poor {{water quality and}} migration opportunities for fish remains poorly documented, although it is an essential research step in implementing EU water legislation. In this paper, we model the environmental constraints that control the movements of anadromous and catadromous fish populations that migrate through the tidal watershed of River Scheldt, a heavily impacted river basin in Western Europe. Local populations of sturgeon, sea lamprey, sea trout, Atlantic salmon, houting and allis shad were essentially extirpated around 1900. For remaining populations (flounder, three-spined stickleback, <b>twaite</b> <b>shad,</b> thinlip mullet, European eel and European smelt), a data driven logistic model was parameterized. The {{presence or absence of}} fish species in samples taken between 1995 and 2004 was modelled as a function of temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, river flow and season. Probabilities to catch individuals from all diadromous species but three-spined stickleback increased {{as a function of the}} interaction between temperature and dissolved oxygen. The hypoxic zone situated in the freshwater tidal part of the estuary was an effective barrier for upstream migrating anadromous spawners since it blocked the entrance to historical spawning sites upstream. Similarly, habitat availability for catadromous fish was greatly reduced and restricted to lower brackish water parts of the estuary. The model was applied to infer preliminary dissolved oxygen criteria for diadromous fish, to make qualitative predictions about future changes in fish distribution given anticipated changes in water quality and to suggest necessary measures with respect to watershed management...|$|R
