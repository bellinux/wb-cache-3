5|$|Java is a {{relatively}} small island compared to Sumatra, {{but it has a}} higher concentration of active volcanoes. There are 45 active volcanoes on the island excluding 20 small craters and cones in the Dieng volcanic complex and the young cones in the Tengger caldera complex. Some volcanoes are grouped together in the list below because of their close location. Mount Merapi, Semeru and Kelud are the most active volcanoes in Java. Mount Semeru has been continuously erupting since 1967. Mount Merapi has been named as one of the Decade Volcanoes since 1995. Ijen has a unique colourful caldera lake which is an extremely acidic <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> (pH<0.3). There are sulphur mining activities at Ijen, where miners collect highly concentrated sulphur rocks by hand.|$|E
5|$|Parasitologist John Kinsella {{compared}} the endoparasites of marsh rice rats in a saltwater marsh at Cedar Key and a freshwater marsh at Paynes Prairie, both in Florida, in a 1988 study. He found {{a total of}} 45species, a number unequaled in rodents. This {{may be related to}} the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the saltwater marsh were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater marsh by nematodes (roundworms). Endoparasites were found in the gastric mucosa (which lines the stomach), the cavity of the stomach, the small intestine, the cecum, the large intestine, the pancreatic duct, the bile ducts, the mucus of the liver, the pulmonary arteries, the abdominal cavity, and the pleural cavity. While the marsh rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the nematode Aonchotheca forresteri, other parasite species, such as the lone star tick (pictured), are shared with other mammals. Compared to the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Florida marsh rice rats usually harbor fewer individual ectoparasites of each species. Borrelia, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has been identified in some ticks that infect the marsh rice rat and it has been identified as a possible <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> for Borrelia.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the best}} places for {{building}} a dam is a narrow part of a deep river valley; the valley sides then can act as natural walls.

The sites are usually those where the gap becomes a minimum for the required storage capacity. The most economical arrangement is often a composite structure such as a masonry dam flanked by earth embankments. The current use of the land to be flooded should be dispensable.|$|E

25|$|Between 1976 and 1998, in 30,000mammals, birds, reptiles, {{amphibians}} and arthropods sampled from {{regions of}} EBOV outbreaks, no Ebola virus was detected apart from some genetic traces found in six rodents (belonging to the species Mus setulosus and Praomys) and one shrew (Sylvisorex ollula) {{collected from the}} Central African Republic. However, further research efforts have not confirmed rodents as a reservoir. Traces of EBOV were detected in the carcasses of gorillas and chimpanzees during outbreaks in 2001 and 2003, which later became the source of human infections. However, the high rates of death in these species resulting from EBOV infection make it unlikely that these species represent a <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> for the virus.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{crude oil}} is {{normally}} {{extracted from the}} ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production {{is used in the}} Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered {{only a small fraction of}} the oil in place, so it not often used today.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{classified}} as a zoonosis, as it is transmitted to humans from a <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts. Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the main vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia). Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage, because they are very small and thus may feed {{for long periods of}} time undetected. Larval ticks are very rarely infected. Although deer are the preferred hosts of the adult stage of deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Lyme disease spirochetes from deer. Rather, deer ticks acquire Borrelia microbes from infected small mammals and occasionally birds, including the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus.|$|E

500|$|Brighton and {{neighbouring}} Hove, on the English Channel coast {{between the}} South Downs and the sea, were built {{on top of}} a vast aquifer of chalk. [...] A regular supply of naturally pure water was always available from this <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir,</b> and in the settlements' early days many wells were sunk to exploit it. [...] The rapid growth of Brighton in the 18th and early 19th century, followed by similar expansion in Hove, put pressure on the local authorities to provide more sources and a better supply system, though: wells became increasingly contaminated by sewage from cesspits, and some had to be blocked because they were so polluted, reducing the two towns' water supply further. [...] The first local water company—the Brighton, Hove and Preston Waterworks Company—was founded on 16 June 1834 by means of an Act of Parliament; it built a waterworks on the road to Lewes and provided piped water for two hours per day to a few wealthy customers.

2500|$|The tunnel is {{equipped}} with 25 evacuation rooms.

2500|$|The tunnel flooded on 16 August 2003 {{after the}} {{automatic}} pumping system failed to sufficiently drain the <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> for water.

A 12-tonne concrete section fell down 28 December 2003, causing the tunnel to close for a week. The tunnel was closed again on 16 January 2004 after geological surveys found a section of unstable rock. Further surveys revealed that the geological evaluations during construction had overestimated the quality of the rock and hence not implemented sufficient countermeasures. As a temporary measure a tentative ferry service was established from February. The issues cost NOK35 million to resolve, and the tunnel could re-open on 2 April.|$|E
2500|$|Wells are drilled into oil {{reservoirs}} {{to extract}} the crude oil. [...] "Natural lift" [...] production methods that rely on the <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, {{such as in the}} Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using [...] "artificial lift" [...] means. Over time, these [...] "primary" [...] methods become less effective and [...] "secondary" [...] production methods may be used. A common secondary method is [...] "waterflood" [...] or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or [...] "wellbore." [...] Eventually [...] "tertiary" [...] or [...] "enhanced" [...] oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil's flow characteristics by injecting steam, carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir. In the United States, primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis, secondary methods account for about half, and tertiary recovery the remaining 10 percent. Extracting oil (or [...] "bitumen") from oil/tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort, or using [...] "in-situ" [...] methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping out the oil-saturated liquid.|$|E

2500|$|The Mekong, {{which is}} 4,220 {{kilometers}} long, {{is one of}} the 12 great rivers of the world. From its source in the Tibetan Plateau, it flows through the Tibetan and Yunnan regions of China, forms the boundary between Laos and Myanmar as well as between Laos and Thailand. [...] At Phnom Penh it merges with the Tonlé Sap and divides into two branches - the Sông Hậu Giang (Hậu Giang river) (known as the Bassac River on the Cambodian side) and the Sông Tiền Giang (Tiền Giang river) - and continues through Cambodia and the Mekong basin before draining into the South China Sea through nine mouths known as the Cửu Long (nine dragons). The river is heavily silted and is navigable by seagoing craft of shallow draft as far as Kompong Cham in Cambodia. A tributary entering the river at Phnom Penh drains the Tonlé Sap, a shallow freshwater lake that acts as a <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> to stabilize the flow of water through the lower Mekong. When the river is in flood stage, its silted delta outlets are unable to carry off the high volume of water. Floodwaters back up into the Tonlé Sap, causing the lake to inundate as much as 10,000 square kilometers. As the flood subsides, the flow of water reverses and proceeds from the lake to the sea. The effect is to reduce significantly the danger of devastating floods in the Mekong delta, where the river floods the surrounding fields each year to a level of one to two meters.|$|E
