In May 1889, Jingyuen and the Beiyang Fleet were moved to fortify Weihaiwei (<b>now</b> Weihai). During the summer of that year, she was part of the flotilla led by Admiral Ding Ruchang, which travelled to Chefoo (<b>now</b> Yantai), Chemlupo (<b>now</b> Incheon, South Korea), and the Imperial Russian Navy base of Vladivostok.

These results indicate that a major algorithmic and software eort is needed to come up with eÆcient numerical libraries on the computational grid. Keywords: meta-computing, heter [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{original}} routing of what is <b>now</b> I-84 existed as early as 1923; however the portion of <b>now</b> I-84 into Idaho was not yet constructed. In 1926, much of the route was signed as US-30S, from the <b>now</b> eastern terminus at I-80 (US-530 then), northwest into Ogden. Between Ogden and Brigham City, the highway was to be concurrent with US-91, then US-30S split off northwest to the Idaho border. The entire western branch of US-30S was an unimproved road, however the concurrency into Ogden was paved. The remainder of the route to its <b>now</b> terminus was mostly graded with a few improved sections, and by 1937, the entire route was paved.|$|E
