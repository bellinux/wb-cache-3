40|$|We {{all think}} we know what good {{medicine}} looks like: smart doctors, stethoscopes, imaging machines, high-tech tests, and the best prescriptions and procedures money can buy. But that picture is vastly incomplete, perhaps fatally so. In this eye-opening book, physician Rishi Manchanda says that our health may depend even more on our social and environmental settings than it does on our most cutting-edge medical care. Manchanda strongly argues that {{that the future of}} our health, and our health care system, depends on growing and supporting a new generation of health care practitioners who look upstream for the sources of our problems, rather than simply go for quick-hit symptomatic relief. These upstreamists, as he calls them, are doctors and <b>nurses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontlines</b> of medicine who see that health (like sickness) is more than a chemical equation that can be balanced with pills and procedures administered within clinic walls. They see, rather, that health begins in our everyday lives, in the places where we live, work, eat, and play. Upstreamists know that asthma can start in the air around us or in the mold in the walls of our homes. They understand that obesity, diabetes, and heart disease partly originate in our busy modern schedules, in the unhealthy food choices available in our stores, and even in the way our neighborhoods are designed. They recognize that depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure can arise from chronically stressful conditions at work and home, and that such conditions can even affect our DNA. And, just as important, these medical innovators understand how to translate this knowledge into meaningful action. If our high-cost, sick-care system is to become a high-value, health care system, the upstreamists will show us the way. Review "Rishi Manchanda’s TED Book about upstreamists breaks a lot of new ground. His is a novel and compelling vision that moves prevention front and center in medical care by moving the doctor upstream — upstream to where the problems begin and where a little insight and foresight can convert an oncoming medical disaster into a preventable problem. " — Fitzhugh Mullan, MD, Murdock Head Professor of Medicine and Health Policy, George Washington University School of Public Health, and Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the George Washington University School of Medicine "This book is fabulous. As an upstreamist, Dr. Manchanda knows that without addressing the social ills that are the source (the upstream causes) of the patients' medical problems, those problems will never be adequately solved. In his book, and in his work, Dr. Manchanda presents an uplifting and necessary journey for any of us who think narrowly as downstreamists. " — Thomas S.

40|$|Human genome {{research}} is creating {{new opportunities for}} a more individualized approach to the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of rare and common diseases. Concerns about insurance discrimination, however, have led many people who could benefit from genetic testing to choose not to have it. Other individuals have chosen to pay for genetic testing on their own. In May 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, known as GINA, was signed into law. GINA is a federal law that protects United States citizens from health insurance and employment discrimination based on their genetic information. <b>Nurses,</b> who are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontlines</b> of healthcare delivery, need {{to become familiar with}} the scope and limitations of GINA. This article describes the need for GINA, the scope and limitations of this law, and health provider resources relating to this law. Case studies that illustrate typical situations nurses and their clients may face with regard to genetic and genomic information are provided. Activities that nurses can carry out in their own institutions to facilitate GINA compliance are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Background: Over {{one half}} of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. <b>Nurses</b> are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontlines</b> of <b>the</b> health care work force and often {{encounter}} women with unintended pregnancies in the clinical setting. They may find themselves responsible for options counseling and helping these women to explore their options of pregnancy, adoption and abortion. Discussing these three options in a non-judgmental, well-informed manner allows the woman to consider all possibilities. Leading this type of conversation requires specific skills and knowledge {{as well as the}} ability to deliver this information in a therapeutic, nonbiased manner. Purpose: The intent {{of this study was to}} analyze data regarding the inclusion of options counseling and abortion education in undergraduate nursing programs in New England. Identification of gaps can provide opportunities for curriculum reform. Due to the enormous impact that nurses have with patients, institutions have a responsibility to provide their students with accurate, honest, factual, current knowledge about options counseling including abortion. Doing so is a public health issue with the incentive of not only providing women with optimal health care and better maternal-fetal outcomes, but also to reduce spending nationwide. This study can support efforts to accomplish these goals. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was sent out via email to the faculty members of accredited undergraduate nursing programs throughout New England. It was active for approximately three months between June 2015 and September 2015 with intermittent reminders sent during that time frame. The survey inquired about personal attitudes, inclusion/exclusion of options counseling and abortion education as well as methods used to include this material in the curricula. Results: All states in New England were included in this study. Fifty percent of responding institutions reported that they include options counseling and abortion education in the curricula, while the remaining 50 % reportedly do not. When asked to identify reasons that this content is not included in the current curricula, 80 % of respondents indicated that it is not a curriculum priority due to time constraints. The main identified methods that support inclusion of options counseling and abortion in the curricula include classroom sessions focused on technical/evidence-based instruction, classroom sessions focused on ethical issues and assigned readings. Conclusions: Options counseling and abortion education is not adequately covered in undergraduate nursing curricula across New England. This data set is remarkably similar to a study done in 1997, showing that in the course of nearly 20 years, there has been little advance in the inclusion of options counseling and abortion education. In many instances, this material is given equal or more attention in ethical discussions rather than focusing on technical evidence-based instruction. Personal attitudes about abortion have been correlated with the inclusions of options counseling and abortion education and likely affect the content that is incorporated in the curricula...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{quality is}} a {{priority}} in this country. Interventions addressing this problem have been done frequently leading to entire hospital departments being dedicated to quality. Nurses comprise the largest sect in healthcare. They have direct access to patient safety. They also have firsthand knowledge of the processes that drive quality. Nurses have been underutilized as quality drivers in health care. One solution was a nurse-driven quality improvement program, called “Providing Cost Effective Quality Care,” that used Toyota Lean as its model for quality improvement. The purpose of this thesis {{was to determine if}} the program’s successes and deficits could be identified comprehensively {{within the context of a}} theoretical implementation framework. The objectives of the program were to support ongoing quality improvement initiatives, while increasing nurses’ access to continuing education, all to improve the quality of patient care. Two cohorts of nurses attended the training and implemented quality improvement projects. Changes were made between cohorts to increase program effectiveness. Results of the program showed that nurses should be selected based on their knowledge of and dedication to the project at hand, that the training program was an effective way to introduce Lean concepts but should allow for team project time, that the use of a coach was an integral component for project effectiveness, and that a lack of administrative support stunted project uptake and implementation. The findings in this thesis demonstrate that the successes and deficits of the “Providing Cost Effective Quality Care” program could be described within the implementation framework. Additional research is needed to use the theoretical implementation framework to drive the program planning and a long-term outcomes evaluation is needed to determine effectiveness in improving patient safety. This program has public health significance because it makes use of <b>nurses,</b> who are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frontline</b> of patient care. The nurses are in the position to support improving patient safety and quality of healthcare, thereby reducing unnecessary adverse health events. This, in turn, reduces the burden of preventable diseases. ...|$|R
