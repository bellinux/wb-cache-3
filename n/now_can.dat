25|$|Physical {{models and}} {{computer}} models have partially complementary strengths and weaknesses. Physical models {{can be used}} by those without access to a computer and <b>now</b> <b>can</b> be made cheaply out of plastic materials. Their tactile and visual aspects cannot be easily reproduced by computers (although haptic devices have occasionally been built). On a computer screen, the flexibility of molecules is also difficult to appreciate; illustrating the pseudorotation of cyclohexane {{is a good example of}} the value of mechanical models.|$|E
25|$|CDJs {{are high}} quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and pitch {{controls}} to allow DJs {{to manipulate the}} playback of digital files for beatmatching similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from compact discs, they <b>now</b> <b>can</b> play digital music files stored on USB flash drives and SD cards. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software {{to act as a}} DJ controller.|$|E
25|$|Wavelength is {{a measure}} of the {{distance}} between repetitions of a shape feature such as peaks, valleys, or zero-crossings, not a measure of how far any given particle moves. For example, in sinusoidal waves over deep water a particle near the water's surface moves in a circle of the same diameter as the wave height, unrelated to wavelength. The range of wavelengths or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a spectrum. The name originated with the visible light spectrum but <b>now</b> <b>can</b> be applied to the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as to a sound spectrum or vibration spectrum.|$|E

He was the youngest participant in the Forum. Other companies attending the Forum included e.g. Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook on the U.S. side and Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu from China. In an interview with Sina, he said that China has been the new driving force {{for the development of}} the Internet industry. Chinese Internet companies <b>now</b> <b>can</b> compete with U.S.counterparts or even outpace them in terms of product and business model innovation.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1970s (when President Nixon took the United States off the gold {{standard}} and President Ford signed legislation that again made it legal {{for the public to}} own gold bullion), any recovered 1933 double eagle, as gold bullion, was required to be melted. Therefore, while double eagles recovered prior to 1974 were melted down, any double eagle recovered <b>now</b> <b>can</b> be spared this fate. Currently, {{with the exception of the}} one sold on July 30, 2002, 1933 double eagle coins cannot be the legal possession of any member of the public, as they were never issued and hence remain the property of the United States government.|$|E
25|$|Nepal {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} in Asia to abolish the death penalty. Nepal is the only Asian country where the possibility of same-sex marriage has been proposed in the high court and in the legislature although same-sex marriage currently does not exist in Nepal (see also LGBT rights in Nepal and Same-sex marriage in Nepal). The decision was based on a seven-person government committee study, and enacted through Supreme Court's ruling November 2008. The ruling granted full rights for LGBT individuals, including the right to marry and <b>now</b> <b>can</b> get citizenship as a third gender rather than male or female as authorised by Nepal's Supreme Court in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Honda's early hybrids {{including}} the first generation Insight used this design, leveraging their reputation for design of small, efficient gasoline engines; their system is dubbed Integrated Motor Assist (IMA). Starting with the 2006 Civic Hybrid, the IMA system <b>now</b> <b>can</b> propel the vehicle solely on electric power during medium speed cruising. Another example is the 2005–2007 Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid, a full-size pickup truck. Chevrolet {{was able to get}} a 10% improvement on the Silverado's fuel efficiency by shutting down and restarting the engine on demand and using regenerative braking. General Motors has also used its mild BAS Hybrid technology in other models such as the Saturn Vue Green Line, the Saturn Aura Greenline and the Malibu Hybrid.|$|E
25|$|John Gough senior died by 'taking an {{overdose}} of strichnine'. The coroner's report which might explain the reason has not survived. The day after his death, the local Burrangong Courier had no explanation for the event: `A man {{of the name of}} John George Gough, an old colonist, who occupied a butcher's shop adjoining Myers' cordial manufactory in Main Street, committed suicide yesterday morning by swallowing strychnine. He was in the Diggers' Theatre, apparently in excellent spirits, on the previous night, and no one <b>now</b> <b>can</b> tell what led to the sad act. Gough was a widower, and leaves a young son who is now unprotected, and for whom we now appeal to the sympathies of the generous in order that he may be enabled to earn an honest living.|$|E
25|$|On {{her death}} in 1876, Maria Nikolaievna's art {{collections}} were divided among her surviving children: Prince Nicholas of Leuchtenberg, his brothers Eugene and George, their sisters Princess Maria of Baden and Princess Eugenia of Oldenburg and their half-sister, countess Elena Strogonova. In 1884, her son, Nicholas Duke of Leuchtenberg, mounted an exhibition at the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts with the Grand Duchess former collection. In 1913 another exhibitions was organized at the Hermitage Museum entitled the Heritage of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaievna. After the revolution the collection was dispersed and <b>now</b> <b>can</b> be enjoyed in museums in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Vienna and the United States. Three of Maria's sons by the Duke of Leuchtenberg lived in her former residence the Mariinsky Palace until 1884, when it was sold to the treasury {{to pay for the}} family's mounting debts. Today the Palace houses the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly.|$|E

25|$|FASTA cannot remove low {{complexity}} regions before aligning the sequences as it {{is possible}} with BLAST. This might be problematic as when the query sequence contains such regions, e.g. mini- or microsatellites repeating the same short sequence frequent times, this increases the score of not familiar sequences in the database which only match in this repeats, which occur quite frequently. Therefore the program PRSS is added in the FASTA distribution package. PRSS shuffles the matching sequences in the database either on the one-letter level or it shuffles short segments which length the user can determine. The shuffled sequences are now aligned again and if the score is still higher than expected this {{is caused by the}} low complexity regions being mixed up still mapping to the query. By the amount of the score the shuffled sequences still attain PRSS <b>now</b> <b>can</b> predict the significance of the score of the original sequences. The higher the score of the shuffled sequences the less significant the matches found between original database and query sequence.|$|E
25|$|The Second World War led {{to another}} great wave of {{tunnelling}} as work was undertaken to enable The Rock to house a garrison of 16,000 men with water, food, ammunition and fuel supplies sufficient to last a year under siege. The Great Siege Tunnels were reused during the war; although it is uncertain exactly how they were used, it appears {{that they may have}} housed one of the generators used to power Gibraltar's searchlights, as a concrete mounting pad of the requisite dimensions was installed in one of the embrasures. The Great Siege Tunnels were extended in two directions during the war, with a long straight extension called the Holyland Tunnel continuing through to the east side of The Rock, so named because it points in the direction of Jerusalem, and a staircase dug to link the tunnels with other Second World War tunnels lower down, known as the Middle Galleries. However, the methods by which the Second World War tunnels were hastily excavated have meant that – unlike the original 18th century tunnels – they have crumbled rapidly and <b>now</b> <b>can</b> not be safely accessed.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January 2013, the Viterbo court {{decided to}} {{transfer}} the case for judgement directly to the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court ruled on 20 June 2013, that the Chamber of Deputies decree having extended Berlusconi's immunity beyond what was provided for by the constitution, was a case with conflict of powers and should be disregarded. This mean that Berlusconi does not enjoy any special immunity protection for his spoken words during election campaigns, and that a court case now shall be held by the constitutional court, to decide {{the merits of the}} case. Before the case against Berlusconi can begin, the Italian Chamber of Deputies however shall be called for trial to defend and explain the reasons for passing their unconstitutional law from 2010. The court hearing against the Chamber of Deputies took place on 8 July 2014, where the constitutional court was asked to deem the concerned Chamber of Deputies decree to be unconstitutional and annul it, by the Court of Rome and the Viterbo court. On 18 July 2014, the Constitutional Court indeed ruled the decree to be unconstitutional and annulled it; meaning that the civil court proceedings against Berlusconi <b>now</b> <b>can</b> continue.|$|E
