5|$|The trial opens as {{originally}} scheduled, {{but the two}} Finley & Figg partners prove unequal to the task. During opening statements, Oscar suffers a myocardial infarction. Wally attempts {{to make light of}} the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx's side effects. Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg. Wally stands in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new jury is seated and for the first day of testimony. The next day, the recovering alcoholic Figg is nowhere to be found although an empty pint bottle of Smirnoff Vodka is.|$|E
25|$|The group {{decides to}} {{fight their way}} to the local marina, and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan. They begin {{reinforcing}} two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape. However, they also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up Andy, who is starving. They strap food and a walkie-talkie onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips gets into Andy's store safely but a zombie follows through the dog door, ultimately biting Andy. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers and kill Andy, rescuing Nicole. They grab ammunition {{and go back to the}} mall. Along the way, Tucker breaks his legs and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation.|$|E
500|$|Miller's debut for {{the first}} team came on 31 March 2004 against Czech Republic in a 2–1 win; he came on as a {{substitute}} for Matt Holland. His first goal for Ireland came in a 3–0 win over Sweden on 1 March 2006 where he had made a run and a 25-yard shot rifled into the top of the net. Despite Miller being without a club during the summer of 2009, manager Giovanni Trapattoni continued to select him for the Ireland squad. Miller later commented that [...] "I am very grateful to the manager. He didn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> me in the squad but he showed faith in me and I'm delighted with that".|$|E

500|$|Since late 2008, MOBA {{has been}} experimenting with {{allowing}} the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be [...] "interpreted". The [...] "Guest Interpretator's Collection" [...] is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and one is added every two months. A professor at Boston University offered his thoughts: [...] "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests {{a commitment to the}} abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!" ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was in a}} garment, {{and with}} an expression, of this kind, that she made her entrance, after I had {{exchanged}} a few words with Miss Ambient. Her husband presently followed her, and there being no other company we went to dinner. The impression I received from that repast is present to me still. There were elements of oddity in my companions, but they were vague and latent, and did n't interfere with my delight It came mainly, of course, from Ambient's talk, which was the most brilliant and interesting I had ever heard. I know not whether he laid himself out to dazzle a rather juvenile pilgrim from over the sea; but it matters little, for it was very {{easy for him to}} shine. He was almost better as a talker than as a writer; that is, if the extraordinary finish of his written prose be really, as some people have maintained, a fault. There was such a kindness in him, however, that I have no doubt it gave him ideas to see me sit open-mouthed, as I suppose I did. Not so the two ladies, who not only were very nearly dumb from beginning {{to the end of the}} meal, but who had not the air of being struck with such an exhibition of wit and knowledge. Mrs. Ambient, placid and detached, met neither my eye nor her husband's; she attended to her dinner, watched the servants, arranged the puckers in her dress, exchanged at wide intervals a remark with her sister-in-law, and while she slowly rubbed her white hands between the courses, looked out of the window at the first signs of twilight--the long June day allowing us to dine without candles.. Miss Ambient appeared to give little direct heed to her brother's discourse; but on the other hand she was much engaged in watching its effect upon me. Her lustreless pupils continued to attach themselves to my countenance, and it was only her air of belonging to another century that kept them from being importunate. She seemed to look at me across the ages, and the interval of time diminished the vividness of the performance. It was as if she knew in a general way that her brother must be talking very well, but she herself was so rich in ideas that she had no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> them up, and was at liberty to see what would become of a young American when subjected to a high aesthetic temperature.|$|E

5000|$|Pass {{blocking}} for {{a center}} {{is similar to}} run blocking for a center. The center will initially help guards based on {{the position of the}} defensive linemen. In the case of a blitz, the center may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a rushing linebacker, safety or corner. A good center also needs to stay vigilant during pass blocking to protect against defensive stunts and twists.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} red grapes {{planted in}} Morocco are Carignan (which once dominated), Cinsaut (almost 40 per cent in 2005), Alicante, and Grenache. Plantations of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah have increased rapidly, and together make up around 15 per cent. Traditional white grape varieties include Clairette blanche and Muscat.

50|$|Log-structured merge-trees (LSMs) {{refer to}} a class of data {{structures}} which consists {{of two or more}} index structures of exponentially growing capacities. When a tree at some level reaches its capacity, it is merged into the next bigger level. The IO-complexity of an LSM depends on parameters such as the growth factor between levels and the data structure chosen at each level, so in order to analyze the complexity of LSMs, we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a specific version. For comparison purposes, we select the version of LSMs that match Fractal Tree indexes on insertion performance.|$|E
50|$|In {{the driving}} part, {{the idea is}} to drive from the office to the house to paint - and back. First, you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a correct paint to paint the house with; wrong choice (such as oil paint for a {{concrete}} building) will result in a chastisement from the Father. Driving is straightforward, and is shown from above; the target building shows up in the game map, highlighted with Tikkurila's logo, and compass shows where to drive. Driving off the road, colliding with a building, or getting run over by a train will make the player lose a life.|$|E
50|$|Although {{hotel room}} {{security}} has improved, with more advanced locks, {{this has not}} eradicated hotel theft. A thief can enter a room without <b>needing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a lock, for example by {{pretending to be a}} guest who has left their key in their room. Items can also be taken while a guest is distracted, for example when checking in.|$|R

50|$|The {{economic}} {{model has been}} reworked. In previous games, goods could only be picked up at a station, and revenue depended on the distance between stations. Carloads in Railroad Tycoon 3 slowly move across the map (representing road and water transport) along the gradient of a scalar field representing price, where supply and demand sites function as sources and sinks. Revenue depends on the price difference between pick-up and delivery. This has several effects; raw materials can {{find their way to}} industries and get processed, without any trains involved, and a train does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up goods at the source.|$|E

The locations of stations and information about bike availability can be accessed on HSL's Journey Planner. A HSL Travel Card can be used instead of a cyclist ID. The pass entitles the user to an unlimited number of rides of up to 30 minutes. Extra charges apply for longer journeys.|$|E
