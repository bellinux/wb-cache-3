40|$|Nephrotoxicity {{comparisons}} of aminoglycosides in rats, utilizing large multiples of human doses, have indicated an advantage for <b>netilmicin.</b> However, no nephrotoxicity advantage of <b>netilmicin</b> {{has been demonstrated}} at the lower doses used in clinics. Some high-dose studies in rats have also suggested that {{the slope of the}} nephrotoxicity dose-response curve of <b>netilmicin</b> was less steep than the slopes of other aminoglycosides. Therefore, the slopes of the nephrotoxicity dose-response curves of gentamicin, amikacin, and <b>netilmicin</b> were compared in 200 rats at low multiples (one to five times) of human clinical doses. Histopathological evaluations of both kidneys from each rat revealed that <b>netilmicin</b> produced equivalent or greater nephrotoxicity as compared with gentamicin and amikacin and that the slope of the nephrotoxicity dose-response curve of <b>netilmicin</b> was approximately one-half as steep as the slopes of amikacin and gentamicin, which were parallel. The distribution of casts excreted in the urine after 2 weeks of dosing and the terminal gross observations corroborated the flatter dose-response slope of <b>netilmicin.</b> Nephrotoxicity advantages predicted by high-dose comparisons with <b>netilmicin</b> in rats are apparently a function of its less steep dose-response slope and therefore may have no relevance to lower doses...|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{of the new}} aminoglycoside antibiotic <b>netilmicin</b> {{were examined}} after single intravenous injections at two different dose levels to elderly male patients.

40|$|<b>Netilmicin</b> (Sch 20569), a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside, was {{studied for}} {{its effects on}} kidney {{function}} and mechanisms by which it is handled by the kidneys. Measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinalysis in chronic rat studies indicated that the nephrotoxicity of <b>netilmicin</b> was remarkably {{less than that of}} gentamicin. Gentamicin caused a dose-related reduction in GFR in association with glucosuria and elevated fractional excretion of K+. By contrast, high doses of <b>netilmicin</b> produced only slight reduction in GFR with increased fractional excretion of K+ but without glucosuria. In separate experiments, rats were shown to excrete 71 to 90 % of <b>netilmicin</b> or gentamicin in 24 h after daily intramuscular administration of doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg for 4 days. In acute experiments on anesthetized dogs, GFR and renal plasma flow were unaffected at serum levels of 11. 0 ± 0. 6 μg/ml maintained by constant infusion of <b>netilmicin</b> for 5 h. The renal clearance of <b>netilmicin</b> was significantly correlated with GFR. The urinary output of <b>netilmicin</b> was 80. 0 ± 4. 2 % of the infusion rate and was independent of urine flow over the range of 0. 04 to 0. 33 ml/kg per min. Preferential accumulation of <b>netilmicin</b> occurred in the renal cortex; the cortex–serum and medulla–serum ratios were 9. 9 ± 1. 2 and 4. 2 ± 0. 6, respectively. In addition, the extraction ratio of <b>netilmicin,</b> which was lower than that of inulin, suggested that <b>netilmicin</b> reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule and results in cortical accumulation. It is concluded that <b>netilmicin,</b> like gentamicin, is excreted by the dog kidney by glomerular filtration plus limited reabsorption. However, the new drug is characterized by low intrinsic nephrotoxicity in rats...|$|E

40|$|The penicillin-aminoglycoside {{combination}} {{is recommended for}} the treatment of systemic enterococcal infections.

We evaluated the efficacy of penicillin, alone or in combination with various dosing regimens of <b>netilmicin,</b> {{for the treatment of}} experimental left-sided Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis in rabbits. Animals were injected intramuscularly for 4 days with penicillin alone or in combination with <b>netilmicin</b> in one of the following regimens: <b>netilmicin</b> at a low dose (2 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h), <b>netilmicin</b> at a high dose (4 mg/kg every 8 h), or <b>netilmicin</b> at a single daily high dose (12 mg/kg every 24 h). MICs and MBCs were 3. 1 and 6. 2 micrograms/ml and 8 and 8 micrograms/ml for penicillin and <b>netilmicin,</b> respectively. A <b>netilmicin</b> concentration of 4 micrograms/ml was the lowest concentration that achieved synergism with penicillin, as shown by the kill-curve method. Mean peak levels of <b>netilmicin</b> in serum were 5. 6 (<b>netilmicin</b> at 2 mg/kg), 9. 8 (<b>netilmicin</b> at 4 mg/kg), and 20. 6 (<b>netilmicin</b> at 12 mg/kg) micrograms/ml. Mean penicillin levels in serum were constantly above the MIC. Penicillin plus <b>netilmicin</b> at a high dose given three times daily was more effective (P less than 0. 05) than any other regimen in reducing bacterial titers in vegetations and was the only treatment that induced a significant bactericidal activity in rabbit serum during the trough. We concluded that divided doses of aminoglycoside are more effective than the same total dose given once daily in combination with penicillin. Our data suggest that prolonged levels of aminoglycoside in serum might be important to exhibit the greatest in vivo efficacy of the combination against E. faecalis. They also indicate that use of a reduced total daily dose of aminoglycoside or an increase in the interval between each dose might reduce the efficacy of therapy in animals with this type of infection...|$|E
