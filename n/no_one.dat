5|$|A port of <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Lives Forever – Game of the Year Edition for the Mac OS X {{operating}} system {{was developed by}} MumboJumbo, and published by MacPlay. It was released on November 21, 2002, soon after the original Windows release of <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way (which was also ported to Mac OS X by MacPlay later). Similarly to the Windows version of the game, the Mac OS X port also uses GameSpy technology for its online multiplayer mode, allowing players to play with each other, no matter which platform they use.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> in 1970 could build a database so large and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> is predestined to hell and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential.

60|$|He {{was as good}} a {{listener}} as talker, appreciating everything that others said, however humble might be their rank or pretensions, and was quick to testify his perception of any point in their discourse. He arrogated nothing to himself, but was perfectly unassuming and unpretending, entering with heart and soul into the business, or pleasure, or, I had almost said, folly, of the hour and the company. <b>No</b> <b>one's</b> concerns, <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> thoughts, <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> opinions, <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> tastes and pleasures seemed beneath him. He made himself so thoroughly the companion of those with whom he happened to be, that they forgot for a time his vast superiority, and only recollected and wondered, when all was over, that it was Scott with whom they had been on such familiar terms, and in whose society they had felt so perfectly at their ease.|$|R
50|$|His {{most recent}} {{theatrical}} work, Posthumous Trilogy (Posmrtna trilogija, 2006) {{is a collection}} of three plays: Sons Die First (Sinovi umiru prvi), <b>No</b> <b>One's</b> Son (Ničiji sin) and The Woman Without a Body (Žena bez tijela). Although these three plays share some common motifs such as fatherhood, belonging and family, and all three end in suicide of the protagonist, Matišić described them respectively as a tragicomedy, a drama, and a dark-humored psychological thriller. <b>No</b> <b>One's</b> Son and The Woman Without a Body have been adapted into feature films, <b>No</b> <b>One's</b> Son and Will Not End Here, both released in 2008.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} trap Williams, Power asked Williams {{to meet him}} at Moorgate Street Station the {{following}} day. Police were lying in wait and arrested both Power and Williams at the Moorgate station. Police covered Williams's head with an apron to prevent him from being photographed and thus possibly influencing witnesses. However, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had glimpsed the murderer's face, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> selected Williams from an identity parade. Power was immediately released.|$|E

Though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was injured, windows were blown out, the Council Chamber (located above the blast) was damaged, all of the columns of the portico were damaged and replaced, and the Liberty Bell replica was a complete loss. A new bell was purchased for $8,000 and later moved to Terry Schrunk Plaza. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> was ever arrested or claimed responsibility for the bombing.|$|E
