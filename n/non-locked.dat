50|$|To allow programmers to use {{a larger}} virtual address space than is {{actually}} available in the RAM, CPUs (or hosts, {{in the language of}} GPGPU) implement a virtual memory system Virtual memory (<b>non-locked</b> / non-pinned memory) in which a physical memory page may be swapped out to disk. When the host needs that page, it loads it back in from the disk. The drawback with CPU⟷GPU memory transfers is that memory transactions are slower, i.e., the bandwidth of the PCI-E bus to connect CPU and GPU is not fully exploited. <b>Non-locked</b> / non-pinned memory does not reside only in main memory (e.g. it can be in swap), so the driver needs to access every single page of the <b>non-locked</b> memory, copy it into pinned buffer and pass it to the Direct Memory Access (DMA) (synchronously page-by-page copy). Indeed, PCI-E transfers occur only using the DMA. Accordingly, when a “normal” transfer is issued, an allocation of a block of page-locked memory is necessary, followed by a host copy from regular memory to the page-locked / pinned one, the transfer, the wait for the transfer to complete and the deletion of the page-locked / pinned memory. This consumes precious host time which is avoided when directly using page-fixed memory.|$|E

30|$|There are, however, {{clinical}} scenarios when {{a surgeon}} may {{prefer to use}} <b>non-locked</b> peripheral screws. The concept of hybrid fixation, where combinations of locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws are used together, has been a longstanding feature used in locked plate osteosynthesis and {{has been shown to}} be biomechanically similar while also providing the potential benefits of compression or aiding with reduction [24 – 28]. Variations in hybrid peripheral screw combinations have not been tested for reverse shoulder glenoid baseplate fixation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate initial glenoid baseplate fixation using a variety of combinations of locked and <b>non-locked</b> peripheral screws. We hypothesized that glenoid baseplate micromotion would be sufficiently minimized using all combinations of locked and <b>non-locked</b> peripheral screws.|$|E
30|$|This {{study used}} the glenoid {{components}} of a single reverse shoulder arthroplasty system (RSP®; DJO Global, Austin, TX, USA). The baseplate consists of a single central 6.5 -mm lag screw in combination with four peripheral screw holes, {{which can be used}} in locked or <b>non-locked</b> fashion. The underside of the baseplate is coated with hydroxyapatite to facilitate bony ingrowth in vivo. All baseplates were fixed perpendicular to the bone block substitutes. Briefly, a 2.5 -mm drill was used to define the trajectory for the baseplate’s central screw. A 6.5 -mm tap was used to create the threads for the central screw. With the tap still in place, a reamer was used to create the circumferential concavity required to accommodate the underside of the baseplate, which was then inserted and tightened to a maximum torque of 3.5  N-m (Model DID- 04 Digital Torque Screwdriver; Imada, Inc. Northbrook, IL, USA). For this study, we evaluated baseplate fixation using four combinations of locked (5 -mm diameter) and (3.5 -mm diameter) <b>non-locked</b> peripheral screws in seven (n =  7) cylinders per fixation group—(1) 1 locked screw +  3 <b>non-locked</b> screws (1 -locked), (2) 2 locked screws +  2 <b>non-locked</b> screws (2 -locked), (3) 3 locked screws +  1 <b>non-locked</b> screw (3 -locked), and (4) 4 locked screws (4 -locked). All locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws were the same length as determined by a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of 100 reverse shoulder arthroplasty surgeries using the same glenoid baseplate. This identified an average peripheral screw length of 21  mm. Thus, 22 -mm screws were selected for all locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws.|$|E
30|$|The use of {{peripheral}} locked screws {{has reduced}} glenoid baseplate failure rates in reverse shoulder arthroplasty. However, situations may arise when {{one or more}} <b>non-locked</b> screws may be preferred. We aimed to determine if different combinations of locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws significantly alter acute glenoid baseplate fixation in a laboratory setting.|$|E
30|$|Several {{steps were}} taken to help {{maintain}} uniformity of the tested constructs and strengthen {{the validity of the}} data. <b>Non-locked</b> screws have the potential to lose fixation during implantation by stripping out. A pilot study was thus performed to evaluate the torque at which peripheral <b>non-locked</b> screws stripped (documented as a sharp drop in measured torque) within the bone model and lost fixation. All of the peripheral <b>non-locked</b> screws were then implanted within the torque limits observed, ensuring that each screw placed provided similar fixation. Additionally, the orientation of the baseplate was controlled such that the screw orientation remained constant, preventing variability in rigidity based on the orientation of the locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws. Finally, the central screw baseplates were implanted with an identical maximum torque to ensure that uniform compression was achieved with each tested model.|$|E
30|$|Use of a glenosphere implant {{with a more}} {{lateral center}} of {{rotation}} was met with controversy based on historical implant failures seen with earlier generation implants [14 – 21]. The first modern reverse shoulder replacement to revisit a more lateralized center of rotation utilized a central screw baseplate and four peripheral <b>non-locked</b> 3.5 -mm screws. Using all peripheral <b>non-locked</b> screws, the glenoid baseplate failure rate was 11 % [22]. With continued understanding of surgical technique and replacement of the 3.5 -mm peripheral <b>non-locked</b> screws with 5.0 -mm locked screws, the incidence of glenoid baseplate failures was reduced to 0 % in a 5 -year minimum follow-up study [33]. This clinical experience validated the mechanical study reported by Harman et al. [11] which showed how peripheral locked screws were superior to <b>non-locked</b> screws at maximizing baseplate fixation < 150 µm micromotion threshold. Surgeons have thus gained comfort using a glenoid baseplate with four peripheral locked screws. There are certainly cases where four peripheral locked screws are either not possible {{or may not be}} of optimal surgical preference. Included in these scenarios are cases where there is limited bone remaining, such that a screw would capture minimal bone or result in a prominent screw; or cases where a larger locked screw might not be optimal, creating a potential stress riser for an acromion spine fracture [34]. Additionally, there are situations when further glenoid component compression is desirable, which can only be achieved by using a <b>non-locked</b> screw. In these cases, the surgeon may elect to utilize a <b>non-locked</b> screw rather than a locked screw. This concept of hybrid fixation is now commonplace in fracture management using locked plates, but prior to this study had not been tested for applicability in the reverse shoulder replacement glenoid component.|$|E

30|$|In summary, hybrid {{peripheral}} {{screw fixation}} using combinations of locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws provides secure glenoid baseplate fixation using a polyurethane bone substitute model.

30|$|Twenty-eight {{polyurethane}} trabecular bone surrogates were instrumented with {{a center}} screw-type glenoid baseplate and fixated with various combinations of peripheral locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws (1 -, 2 -, 3 - and 4 -locked con). Each construct was tested through a 55 ° arc of abduction motion generating compressive and shear forces across the glenosphere. Baseplate micromotion (μm) was recorded throughout 10, 000 cycles for each model.|$|E
30|$|With {{increased}} {{cyclic loading}} of the glenosphere, there was increased micromotion {{seen at the}} baseplate−bone model interface. However, {{only one of the}} 28 tested constructs exhibited micromotion > 150 µm threshold within the 10, 000 cycles. This specimen utilized a single locked and three <b>non-locked</b> peripheral screws and did not reach this threshold until after 9500 cycles. While we noted no statistically significant differences between fixation groups, the variability in measured micromotion after 10, 000 cycles of loading was decreased with an increasing number of locked peripheral screws. Thus, these study findings suggest that (1) hybrid fixation is a reasonable option for surgeons to consider when placing peripheral screws around a central screw baseplate and that (2) maximizing the number of peripheral locked screws, when clinically feasible, may more consistently maintain baseplate fixation through the postoperative rehabilitation course. Furthermore, use of a glenosphere with a center of rotation 10  mm lateral to the glenoid can be utilized with a glenoid baseplate secured with a combination of locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws without compromising the fixation necessary for ingrowth.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} spike timing {{precision}} and dynamical behavior on error correction in spiking neurons were investigated. Stationary discharges — phase locked, quasiperiodic, or chaotic — were induced in a simulated neuron by presenting pacemaker presynaptic spike trains across {{a model of}} a prototypical inhibitory synapse.

Aftereffects of errors — in this communication, missed presynaptic spikes — were determined by comparing postsynaptic spike times between simulations identical except for {{the presence or absence of}} errors. Results show that the effects of an error vary greatly depending on the ongoing dynamical behavior. In the case of phase lockings, a high degree of presynaptic spike timing precision can provide significantly faster error recovery. For <b>non-locked</b> behaviors, isolated missed spikes can have little or no discernible aftereffects (or even serve to paradoxically reduce uncertainty in postsynaptic spike timing), regardless of presynaptic imprecision. This suggests two possible categories of error correction: high-precision locking with rapid recovery and low-precision <b>non-locked</b> with error immunity. ...|$|E

However, in a 5 -year follow-up series using the same implant with 5.0 -mm peripheral locked screws, the baseplate failure rate was reduced to 0 % [23].

It enables the user to interact with the virtual molecules, experience the interaction forces via their sense of touch, and gain insights about the docking process itself. Here we use a recently developed haptics software tool, Haptimol_RD, for the rigid docking of protein subunits to form complexes. Dimers, both homo and hetero, are loaded into the software with their subunits separated in space for the purpose of assessing whether they can be brought back into the correct docking pose via rigid-body movements. Four dimers were classified into two types: two with an interwinding subunit interface and two with a non-interwinding subunit interface. It was found that the two with an interwinding interface could not be docked whereas the two with the non-interwinding interface could be. For the two that could be docked a “sucking” effect could be felt on the haptic device when the correct binding pose was approached which is associated with a minimum in the interaction energy.

40|$|Introduction. During plate {{fixation}} of clavicular fractures the {{brachial plexus}} and subclavian vessels {{are vulnerable to}} injury beneath the clavicle. Locking plate fixation allows for mono-cortical fixation, theoretically {{reducing the risk of}} injury to these structures. Biomechanical analysis of the performance of such fixation is limited, and {{this study was designed to}} explore this further as a treatment option in clavicle fractures. Materials and methods. Fixation of fifteen simulated mid-shaft fractures was undertaken using a combination of mono-cortical locked, bicortical locked and bicortical <b>non-locked</b> plating methods in cadaveric clavicles. Samples were then tested via three-point bending to destruction, and the performance of each with respect to failure load, bending stress, bending stiffness and Young's modulus was then analysed. The influence of the number of cortices engaged and locking was also assessed. Results. Clavicles fixed with monocortical locking plates displayed a significantly lower bending stress (12 ± 1 MPa) than both the bicortical locking (28 ± 3 MPa, p = 0. 015) and non-locking specimens (24 ± 3 MPa, p = 0. 002). Engaging two cortices with the fixation produced a significant increase in failure load (291 ± 28 N vs 138 ± 48 N, p = 0. 018) and bending stress (26 ± 2 MPa vs 9. 9 ± 3. 5 MPa, p = 0. 002) compared to single cortex fixation. Discussion. The greatest influence upon the performance of the fixation was the number of cortices engaged, with bicortical fixation performing significantly better than mono-cortical. Whether or not the fixation device was a locking one did not have a significant bearing upon the performance. Conclusion. This in vitro biomechanical analysis demonstrates that mono-cortical locked plating fails at significantly lower levels of load and stress than bicortical locked and <b>non-locked</b> plating in mid-shaft fractures of the clavicle, and caution would therefore be advised in its use as a fixation modality for these injuries. </p...|$|E
30|$|Limitations of {{this study}} relate {{to the use of}} {{polyurethane}} foam. While efforts were made to simulate the clinical environment, including placement of screws within torque limits, variations in patient bone quality may have different effects on hybrid peripheral screw baseplate fixation strength. Additionally, the screws placed were all within the foam model and did not obtain bi-cortical purchase that may occur in vivo. However, even without bi-cortical purchase, all but one <b>non-locked</b> baseplate configurations were able to limit micromotion < 150  µm through 10, 000 cycles. Finally, this study represents the initial fixation obtained by the glenoid baseplate. With the limitations of postoperative rehabilitation protocols, osseous integration of the glenoid baseplate may occur well before the 10, 000 cycles tested in this study.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to achieve adequate screw fixation for plate constructs in fractures with poor quality bone or in metaphyseal bone with extensive bone loss or comminution[7][17]. Furthermore, rescuing or augmenting failed screw fixation in inadequate bone with various cement products has yielded mixed results when tested with pure axial pullout loading[20][21]. In most cases, plate/screw constructs experience both vertical (translational) and horizontal (pullout) forces during physiologic loading[17][20][21]. The increased use of locked screws in plate constructs has also changed the loading patterns of bone screws. For this study, a novel “toggle-out” testing method was developed to more realistically simulate in-vivo loading of screw-plate constructs. Our objective was to compare the fixation of locked and <b>non-locked</b> screws in simulated cancellous bone of three different densities and to determine the effectiveness of augmentation of the screw fixation using either PMMA or a resorbable Calcium Phosphate cement in both stripped and oversized screw holes. Polyurethane foam blocks of 12. 5, 20, and 30 lb/ft 3 densities representing ostoporotic, normal, and high density cancellous bone respectively (Sawbones, Pacific Research Laboratories, Vashon Island, WA) were used as the bone surrogate for this study. Holes were drilled into the blocks perpendicular to a single face for placement of screws. All screws tested were 4 mm diameter, 32, 34, or 36 mm length stainless steel cancellous bone screws (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ). The holes were either 2. 5 mm diameter pilot holes, 4. 0 mm diameter (to simulate a stripped screw hole), or 12 mm diameter (bone loss / void). In the 4 mm stripped holes and the 12 mm holes, various cements were used to augment the screw fixation. The cements used were PMMA (Simplex, Stryker) and Calcium Phosphate Cement (Trabexus, Vivorté). After placement of the screws or after the cement had set for 24 hours, the blocks were mounted on a load frame (MTS Corp) for cyclic testing. The load fixture allowed screws to be configured either as locked screws or <b>non-locked</b> screws with respect to the plate. Along with cyclic transverse loading, a constant axial pullout force of 20 N was applied to each screw during testing. Cyclic “toggle” loading was applied for 1000 cycles at each of ± 25, ± 50, ± 100, and ± 200 N, or until failure by pullout or screw breakage. The average total displacement (positive and negative combined) value for each test was recorded over the last ten load cycles. Under all conditions, the locked screws exhibited significantly less displacement than the <b>non-locked</b> screws (p screws to be set up as locked screws for half of the test conditions. Locking screws exhibited less displacement than non-locking screws across all test samples (P= 0. 00). This study therefore supports the use of a locking-style cancellous screw in poor quality bone or when cement augmentation of large holes is warranted. The behavior in stripped holes was quite interesting and erratic. The non-locking screws easily pulled out in most cases, but the locking screws were able to survive more cycles. Also, the higher density bone made cement augmentation to prevent pullout more difficult because the cement (especially CaP) does not interdigitate with the high density material. Cement augmentation of large defects and stripped holes in poor quality bone {{has the potential to be}} successful regardless of the type of cement used because locking screws were significantly more stable than non-locking screws...|$|E

30|$|We {{demonstrate}} that surgical treatment of humeral shaft fractures in the United States {{has been increasing}} over time. The reason for this rise remains unclear, as numerous studies have reported satisfactory treatment with non-operative management. Complications following ORIF also occur at a similar rate to bracing, albeit with a different profile. Nerve palsy {{is the most common}} complication, reported in up to 7 % of patients. Infection is also a common complication, affecting up to 3 % of patients [20]. Possible reasons for increased ORIF utilization include a perceived quicker return to work, earlier initiation of shoulder and elbow rehabilitation, and avoidance of brace wear during the recovery period. While fixed-angle locked plating was introduced in 2005 and has been described for comminuted humeral shaft fractures and osteoporotic bone, the mainstay of treatment remains <b>non-locked</b> plating [21, 22]. Additionally, the increase in ORIF seen over time predated the introduction of locked plating, with no upward inflexion point seen over time. As a result, {{we do not believe that}} advancements in plate technology are responsible for the increased ORIF utilization described in this study. However, the development of intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures does coincide with the timing of the increase in operative intervention [23, 24]. The increasing utilization of this technique may correlate with the observed trend.|$|E

Methods In eight pairs of human cadaveric femora, one femur per pair was randomly assigned to receive a Fence construct with either elevated or non-elevated plate, while the contralateral femur received either an LCP or LC-DCP instrumentation. Fracture gap motion and fatigue performance under cyclic loading was evaluated successively in axial compression and in torsion. Results were statistically compared in a pairwise setting. Results The elevated Fence constructs allowed significantly higher gap motion compared to the LCP instrumentations (axial compression: p ≤ 0. 011, torsion p ≤ 0. 015) but revealed similar performance under cyclic loading (p = 0. 43). The Fence instrumentation with established bone-plate contact revealed larger fracture gap motion under axial compression compared to the conventional LC-DCP osteosynthesis (p ≤ 0. 017). However, all contact Fence specimens survived the cyclic test, whereas all LC-DCP constructs failed early during torsion testing (p Conclusions Even though accentuated fracture gap motion became obvious, the "Fence" technique is considered an alternative to cost-intensive locking-head devices.

30|$|New locking plates offer {{advantages}} over conventional plates {{for the treatment}} of periprosthetic fracture associated with total knee arthroplasty. These devices provide stable fixation in osteopenic bone, are adaptable to different types of fracture and prosthesis and can be inserted using a minimally invasive approach. These plates are particularly useful in presence of an implant in proximal femur as it allows unicortical screw fixation overlapping the distal part of the proximal implant, thus avoiding a stress riser between the two implants. Biomechanical studies using paired cadaver femurs have demonstrated that fixation with locked plates is superior to that with plates with <b>non-locked</b> screws including blade plate and dynamic condylar screw [27, 28]. Clinical studies have also reported good results using locking plates {{for the treatment of}} periprosthetic supracondylar femur fractures [29 – 32]. Kregor et al. reported 100 % union rate in 13 periprosthetic fractures using locking plate; only one patient needed bone grafting [29]. Althausen et al. reported better results using less invasive stabilization system (LISS) plate in terms of maintenance of alignment and early return to preoperative functional status as compared with three other devices [30]. Raab and Davis reported their results of using locking plate in 11 fractures, which included 2 nonunions. Eight fractures were supplemented with non-structural allograft. All patients were advised limited weightbearing, and seven patients needed a brace postoperatively. They achieved union in all nine acute fractures and in one case of nonunion with satisfactory alignment [31]. Ricci et al. reported their results of treating 22 periprosthetic fractures by indirect reduction methods without bone graft using a locking plate.
