In June 2003, a Swiss {{court ruled that the}} IOC could reclaim Lazutina's silver medal for a positive test for darbepoetin, promoting Scott to silver and Kateřina Neumannová to bronze. The CAS then ruled in December that Danilova's medal could also be retrieved for her failed darbepoetin test, leading to another change in the event standings. Scott and Neumannová were both promoted again, with Viola Bauer <b>now</b> <b>getting</b> the bronze.|$|E

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review of the episode, [...] "Some {{sluggish}} stories took better turns this week – albeit sometimes by just ending things for now – while a book character many thought would never appear on the series made a notable splash, answering a big mystery that the novels hadn’t even revealed yet in the process. There were some great moments in [...] "Blood of My Blood", but mostly the big returns {{made it possible to}} salivate for the payoffs (and possible characters) to come." [...] He also continued by noting, [...] "this installment probably speaks, more than any other episode so far this season, to the accelerated rate of payoffs we're <b>now</b> <b>getting</b> that the show isn't directly following the books." [...] Fowler gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10. Laura Prudom of Variety also praised the pacing of the episode as well as the season's payoffs, writing [...] "There's a clarity of purpose in Season 6 that certainly gives the impression that we're barreling towards a conclusion instead of just meandering through Dorne or killing time in Qarth." ...|$|E

[...] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5, and mentioned, [...] "Debut director Karan Malhotra shows great promise in making the film visually arresting and maintaining the consistency of performances. But remaking a cult film means you have big shoes to fill. If you’re a loyalist of the late Mukul Anand’s Agneepath, you’re likely to have reservations with this one. But if you leave the comparisons aside and are willing to forgive the faults, Agneepath is worth a watch essentially to savor Hrithik’s performance." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave Agneepath 3 out of 5 and said, [...] "It is in the end, an old-fashioned revenge drama treated in that melodramatic, over-the-top style.

On , Howard's force arrived off Brest only to see a small enemy force join with the larger force in the safety of Brest harbour and its fortifications. The French had recently been reinforced by a force of galleys from the Mediterranean, which sank one English ship and seriously damaged another. Howard landed forces near Brest, but made no headway against the town and was by <b>now</b> <b>getting</b> low on supplies. Attempting to force a victory, he took a small force of small oared vessels on a daring frontal attack on the French galleys on [...] Howard himself managed to reach the ship of French admiral, Prégent de Bidoux, and led a small party to board it. The French fought back fiercely and cut the cables that attached the two ships, separating Howard from his men. It left him at the mercy of the soldiers aboard the galley, who instantly killed him.|$|E

[...] By <b>now</b> <b>getting</b> some boos from the crowd, guitarist Van Zandt, who had hoped Springsteen would stop making the mistake on his own, finally went over to Springsteen and corrected him: [...] "‘You don’t realize it, but you’re saying Ohio and we’re in Michigan.’ He was like ‘What!?’" [...] Springsteen then told the crowd that he had committed [...] "every front man's nightmare," [...] and {{made a show of}} saying [...] "Michigan" [...] from then on.

He attempts to subvert the Doctor, without success. Meanwhile, Sarah Jane and Rose, <b>now</b> <b>getting</b> on better than at their first meeting, try to unlock the programming on the school's computers; Mickey and K9 remain in Sarah Jane's car for surveillance.

As the paradigm is nearly solved, which would allow the Krillitanes full control over time and space, they seal the school. Mr. Finch propositions the Doctor a second time, tempting him with the ability to save the Time Lords and override human mortality. With Sarah Jane's counseling, the Doctor refuses, and they run from Mr. Finch. After Kenny (a student who had not eaten the chips) alerts Mickey to the students' plight, Mickey crashes Sarah Jane's car through the school's doors and unplugs the computers, allowing the children to flee. The Doctor leads the Krillitanes to the kitchen. [...] Upon their arrival, K9 detonates the chip oil container, saturating the Krillitanes.

2500|$|Burke did {{not long}} survive the morning as Tyson moved a ball {{back up the}} hill to flatten his stumps. Graeme Hole had a high backlift and failed to get his bat down in time to trap a yorker and was clean bowled by Tyson at 77/4. Hutton now rested his fast bowlers and brought on Trevor Bailey and Bob Appleyard to slow down the scoring and tie up the batsman. Richie Benaud was not a patient batsman and took a swipe at [...] "Applecart" [...] which he hit sky high to Tyson in the deep, who only managed to snatch it inches above the grass to have Australia 102/5. Neil Harvey was <b>now</b> <b>getting</b> into his stride and in what many {{observers}} thought was the greatest innings of his life, he counter-attacked the bowling, cutting short balls and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side and once hooking Tyson over fine leg's head for four. By lunch he and Ron Archer had taken the score to 118/5 and as long has Harvey was in the Australians thought they could win. After the interval Tyson and Statham were brought back on, with immediate results as Tyson felled Archer's stumps with another fast ball. Alan Davidson lasted only 6 balls before he was caught by the wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans off Statham. Statham was phenomenally accurate, conceding only 45 runs off 19 eight-ball overs. Tyson bled runs at double that rate, as Tom Graveney recalled [...] "I was fielding in the slips and we were having to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots". Ray Lindwall came in fearing the bouncer, and it was his undoing as he turned a Tyson half-volley into a yorker by playing off the back foot and was bowled.|$|E
2500|$|Ford was legendary for his {{discipline}} and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; {{he was also}} infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive {{the full force of}} his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a [...] "big idiot" [...] and even punched Henry Fonda. Henry Brandon (who played Chief Scar from The Searchers) once referred to Ford as [...] "the only man who could make John Wayne cry"[...] He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: [...] "D'ya known, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things that I could get any child off the street to do better?". Stock Company veteran Ward Bond was reportedly one of the few actors who were impervious to Ford's taunting and sarcasms. Sir Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios when he starred in Mogambo, was not the only person to suffer at the hands of John Ford's notorious behaviour. He recalls [...] "Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them was Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally—sometimes very sadistically. In Ford's eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled {{out in front of the}} entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford's brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford's grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was <b>now</b> <b>getting</b> his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight." [...] "We now had to return to the MGM-British Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day's work, I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK. He was as good as his word—for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour." ...|$|E
