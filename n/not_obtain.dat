The squad sent to the Tour de l'Ain was more successful. Chris Horner obtained the race lead after the individual time trial in stage 3B, which was won by Alexander Vinokourov riding for the Kazakh national team. Though Horner fell to second behind Tour de l'Ain champion Rein Taaramäe the next day as the race concluded, he did win the points classification.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate they could <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains {{were separated by}} time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E

5|$|San Martín {{requested}} {{help from}} British Admiral William Bowles. He wrote from Chile {{and expected to}} find him in Buenos Aires, but Bowles had embarked for Río de Janeiro. Bowles considered that San Martín was more trustworthy than Alvear, and praised his monarchism. San Martín did <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> the ships and interrupted the correspondence with Bowles for some months. He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in Buenos Aires with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either Buenos Aires or foreign powers, San Martín promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.|$|E

5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E
5|$|Considered one of {{the preeminent}} figures of the classic horror film, the vampire {{has proven to be}} a rich subject for the film and gaming industries. Dracula is a major {{character}} in more films than any other but Sherlock Holmes, and many early films were either based on the novel Dracula or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 German silent film Nosferatu, directed by F. W. Murnau and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic Draculas, Murnau could <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> permission to do so from Stoker's widow, and had to alter many aspects of the film. Universal's Dracula (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count, was the first talking film to portray Dracula. The decade saw several more vampire films, most notably Dracula's Daughter in 1936.|$|E

Two weeks later, Odex installed an online warning system developed by BayTSP that generated cease and desist emails intended for the alleged downloaders. The company did <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> subscribers' information directly from ISPs, but relied on ISPs to forward such emails to their subscribers. Sing vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP to continue its anti-piracy drive, and that it would again resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably.|$|E

5|$|The team {{entered the}} Clásica de San Sebastián in August, with Contador in 26th their highest-placed finisher. Contador, like many riders in the event, rode it as {{preparation}} for the road cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games. Astana also took part in Vattenfall Cyclassics, the Coppa Sabatini, Paris–Bourges, the Giro dell'Emilia, the Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli, Milano–Torino, and the Giro del Piemonte in September and October, but did <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> a place higher than 11th (by Janez Brajkovič in the Giro dell'Emilia). In August, Leipheimer and Contador took the top two spots in the Clásica a los Puertos de Guadarrama, a race they rode as {{preparation for the}} Vuelta a España.|$|E

5|$|These {{simulations}} {{showed the}} basic idea of how a single large planet can shepherd the smaller extreme trans-Neptunian objects into similar types of orbits. It was a basic proof of concept simulation that did <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> a unique orbit for the planet as they state there are many possible orbital configurations the planet could have. Thus they did not fully formulate a model that successfully incorporated all the clustering of the extreme objects with an orbit for the planet. But {{they were the first}} to notice there was a clustering in the orbits of extremely distant objects and that the most likely reason was from an unknown massive distant planet. Their work is very similar to how Alexis Bouvard noticed Uranus' motion was peculiar and suggested that it was likely gravitational forces from an unknown 8th planet, which led to the discovery of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany instead of buying from Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, Hay ordered Colonel George E. Newman—commander of the 1st Brigade—to {{place the}} 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, in the {{northern}} portion of Long Nguyen. On the next day, Colonel Frank E. Blazey, commander of the 3rd Brigade, was ordered to deploy the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment to the southern half of the area. In {{the early stages of}} Shenandoah II, U.S. forces only made a few contacts with the Viet Cong. On October 2, a South Vietnamese unit operating east of Highway 13 near Chon Thanh made significant contact with a large Viet Cong formation and absorbed heavy casualties. Enemy documents obtained by the South Vietnamese indicated they had clashed with a battalion-sized unit from the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment, sent to attack Chon Thanh in order to cover the movement of the 271st Regiment into the Long Nguyen area. Early in October, Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment had arrived in Long Nguyen but they could <b>not</b> <b>obtain</b> their much-needed food supplies, as a result of allied search-and-destroy operations which had created significant food shortages for Viet Cong units in the region.|$|E
