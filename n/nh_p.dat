50|$|The Chippewa {{language}} has three short vowels (a i o) and four long vowels (aa e ii oo). There are also nasal vowels which {{consist of a}} basic vowel followed by “nh”. The “h” may be omitted before a “y” or a glottal stop. Nasalized vowels are vowels before “ns”, “nz”, or “nzh”. Consonants are comparable to their English counterparts and are written: b ch d g h ’ j k l n <b>nh</b> <b>p</b> r s sh t w y z zh. Letters not used in Chippewa are f l r u v and x, letter c is used only as a digraph, and letter h usually exists as a digraph, but on very rare occasions usually in exclamations, do exist independently. Letters l, f, and r only occur in words loaned from other languages. There are certain consonant clusters that occur in Chippewa: sk, shp, sht, shk, mb, nd, nj, ng. A consonant cluster also may occur with a single consonant followed by a “w” before a vowel. Most letters are pronounced similarly to how they are pronounced in English. Letters b, d, and g are often devoiced when placed near voiceless consonants or {{at the beginning of}} words. Sometimes s, t, and ch are pronounced with more force than how pronounced in English and also with a rounding of the lips. The Chippewa language uses voiced and voiceless stops, fricatives, affricates, nasal stops, and approximates. It also uses labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, and glottal consonant places.|$|E

The possible role of guanine nucleotides in this reaction {{has now been}} examined with human material. Fat cell ghosts were prepared from subcutaneous fat obtained from patients undergoing elective surgery. Adenylate cyclase was assayed with [alpha- 32 P]ATP as substrate. Fluoride ion stimulated the enzyme 8. 3 -fold relative to basal levels, but epinephrine activation of cyclase was not statistically significant. GTP did not allow expression of an epinephrine effect. However, {{the addition of the}} GTP analogue, 5 '-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate [GMP-P(NH) P], along with epinephrine produced 5. 7 -fold activation of the enzyme (P less than 0. 001). GMP-P(NH) P alone was without stimulatory effect. Comparable augmentation by GMP-P (<b>NH)</b> <b>P</b> of adenylate cyclase activity was seen with isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Propranolol blocked catecholamine-GMP-P (<b>NH)</b> <b>P</b> stimulation of the enzyme, suggesting that the nucleotide-dependent activation of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase is mediated by beta-receptors.

We investigated various cell responses, such as chemiluminescence by PMN, platelet aggregation {{and the release}} of lipid mediators [i. e. leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) and its omega-oxidation products from neutrophils and 12 -hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12 -HETE) from platelets]. As a marker of G protein involvement, the binding of [3 H]guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp (<b>NH)</b> <b>p)</b> to the membrane fractions of stimulated cells was determined. PMN pre-stimulated with FMLP showed a synergistically enhanced generation of leukotrienes returning to control values with the time of preincubation. Platelets preliminary treated with thrombin followed by incubation with NaF resulted in a sub-additive and time-independent mediator generation. Neither chemiluminescence by PMN nor platelet aggregation showed a similar pattern compared to the mediator release: PMN preincubated with FMLP followed by NaF resulted in a second chemiluminescence response; the aggregation of platelets which were preincubated with thrombin was partially inhibited by the addition of NaF. Membrane fractions isolated from FMLP-pre-stimulated neutrophils showed a pattern in [3 H]Gpp (NH) p-binding capacity that was comparable to the respective leukotriene release. With thrombin-prestimulated platelets, no similarities between Gpp (<b>NH)</b> <b>p</b> binding, aggregation or 12 -HETE generation were observed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare growth and carcass traits of 1, 252 progeny of six commercially available dam lines included in the National Pork Producers Council Maternal Line Evaluation Project. Lines compared included one maternal line supplied by each of American Diamond Swine Genetics (ADSG), Danbred NA (DB), two lines supplied by Monsanto Choice Genetics (DK and GPK 347), Newsham Hybrids (NH), and Landrace × Large White females supplied by the National Swine Registry (NSR). All females were mated to DB, Duroc-Hampshire terminal sires. Traits analyzed were ADG from 56 to 115 kg live weight, days to 115 kg, backfat thickness measured at the 10 th rib, carcass length, dressing percent, and 10 thrib LM area. Carcass traits were adjusted to a carcass weight of 85 kg. The statistical model included fixed effects of maternal line, sex, farrowing group, and finishing unit (farm). All two-way interactions among main effects were tested and removed from final models because they were not significant. In addition, because they were not significant, effects of farm and farrowing group were removed from models for carcass length and 10 th-rib backfat thickness, and farm was removed from the model for LM area. Least squares means for ADG ranged from 0. 74 to 0. 79 kg/d. The GPK 347 line had lower ADG and greater days to 115 kg than all other lines (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The ADSG (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and <b>NH</b> (<b>P</b> 3 ̆c 0. 01) progeny had lower ADG than DK progeny. The DK line had the fewest days to 115 kg (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Progeny for the DB and NH lines had the least 10 th-rib backfat, differing from ADSG, DK, and GPK 347 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Pigs from DB females had the greatest dressing percent, differing from ADSG, DK, GPK 347, and <b>NH</b> (<b>P</b> 3 ̆c 0. 05).

This equilibrium simulation is performed in an (M, <b>NH,</b> <b>p,</b> T) statistical ensemble where the number of lattice sites M {{and the number of}} hydrogen particles NH are constants. The number of metal particles can fluctuate to accommodate the creation of vacancy hydrogen complexes VHn according to the fixed chemical potential of the metal.

At CH= 1 % and room temperature, we show that the VHn complexes cluster in the form of chains, lying in the directions. The probability of finding large clusters is high enough to further consider their implication in hydrogen damaging. The formation of superabundant vacancies in metal-hydrogen systems was discovered by Fukai during high temperature, high H 2 pressure experiments [1, 2].

In dispersed rat pancreatic acini, forskolin increased cyclic AMP levels 26 -fold and potentiated the increase induced by secretin, VIP, and CCK- 8. It also stimulated the phosphorylation of three particulate proteins (Mr = 21 K, 25 K and 33 K). In terms of secretion, it raised amylase secretion by 60 %, a weak effect comparable to that exerted by VIP but much lower than that of secretin or CCK- 8.

40|$|Secondary enzyme-substrate {{contacts}} in the hydrolysis of ester substrates by the cysteine protease papain were investigated by systematically altering backbone hydrogen bonding and side chain hydrophobic {{contacts in}} the substrate and determining each substrate's k cat/K M. k cat/K M, the second order rate constant, directly reflects the equilibrium of free enzyme plus free substrate to the enzyme-substrate transition state. The incremental binding energies of the substrate backbone hydrogen bonds are estimated at - 2. 3 kcal/mol for the P 2 NH, - 2. 2 kcal/mol for the P 1 NH, and - 2. 3 kcal/mol for the P 2 ' NH. The observed hydrogen bonding energy for the substrate backbone P 1 ' C=O is - 1. 0 kcal/mol. The incremental binding energy of the Phe side chain in the P 2 position is estimated at - 4. 0 kcal/mol. The contacts on the acyl side of the scissile bond (the P 2 <b>NH,</b> <b>P</b> 2 Phe side chain and P 1 NH) display a strong interdependence of binding energies that is characteristic of enzyme-substrate interactions. This interdependence arises largely from the entropic cost of forming the rate-determining enzyme-substrate transition state. As favourable contacts are added successively to a substrate, the entropic penalty associated with each decreases and the binding energy expressed approaches the incremental binding energy. On the leaving group side, the observed - 1. 0 kcal/mol for the P 1 ' C=O probably underestimates the incremental binding energy whilst the - 2. 3 kcal/mol for the P 2 ' NH is a reasonable estimate.

Carbon dioxide production decreased in late May as soils became saturated during snowmelt. Soil inorganic N concentrations increased before snowmelt, peaking between 101 and 276 mg kg- ' soil in May, and then decreasing as soils became saturated with melt water. Net N mineralization for the period of March 3 to May 4 ranged from 2. 23 to 6. 63 g N m-', and were a proximately two orders of magnitude greater than snowmelt inputs of 50. 4 mg N m- 2 for <b>NH,</b> <b>P</b> and 97. 2 mg N m- ' for NO,.

Adaptive {{control and}} {{fingertip}} force synchronization of precise grasp stability during unimanual manipulation of small objects represents an illustrative example of highly fractionated movements that are foundation of fine motor control. It {{is assumed that}} this process is controlled by several motor areas of the frontal lobe, particularly applicable to the primary motor (M- 1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Aiming to examine the role of PMd during fine coordination of fingertip forces we applied theta burst repetitive magnetic stimulation (TBS) to disrupt neural processing in that cortical area. Methods. Using a single-blind, randomized, crossover design, 10 healthy subjects (29 ± 3. 9 years) received single sessions of continuous TBS (cTBS 600), intermittent TBS (iTBS 600), or sham stimulation, separate from one another at least one week, over the PMd region of dominant hemisphere. Precision grasp and lift were assessed by instrumented device, recording grip (G) and load (L) forces, during three manipulation tasks (ramp-and-hold, oscillation force producing and simple lifting tasks), with each hand separately, before and after interventions. Results. We observed the improvement of task performance related to constant error (CE) in oscillation task with the dominant hand (DH) after the iTBS (p = 0. 009). On the contrary, the cTBS reduced variable error (VE) for non-dominant hand (<b>NH),</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 005. Considering force coordination we found that iTBS worsened variables for NH (G/L ratio, p = 0. 017; cross-correlation of the G and L, p = 0. 047; Gain, p = 0. 047). Conclusion. These results demonstrate the ability of TBS to modulate fingertip forces during precision grasping and lifting, when applied over PMd. These findings support the role of PMd in human motor control and forces generation required to hold small objects stable in our hands...|$|E

Real time feedback control of (at 95 % of the stability boundary), optimizing the plasma shape (e. g.,, divertor strike and X points, double/single null balance) and particle control (ne=nGW 0 : 3, Ze < 2 : 0) were necessary for the long pulse results.

We find that simulations of NH 3 driven with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) emission inventory are qualitatively and spatially consistent with TES satellite observations, with a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 64. However, the surface observations at Bakersfield indicate a diurnal cycle in the model bias, with CMAQ overestimating surface NH 3 at night and underestimating it during the day. The surface, satellite, and aircraft observations all suggest that daytime NH 3 emissions in the CARB inventory are underestimated by at least a factor of 2, while the nighttime overestimate of NH 3 (g) is likely due {{to a combination of}} overestimated NH 3 emissions and underestimated deposition. Running CMAQ v 5. 0. 2 with the bi-directional NH 3 scheme reduces NH 3 concentrations at night and increases them during the day. This reduces the model bias when compared to the surface and satellite observations, but the increased concentrations aloft significantly increase the bias relative to the aircraft observations. We attempt to further reduce model bias by using the surface observations at Bakersfield to derive an empirical diurnal cycle of NH 3 emissions in the SJV, in which nighttime and midday emissions differ by about a factor of 4. 5. Running CMAQv 5. 0. 2 with a bi-directional NH 3 scheme together with this emissions diurnal profile further reduces model bias relative to the surface observations. Comparison of these simulations with the vertical profile retrieved by TES shows little bias except for the lowest retrieved level, but the model bias relative to flight data aloft increases slightly. Our results indicate that both diurnally varying emissions and a bi-directional NH 3 scheme should be applied when modeling NH 3 (g) and <b>NH</b> 4 (<b>p)</b> in this region. The remaining model errors suggest that the bi-directional NH 3 scheme in CMAQ v 5. 0. 2 needs further improvements to shift the peak NH 3 land–atmosphere flux to earlier in the day. We recommend that future work include updates to the current CARB NH 3 inventory to account for NH 3 from fertilizer application, livestock, and other farming practices separately; adding revised information on crop management practices specific to the SJV region to the bi-directional NH 3 scheme; and top-down studies focused on determining the diurnally varying biases in the canopy compensation point that determines the net land–atmosphere NH 3 fluxes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compare individual hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) changes following a live high-train low (LHTL) altitude training camp under either normobaric hypoxia (NH) or hypobaric hypoxia (HH) conditions in endurance athletes. In a crossover design with a one-year washout, 15 male triathletes randomly performed two 18 -day LHTL training camps in either HH or NH. All athletes slept at 2, 250 meters and trained at altitudes < 1, 200 meters. Hbmass was measured in duplicate with the optimized carbon monoxide rebreathing method before (pre) and immediately after (post) each 18 -day training camp. Hbmass increased similarly in HH (916 - 957 g, 4. 5 ± 2. 2 %, P < 0. 001) and in NH (918 - 953 g, 3. 8 ± 2. 6 %, P < 0. 001). Hbmass changes did not differ between HH and <b>NH</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 42). There was substantial interindividual variability among subjects to both interventions (i. e., individual responsiveness or the individual variation in the response to an intervention free of technical noise) : 0. 9 % in HH and 1. 7 % in NH. However, a correlation between intraindividual ΔHbmass changes (%) in HH and in NH (r = 0. 52, P = 0. 048) was observed. HH and NH evoked similar mean Hbmass increases following LHTL. Among the mean Hbmass changes, there was a notable variation in individual Hbmass response that tended to be reproducible. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to compare individual hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) response to normobaric and hypobaric live high-train low using a same-subject crossover design. The main findings indicate that hypobaric and normobaric hypoxia evoked a similar mean increase in Hbmass following 18 days of live high-train low. Notable variability and reproducibility in individual Hbmass responses between athletes was observed, indicating the importance of evaluating individual Hbmass response to altitude training...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Slight {{differences}} in physiological responses and nitric oxide (NO) {{have been reported}} at rest between hypobaric hypoxia (HH) and normobaric hypoxia (NH) during short exposure. Our study reports NO and oxidative stress at rest and physiological responses during moderate exercise in HH versus NH. METHODS: Ten subjects were randomly exposed for 24 h to HH (3000 m; FIO 2, 20. 9 %; BP, 530 ± 6 mm Hg) or to NH (FIO 2, 14. 7 %; BP, 720 ± 1 mm Hg). Before and every 8 h during the hypoxic exposures, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2), HR, and gas exchanges were measured during a 6 -min submaximal cycling exercise. At rest, the partial pressure of exhaled NO, blood nitrate and nitrite (NOx), plasma levels of oxidative stress, and pH levels were additionally measured. RESULTS: During exercise, minute ventilation was lower in HH compared with NH (- 13 % after 8 h, P < 0. 05). End-tidal CO 2 pressure was lower (P < 0. 01) than PRE both in HH and NH but decreased less in HH than that in NH (- 25 % vs - 37 %, P < 0. 05). At rest, exhaled NO and NOx decreased in HH (- 46 % and - 36 % after 24 h, respectively, P < 0. 05) whereas stable in NH. By contrast, oxidative stress was higher in HH than that in NH after 24 h (P < 0. 05). The plasma pH level was stable in HH but increased in <b>NH</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 01). When compared with prenormoxic values, SpO 2, HR, oxygen consumption, breathing frequency, and end-tidal O 2 pressure showed similar changes in HH and NH. CONCLUSION: Lower ventilatory responses to a similar hypoxic stimulus during rest and exercise in HH versus NH were sustained for 24 h and associated with lower plasma pH level, exaggerated oxidative stress, and impaired NO bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{has been}} explored that decreases of adenylate cyclase may explain diminished hormone sensitivity of adipose tissue with aging. Isolated cells were prepared from epididymal fat pads of rats 1 -, 2 -, 6 -, 12 -, and 24 -mo old, fixed in OSO 4, and sized and counted with a Coulter apparatus. Adenylate cyclase was assayed in cell membranes (ghosts) using [alpha- 32 P] ATP as substrate and expressed as cyclic [32 P] AMP/ 10 min per mg protein or per 10 (6) cells. Enzyme activity was determined for the basal state {{and in the}} presence of varying concentrations of glucagon, ACTH, epinephrine, and fluoride. Basal activity per cell increased in threefold between 1 and 2 mo with a comparable increase in cell surface area, suggesting synthesis of enzyme along with new cell membrane. Although epinephrine stimulated adenylate cyclase 8 -fold and fluoride 12 -fold throughout the life-span of the rat, stimulated activity paralleled basal levels, decreasing 60 % between 2 and 24 mo per mg protein and 40 % between 6 and 24 mo per cell. Glucagon stimulated adenylate cyclase 4. 5 -fold relative to basal in the 1 -mo-old rat, but its effect then rapidly decreased and was absent by 12 mo. The fourfold stimulation by ACTH noted in the 1 -mo-old animals decreased gradually with age but was still twice basal at 24 mo. Since no significant change of cell size occurred after 6 mo, diminished hormone sensitivity with senescence cannot be related to cell size. Similar age-related patterns of hormonal activation were evoked by 5 '-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate [GMP-P(NH) P], a nucleotide analogue which increased both basal- and hormone-activated enzyme at all ages studied. Dose-response curves to hormones, fluoride, and GMP-P (<b>NH)</b> <b>P</b> were not affected by age. High Mg++ (50 mM) {{in the presence of}} GMP-P-(NH) P stimulated adenylate cyclase to levels greater than with fluoride, but a similar loss of activity with aging was still observed. Loss of hormone receptors may partially explain the age-related decreases of glucagon and ACTH-sensitive adenylate cyclase, but decreased basal-, epinephrine-, fluoride-, and GMP-P-(NH) P-stimulated responses suggest loss of the catalytic component of the adenylate cyclase enzyme complex in the aging fat cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of various nutrients on arsenic (As) removal by arsenic hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata L. in a Hoagland nutrient solution (HNS). The treatments included different concentrations of Ca and K in 20 % strength of HNS, different strengths of HNS (10, 20 and 30 %), different strengths of HNS (10 and 20 %) with and without CaCO 3, and different concentrations of Ca, K, NO 3, <b>NH</b> 4, and <b>P</b> in 20 % strength of HNS. The plants were grown in nutrient solution containing 1 mg As L− 1 for 4 weeks except the Ca/K experiment where the plants were grown in nutrient solution containing 10 or 50 mg As L− 1 for 1 week. Adding up to 4 mM Ca or 3 mM K to 20 % strength HNS significantly (P < 0. 05) increased plant arsenic accumulation when the solution contained 10 mg As L− 1. Plant arsenic removal was reduced with increasing Ca and K concentrations at 50 mg As L− 1. Lower strength of HNS (10 %) resulted in the greatest plant arsenic removal (79 %) due to lower competition of P with As for plant uptake. Addition of CaCO 3 to 20 % strength of HNS significantly increased arsenic removal by P. vittata. Among the nutrients tested, NO 3 and CaCO 3 were beneficial to plant arsenic removal while <b>NH</b> 4, <b>P</b> and Cl had adverse effects. This experiment demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to optimize plant arsenic removal by adjusting nutrients in the growth medium. Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the instantaneous vs. integrated effects of waste on the water quality of the Chorobamba River. I sampled 9 stations upstream and downstream of the Town of Oxapampa, Peru during the dry season (June-August) of 2004. I measured in-situ parameters such as pH, DO, temperature, etc. as well as vegetation, riverbank erosion, nutrients (N 03, <b>NH</b> 4, <b>P</b> 04), coliform bacteria and macroinvertebrate communities to determine the current conditions of the river, as well as the integrated effects of pollution. Although water quality conditions remained stable, high fecal coliform concentrations and macroinvertebrate communities indicate deterioration in river health over a longer period of time. If riparian areas along the Chorobamba continue to decrease and if inputs of sewage into the rivers continue to increase, as a function of population, then, conditions will continue to deteriorate in the coming years...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was {{preparation}} of makrocyclic ligand based on 1, 4, 8, 11 - tetraazacyklotetradecane skeleton, which is suitable for selective complexation of divalent copper. Cyclam macrocycle bears one weakly coordinating aminobenzylphospinate pendant arm (compound L). During the synthesis was the skeleton asymmetrically protected in positions 1, 4 and 8. Attachment of phospinate pendant arm was tried with the corresponding Mannich reaction of ethyl or bis(trimethylsilyl) esters 4 -nitrobenzylphosphinic acid and alkylation using mesyl ester derived from hydroxomethyl(4 -nitrobenzyl) phosphinic acid (benzyl O- methylsulfonylhydroxymethyl(4 -nitrobenzyl) phosphinate). In the frame of this work the synthesis of the targeted product was developed. Reproducibility was also verified for synthesis of cyclam and its asymmetrical protection in three positions. Furthermore, {{a study of the}} kinetics of de-protection of cyclam skeleton and pendant arm using basic and acid hydrolysis was done.
