25|$|Today 45 {{countries}} around the world recognize the legitimacy of the Polisario over Western Sahara. Support for the Polisario Front came mostly from newly independent African states, such as Angola and Namibia. Most of the Arab world had supported Morocco; only Algeria and Libya have, at different times, given any significant support to Polisario. Iran recognized the SADR in 1980, Mauritania had recognized the SADR in 1984, and Syria and South Yemen had supported the Polisario position on the conflict when they were all members of the Front of Refusal. Additionally, many third world <b>non-aligned</b> <b>countries</b> have supported the Polisario Front. Ties with Fretilin of East Timor (occupied by Indonesia in 1975) were exceptionally strong and remain so after that country's independence; both Polisario and Fretilin have argued that there are numerous historical parallels between the two conflicts.|$|E

50|$|The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) was {{a socialist}} country {{that existed in}} the second half of the 20th century.

However, since it was a <b>non-aligned</b> <b>country,</b> it had no ties to the Soviet Bloc either. One of the major ideas contributing to the development of any technology in SFRY was the apparent need to be independent of foreign suppliers for spare parts, fueling domestic computer development.|$|R

2500|$|Amid the Sino-Soviet {{split and}} Vietnam War, American President Nixon entered into {{negotiations}} with Communist Chairman Mao, initially through a secret 1971 trip undertaken by Henry Kissinger to visit Zhou Enlai. On October 25, 1971, Albania's motion {{to recognize the}} People's Republic of China as the sole legal China was passed as General Assembly Resolution 2758. It was supported {{by most of the}} communist states (including the Soviet Union) and <b>non-aligned</b> <b>countries</b> (such as India), but also by some American allies such as the United Kingdom and France. Nixon then personally visited China the next year, beginning the normalization of Sino-American relations. Since that time, the Republic of China has softened its own One-China Policy and sought international recognition. These moves have been opposed and mostly blocked by the People's Republic of China, forcing the Republic of China to join international organizations under other names.

2500|$|On 23 June 2008, IAEA {{inspectors}} {{were allowed}} to visit the Dair Alzour site (also referred to as Al Kibar), and take samples of the debris.

Some American nuclear experts have speculated about similarities between the alleged Syrian reactor and North Korea's Yongybon reactor but IAEA Director General ElBaradei has pointed out that [...] "there was uranium but it doesn't mean there was a reactor". ElBaradei has shown dissatisfaction with the United States and Israel for only providing the IAEA with photos of the bombed facility in Syria, and has also urged caution against prematurely judging Syria's atomic program by reminding diplomats about false U.S. claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Russia, China, Iran, and <b>non-aligned</b> <b>countries</b> have also supported giving Syria nuclear guidance despite pressure from the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The Comoros has {{repeatedly}} pressed {{its claim to}} Mayotte before the United Nations General Assembly, which adopted a series of resolutions under the caption [...] "Question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte", opining that Mayotte belongs to the Comoros under the principle that the territorial integrity of colonial territories should be preserved upon independence. As a practical matter, however, these resolutions have little effect {{and there is no}} foreseeable likelihood that Mayotte will become de facto part of the Comoros without its people's consent. More recently, the Assembly has maintained this item on its agenda but deferred it from year to year without taking action. Other bodies, including the Organization of African Unity, the Movement of <b>Non-Aligned</b> <b>Countries</b> and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, have similarly questioned French sovereignty over Mayotte. To close the debate and to avoid being integrated by force in the Union of the Comoros, the population of Mayotte overwhelmingly chose to become an overseas department and a region of France in a 2009 referendum. The new status was effective on 31 March 2011 and Mayotte has been recognised as an outermost region by European Union on 1 January 2014. This decision integrates Mayotte in the French Republic legally « one and indivisible ».|$|E

50|$|It is {{historically}} {{understood that the}} USSR did intercept the Apollo missions telemetry on {{the territory of the}} USSR, but until 2005, no source in the former USSR military or intelligence services has come forth with any evidence of this happening. The USSR used different frequency bands for its own space missions, so by default its deep space network did not readily have equipment able to receive Apollo telemetry. Whether China or any other non-Western (or <b>non-aligned)</b> <b>country</b> at the time chose to intercept any of the Apollo telemetry is unclear. Amateur radio and affiliated telecommunications sector persons could listen to the Apollo telemetry the world over—provided they could afford the reception equipment.|$|R
40|$|Although a {{formally}} <b>non-aligned</b> <b>country</b> {{with strong}} economic and security {{links to the}} Western powers, Sweden nevertheless developed an expansive national intelligence system during the Cold War. After the tumultuous shift of European security policy between 1989 - 91, Sweden realized immediate benefits {{in the area of}} national security; it went from the exposed position of a front-line state in the Baltic to an embedded position behind a new Cordon Sanitaire to the east. As other small European countries, Sweden in the 1990 s was thus faced with the task of aligning its national intelligence system with new international premises and a broadened, but largely unknown, future security agenda. The attempts to reform its system offer insights into the process involved in changing intelligence agendas and institutions, and into the problems facing national intelligence policy caused by globalization and European integration...|$|R

50|$|Swedish {{neutrality}} {{refers to}} Sweden's policy of neutrality in armed conflicts, {{which has been}} in effect since the early 19th century. The policy originated {{largely as a result of}} Sweden's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars during which over a third of the country's territory was lost, including the traumatic loss of Finland to Russia. Resentment towards the old king precipitated a coup d'état and the new regime formulated a new foreign policy which became known as The Policy of 1812. Since the time of the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden has not initiated any direct armed combat. However, Sweden's military and government have been involved in major peacekeeping actions and other military support functions around the world. The accession to the European Union in 1995 meant that neutrality as a principle was abolished.

5000|$|Kozak wrote several {{plays on}} the issue of revolution, revolutionary terror, and the {{relation}} between power and personal integrity. The themes of his plays were all highly controversial for the communist regime. To avoid direct confrontation, Kozak set them in foreign and distant countries, such as Cuba or in countries of the Soviet bloc. Since Yugoslavia was a <b>non-aligned</b> <b>country</b> at the time, criticism of Stalinism or other [...] "deviant" [...] forms of socialism was generally permitted. His best-known play is [...] "The Affair" [...] (Afera), set during the anti-Fascist resistance in Northern Italy, but in fact a metaphorical account of the trial against the dissident Jože Pučnik.

40|$|According to the {{analysis}} presented in the article, the main threat to Finnish security is no more a conflict between the great powers, into which Finland would be drawn, but rather geopolitical spillover from a crisis in Russian-Baltic relations. Weighing {{the pros and cons}} of Finnish (and Swedish) Nato-membership in this context, the author concludes that Finland’s and Sweden’s Nato-membership would be in their national interest since it would enhance the security of the Baltic states without threatening Russia, thus contributing to the stability of the whole Baltic Sea region. Finland’s current security policy is based on a janus-faced doctrine. On the one hand, Finnish politicians and government officials regularly stress the positive contribution that Finnish EUmembership and “cooperation within Nato’s new structures ” has made to Finnish security. On the other hand, Finnish authorities continue to insist that Finland is a “militarily <b>non-aligned</b> <b>country</b> ” with an “independent defence capability”. i The same contradictory elements can also be found in the realm of deeds: at the same time as Finland maintains her independent defence capability and relies on the traditional strategy of territorial defence, she openly promotes a stronger EU and has taken concrete steps towards ensuring interoperability wit...|$|R
