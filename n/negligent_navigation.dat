2500|$|On 2 March 1802, as she sailed off Ceylon, she grounded, {{having been}} unable to turn quickly enough once {{breakers}} were sighted. She had to be abandoned as a wreck after 16 hours of efforts to lighten her. She had run into a shoal off Mullaitivu due to <b>negligent</b> <b>navigation.</b> (Earlier [...] had warned Sauce that his reckoning was off by 40 miles.) The subsequent court martial severely reprimanded Sauce and moved his name {{to the bottom of}} the list of Commanders. The court martial also dismissed the service the master, James O'Conner.|$|E
50|$|A {{court of}} enquiry into the sinking began at Auckland on 28 November and lasted about two months. Captain Atwood {{was found guilty of}} grossly <b>negligent</b> <b>navigation</b> (and on other matters), and his master's {{certificate}} was suspended.|$|E
50|$|The {{admiralty}} action was heard by Mr. Justice Demers of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Quebec Admiralty District), assisted by two nautical assessors. The plaintiffs {{alleged that the}} collision was caused solely by the improper and <b>negligent</b> <b>navigation</b> and mismanagement of Dragon by Wake-Walker. In his defence, Wake-Walker pleaded inevitable accident, said {{to be caused by}} the maneuvering of the Saguenay Trader, which Wake-Walker was trying to avoid hitting. On 21 June 1935, Demers J. held that Wake-Walker was liable.|$|E
5000|$|Canadian Pacific Railway won a {{court case}} against A. F. Klaveness & Co, the owners of Storstad, for $2,000,000, which is the {{valuation}} of silver bullion stored on Empress of Ireland when she sank. [...] The owners of Storstad entered an unsuccessful counter claim against the Canadian Pacific Railway for $50,000 damages, contending that Empress of Ireland was at fault and alleging <b>negligent</b> <b>navigation</b> on her part. Storstad was seized {{at the request of}} CPR, and sold for $175,000 to Prudential Trust, an insurance company acting on behalf of A. F. Klaveness & Co.|$|E

50|$|On 13 August 1934, Dragon under Wake-Walker's command was {{entering}} the Market (or Victoria) Basin in the harbour of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, {{when the ship}} collided with an oil bunkering steamer, Maplebranch, which was securely moored {{at the time of}} the collision. Maplebranch sank. The steamer's owners sued Wake-Walker for the damages to Maplebranch and its cargo, alleged to have been caused solely by the improper and <b>negligent</b> <b>navigation</b> and mismanagement of Dragon by Wake-Walker. In his defence, Wake-Walker pleaded inevitable accident, caused by the maneuvering of a third vessel, Saguenay Trader, which Wake-Walker was trying to avoid hitting.|$|E
5000|$|The carrier's duties are not [...] "strict", but {{require only}} a {{reasonable}} standard of professionalism and care; and Article IV allows the carrier {{a wide range}} of situations exempting them from liability on a cargo claim. These exemptions include destruction or damage to the cargo caused by: fire, perils of the sea, Act of God, and act of war. A controversial provision exempts the carrier from liability for [...] "neglect or default of the master ... in the navigation or in the management of the ship". This provision is considered unfair to the shipper; and both the later Hamburg Rules (which require contracting states to denounce the Hague-Visby Rules) and Rotterdam Rules (which are not yet in force) refuse exemption for <b>negligent</b> <b>navigation</b> and management.|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (the ‘Rotterdam Rules’) {{was adopted}} by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 11 December 2008. The Rotterdam Rules contain two oft-criticised changes from the {{existing}} regime governing international carriage of goods widely adopted among maritime nations, namely the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to Bills of Lading, Brussels, 25 August 1924 (the ‘Hague Rules’) and its subsequent Protocol in 1968 (the ‘Visby Protocol’ or the ‘Hague-Visby Rules’). These changes are, namely, an extension of the carrier’s obligations to maintain seaworthy vessel throughout the voyage (Article 14) and a deletion of an exclusion of carrier’s liabilities due to <b>negligent</b> <b>navigation</b> (Article 17). This paper addresses implications of these changes and assess whether ship-owners and ship-operators can comply with these without having to incur excessive additional expenses...|$|E
