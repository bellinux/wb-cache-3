500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Greenwalt {{was very}} keen {{to acquire the}} character of Cordelia for the spin-off series, commenting, [...] "I desperately wanted {{her to come to}} Angel because Angel being dark and broody, we <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> bright smile." [...] At the same time, Whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in the fourth season of Buffy where [...] "All of our characters {{got to the point where}} they were loving and hugging, and it was sort of like, where's Cordelia?", leading him to introduce Spike (James Marsters) to the cast to accommodate her absence. Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a [...] "rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS. So in episode one of Angel, Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail, actually." [...] Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins [...] "finding within herself a new level of humanity".|$|E
500|$|Although Canning {{wrote that}} [...] "the writers did {{a fine job}} of {{incorporating}} the tenure, Will's terrible Spanish and the songs into the storylines", Will's lack of Spanish skills was questioned by other reviewers. Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch said this did not [...] "seem to gel with the passionate Will Schuester I remember from season 1", and Slezak expressed surprise that [...] "he hadn't even mastered the basics of the language!", as did Chaney. Slezak also said Will, as evidenced by his [...] "La Cucaracha" [...] rendition for his class, was [...] "suddenly dumb as the cardboard box that Finn winningly turned into a robot head", and Chaney commented, [...] "Mr. Schuester always seemed a bit more sensitive than this." [...] VanDerWerff wrote of [...] "the weird, dark despair {{at the heart of}} Will's plight: He's a high school Spanish teacher, and he mostly is that because he doesn't know what else to do." [...] He added, [...] "I think this was probably the best episode for the character since early season one." [...] Canning stated that [...] "the tension between Will and Emma was a welcome change", and Votta commented on the episode's less dramatic ending with Will's apology and [...] "celebrating Emma's new-found tenure with a dinner" [...] with the conclusion, [...] "sometimes you don't <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> bang to get oomph out of an episode". Chaney, however, was puzzled as to why Emma was given teaching tenure [...] "when she's been working at McKinley as a guidance counselor and handing out absolutely horrifying self-made pamphlets".|$|E

"Blood Roses", which Amos had {{initially}} intended {{to serve as}} the opening track to the album, finds the singer scorned over a failed relationship, belting out lines such as, [...] "can't forget the things you never said" [...] and [...] "I've shaved every place where you've been boy". Regarding [...] "Caught a Lite Sneeze", Amos says, [...] "the whole current is doing anything so that you don't have to face yourself.

5000|$|The name [...] "Boca Grande" [...] in Spanish {{literally}} means [...] "Big Mouth". This {{name was}} most likely chosen because the restaurant offers large portions of food, implying that the diner will <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> mouth to handle the portions.|$|E

Alan Shearer was still brilliant though, with 31 Premiership goals. Despite an early exit from the UEFA Champions League, Blackburn improved as the season went on. Although they never looked like regaining their Premiership title, they were in contention for a UEFA Cup place until the very last game of the season but lost out to Arsenal and finished seventh. It wasn't at all a bad finish, though, considering that Blackburn had been in {{the bottom half of the}} Premier League for much of the season.
