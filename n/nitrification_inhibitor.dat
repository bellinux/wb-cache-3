This analysis is performed using 300 ml incubation bottles in which buffered dilution water is dosed with seed microorganisms and stored for 5 days in the dark room at 20 °C to prevent DO production via photosynthesis. In addition to the various dilutions of BOD samples, this procedure requires dilution water blanks, glucose glutamic acid (GGA) controls, and seed controls. The dilution water blank is used to confirm the quality of the dilution water that is used to dilute the other samples. This is necessary because impurities in the dilution water may cause significant alterations in the results.

The results, however, showed that when root exudates were collected in distilled water, there was no inhibitory effect on nitrification, but when root exudates were collected in a medium containing 1 mM NH 4 Cl, it showed significant nitrification inhibition in our soil nitrification test (bioassay).

Under soil conditions the main form of N available for the plant is nitrate. Nitrification inhibitors reduce the nitrification rate and increase the ammonium absorbed by the plant.

Vegetable cropping systems are often characterised by high inputs of nitrogen fertiliser and consequently elevated emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) can be expected.

A field experiment investigated the effect of the <b>nitrification</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (DMPP & 3 MP+TZ) on N 2 O emissions and yield from a typical vegetable production system in sub-tropical Australia. Soil N 2 O fluxes were monitored continuously over an entire year with a fully automated system. Measurements were taken from three subplots for each treatment within a randomized complete blocks design. There was a significant inhibition effect of DMPP and 3 MP+TZ on N 2 O emissions and soil mineral N content directly following the application of the fertiliser over the vegetable cropping phase. However this mitigation was offset by elevated N 2 O emissions from the inhibitor treatments over the post-harvest fallow period. Cumulative annual N 2 O emissions amounted to 1. 22 kg-N/ha, 1. 16 kg-N/ha, 1. 50 kg-N/ha and 0. 86 kg-N/ha in the conventional fertiliser (CONV), the DMPP treatment, the 3 MP+TZ treatment and the zero fertiliser (0 N) respectively. Corresponding fertiliser induced emission factors (EFs) were low with only 0. 09 - 0. 20 % of the total applied fertiliser lost as N 2 O. There was no significant effect of the <b>nitrification</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on yield compared to the CONV treatment for the three vegetable crops (green beans, broccoli, lettuce) grown over the experimental period. This study highlights that N 2 O emissions from such vegetable cropping system are primarily controlled by post-harvest emissions following the incorporation of vegetable crop residues into the soil.

A large amount of {{research has been done}} to find and implement N fertilizer management practices that will increase N use efficiency by the fertilized crop thus decreasing the potential for degradation of the environment. Researchers have studied timing of N applications, split applications of fertilizer N, and the use of various additives to address this problem. The purpose of the paper is to present the results of evaluation of two N fertilizer additives. <b>Nitrification</b> <b>Inhibitors</b> Use of <b>nitrification</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (NI) may help improve N use efficiency in corn production resulting in environmental benefits as well as increased profitability and crop quality (Wolt, 2000; Sahrawat, 1989). <b>Nitrification</b> <b>inhibitors</b> reduce the rate that NH 4 is transformed to NO 3 in soils. Ammonium is not susceptible to denitrification or leaching losses but NO 3 is. The idea is t...|$|R
