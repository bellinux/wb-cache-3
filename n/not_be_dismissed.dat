5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for the Act is required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and the 1930s, {{the number}} of runs scored by batsmen, and the {{proportion}} of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad-play {{and the extent to which}} batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump, simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler Harold Larwood responded by targeting leg stump, frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial Bodyline tactics he used in Australia in 1932–33. Some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump—reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads—if they presented any threat, knowing that they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, Donald Bradman, the leading Australian batsman and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create more exciting games.|$|E

50|$|The SAPO {{case was}} {{distinguishable}} because, in that case, {{the termination of}} the contract was linked to alleged misconduct by the employee and not to the natural expiry of the contract. The court accordingly found that the applicant had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>dismissed.</b>|$|R
5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences {{that are difficult to}} read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E

Lebron v. Rumsfeld, 764 F.Supp.2d 787 (D.S.C.). On January 23, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this dismissal.|$|E
25|$|In 1812, a {{new system}} was introduced, {{requiring}} all males between age 20 and 25 {{to serve in the}} armed forces twelve days a year, changing in 1858 to four weeks per two years. At the same time, the new allotment system remained in use up until 1901, when mandatory conscription, with 89 months of military service, was introduced. The allotment system was finally abolished in 1901. From that time, regiments began to be garrisoned in towns instead of being spread all over the province with a training ground as the only common meeting place. As croft soldiers were contracted by the government {{for as long as they}} wanted and were fit for service, and as they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed,</b> some soldiers lived under the allotment system long after 1901, the last one retiring as late as 1961. Through the reform, the regiments' local connections were partially lost, as conscripts were not necessarily from the regiments' respective provinces. Before the reform, soldiers of the same company generally stemmed from the same village and region.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} was opened into the accident by the Accidents Investigation Branch. Under directions from Sir Sefton Brancker, a Public Inquiry was held, chaired by Sir Arthur Colefax, with Professor B M Jones and James Swinburne as assessors. The enquiry opened on 23 January 1925 at the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London. This {{was the first}} Public Inquiry into a civil aviation accident in the United Kingdom. The inquiry was held under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Act, 1920, as amended in 1922. Evidence was given that the aircraft had a valid certificate of airworthiness and {{that at the time}} of the accident it was operating in an unmodified form. The aircraft was not overloaded and had been inspected on the morning of the day the accident occurred. Reported problems with the lubrication system on the Napier Lion engine had been rectified. Failure of the aircraft to reach its intended destinations in the week before the accident had been entirely due to weather conditions, and not as the result of any mechanical defect. The pilot, David Stewart, had served with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force, having been awarded the Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Force Cross. He had been a pilot since 1917. Evidence was given that a petrol pipe recovered from the wreckage was discovered to be partially obstructed internally. The possibility of this occurring before the crash could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed,</b> although the obstruction could also have been as a result of the post-crash fire. The inquiry was then adjourned until 25 January.|$|E

500|$|Justice David J. Brewer {{issued a}} dissent stating that he {{believed}} that due process had been observed and that the majority opinion should have affirmed the lower court rulings rather than dismissing the case. In his opinion, Brewer stated: [...] "s I understand the law, this court has jurisdiction to review a judgment of the highest court of a State ousting one from his office and giving it to another, and a right to inquire whether that judgment is right or wrong in respect to any federal question such as due process of law, I think the writ of error should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed,</b> but that {{the judgment of the}} Court of Appeals of Kentucky should be affirmed." [...] Justice Henry B. Brown concurred with Brewer.|$|E

A number of Bosnian Serb political figures made public statements denying that war crimes had happened and a government spokesman called the report a bid to promote [...] "truth and reconciliation". The Republika Srpska Socialist Party leader, Lazar Ristić, welcomed the report and accused the Bosniak side of having [...] "hitherto presented only false reports, in which names were listed of persons who are still alive today." ...|$|E
500|$|Burney and Ramilisonina {{admitted}} that the most parsimonious explanation for the sightings was that kidoky was a misidentified sifaka or other larger living lemur species. [...] However, the authors did not feel comfortable with such a dismissal because of their careful quizzing and use of unlabeled color plates during the interviews {{and because of the}} competence demonstrated by the interviewees in regards to local wildlife and lemur habits. [...] The possibility of a wild introduced baboon surviving in the forests could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed.</b> [...] However, the descriptions of kidoky, with its terrestrial baboon-like gait, make Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur the most plausible candidates among the giant subfossil lemurs. [...] At the very least, the stories support a wider extinction window for the giant subfossil lemurs, suggesting that their extinction was recent enough for such vivid stories to still survive in the oral traditions of the Malagasy people.|$|E

500|$|The judge heard out the owners; after expressing initial reluctance, he {{took the}} job for seven years at a salary of $50,000, on {{condition}} he could remain on the federal bench. During Landis's time serving as both judge and commissioner, he allowed a $7,500 reduction in his salary as commissioner, to reflect his pay as judge. The appointment of Landis was met with acclaim in the press. [...] A tentative agreement was signed by the parties a month later—an agreement which itemized Landis's powers over baseball, and which was drafted by the judge. [...] The owners were {{still reeling from the}} perception that baseball was crooked, and accepted the agreement virtually without dissent. [...] Under the terms of the contract, Landis could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> by the team owners, have his pay reduced, or even be criticized by them in public. He also had nearly unlimited authority over every person employed in the major or minor leagues, from owners to batboys. [...] The owners waived any recourse to the courts to contest Landis's will. Humorist Will Rogers stated, [...] "on't kid yourself that that old judicial bird isn't going to make those baseball birds walk the chalkline".

[...] By March 1986, Hussey and Ferraro were no longer calling for [...] "dialogue" [...] but were publicly demanding recognition of [...] "a woman's right to choose." [...] In July 1986 when the two nuns were pressured more strongly with expulsion, 11 of the other nuns who signed came forward with a statement in solidarity with them, denying a recent Vatican announcement that all nuns but Hussey and Ferraro were now aligned with the Church's position on abortion. The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, [...] "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism. I continue to stand behind every word of it without the slightest reservation." [...] After nearly four years of dispute, Hussey and Ferraro were informed by their order's leadership in June 1988 that they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> from the order.

500|$|In {{his first}} speech of 2012, Miliband {{said that if}} Labour won the 2015 general {{election}} times would be difficult economically, but Labour was still the only party capable of delivering [...] "fairness". He also said he would tackle [...] "vested interests", citing energy and rail companies. Following the announcement in late January 2012 that {{the chief executive officer}} of the nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland, Stephen Hester, would receive a bonus worth £950,000, Miliband called the amount [...] "disgraceful", and urged David Cameron to act to prevent the bonus. Cameron refused, saying it was a matter for the RBS board, leading Miliband to announce that Labour would force a Commons vote on whether or not the government should block it. Hester announced that he would forego his bonus, and Miliband said Labour would carry on with a Commons vote regardless, focusing instead on the bonuses of other RBS executives. Following George Galloway's unexpected win in the March by-election in Bradford West, Miliband announced he would lead an inquiry into the result, saying, it [...] "could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> as a one-off". In April 2012, in the midst of a debate about the nature of political party funding, Miliband called on David Cameron to institute a £5,000 cap on donations from individuals and organisations to political parties, after it had been suggested that the government favoured a cap of £50,000. On 14 July 2012, Miliband became the first Leader of the Labour Party to attend and address the Durham Miners' Gala in 23 years. In the same month, Miliband became the first British politician to be invited to France to meet the new French President, François Hollande.|$|E
