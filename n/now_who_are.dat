2500|$|There is an overt {{intention}} of progressing heavy music present in Isis' output; {{a desire to}} further the intellectual cause that pushes them forward. This is evident within the clear progression of their sound from release to release, their influence on heavy music, and their acceptance in art circles where other metal bands are not so readily embraced. Their stated goal is [...] "not {{to break away from}} the scene that [...] came from, but to expand upon it". Publications such as Terrorizer attest to how Turner has completed his goal, explaining that [...] "Aaron Turner has loosened hardcore from its geographical roots, and in the process created an intimate, yet immeasurable vision all of his own". Turner has complained that [...] "metal in general has long been unjustly maligned as solely the province of knuckle-dragging meatheads [...] That said, there's never been a group of musicians like there is <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> helping to advance the form." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{moved to}} depart, then checked, and faced him again. It <b>was</b> she <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> on her defence, her voice quivering with indignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas, madame!" [...] he answered, [...] "it is you <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{pleased to}} jest. Your {{husband is a}} great and {{powerful}} ambassador. I, unfortunately, have no career, no place in life, save the place which the possession of a few millions gives to a successful financier." ...|$|E
60|$|So thought Solomon, {{in spite}} of all his wisdom, because he had not heard the good news of Easter day. And so think many <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> called wise men and philosophers; because they, alas! for them, will not believe the good news of Easter day.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{other one}} isn't here, either,' I exclaimed, growing more puzzled. 'The waiter at the hotel! Why, that's another forgery! Higginson must have waited till {{the man was}} safely dead, and then used him similarly. It was all very clever. <b>Now,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> these people who really {{witnessed}} it?' ...|$|E

60|$|A {{great and}} awful disgust filled his whole heart. It <b>was</b> he <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> {{conscious}} of the loathsome web, which had enveloped him more completely {{than he had ever}} anticipated.|$|R

He owns two slaves <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> running the river. He keeps out of politics, and he has none of the Yankee faults." ...|$|E
6000|$|I knew {{something}} must be wrong--fearfully wrong--but I didn't know what.

6000|$|... 'Sure, we're {{always in}} the thick of it, sorr. Mr. ---- was hit; no, not badly; only his wrist, but there's not many of the {{officers}} left; only two <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> at Talana.' ...|$|R

60|$|She {{broke off}} in a sudden fit of sobbing. He took her face gently in his hands, {{and held it up}} to him. It <b>was</b> he, <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> to play the part of consoler.|$|R
6000|$|... "History {{is full of}} such instances. A part of the subjects, {{unwilling to}} be the dupes of such a fraud, revolt against the monarch in name, against the cabal in fact. <b>Now</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> the real rebels? Profession is nothing. Hyder Ally never seated himself in the {{presence}} of the prince he had deposed, though he held him captive during life." ...|$|E

But you are the friend of the Prince of Saxe Leinitzer. You are one of those even <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> working actively against me. I am not blaming you, but we are on opposite sides." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But that {{is because}} your master is an unusually bad fellow," [...] replied Considine. [...] "Few Cape farmers are so bad as he. You have {{yourself}} had experience of Hans Marais, <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> kind to every one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Say {{you don't}} believe it. Ask the scandal-monger how he knows and insist on his telling you--insist. And if he won't--be very, very rude to him. Insist {{up to the}} quarrelling point. <b>Now</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> those people?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{that poor}} girl <b>who</b> <b>is</b> coming here <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> devoted to you, and to whom, I do not doubt, you have uttered words which {{ought to have}} made it {{impossible}} for you to speak to me as you spoke not a moment since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All of us, my honest friend," [...] {{continued}} the Doctor, [...] "are subject to making mistakes; {{so that the}} chief art of life, is to learn how best to remedy mistakes. Now one remedy for mistakes is honesty. So pay the man for {{the damage done to}} his box. And <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> you, my friend? My correspondents here mention your name--Israel Potter--and say you are an American, an escaped prisoner of war, but nothing further. I want to hear your story from your own lips." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ay! {{what can}} harm us <b>now,</b> <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> in Love's hand? I {{do not think}} I'd care Though the vile world should with its lackey Slander Trample and tread upon my life; why should I? They say the common field-flowers of the field Have sweeter scent when they are trodden on Than when they bloom alone, and that some herbs Which have no perfume, on being bruised die With all Arabia round them; so it is With the young lives this dull world seeks to crush, It does but bring the {{sweetness}} out of them, And makes them lovelier often. And besides, While we have love {{we have the best}} of life: Is it not so? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{determine}} <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> your friends, who your loyal servants," [...] she told him. [...] "How {{is so much}} force to be resisted {{in the state in}} which you find yourself? The Catholics exhausted, and weary as they are by a civil war in which their king was of little account to them, are going to arm so as to offer what resistance they can without depending upon you. Thus, within your State you will have two great parties under arms, neither of which can be called your own. Unless you stir yourself, and quickly, unless you choose now between friends and foes, you will find yourself alone, isolated, in grave peril, without authority or power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{thought at}} the time that your {{indifference}} was a little remarkable," [...] Mr. Maddison said quietly. The positions between them were entirely reversed. It was Sir Allan Beaumerville <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> placing a great restraint upon himself, and Mr. Maddison <b>who</b> <b>was</b> collected and at his ease.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{you have}} done to Xodar, now do you {{likewise}} to Thurid. Take him before Issus, bound in his own harness, that she may see with her own eyes that there be one among you <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> greater than the First Born." ...|$|R
60|$|Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He doesn't know <b>who</b> <b>is</b> here nor care. <b>Now</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> that lankylooking galoot {{over there}} in the macintosh? <b>Now</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> he I'd like to know? Now I'd give a trifle to know <b>who</b> he <b>is.</b> Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} thought that," [...] {{he assured me}} soberly. [...] "It may well be so. Last night I dreamed I was a lark bird, a {{beautiful}} singing lark of the sky like the larks on the upland pastures of Haleakala. And I flew up, up, toward the sun, singing, singing, as old Kohokumu never sang. I tell you now that I dreamed I was a lark bird singing in the sky. But may not I, the real I, be the lark bird? And may not the telling of it be the dream that I, the lark bird, am dreaming <b>now?</b> <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> {{you to tell me}} ay or no? Dare you tell me I am not a lark bird asleep and dreaming that I am old Kohokumu?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{legitimate}} war, so to speak, in {{this region}} is a mountaineering war. The typical position is roughly as follows. The Austrians occupy valley A which opens northward; the Italians occupy valley B which opens southward. The fight is for the crest between A and B. The side that wins that crest gains the power of looking down into, firing into and outflanking {{the positions of the}} enemy valley. In most cases it is the Italians <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> pressing, and if the reader will examine a map of the front and compare it with the official reports he will soon realise that almost everywhere the Italians are up {{to the head of the}} southward valleys and working over the crests so as to press down upon the Austrian valleys. But in the Trentino the Austrians are still well over the crest on the southward slopes. When I was in Italy they still held Rovereto.|$|E
6000|$|... "But he is {{not what}} I call loyal. He cannot keep himself from running after strange gods. What need had he {{to take up the}} Church {{question}} at Tankerville? The truth is, Duke, the thing is going to pieces. We get men into the House <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> clever, and all that sort of thing, and who force their way up, but who can't be made to understand that everybody should not want to be Prime Minister." [...] The Duke, who was now a Nestor among politicians, though very green in his age, smiled as he heard remarks which had been familiar to him for the last forty years. He, too, liked his party, and was fond of loyal men; but he had learned at last that all loyalty must be built on a basis of self-advantage. Patriotism may exist without it, but that which Erle called loyalty in politics was simply devotion to the side which a man conceives to be his side, and which he cannot leave without danger to himself.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} the tool of that clique, it <b>was</b> they <b>now</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> ready to cast her aside, to break her power and {{ultimately}} to throw her on the heap of social refuse, where other traitors, liars and cheats mouldered away in obscurity.|$|R
6000|$|... '"To-morrow Israel will be avenged." [...] What! in Karasmian blood? I have no faith. No matter. All is now {{beyond my}} influence. A rushing destiny carries me onward. I cannot stem the course, nor guide the vessel. How <b>now!</b> <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> the officer on guard?' ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{is what he}} did {{to defeat}} it. In the House of Representatives he and his friends {{furnished}} some twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished ninety odd. <b>Now,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> it that did the work? [A voice: [...] "Douglas."] Why, yes, Douglas did it? To be sure he did! ...|$|R
