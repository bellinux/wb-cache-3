25|$|In higher plants, P. aeruginosa induces soft rot, {{for example}} in Arabidopsis thaliana (Thale cress) and Lactuca sativa (lettuce). It is also {{pathogenic}} to invertebrate animals, including the <b>nematode</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans,</b> the fruit fly Drosophila and the moth Galleria mellonella. The associations of virulence factors are the same for plant and animal infections.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{functionally}} specialized for nociception {{have been}} documented in other invertebrates including the leech Hirudo medicinalis, the <b>nematode</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans</b> and the molluscs Aplysia californica and Cepaea nemoralis. Changes in neuronal activity induced by noxious stimuli have been recorded in the nervous centres of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and larval Manduca sexta.|$|E

30|$|Similar to CuO NP, the {{mechanism}} of toxicity induced by ZnO NP seems to deviate from its ionic counterpart. Fernandez-Cruz et al. [161], for instance, suggested that cytotoxic effects in fish cells are mainly particle-related, which is supported by studies uncovering difference in gene expression [162, 163] and thus different mechanisms of toxicity [164]. Recent evidence with soil <b>nematodes</b> (<b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans)</b> indicates a higher ecotoxicological potential of ZnO NP relative to Zn 2 + ions [165].|$|R
25|$|MTs {{are present}} in a vast range of taxonomic groups, ranging from prokaryotes (such as the {{cyanobacteria}} Synechococcus sp.), protozoa (such as the ciliate Tetrahymena genera), plants (such as Pisum sativum, Triticum durum, Zea mays, or Quercus suber), yeast (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Candida albicans), invertebrates (such as the <b>nematode</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans,</b> the insect Drosophila melanogaster, the mollusc Mytilus edulis, or the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and vertebrates (such as the chicken Gallus gallus, or the mammalian Homo sapiens or Mus musculus).|$|E
25|$|The {{nervous system}} of one very small roundworm, the <b>nematode</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans,</b> has been {{completely}} mapped out in a connectome including its synapses. Every neuron and its cellular lineage has been recorded and most, if not all, of the neural connections are known. In this species, the nervous system is sexually dimorphic; the nervous systems of the two sexes, males and female hermaphrodites, have different numbers of neurons and groups of neurons that perform sex-specific functions. In C. elegans, males have exactly 383 neurons, while hermaphrodites have exactly 302 neurons.|$|E
25|$|Egg {{formation}} in M. javanica {{has been studied}} in detail, and is similar to egg {{formation in}} the well studied, free-living <b>nematode</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans.</b> Embryogenesis has also been studied, and the stages of development are easily identifiable with a phase contrast microscope following preparation of an egg mass squash. The egg is formed as one cell, with two-cell, four-cell and eight-cell stages recognisable. Further cell division leads to the tadpole stage, with further elongation resulting {{in the first stage}} juvenile, which is roughly four times as long as the egg. The J1 stage of C. elegans has 558 cells, and the J1 of M. javanica likely has a similar number, since all nematodes are morphologically and anatomically similar. The egg shell has three layers, with the vitelline layer outermost, then a chitinous layer and a lipid layer innermost.|$|E
50|$|Species-specific {{databases}} {{are available}} for some species, mainly those that are often used in research (Model Organisms). For example, EcoCyc is an E. coli database. Other popular Model Organism Databases include Mouse Genome Informatics for the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus, the Rat Genome Database for Rattus, ZFIN for Danio Rerio (zebrafish), PomBase for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, FlyBase for Drosophila, WormBase for the <b>nematodes</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans</b> and <b>Caenorhabditis</b> briggsae, and Xenbase for Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopus laevis frogs.|$|R
40|$|The common {{ancestor}} of the self-fertilizing <b>nematodes</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans</b> and C. briggsae must have reproduced by obligate outcrossing, like most species in this genus. However, {{we have only}} a limited understanding about how genetic variation is patterned in such male–female (gonochoristic) Caenorhabditis species. Here, we report results from surveying nucleotide variation of six nuclear loci in a broad geographic sample of wild isolates of the gonochoristic C. remanei. We find high levels of diversity in this species, with silent-site diversity averaging 4. 7...|$|R

25|$|Because {{they are}} easy to keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the <b>nematode</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans</b> have long been the most intensively studied {{metazoan}} model organisms, and were among the first life-forms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but as many genes, introns, and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can teach us little about the origins of animals in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasized the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the Eumetazoa. An analysis of the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela also suggests that the last common ancestor of sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously assumed. Other model organisms belonging to the animal kingdom include the house mouse (Mus musculus), laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio).|$|E
500|$|In {{every type}} of animal that has been examined, {{dopamine}} has been seen to modify motor behavior. In the model organism, <b>nematode</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans,</b> it reduces locomotion and increases food-exploratory movements; in flatworms it produces [...] "screw-like" [...] movements; in leeches it inhibits swimming and promotes crawling.

40|$|The {{intestine}} of {{the three}} free-living rhabditid <b>nematodes</b> <b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans,</b> Panagrolaimus superbus and Acrobeloides maximus was studied using transmission electron microscopy of sections made at three locations along the intestine. Between the three nematode species, ultrastructural differences in cellular components are minor.

Furthermore, {{two different types of}} secretions into the intestinal lumen were identified, one only at the anterior intestine, the second present along {{the entire length of the}} intestinal lumen.

40|$|Phosphine {{is a small}} redox-active {{gas that}} is used to protect global grain reserves, which are {{threatened}} by the emergence of phosphine resistance in pest insects. We find that polymorphisms responsible for genetic resistance cluster around the redox-active catalytic disulfide or the dimerization interface of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) in insects (Rhyzopertha dominica and Tribolium castaneum) and <b>nematodes</b> (<b>Caenorhabditis</b> <b>elegans).</b> DLD is a core metabolic enzyme representing a new class of resistance factor for a redox-active metabolic toxin. It participates in four key steps of core metabolism, and metabolite profiles indicate that phosphine exposure in mutant and wild-type animals affects these steps differently. Mutation of DLD in C. elegans increases arsenite sensitivity. This specific vulnerability may be exploited to control phosphine-resistant insects and safeguard food security...|$|R
