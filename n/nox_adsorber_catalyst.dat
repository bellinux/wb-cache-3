40|$|Sulfur {{poisoning}} from {{engine fuel}} and lube {{is one of}} the most recognizable degradation mechanisms of a <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> <b>catalyst</b> system for diesel emission reduction. Even with the availability of 15 ppm sulfur diesel fuel, NOx adsorber will be deactivated without an effective sulfur management. Two general pathways are currently being explored for sulfur management: (1) the use of a disposable SOx trap that can be replaced or rejuvenated offline periodically, and (2) the use of diesel fuel injection in the exhaust and high temperature de-sulfation approach to remove the sulfur poisons to recover the NOx trapping efficiency. The major concern of the de-sulfation process is the many prolonged high temperature rich cycles that catalyst will encounter during its useful life. It is shown that <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> <b>catalyst</b> suffers some loss of its trapping capacity upon high temperature lean-rich exposure. With the use of a disposable SOx trap to remove large portion of the sulfur poisons from the exhaust, the <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> <b>catalyst</b> can be protected and the numbers of de-sulfation events can be greatly reduced. Spectroscopic techniques, such as DRIFTS and Raman, have been used to monitor the underlying chemical reactions during NOx trapping/ regeneration and de-sulfation periods, and provide a fundamental understanding of NOx storage capacity and catalyst degradation mechanism using model catalysts. This paper examines the sulfur effect on two model NOx adsorber catalysts. The chemistry of SOx/base metal oxides and the sulfation product pathways and their corresponding spectroscopic data are discussed. SAE Paper SAE- 2003 - 01 - 3245 {copyright} 2003 SAE International.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{quantify}} DRIFT spectral features {{associated with the}} in-situ adsorption of gases on a <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> <b>catalyst,</b> Pt/K/Al 2 O 3, is described. To implement this method the multicomponent catalyst is analyzed with DRIFT and chemisorption to determine that at operating conditions the surface is comprised of a Pt phase, a pure γ-Al 2 O 3 phase with associated hydroxyl groups at the surface, and an alkalized-Al 2 O 3 phase where the surface –OH groups are replaced by –OK groups. Both DRIFTS and chemisorption experiments show that 93 - 97 % of the potassium exists in this form. The phases have a fractional surface area of 1. 1 % for the 1. 7 nm sized Pt, 34 % for pure Al 2 O 3 and 65 % for the alkalized-Al 2 O 3. NO 2 and CO 2 chemisorption at 250 ˚C is implemented to determine the saturation uptake value that is observed with DRIFTS at 250 ˚C.

As a continuation of the technique development, the temperature changes and gradients formed during simulated operation of a Pt/Ba/Al 2 O 3 <b>NOX</b> <b>adsorber</b> <b>catalyst</b> (NAC) for diesel exhaust applications were monitored using IR thermography and standard thermocouples. NACs operate in a cyclic manner; during the lean phase, when the engine is in normal operation, the catalyst traps entering NOX; once the catalyst nears saturation, the catalyst is exposed to a rich exhaust phase, in reductant relative to oxygen, where the trapped NOX is reduced to N 2; and finally the exhaust returns to the normally lean conditions thereby completing the cycle. During the rich phase, previous work has suggested that significant temperature changes might be occurring {{along the length of the}} catalyst.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to determine the}} influence of diesel fuel composition on the ability of <b>NOX</b> <b>adsorber</b> <b>catalyst</b> (NAC) technology, in conjunction with diesel particle filters (DPFs), to achieve stringent emissions levels with a minimal fuel economy impact. The test bed for this project was intended to be a light-duty sport utility vehicle (SUV) with a goal of achieving light-duty Tier 2 -Bin 5 tail pipe emission levels (0. 07 g/mi. NOX and 0. 01 g/mi. PM). However, with the current US market share of light-duty diesel applications being so low, no US 2002 model year (MY) light-duty truck (LDT) or SUV platforms equipped with a diesel engine and having a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) less than 8500 lb exist. While the current level of diesel engine use is relatively small in the light-duty class, there exists considerable potential for the diesel engine to gain a much larger market share in the future as manufacturers of heavy light-duty trucks (HLDTs) attempt to offset the negative impact on cooperate average fuel economy (CAFE) that the recent rise in market share of the SUVs and LDTs has caused. The US EPA Tier 2 emission standards also contain regulation to prevent the migration of heavy light-duty trucks and SUV's to the medium duty class. This preventive measure requires that all medium duty trucks, SUV's and vans in the 8, 500 to 10, 000 lb GVWR range being used as passenger vehicles, meet light-duty Tier 2 standards. In meeting the Tier 2 emission standards, the HLDTs and medium-duty passenger vehicles (MDPVs) will face the greatest technological challenges. Because the MDPV is the closest weight class and application relative to the potential upcoming HLDTs and SUV's, a weight class compromise was made in this program to allow the examination of using a diesel engine with a NAC-DPF system on a 2002 production vehicle.

While Navistar pursued engine-based (in-cylinder) approaches to LNT regeneration, complementary experiments at ORNL focused on in-exhaust fuel injection. ORNL developed a PC-based controller for transient electronic control of EGR valve position, intake throttle position, and actuation of fuel injectors in the exhaust system of a Navistar engine installed at Oak Ridge. Aftertreatment systems consisting of different diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) in conjunction with a diesel particle filter and LNT were evaluated under quasi-steady-state conditions. Hydrocarbon (HC) species were measured at multiple locations in the exhaust system with Gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Under full-load, rated speed conditions, injection of fuel upstream of the DOC reduced the fuel penalty for a given level of NOx reduction by 10 - 20 %. GC-MS showed that fuel compounds were 'cracked' into smaller hydrocarbon species over the DOC, particularly light alkenes. GC-MS analysis of HC species entering and exiting the LNT showed high utilization of light alkenes, followed by mono-aromatics; branched alkanes passed through the LNT largely unreacted. Follow-on experiments at a 'road load' condition were conducted, revealing that the NOx reduction was better without the DOC at lower temperatures. The improved performance was attributed to the large swings in the NOx adsorber core temperature. Split-injection experiments were conducted with ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel and three pure HC compounds: 1 -pentene, toluene, and iso-octane. The pure compound experiments confirmed the previous results regarding hydrocarbon reactivity: 1 -pentene was the most efficient LNT reductant, followed by toluene. Injection location had minimal impact on the reactivity of these two compounds. Iso-octane was an ineffective LNT reductant, requiring high doses (resulting in high HC emissions) to achieve reasonable NOx conversions. Diesel fuel reactivity was sensitive to injection location, with the best performance achieved through fuel injection downstream of the DOC. This configuration generated large LNT temperature excursions, which probably improved the efficiency of the NOx storage/reduction process, but also resulted in very high HC emissions. The ORNL team demonstrated an LNT desulfation under 'road load' conditions using throttling, EGR, and in-pipe injection of diesel fuel. Flow reactor characterization of core samples cut from the front and rear of the engine-aged LNT revealed complex spatially dependent degradation mechanisms. The front of the catalyst contained residual sulfates, which impacted NOx storage and conversion efficiencies at high temperatures. The rear of the catalyst showed significant sintering of the washcoat and precious metal particles, resulting in lower NOx conversion efficiencies at low temperatures. Further flow reactor characterization of engine-aged LNT core samples established that low temperature performance was limited by slow release and reduction of stored NOx during regeneration. Carbon monoxide was only effective at regenerating the LNT at temperatures above 200 C; propene was unreactive even at 250 C. Low temperature operation also resulted in unselective NOx reduction, resulting in high emissions of both N{sub 2 }O and NH{sub 3 }. During the latter years of the CRADA, the focus was shifted from LNTs to other aftertreatment devices. Two years of the CRADA were spent developing detailed ammonia SCR device models with sufficient accuracy and computational efficiency to be used in development of model-based ammonia injection control algorithms.

40|$|Plasmatron reformers {{are being}} {{developed}} at MIT and ArvinMeritor [1]. In these reformers a special low power electrical discharge is used to promote partial oxidation conversion of hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen and CO. The partial oxidation reaction of this very fuel rich mixture is difficult to initiate. The plasmatron provides continuous enhanced volume initiation. To minimize electrode erosion and electrical power requirements, a low current, high voltage discharge with wide area electrodes is used. The reformers operate at or slightly above atmospheric pressure. Plasmatron reformers provide the advantages of rapid startup and transient response; efficient conversion of the fuel to hydrogen rich gas; compact size; relaxation or elimination of reformer catalyst requirements; and capability to process difficult to reform fuels, such as diesel and bio-oils. These advantages facilitate use of onboard hydrogen-generation technology for diesel exhaust after-treatment. Plasma-enhanced reformer technology can provide substantial conversion even {{without the use of}} a catalyst.

Nitrogen Oxides (<b>NOx)</b> <b>adsorber</b> technology was selected based on a previous investigation of various NOx aftertreatment technologies including non-thermal plasma, <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> and active lean NOx. Particulate Matter (PM) emissions were addressed by developing a catalyzed particulate filter. After various iterations of the catalyst formulation, the aftertreatment components were integrated and optimized for a light duty vehicle application. This compact exhaust aftertreatment system is dual leg and consists of a sulfur trap, <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorbers,</b> and catalyzed particulate filters (CPF). During regeneration, supplementary ARCO ECD low-sulfur diesel fuel is injected upstream of the adsorber and CPF in the exhaust. Steady state and transient emission test results with and without the exhaust aftertreatment system (EAS) are presented. Results of soot filter regeneration by injecting low-sulfur diesel fuel and slip of unregulated emissions, such as NH 3, are discussed. Effects of adsorber size and bypass strategy on NOx conversion efficiency and fuel economy penalty are also presented in this paper. The results indicate that if the supplementary fuel injection is optimized, NH 3 slip is negligible. During the FTP cycle, injection of low sulfur diesel fuel can create temperature exotherms high enough to regenerate a loaded CPF. With the optimized <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> regeneration strategies the fuel injection penalty can be reduced by 40 to 50 %.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{excellent}} fuel efficiency, reliability, and durability, compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) engines {{have been used}} extensively to power almost all highway trucks, urban buses, off-road vehicles, marine carriers, and industrial equipment. CIDI engines burn 35 to 50 % less fuel than gasoline engines of comparable size, and they emit far less greenhouse gases (Carbon Dioxides), which have been implicated in global warming. Although the emissions of CIDI engines have been reduced significantly over the last decade, there remains concern with the Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) and Particulate Matter (PM) emission levels. In 2000, the US EPA proposed very stringent emissions standards to be introduced in 2007 along with low sulfur (< 15 ppm) diesel fuel. The California Air Resource Board (CARB) has also established the principle that future diesel fueled vehicles should meet the same emissions standards as gasoline fueled vehicles and the EPA followed suit with its Tier II emissions regulations. Meeting the Tier II standards requires NOX and PM emissions to be reduced dramatically. Achieving such low emissions while minimizing fuel economy penalty cannot be done through engine development and fuel reformulation alone, and requires application of NOX and PM aftertreatment control devices. A joint effort was made between Cummins Inc. and the Department of Energy to develop the generic aftertreatment subsystem technologies applicable for Light-Duty Vehicle (LDV) and Light-Duty Truck (LDT) engines. This paper provides {{an update on the}} progress of this joint development program. Three NOX reduction technologies including plasmaassisted catalytic NOX reduction (PACR), active lean <b>NOX</b> <b>catalyst</b> (LNC), and <b>adsorber</b> <b>catalyst</b> (AC) technology using intermittent rich conditions for NOX reduction were investigated in parallel in an attempt to select the best NOX control approach for light-duty aftertreatment subsystem integration and development. Investigations included system design and analysis, critical lab/engine experiments, and ranking then selection of NOX control technologies against reliability, up-front cost, fuel economy, service interval/serviceability, and size/weight. The results of the investigations indicate that the best NOX control approach for LDV and LDT applications is a <b>NOX</b> <b>adsorber</b> system. A greater than 83 % NOX reduction efficiency is required to achieve 0. 07 g/mile NOX Tier II vehicle-out emissions.

In 2000, the US EPA proposed very stringent emissions standards to be introduced in 2007 along with low sulfur (< 15 ppm) diesel fuel. The California Air Resource Board (CARB) has also established the principle that future diesel fueled vehicles should meet the same low emissions standards as gasoline fueled vehicles and the EPA followed suit with its Tier II emissions regulation. Achieving such low emissions cannot be done through engine development and fuel reformulation alone, and requires application of NOx and particulate matter (PM) aftertreatment control devices. There is a widespread consensus that <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorbers</b> and particulate filter are required in order for diesel engines to meet the 2007 emissions regulations for NOx and PM. In this paper, the key exhaust characteristics from an advanced diesel engine are reviewed. Development of the <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> technology is discussed. Spectroscopic techniques are applied to understand the underlying chemical reactions over the catalyst surface during NOx trapping and regeneration periods. In-situ surface probes are useful in providing not only thermodynamic and kinetics information required for model development but also a fundamental understanding of storage capacity and degradation mechanisms. The distribution of various nitration/sulfation species is related to surface basicity. Surface displacement reactions of carbonates also play roles in affecting the trapping capability of <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorbers.</b> When ultralow-S fuel {{is used as a}} reductant during the regeneration, sulfur induced performance degradation is still observed in an aged catalyst. Other possible sources related to catalyst deactivation include incomplete reduction of surface nitration, coke formation derived from incomplete hydrocarbon burning, and lubricant formulations. Sulfur management and the direction of future work for the successful implementation of such integrated engine and aftertreatment technology are discussed.

25|$|High {{levels of}} sulfur in diesel are harmful for the {{environment}} because they prevent the use of catalytic diesel particulate filters to control diesel particulate emissions, {{as well as more}} advanced technologies, such as nitrogen oxide (<b>NOx)</b> <b>adsorbers</b> (still under development), to reduce emissions. Moreover, sulfur in the fuel is oxidized during combustion, producing sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, that in presence of water rapidly convert to sulfuric acid, one of the chemical processes that results in acid rain. However, the process for lowering sulfur also reduces the lubricity of the fuel, meaning that additives must be put into the fuel to help lubricate engines. Biodiesel and biodiesel/petrodiesel blends, with their higher lubricity levels, are increasingly being utilized as an alternative.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> was {{designed}} to avoid the problems that EGR and SCR experienced. An adsorbant such as zeolite traps the NO and NO2 molecules — acting as a molecular sponge. Once the trap is full (like a sponge full of water) no more NOx can be absorbed. Various schemes {{have been designed to}} [...] "purge" [...] or [...] "regenerate" [...] the trap. One of possible reactants used to this aim is diesel fuel. Injection of diesel fuel before the adsorber can purge it — the NOx is made to desorb and react with hydrocarbons under rich conditions to produce water and nitrogen. Also hydrogen is a good reductant, but is dangerous and difficult to store. Some experimental systems have used fuel reformers for on-board hydrogen generation.|$|R
50|$|A <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber</b> is {{designed}} to reduce oxides of nitrogen emitted in the exhaust gas of a lean burn internal combustion engine. Lean burn engines, particularly diesels, present a special challenge to emission control system designers because of the relatively high levels of O2 (atmospheric oxygen) in the exhaust gas. The 3-way catalytic converter that has been successfully used since the 1980s on stoichiometric engines (such as fueled by petrol, LPG, CNG, or ethanol) will not function at O2 levels in excess of 1.0%, and does not function well at levels above 0.5%. Because of the increasing need to limit NOx emissions from diesel engines, technologies such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) have been used, however EGR is of limited effectiveness and SCR requires a continuous supply of reductant to the exhaust.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a simple model for simulating the transient {{behavior of a}} lean <b>NOx</b> <b>adsorber.</b> The model is based on one-dimensional differential approximations of mass balance equations for nitrogen oxides (NOx) that can be integrated very quickly (i. e., faster than real time). In this paper we focus specifically on the lean (or capture) phase of adsorber operation. During this phase, NOx {{is removed from the}} exhaust gas and reversibly reacted with alkali metal oxides in the monolith washcoat to form nitrates. We describe the driving force for the nitration reactions in terms of a pseudo-equilibrium sorption isotherm, which can be experimentally measured. The approach to (pseudo) equilibrium at each axial location is controlled by diffusion across the boundary layer and solid-phase diffusion within the washcoat.
