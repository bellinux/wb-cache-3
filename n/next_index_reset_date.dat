For practical application, we use the reset call options with continuous <b>reset</b> <b>dates</b> as control variates to evaluate the prices of six arithmetic average reset options listed on Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1998 to 1999.

In practice, reset options have been traded for many years. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) both introduced S&P 500 index put warrants with three-month reset period in late 1996. Morgan Stanley issued a reset warrant with an initial strike price of $ 44. 73 in July 1997.

40|$|Banks incur {{a variety}} of risks and utilise {{different}} techniques to manage the exposures so created. Some of those techniques are internal to the bank. For example, the law of large numbers enables banks to diversify away liquidity risk or default risk from a portfolio of retail loans. Alternatively, matching of asset and liability characteristics such as interest rate <b>reset</b> <b>dates</b> removes interest rate risk. Other techniques involve use of markets. For example, banks can take positions in markets in interest rate options and futures to manage interest rate risk. Unfortunately, one type of exposure does not appear amenable to either of these risk management techniques. This is the credit risk arising from loans extended to large corporate customers. While a portfolio of corporate loans can provide some protection by diversification, most banks face significant residual exposure to large corporate customers.

40|$|AbstractWe {{develop a}} {{straightforward}} algorithm to price arithmetic average reset options with multiple <b>reset</b> <b>dates</b> in a Cox et al. (CRR) (1979)  [10] framework. The {{use of a}} lattice approach is due to its adaptability and flexibility in managing arithmetic average reset options, as already evidenced by Kim et al. (2003)  [9]. Their model {{is based on the}} Hull and White (1993)  [5] bucketing algorithm and uses an exogenous exponential function to manage the averaging feature, but their choice of fictitious values does not guarantee the algorithm’s convergence (cfr., Forsyth et al. (2002)  [11]). We propose to overcome this drawback by selecting a limited number of trajectories among the ones reaching each node of the lattice, where we compute effective averages. In this way, the computational cost of the pricing problem is reduced, and the convergence of the discrete time model to the corresponding continuous time one is guaranteed...|$|R

40|$|Using {{two large}} {{proprietary}} datasets from New England, this paper establishes some basic {{facts about the}} subprime crisis. First, while unaffordable interest-rate resets are often blamed for setting off this crisis, most subprime borrowers who defaulted did so {{well in advance of}} their <b>reset</b> <b>dates.</b> Defaults on subprime adjustable-rate mortgages are more sensitive to declining housing prices than are defaults on fixed-rate loans, however, and the data support a number of alternative explanations for this finding. Second, many borrowers with good credit scores took out subprime loans as the housing boom gathered steam. It is hard to construct a prima facie case that these borrowers were inappropriately steered into the subprime market, however, because the loans that these borrowers took out were too risky for prime treatment. Finally, 70 % of Massachusetts homes recently lost to foreclosure were originally purchased with prime mortgages. But subprime refinancing is especially prevalent among owners who were likely to have extracted substantial amounts of equity before they defaulted. Mortgage Subprime Crisis...|$|R
50|$|The {{reference}} {{rate and the}} frequency at which the rate is reset are contractually set. The rate used is often some form of LIBOR, but it can take different forms, such as tying it to the consumer price index, a housing price index, or an unemployment rate. The rate can be allowed to reset on an immediate, daily, or some type of monthly or yearly schedule. The rate can be computed by taking its set stated rate and subtracting the {{reference rate}} at the <b>reset</b> <b>date.</b> Caps and floors are often placed within inverse floaters to avoid unattractive features to investors (such as a negative coupon). Typically, the floor is set at zero and a cap may be set (e.g. 10%). If a floater is involved a cap is put on the floater to match up with the inverse's floor, and vice versa. This is done since both are derived from the same fixed-rate asset.|$|R
