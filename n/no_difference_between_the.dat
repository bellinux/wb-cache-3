5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what {{religion}} is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> experiencer and the experience.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rich and the poor.|$|E

25|$|For vigabatrin, {{there is}} no range of target {{concentrations}} because researchers found <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> serum concentration levels of responders and those of non-responders. Instead, the duration of action {{is believed to be}} more a function of the GABA-T resynthesis rate; levels of GABA-T do not usually return to their normal state until six days after stopping the medication.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Chow test {{is used to}} {{test whether}} two subsamples both have the same {{underlying}} true coefficient values. The sum of squared residuals of regressions {{on each of the}} subsets and on the combined data set are compared by computing an F-statistic; if this exceeds a critical value, the null hypothesis of <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two subsets is rejected; otherwise, it is accepted.|$|E

25|$|To express {{nuances of}} {{grammatical}} mood, several special verb forms are used, which {{are derived from}} the indicative (non-modal) forms. Wishes and commands are formed with an optative system, whose principal characteristic is the element -i, which is attached directly to the verb stem. There is <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> form for transitive and intransitive verbs, there being agreement with {{the subject of the}} sentence. Tense markers are unchanged in the optative.|$|E
25|$|In a {{homogeneous}} specimen, there is <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two beams, and no contrast is being generated. However, near a refractive boundary (say a nucleus within the cytoplasm), {{the difference between}} the ordinary and the extraordinary beam will generate a relief in the image. Differential interference contrast requires a polarized light source to function; two polarizing filters have to be fitted in the light path, one below the condenser (the polarizer), and the other above the objective (the analyzer).|$|E

25|$|Few {{argued that}} there was <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two worlds, but some were {{convinced}} that the difference itself was the primary danger. Charles Maynes worried that a military force consisting primarily of enlisted personnel from the lower socio-economic classes would ultimately refuse {{to fight for the}} goals of the upper classes. Tarr and Roman, on the other hand, were concerned that the similarities between military elites and civilian elites enabled a dangerous politicizing trend among the military. Chivers represented a small number who believed that the differences between the cultures were so small as essentially to be irrelevant.|$|E
25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} human rights, the courts have stated that there is <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> protection offered by the common law, and that guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. The right to freedom of expression has traditionally been considered as residual in character but certain types of speech are protected in positive terms. This is the case of debates in Parliament which are protected by parliamentary privilege, media reporting on parliamentary proceedings is covered by absolute privilege, while reports of court proceedings are protected by qualified privilege so long as they are fair, accurate and not published with malice.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species have}} a sperm {{transplant}} mechanism. Crickets are one such species that can prematurely remove spermatophore after copulation, which terminates sperm transfer. In one study, males {{were randomly assigned}} to females to create half-sib families to determine the heritability of spermatophore retention time in females. The researchers found that there was additive genetic variance in the timing of spermatophore removal by females. These results suggest that the timing of the spermatophore removal is determined partly by genotype and is independent of the quality of a female's mate. This shows <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> fitness of females who freely remove the spermatophore and the fitness of females that are forced to accept complete ejaculates.|$|E

25|$|On average, stem mothers {{distribute}} themselves {{among the}} leaves of a Populus tree according to the ideal free distribution model. Stem mothers sharing a leaf have to split the available resources, and this sharing comes {{at a cost to}} the stem mother's reproductive success. Two stem mothers sharing a leaf spend a significant amount of their time engaging in territorial behavior instead of feeding or gall forming. Thus, stem mothers sharing a leaf produce less offspring than single stem mothers on leaves of the same size. When one stem mother is removed from a shared leaf, the reproductive success of the remaining occupant(s) rise accordingly. Some stem mothers choose to settle alone on smaller leaves instead of sharing a larger leaf with another individual. This creates a scenario where, on average, there is <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> reproductive success of stem mothers occupying leaves singly and stem mothers sharing leaves with other individuals.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{identify}} differentially expressed genes using a {{fold change}} cutoff, {{one can use}} a variety of statistical tests or omnibus tests such as ANOVA, all of which consider both fold change and variability to create a p-value, an estimate of how often we would observe the data by chance alone. Applying p-values to microarrays is complicated by the large number of multiple comparisons (genes) involved. For example, a p-value of 0.05 is typically thought to indicate significance, since it estimates a 5% probability of observing the data by chance. But with 10,000 genes on a microarray, 500 genes would be identified as significant at p < 0.05 even if there were <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> experimental groups. One obvious solution is to consider significant only those genes meeting a much more stringent p value criterion, e.g., one could perform a Bonferroni correction on the p-values, or use a false discovery rate calculation to adjust p-values in proportion to the number of parallel tests involved. Unfortunately, these approaches may reduce the number of significant genes to zero, even when genes are in fact differentially expressed. Current statistics such as Rank products aim {{to strike a balance between}} false discovery of genes due to chance variation and non-discovery of differentially expressed genes. Commonly cited methods include the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and a wide variety of methods are available from Bioconductor and a variety of analysis packages from bioinformatics companies.|$|E
