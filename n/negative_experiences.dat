He briefed Roosevelt on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which had {{concluded}} that an atomic bomb was feasible, and on the German nuclear energy project, about which little was known. Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program. To control it, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Marshall. On Bush's advice, Roosevelt chose the army to run the project rather than the navy, although the navy had shown far more interest in the field, and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush's <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> with the Navy had convinced him {{that it would not}} listen to his advice, and could not handle large-scale construction projects.|$|E
40|$|It is {{said that}} even if people have <b>negative</b> <b>experience,</b> they can {{overcome}} it and also find a positive meaning in it. But, this changing process and details of positive meaning have not been proved. This study had interview with 23 undergraduates, who interpreted their <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> positively. Results were led from qualitative analysis about coping with <b>negative</b> <b>experience,</b> chance of overcoming, present state, details of positive meaning. In practical, people coped with their situation by themselves or with help of other people, and considering <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> to mental food is typical. In overcoming process, later positive experiences were important, and positive meaning became bigger relatively little by little. The coping process led to details of positive meaning including their own growth and new human relations...|$|R
30|$|Students {{wanting to}} avoid cold call or random call {{after they have}} had a <b>negative</b> <b>experience,</b> or even after they {{perceived}} that a classmate has had a <b>negative</b> <b>experience,</b> is consistent with psychology literature which suggests that if students have a <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> in class, then their fear of negative evaluation, and consequently their anxiety, is only going to be exacerbated in future situations (Heimberg et al. 2010). Thus, we would predict that repeatedly exposing students to cold call or random call would not help to decrease their anxiety unless they had a positive experience, which none of the students in our study described (Heimberg et al. 2010).|$|R

5|$|After France {{declared}} war on Prussia in July 1870, initiating the Franco-Prussian War, Cyclop and two smaller gunboats were transferred to guard {{the mouth of the}} Elbe river. She remained there {{for the duration of the}} conflict but saw no action against the French Navy. After the Prussian victory in 1871, which saw the creation of the German Empire, along with the Imperial German Navy, she returned to her previous role as a tender in Kiel. During the year, she assisted in the transfer of a new floating dry dock from Swinemünde to Kiel. Repeated, <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> with Danish pilots led the Imperial Navy to send Cyclop to assist with navigation off Langeland. In August, Cyclop served as a tender to the aviso , which had returned from a scientific expedition. On 11 November, Cyclop was scheduled to begin an overhaul in Danzig, but an inspection of the hull revealed it to be in too poor a condition. Accordingly, she was stricken from the naval register on 19 March 1872; usable parts were removed for use in the construction of new gunboats, and she was thereafter broken up.|$|E

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{discussion}} in the literature whether personal uncertainty is indeed a threatening experience or whether people actually try to maintain it or even seek it. The current paper argues that personal uncertainty is particularly a <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> when approaching it. Furthermore, this work will demonstrate that this <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> will also have consequences for self-regulatory processes, namely the motivation to regulate personal uncertainty. Building {{on the work of}} the social cognition field, I propose that people process information in a more detailed manner when they are approaching uncertainty (Study 1). Moreover, people will judge procedures, where they can voice their opinion as more fair when approaching uncertainty (Study 2). Findings collected in different experimental paradigms provide evidence that personal uncertainty is indeed a <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> when approaching it...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} {{the validity of the}} Scale of Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Experience</b> (SPANE) in a South Africa context using a sample of 992 university students. Item fit and unidimensionality of the Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Experience</b> subscales were examined using a process of Rasch analysis. Reliability of the subscales was evaluated and correlations were between the SPANE, the Mental Health Continuum – Short Form (MHC-SF) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), were examined. In general, the SPANE exhibited good Rasch fit and reliability. However, there were two items, one from each the Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Experience</b> subscales respectively that exhibited some problems with Rasch fit. While the substantive effect of these problematic items on reliability was marginal, their identification as problematic corroborated analysis in another study, enjoining, if not their removal, certainly a direction for future research. Overall, the findings serve to both support the notion that in its present form the SPANE is a psychometrically sound instrument to measure positive and <b>negative</b> <b>experience</b> as a facet of well-being among South African university students, and to indicate directions for further research on the scale...|$|R

25|$|The {{absence of}} a global review, and the {{language}} barrier having partially hindered the flow of international information has led some international groups to level criticism at some wolf advocates, claiming that they have extrapolated America's general lack of <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> with wolves {{to the rest of}} the world, whilst ignoring the differing histories and cultures which lead to diverse interactions with the animals. Hunting proponents argue that wolves with no <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> of humans are more likely to encroach upon human settlements and attack people, citing for example the differences in attitudes toward the public distribution of firearms in America and Eurasia as examples as to why nations on both continents have differing accounts of wolf aggression. Hunting wolves is reasoned to maintain shyness in wolves, an idea which is correlated by a modern account demonstrating that wolves in protected areas are more likely to show no fear toward humans than ones in areas where they are actively hunted. Historical and recent accounts indicate that individual wolves or wolf packs that turn man-eater typically do not stop until hunted and destroyed.|$|E

Her expansive interest in the subject led her to compile a detailed theory of neurosis, with data from her patients. Horney believed neurosis to be a continuous process—with neuroses commonly occurring sporadically in one's lifetime. This was in contrast to the opinions of her contemporaries who believed neurosis was, like more severe mental conditions, a negative malfunction of the mind in response to external stimuli, such as bereavement, divorce or <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> during childhood and adolescence.|$|E

25|$|Experiences in a person's {{life are}} {{a major source of}} how {{self-esteem}} develops. In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> a child will have. Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older. Students in elementary school who have high self-esteem tend to have authoritative parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards for their child and allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.|$|E

But the city mastered these adversities more easily than what was to follow the war: the plague ravaged the city, as it would most of Europe at this time. In the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, Frankfurt was confirmed as an Imperial Free City, and soon reached new heights of prosperity. The Palais Barckhaus at Zeil in Frankfurt even served as residence of Emperor Charles VII until 1744.|$|E

Another respondent said that the Koreans in South Korea were initially nice to them, but the respondent said that Koreans in South Korea became rude to them after finding out that they could not speak Korean.

25|$|While {{the general}} {{bisexual}} {{population as a}} whole faces biphobia, this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In his examination of the bisexual male perspective, entitled, Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective, Grady L. Garner delves into the oppression that he faces as both a black and bisexual male. He explains that the internalization of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can be incredibly distressing as bisexual black males attempted to translate or transform these <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones. The experience of bisexual black males is different from that of bisexual white males. As the demands and tribulations of black bisexual males appear to be comparatively more distressing than those that black and white, homo- and heterosexual individual's encounter, this acknowledgement is important and vital to the understanding of biphobia from an intersectional perspective.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} has found {{the average length of}} abstinence for bulimics in OA was significantly higher than the average length for binge eaters. Paradoxically, bulimics were also found to attend fewer meetings, and had less of a commitment to write their thoughts and feelings down daily. However, the frequency of relapse for bulimics and binge eaters was not significantly different. The differences may be explained by the predictable nature of the bulimic cycle. Other {{research has}} found binge eaters in OA had better success than bulimics. Most OA members who have reported <b>negative</b> <b>experiences</b> in the program are anorexic. This could be caused by OA's focus on problems of eating too much rather than too little. Some OA practices, such as refraining from eating certain kinds of foods, are antithetical in the case of anorexics. Though, most anorexics have a previous history of bulimia.|$|E
