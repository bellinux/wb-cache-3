25|$|The {{conversion}} of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH) is performed by bacteria {{such as the}} <b>Nitrosomonas</b> species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, {{are responsible for the}} oxidation of the nitrites (NO) into nitrates (NO). It is important for the ammonia (NH) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrification {{itself is}} a two-step aerobic process, each step {{facilitated}} by {{a different type of}} bacteria. The oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2−) is most often facilitated by <b>Nitrosomonas</b> spp. ("nitroso" [...] referring to the formation of a nitroso functional group). Nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO3−), though traditionally believed to be facilitated by Nitrobacter spp. (nitro referring the formation of a nitro functional group), is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by Nitrospira spp.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrification is {{the process}} by which ammonia (...) is {{converted}} to nitrate (...) [...] [...] Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite (...) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. <b>Nitrosomonas)</b> and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Nitrobacter). [...] Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms. [...] Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine (...) by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase in the cytoplasm, followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in the periplasm.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the in-place remediation of trichloroethylene in soil and ground water instead of removal for off-site treatment and disposal. Naturally-occurring bacteria have been identified with the ability to degrade TCE. Dehalococcoides sp. degrade trichloroethylene by reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, Pseudomonas fluorescens can co-metabolize TCE. Soil and ground water contamination by TCE has also been successfully remediated by chemical treatment and extraction. The bacteria <b>Nitrosomonas</b> europaea can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene.

2500|$|A {{well-balanced}} tank contains {{organisms that}} {{are able to}} metabolize the waste products of other aquarium residents. This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle. Bacteria known as nitrifiers (genus <b>Nitrosomonas)</b> metabolize nitrogen waste. Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce nitrite. Nitrite is toxic to fish in high concentrations. Another type of bacteria (genus Nitrospira) converts nitrite into nitrate, a less toxic substance. (Nitrobacter bacteria were previously believed to fill this role. While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as Nitrospira, it has recently been found that Nitrobacter are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while Nitrospira are plentiful.) However, commercial products sold as kits to [...] "jump start" [...] the nitrogen cycle often still contain Nitrobacter.|$|E
2500|$|Many soil {{bacteria}} possess the enzyme urease, which catalyzes conversion of urea to ammonia (NH3) or ammonium ion (NH4+) and bicarbonate ion (HCO3−). Thus urea fertilizers rapidly transform to the ammonium form in soils. Among the {{soil bacteria}} known to carry urease, some ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), such as species of <b>Nitrosomonas,</b> can also assimilate {{the carbon dioxide}} the reaction releases to make biomass via the Calvin cycle, and harvest energy by oxidizing ammonia (the other product of urease) to nitrite, a process termed [...] nitrification.C- and 15N-labeled urea added to soil|journal= Biology and Fertility of Soils|volume= 42|issue= 2|pages= 137|year= 2005|last1= Marsh|first1= K.

[...] Ammonium and nitrate are readily absorbed by plants, and are the dominant sources of nitrogen for plant growth. [...] Urea is also used in many multi-component solid fertilizer formulations. [...] Urea is highly soluble in water and is therefore also very suitable for use in fertilizer solutions (in combination with ammonium nitrate: UAN), e.g., in 'foliar feed' fertilizers. For fertilizer use, granules are preferred over prills because of their narrower particle size distribution, which is an advantage for mechanical application.|$|E
