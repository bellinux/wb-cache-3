25|$|Amidst the {{southern}} villages, Nuits-Saint-Georges the largest {{town in the}} region with producers often selling their wine to the north. The local wines are most of 'Villages' quality, and need longer aging in the cellar than most Burgundies of similar quality. Wines from Premeaux-Prissey are sold under the Nuits-Saint-Georges appellation and as Côte de <b>Nuits</b> Villages. Comblanchien gives {{its name to the}} seam of limestone {{in the middle of the}} Côte d'Or. Its wine is sold as Côte de <b>Nuits</b> Villages. The southernmost village of Corgoloin is also covered by the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> Villages appellation.|$|E
25|$|Wine {{produced}} in the Cote de <b>Nuits</b> can fall under several Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) depending on where the grapes were grown and whether they were blended with grapes from other areas. All wines {{produced in}} the Cote de <b>Nuits</b> is entitled to the basic AOC Bourgogne designation for either its blanc Chardonnay wines or it rouge pinot noir. A higher quality AOC is the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> Villages, a general appellation for wines from five of the smaller communes : Fixin and Brochon in the north, Comblanchien, Corgoloin and Prissey to the south. The Hautes-Côtes de <b>Nuits</b> are a separate appellation for the hills {{to the west of}} Nuits-St-Georges. Individual 'village' appellations are the next step up, although not all match the commune boundaries or names. Notably in the north the Marsannay appellation covers Marsannay-la-Côte and parts of Couchey and Chênove. The Premiers Crus are the next level and roughly correspond to individual vineyards that weren't deemed good enough for Grand Cru status.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 at the Paris Exposition Universelle, the Comité d'Agriculture de Beaune tasked Dr. Jules Lavalle with coming up with a similar {{classification}} of the vineyards of the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> and Côte de Beaune for the 1862 International Exhibition in London. The history of the tête de cuvée and making wine from a single vineyard estate was more established in the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> than Côte de Beaune which was reflected in Lavalle's defining over 20 vineyards in the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> worthy of cru for red wines while the Côte de Beaune had only one exceptional vineyard. Lavalle's classification would serve as foundation for the official establishment of Grand cru and premier cru in the 1930s as Appellation d'origine contrôlée or AOCs. Today there are 24 Grand cru vineyards in the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> clustered around six villages and more than 100 premier cru vineyards throughout the region.|$|E

25|$|The {{two primary}} grapes of the Cote de <b>Nuits,</b> pinot noir and Chardonnay, are {{believed}} to be indigenous to the Burgundy wine region. Through centuries of trial and error, the two varieties have shown to produce the most consistent quality in the region. Broadly speaking, pinot noir tends to be planted in areas with high proportion of marl while Chardonnay is most often found in vineyards that are dominated by limestone. As the Cote de <b>Nuits</b> has many areas with significant amounts of marl, pinot noir is the dominant planting in the area. As a grape variety, pinot noir is very reflective of the terroir it is grown in which, coupled with the highly variable soils of the area, can cause two Cote de <b>Nuits</b> wine producers in the same year and by the same producer to be dramatically different due to where exactly they were grown.|$|E

25|$|Some of the winemakers {{producing}} those hard, dense wines {{would use}} some of small segments of white grapes grown in the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> as a softening blend {{in a manner similar}} to how white grapes were historically used in Chianti. While for most of its history, the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> had been firmly associated with red grape varieties, the 16th and 17th century saw an increase in plantings of white grape varieties, like Chardonnay and Fromenteau. White grapes continue to be found scattered throughout the area, including a notable white Chambertain, until the mid 19th century when nearly all premier and Grand cru vineyards became completely dedicated to pinot noir.|$|E
25|$|Located {{near the}} 47th {{parallel}} north, the Cote de <b>Nuits</b> {{is one of}} the northernmost regions to produce premium quality red wines. However, this northerly location brings with it a lot of vintage variation from year to year. From winter time hail, spring time frost and cool autumns that may bring devastating rains that impede ripening and harvest, the quality of each vintage can be highly variable. The vineyards of the Cote de <b>Nuits</b> are planted on east and southeast facing slopes that receive the most opportune sun exposures with vineyards designated as premier and grand cru almost always planted on this ideal aspect at elevations between 800–1000ft (250–300 m).|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being made}} {{primarily}} from the same grape, pinot noir, winemaking styles in the Cote de <b>Nuits</b> is far from monolithic. The individual style of the producer or negociant and the decisions they make at {{each step of the}} winemaking process — beginning with the sorting table as they grapes arrive from the harvest — will affect the resulting quality of the wine immensely. It is this reason, along with the varied and complex ownership of most grand and premier cru vineyards, that most wine experts put more weight on the reputation of the producer and the vintage year than on the vineyard name when it comes to evaluating all Burgundy wine-the Cote de <b>Nuits</b> not excluded.|$|E

25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Louis XIV, his {{personal}} physician Guy-Crescent Fagon recommended that he drink only wines from <b>Nuits</b> St-Georges for their health giving properties. Wine merchants in the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> latched onto this royal association as a great marketing coup over the region's rivals in Champagne and Bordeaux. The 18th century ushered {{in a period of}} tête de cuvée of wines made solely from the best grapes produced in single vineyards. To add to the distinctiveness of these wines, new winemaking techniques such as extended maceration and longer fermentations became popular. This produced dark, tannic vin de garde wines that required extended periods of aging. Imitation of this style by producers using lower quality of grapes saw producers use various methods of adulteration such as adding honey to the wine in order to increase the sugar and, consequently, the alcohol level of the wine. Following Jean-Antoine Chaptal's, Napoleon's Minister of the Interior, recommendation to use the method now known as chaptalization to boost alcohol levels, the market was flooded with Burgundy wines from the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> and beyond that were dark, dense and highly alcoholic.|$|E
25|$|Of the red grapes, the {{majority}} of production in the Côte d'Or {{is focused on the}} Pinot noir grape, while the Gamay grape is grown in Beaujolais. In the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> region, 90% of the production is red grapes.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> is {{wrapped up in the}} history of the greater Cote d'Or. The Romans were the first to {{introduce}} viticulture into the area during their settlement of Gaul sometime during the 3rd century AD. Breaking away from the typical Roman style of planting near rivers, the Romans encouraged their allies in the area, the Aedui to plant vines on the narrow strip of land that was located to the east of their settlement at Augustodunum. It was this area, known asPagus Arebrignus, that was to eventually be subdivided into the Côte de <b>Nuits</b> and Côte de Beaune. When the area was under attack from the Alamans and other Germanic tribes, the Romans sought the help of a Baltic tribe known as the Burgundians who would eventually settle into the area and give the region its name.|$|E
