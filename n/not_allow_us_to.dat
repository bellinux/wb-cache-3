25|$|The claims may be {{categorized}} into linguistic decipherments, identifying {{the language of}} the inscription, and non-linguistic decipherments. A purely ideographical reading is not linguistic in the strict sense: while it may reveal the meaning of the inscription, it would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> identify the underlying language.|$|E
25|$|As {{the range}} of {{permissible}} transformations becomes broader, {{the range of}} objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by {{the application of the}} transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a critical discussion {{of our present}} knowledge of intergalactic matter and radiation {{as it relates to}} cosmology. While there have been some observational successes and much theoretical speculation, studies of intergalactic matter and radiation have still <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> draw certain conclusions about the origin and evolution of the universe...|$|R
30|$|Equations (1) and (2) <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> model, in {{a pretty}} much ad hoc way, {{transitions}} between informal and formal jobs. Sadly, the short time frame that each individual is observed, does <b>not</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> use a proper transition model. Finally, another element {{to keep in mind}} is that, since we are working with a non-behavioral model, we do not control for the role that Social Security might have on the choice between having a formal or informal job.|$|R
25|$|Quantum physics does <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> access {{all this}} {{information}} directly, though. A measurement will yield only one of all possible values, destroying all others. If not for the no cloning theorem, we could first measure f(x) without measuring x, and then make a few copies of the resulting state (which is a superposition of states all having the same f(x)). Measuring x on these states would provide different x values which give the same f(x), leading to the period. Because we cannot make exact copies of a quantum state, this method does not work. Therefore, we have to carefully transform the superposition to another state that will return the correct answer with high probability. This is achieved by the quantum Fourier transform.|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E
25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E
30|$|However, {{this plot}} does <b>not</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{rule out the}} {{existence}} of several low scale attackers which would have a behavior similar to low performing genuine users. As matter of fact, the bulk of participants contribute only a few moves before leaving the system. Attackers with such a behavior are impossible to detect as their profile is too similar to normal users. Indeed, the only two such reported attackers were detected thanks to the acquaintance network inferred from logs.|$|R

40|$|Focusing on {{mechanistic}} aspects, a {{study of}} the influence of the (E) /(Z) double-bond geometry of the Michael acceptor on the enantioselectivity of copper-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition reactions has been realized. In spite of numerous articles concerning copper-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition reactions, the major factors of such a reaction are quite difficult to elucidate. Although our experiments have <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> define strict rules, they have highlighted some factors not to be neglected when considering the approach of the copper reagent to the double bond, such as (E) /(Z) isomerization and steric aspects, which could change the reactive conformation of the substrate.

40|$|Machiavelli and {{the tyranny}} of time. By {{addressing}} the issue of tyranny in political life, this essay aims to subtract Machiavelli to the traditional reading that has flattened his thought as “Machiavellian” and, at the same time, to overcome the contemporary interpretation {{of him as a}} “champion” of republican freedom. In Machiavelli’s thought there is rather something tyrannical: the detection of a temporality of the political life constantly changing the scenario in which we move, <b>not</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> trust in the same solutions at all times.

[...] Doctor Charles Tannock, a conservative member of the European Parliament for Greater London, and others echoed those sentiments and compared the destruction to the Buddha statues destroyed by the Taliban in Bamyan, Afghanistan in 2001.

5000|$|An {{apparent}} {{problem with}} this was pointed out by Arthur Prior: Why can't we have an expression (call it [...] "tonk") whose introduction rule is that of OR (from [...] "p" [...] to [...] "p tonk q") but whose elimination rule is that of AND (from [...] "p tonk q" [...] to [...] "q")? This lets us deduce anything at all from any starting point. Prior suggested that this meant that inferential rules could not determine meaning. He was answered by Nuel Belnap, that even though introduction and elimination rules can constitute meaning, not just any pair of such rules will determine a meaningful expression—they must meet certain constraints, such as <b>not</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> deduce any new truths in the old vocabulary. These constraints are what Dummett was referring to.|$|R
2500|$|The role of our {{scientific}} {{image of}} the universe in a rational world view has always {{caught the attention of}} Mosterín. He has devoted much work to the epistemic analysis of cosmological theories and of the reliability of their claims. Together with John Earman, he has undertaken a thorough critical review of the paradigm of cosmic inflation. Earman and Mosterín conclude that, despite the widespread influence of the inflationary paradigm {{and the fact that it}} does not contradict any known results, there are as yet no good grounds for admitting any of the models of inflation into the standard core of scientific cosmology. He has also dealt with the role of speculation in cosmology. In particular, Mosterín has shown the multiple misunderstandings underlying the so-called anthropic principle and the use of anthropic explanations in cosmology. Mosterín concludes that [...] "in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know.

2500|$|On 15 April, the {{government}} army celebrated Cumberland's twenty-fifth birthday by issuing two gallons of brandy to each regiment. At Murray's suggestion, the Jacobites tried that evening {{to repeat the}} success of Prestonpans by carrying out a night attack on {{the government}} encampment. Murray proposed that they set off at dusk and march to Nairn. Murray planned {{to have the right}} wing of the first line attack Cumberland's rear, while Perth with the left wing would attack the government's front. In support of Perth, Charles Edward Stuart would bring up the second line. The Jacobite force however started out well after dark at about 20:00. Murray led the force cross country with the intention of avoiding government outposts. This however led to very slow going in the dark. Murray's one time aide-de-camp, James Chevalier de Johnstone later wrote, [...] "this march across country in a dark night which did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> follow any track, and accompanied with confusion and disorder". By the time the leading troop had reached Culraick, still [...] from where Murray's wing was to cross the River Nairn and encircle the town, there was only one hour left before dawn. After a heated council with other officers, Murray concluded that there was not enough time to mount a surprise attack and that the offensive should be aborted. O'Sullivan went to inform Charles Edward Stuart of the change of plan, but missed him in the dark. Meanwhile, instead of retracing his path back, Murray led his men left, down the Inverness road. In the darkness, while Murray led one-third of the Jacobite forces back to camp, the other two-thirds continued towards their original objective, unaware of the change in plan. One account of that night even records that Perth and Drummond made contact with government troops before realising the rest of the Jacobite force had turned home. Not long after the exhausted Jacobite forces had made it back to Culloden, reports came of the advancing government troops. By then, many Jacobite soldiers had dispersed in search of food, while others were asleep in ditches and outbuildings.|$|E

The goal of this paper is to provide a logical framework to model and reason about this process.

At a static level, IDEL does <b>not</b> only <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> model the information available to a set of agents, like standard epistemic logic, but also the issues that the agents entertain. At a dynamic level, IDEL does <b>not</b> only <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> model the effects of communicative actions that provide new information, like standard DEL, but also the effects of actions that raise new issues. Thus, IDEL provides the fundamental tools needed to analyze information exchange as a dynamic process of raising and resolving issues...|$|R
