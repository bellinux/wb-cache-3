This results in some dealers being knowledgeable about specific tyres but not Nokian Tyre's full tyre product range.|$|E

5|$|Evins {{incorporated}} Cracker Barrel in February 1970, {{and soon}} opened more locations. In the early 1970s, the firm leased land on gasoline station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants. These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during gasoline shortages {{in the mid}} to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps. Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether as the company focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues. Cracker Barrel became a publicly traded company in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion. It floated {{more than half a million}} shares, raising $4.6 million. Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel grew at a rate of around 20percent per year; by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual <b>net</b> <b>sales</b> of almost $81 million.|$|E

Net income losses were incurred in 2012 and 2014. In 2010, Nintendo revealed that Iwata earned a modest salary of ¥68 million (US$770,000), which increased to ¥187 million (US$2.11million) with performance based bonuses. In comparison, Miyamoto earned {{a salary of}} ¥100 million (US$1.13million). Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 as apologies for the poor sales while {{other members of the}} Nintendo board of directors had pay cuts of 20–30percent. This also served to ensure the job security of Nintendo's employees, preventing workers from being laid off in order to improve short-term finances. In 2012, the company experienced its first operating loss since entering the video game market more than 30years earlier. Losses continued {{for the next two years}} before the company finally returned to profitability at the end of the 2015fiscal year. The slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E

40|$|Does legal {{insider trading}} {{contribute}} to market efficiency? Using the refinement {{proposed by the}} recent microstructure literature, we analyze the information content of legal insider trading. Our sample encompasses 2, 110 different companies subject to 59, 244 aggregated daily insider trades over the period from January 1995 {{to the end of}} September 1999. Our main findings are the followings. (i) Consistent with previous literature, financial markets offer a mild response in terms of abnormal returns to insider trading activities. (ii) The univariate analysis of stock prices on insider net purchase and <b>net</b> <b>sale</b> days suggests insiders' market timing ability. (iii) Market liquidity seems to be weaker on insider net purchase days, indicating that net buyer insiders are on average market liquidity consumers. (iv) Market liquidity seems to be higher on insider <b>net</b> <b>sale</b> days, indicating that net seller insiders are on average market liquidity providers. (v) The analysis of the considered information proxy reveals that insiders enhance market efficiency. Insider trading clearly permits faster price discovery on insider trading days. legal insider trading, market efficiency, order imbalance...|$|R

25|$|Business {{enterprises}} contributed 59.1 % of US GERD in 2012, {{down from}} 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute {{a small fraction}} of total R, 3.3% and 3.8% respectively. The USA has historically been a leader in business R and innovation. The economic recession of 2008–2009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the US recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the US Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business ‘deaths’ began overtaking the number of business ‘births’ and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1–2% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R spending were in agriculture production: -3.5% compared to the average R to <b>net</b> <b>sales</b> ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R to <b>net</b> <b>sales</b> ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.|$|E
