40|$|<b>Niche</b> <b>markets</b> for {{livestock}} products are growing both nationally and within Iowa. Broadly, <b>niche</b> <b>markets</b> address consumer demand for product differentiation while enabling producers {{to take a}} more active role in price determination. This creates opportunities for individuals who are interested in raising livestock following a production model different from typical commodity production. Student interest in pursuing livestock production for <b>niche</b> <b>markets</b> is strong at Iowa State University. In response to exit-interview requests for coursework addressing production of livestock for <b>niche</b> <b>markets,</b> a course was developed by the authors. In the first semester (Fall 2008), 42 students enrolled in the course.

5|$|In August 1996, JAL Flight Academy was restructured, J-Air was {{separated}} and {{established as a}} wholly owned regional subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines on August 8. On November 1, the airline inaugurated its first flight from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport and was building up service on smaller-demand domestic routes, which larger aircraft could not serve economically. However, the local government subsidy was terminated {{at the end of}} the 2000 fiscal year and the airline was required to become self-sufficient. As part of its domestic marketing strategy, JAL found a <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> where the 100-plus-seats Boeing 737s were too large and frequent services were in demand, and began repositioning the airline. Fifty-seats Bombardier CRJ-200s were introduced and progressively replaced the five JS31s until completion in August 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{photovoltaics}} (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell {{recognized the importance of}} this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.|$|E
5|$|While its Japanese success {{had been}} taken for granted by Square executives, North America and Europe were another matter, as {{up to that time}} the Japanese {{role-playing}} genre was still a <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> in Western territories. Sony, due to the PlayStation's struggles against Nintendo and Sega's home consoles, lobbied for the publishing rights in North America and Europe following Final Fantasy VIIs transfer to PlayStation—to further persuade Square, Sony offered a lucrative royalties deal with profits potentially equaling those Square would get by self-publishing the game. Square accepted Sony's offer as Square itself lacked Western publishing experience. Square was uncertain about the game's success, as other JRPGs including Final Fantasy VI had met with poor sales outside Japan. To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa. It was first exhibited to the Western public at Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996 (E3).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Niche</b> <b>marketing</b> has {{recently}} received {{a great deal}} of attention in the agri-food trade press and in academic circles as a legitimate strategy for small- and medium-sized agri-food firms. Due to the limited theoretical treatment of agri-food <b>niche</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy, the paper will apply marketing concepts from the general management literature (e. g., Porter; Linneman and Stanton) to agri-food industries. The first objective of the paper is to introduce the three elements of <b>niche</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies and show how these elements can be used to form a strategy identification matrix. The matrix is intended to be used by agribusiness decision makers to assist in the development of <b>niche</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies. The second objective is to provide examples of successful <b>niche</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies that have appeared in the literature related to agricultural markets. More than forty such examples have been identified and collected. These case studies will be analyzed, and their relationship to the niche strategy matrix will be examined. Marketing,...|$|R

5|$|The {{craft of}} making reborn dolls {{began in the}} United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long {{tradition}} of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism. The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls. In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The <b>niche</b> <b>market</b> for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have been started {{as a result of this}} popularity.|$|E
