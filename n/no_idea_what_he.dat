500|$|Adelina Poerio {{was cast}} as the {{fleeting}} red-coated figure after Roeg saw her photo at a casting session in Rome. Standing at only 4'2" [...] tall, she had {{a career as a}} singer. Renato Scarpa was cast as Inspector Longhi, despite not being able to speak English and so he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying in the film.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but you had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was or {{what he was going}} to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E

Although he knows {{a great deal about}} sports statistics, he knows very little about anything else. This of course doesn't stop Rynoh from acting like an authority on everything under the Sun, though once he opens his mouth, it's clear <b>he</b> has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> talking about. He is voiced by Cory Doran.|$|R
2500|$|Lee {{returned}} to his parents' home in Harlem in 1923 with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to do}} next. He considered returning to music, but an old school friend suggested that he try boxing. At one amateur match, fight announcer Joe Humphries saw the name [...] "Canagata, Lee" [...] on the card he was using. He tossed the card aside and instead announced [...] "Canada Lee"—a name that Lee liked and adopted. In the amateur ring he won 90 out of 100 bouts and the national amateur lightweight title.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977 Chappell {{signed to}} play for World Series Cricket along with his brothers. He had {{failed to make the}} first team for WA for the 1977–78 season when Dennis Lillee {{approached}} him. Chappell later recalled, [...] "Lillee said to me, [...] "Bad luck about not making it in the WA team. Don't worry, something better might come along." [...] I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant. And a few days later [...] Robinson, Dennis' manager, rang and said, [...] "Do you want to join World Series Cricket" [...] and I said, [...] "Yeah, where do I sign?"" ...|$|E
2500|$|Aaron {{surmised that}} this setting would also return the Apollo 12 {{telemetry}} to normal. When {{he made the}} recommendation to the Flight Director, [...] "Flight, try SCE to Aux", most of his mission control colleagues had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was talking about. Both the flight director and the Capcom asked him to repeat the recommendation. Pete Conrad's response to the order was, [...] "What the hell is that?" [...] Fortunately Alan Bean {{was familiar with the}} location of the SCE switch inside the capsule, and flipped it to auxiliary. Telemetry was immediately restored, allowing the mission to continue. This earned Aaron the lasting respect of his colleagues, who declared that he was a [...] "steely-eyed missile man".|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{websites}} start {{popping up}} with conspiracies about the 4400, including one regarding Orson. Shawn walks in while {{his brother and}} his girlfriend are viewing this website. Shawn is also confronted by his brother regarding the fight, and claims <b>he</b> has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> talking about. However, he visits his cousin {{in the hospital and}} briefly wakes him from his coma by grabbing on to him, thus realizing that he has some sort of supernatural ability.|$|R

They discuss it and he reassures her that while <b>he</b> has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing, {{he wants to have}} the baby, and she's very happy and relieved. On St. Patrick's Day, John and Natalie stare at one another as he dances with Marty. After being pushed down the stairs, Marty and John discover that their baby has been miscarried.|$|R

2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew what he was up to. [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E
2500|$|According to David Thomson, Rivette was [...] "famous {{for having}} {{little or no}} home life, {{certainly}} not a private life that overlaps with his work. On his own, he would rather sit in the dark with another movie"; in 1956, he was described as [...] "too aloof and forbiddingly intellectual". Bulle Ogier described Rivette as very secretive about his life: [...] "I've <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does. I only see him when we're filming" [...] or when she bumped into him in public, although she felt close to him. According to Ogier, he had neuroses and anxiety which often prevented him from answering the phone, and talking about his personal life would be indiscreet and a betrayal. Laurence Côte said that joining Rivette's inner circle of trusted friends was difficult and required [...] "a number of hurdles to overcome and to respect codes." [...] Martine Marignac said that Rivette was very modest and shy, and that his circle of close friends grew used to not hearing from him for prolonged periods of time. Marignac also said that [...] "He spends his life going to the movies, but also reading, listening to music. It {{is clear that the}} world of reality assaults him." [...] Jonathan Romney reported that in the 1970s [...] "Rivette sometimes went AWOL from his own shoots, he would invariably be found watching some rarity in one of the Left Bank art cinemas." [...] Jean-Pierre Léaud, who described Rivette as a close friend, said that he [...] "was the only person who saw everything in a film. And he transmitted everything he saw to us, setting in march our own aesthetic ideas". The director {{was the subject of a}} 1990 documentary, Jacques Rivette, the Night Watchman, directed by Claire Denis and Serge Daney. Travis Mackenzie Hoover wrote that the documentary portrays Rivette with [...] "lonerish tendencies" [...] and as [...] "a sort of transient with no home or country, wandering about or loitering in public space instead of staking out some personal terra firma." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{explaining}} to the Narrator {{that she did}} everything she could to stop Justin from asking her to prom, Naomi goes up to Justin and asks him if he smokes. Justin tells her he doesn't, but if that's what she needs to go to prom with him, then he'll get her weed. He then divulges to the Narrator that <b>he</b> has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing, but he just cares too much about Naomi to have told her no ("One School").|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} episode 'What Lies Beneath', the crew accidentally uncover a drug-smuggling ring when Kate strays off course. When {{questioning}} {{one of the}} smugglers, he refuses to tell her anything, saying that 'nice middle-class chicks like you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth'. Kate smirks for a moment, before telling the smugglers about her brother who died of a drug overdose after she refused to give him money. At {{the end of the}} episode, after getting the information they need, Mike offers condolences for her brother, but she tells him she has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> talking about.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is amazing," [...] he admitted, [...] "but {{it is the}} truth. I know it for a fact. The man was {{absolutely}} beside himself, he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said the}} diplomat, {{with a little}} bow and an incredulous expression, as if the lady could have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might yet know, [...] "I am so much obliged to you! I am so thankful!" ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{not angry}} with him now, but puzzled; she had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant: she {{accepted}} the situation, she had indeed a vague {{feeling that he was}} behaving in a very noble fashion and that she ought to admire it; but also she felt inclined to laugh at him and perhaps even to despise him a little.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, on Voyager {{the genuine}} crew is having problems. A faulty {{component}} in Neelix's galley has disrupted systems {{all over the}} ship. It seems {{he picked up the}} component as a trade, in exchange for a load of supplies that he sent to a shelter for orphans, and failed to test it before installing it. In the middle of the mess the ship gets a call from Orek, the head of mining operations at a nearby planet. He is angry that Janeway has run off without dropping off the dilithium she had promised him. Naturally, she has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> talking about.|$|R
50|$|The {{young man}} says he almost {{finished}} it. He knows that it’s all over for him; he’ll never spend another night {{as a free}} man. He is desperate {{to know that he}} did the right thing; that it wasn’t all for nothing. Paul has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> talking about. The man tells him he has to know, because the voice told the man to tell him about them all. “God’s voice,” he says. He knows it’s Him, because he saw GOD IS NOW HERE in his own blood. He asks a stunned Paul if they are the good ones.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have a {{suitable}} messenger." [...] He turned to Williamson. [...] "Nobody would suspect Dick, and he'd be safe, because he'd have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing. He's going {{up with me}} in the car to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{intends to}} go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, {{and he is a}} {{first-class}} chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors." ...|$|E
60|$|Felix {{drew the}} bow softly, perplexedly over the strings. He had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should play. Then {{his eyes were}} caught and held by Naomi's burning, mesmeric, blue gaze as she lay on her {{crumpled}} pillow. A strange, inspired look came over the boy's face. He began to play {{as if it were}} not he who played, but some mightier power, of which he was but the passive instrument.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{looked at}} her, helplessly. A girl in tears was a {{creature}} wholly beyond his experience, {{and he had}} <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> ought to do in such an emergency. He therefore adopted what was, doubtless, the best course, had he but known it, of letting her alone. After a time, the violence of her crying abated, and only short sobs broke from her, as she sat with her face hidden in her hands.|$|E
5000|$|In {{reaction}} to the sentiment that the military exercises might in fact be movement against American citizens, Dallas Morning News columnist Jacquielynn Floyd wrote a column titled, [...] "Abbott should counter, not cater to, Texans' crazy Jade Helm fears," [...] noting that Abbott's [...] "response to this nut-studded fruitcake of fear was unfortunate." [...] On April 29, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed the concerns of critics in the regular press briefing, saying, [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> thinking," [...] regarding Abbott's letter to the Texas Guard. [...] "In no way will the constitutional rights or civil liberties of any American citizen be infringed upon while this exercise is being conducted." ...|$|R
60|$|Toby {{tried to}} explain that <b>he</b> had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was {{expected}} to do, and that he had been on the wagon to which he had been sent, only leaving it to wash his face; but the angry man grew still more furious.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2007, Dick was {{forcibly}} removed {{during an}} appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, after repeatedly touching guest Ivanka Trump. Jimmy Kimmel called in his security guards, Uncle Frank and Veatrice Rice, who assisted as Kimmel dragged Dick off the set by his legs. Kimmel later said [...] "Andy did a segment, {{he was a little}} out of it. Ivanka came out, he wanted a big, wet kiss. It was time for Andy to go, so I escorted him out by his feet." [...] Kimmel added, [...] "He always makes me a little uncomfortable, you have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> going to do next." [...] Kimmel also said he had spoken to Dick afterwards and that Dick was not upset about the incident.|$|R
60|$|Next {{he jumped}} five times, and I {{could hear the}} wrestling sound he made when he shook himself. I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might do next, {{and if he had}} not been {{securely}} hooked would have gotten off. I tried hard to keep the line taut and was not always successful. Like the waahoo, he performed tricks new to me. One was an awkward diving leap that somehow jerked the line in a way to alarm me. When he quit his tumbling and rushing I led him close to the boat.|$|E
60|$|In Merida, that {{wonderful}} tropic city of white towers and white streets and white-gowned women, I ran into this Englishman again. I {{wanted to see}} the magnificent ruins of Uxmal and Ake and Labna. So did he. I knew it would be a hard trip from Muna to the ruins, and so I explained. He smiled in a way to make me half ashamed of my doubts. We went together, and I found him to be a splendid fellow. We parted without knowing each other's names. I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought of me, but I thought he must have been somebody.|$|E
6000|$|... "Coffee 'n' rolls!" [...] {{repeated}} the dummy, {{and soon the}} waiter placed them before her. Of course she had no appetite, as her constitution, being mostly wood, did not require food; but she watched the shop girl, and saw her put the coffee to her mouth and drink it. Therefore the wax lady did the same, and the next instant was surprised to feel the hot liquid trickling out between her wooden ribs. The coffee also blistered her wax lips, and so disagreeable was the experience that she arose and left the restaurant, paying {{no attention to the}} demands of the waiter for [...] "20 cents, mum." [...] Not that she intended to defraud him, but the poor creature had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant by [...] "20 cents, mum." ...|$|E
500|$|Described as a [...] "weaselly scion" [...] and a [...] "corrupt and incompetent jerk who's {{in charge}} of things but clearly has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing." [...] Farrell {{explained}} the motivation he gave to the character, stating [...] "This guy thinks he's God's gift to women, God's gift to intellect, to humor, to the club scene, to everything. It's all part of his grandiose sense of self-esteem, which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt, {{and all kinds of}} other things. With Pellit, Seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible." [...] Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character, suggesting the comb over hairstyle, pot-belly and an affinity for Chinese dragons.|$|R
50|$|Sean Cunningham, a Broadway director, {{went into}} the film {{business}} in 1969. He gathered three crew members, and with a budget of $3,500, he shot The Art of Marriage.

5000|$|While Kate {{is taking}} her bath, Deeley confronts Anna, {{telling her that}} he's met her before. He says she used to dress in black and get men to buy her drinks, and he fell for it, buying her a drink 20 years ago and going with her to party. They sat across the room from each other, {{and he looked up}} her skirt. A girl sat beside her and they talked, while Deeley was {{surrounded}} by men and lost track of the girls. When he got through the crowd to the couch where the girls had sat, they were gone. Anna pretends to have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> talking about, and he insists that she was trying to be Kate back then, mimicking her mannerisms and shy smile, but she wasn't as good at it. Deeley recounts first meeting Kate in a movie theater showing the film [...] "Odd Man Out".|$|R
