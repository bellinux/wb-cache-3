40|$|PURPOSE: The {{present study}} {{determined}} {{the association between}} body fluid variation {{and the development of}} acute mountain sickness (AMS) in adults. METHODS: Forty-three healthy participants (26 males and 17 females, age: 26 ± 6 yr, height: 174 ± 9 cm, weight: 68 ± 12 kg) were passively exposed at a FiO 2 of 12. 6 % (simulated altitude hypoxia of 4500 m, PiO 2 = 83. 9 mmHg) for 12 -h. AMS severity was assessed using the Lake Louise Score (LLS). Food and drink intakes were consumed ad libitum and measured; all urine was collected. Before and after the 12 -h exposure, body weight and plasma osmolality were measured and whole-body bioimpedance analysis was performed. RESULTS: The overall AMS incidence was 43 % (38 % males, 50 % females). Participants who developed AMS showed lower fluid losses (3. 0 ± 0. 9 vs. 4. 5 ± 2. 0 ml/kg/h, p = 0. 002), a higher fluid retention (1. 9 ± 1. 5 vs. 0. 6 ± 0. 8 ml/kg/h, p = 0. 022), greater plasma osmolality decreases (- 7 ± 7 vs. - 2 ± 5 mOsm/kg, p = 0. 028) and a larger plasma volume expansion (11 ± 10 vs. 1 ± 15 %, p = 0. 041) compared to participants not developing AMS. <b>Net</b> <b>water</b> balance (fluid <b>intake</b> [...] fluid loss) and the amount of fluid loss were strong predictors whether getting sick or not (Nagelkerkes r(2) = 0. 532). The LLS score was related to <b>net</b> <b>water</b> balance (r = 0. 358, p = 0. 018), changes in plasma osmolality (r = - 0. 325, p = 0. 033) and sodium concentration (r = - 0. 305, p = 0. 047). Changes in the impedance vector length were related to weight changes (r = - 0. 550, p< 0. 001), fluid intake (r = - 0. 533, p< 0. 001) and <b>net</b> <b>water</b> balance (r = - 0. 590, p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Participants developing AMS within 12 hours showed a positive <b>net</b> <b>water</b> balance due to low fluid loss. Thus measures to avoid excess fluid retention are likely to reduce AMS symptoms...|$|R

Even though a recommendation exists for adequate <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> for Koreans, studies identifying actual <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> from all beverages and foods consumed daily in the Korean population are limited. Thus, we estimated total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> from both beverages and foods and its association with energy intake and eating behaviors in Korean adults. We used a nationally representative sample of 25, 122 Korean adults aged ≥ 19 years, from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008 – 2012. We performed multiple regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related variables to investigate the contribution of overall energy and dietary intakes and eating behaviors to total <b>water</b> <b>intake.</b> The mean total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> excluding plain <b>water</b> was 1071 g (398 g from beverages and 673 g from foods) and the estimated plain <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> was 1. 3 L. Among Korean adults, 82 % consumed beverages (excluding plain water) and these beverages contributed to 10 % of daily energy intake and 32 % of total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> from beverages and foods. For every 100 kcal/day in energy <b>intake,</b> <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> consumed through beverages and foods increased by 18 g and 31 g, respectively. <b>Water</b> <b>intake</b> from beverages and foods was positively associated with energy from fat and dietary calcium, but inversely associated with energy density and energy from carbohydrates. When there was a 5 % increase in energy intake from snacks and eating outside the home, there was an increase in <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> from beverages of 13 g and 2 g, respectively. Increased daily energy intake, the number of eating episodes, and energy intake from snacks and eating outside the home predicted higher <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> from beverages and foods. Our results provide evidence suggesting that various factors, including sociodemographic status, dietary intakes, and eating behaviors, could be important contributors to the <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> of Korean adults.

Ration CP percentage (DM basis) affected free <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> only in dry cows; 1 unit of increase resulted in an increase of about 1 kg/d in <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> between 12 and 13 % CP. As ration moisture dropped from 70 to 40 %. free <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> increased about 7 L/d in dry cows, but this {{was accompanied by a}} drop of 15 L/d in total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> (free plus feed <b>water).</b> Free <b>water</b> <b>intakes</b> were predicted with R 2 of. 64 and. 69 in dry and lactating Holstein cows, respectively.

Central acute m-CPBG injections in the doses of 80 and 160 nmol significantly reduced <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> elicited by an acute salt load. Third ventricle injections of m-CPBG in the dose of 160 nmol significantly inhibited <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> in hypovolemic animals, whereas third ventricle injections of m-CPBG in a higher dose (320 nmol) were necessary to decrease <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> in water-deprived rats. Pretreatment with 1 -methyl-N-[8 -methyl 8 -azabicyclo(3. 2. 1) -oct- 3 -yl]- 1 H-indazole- 3 -carboxamide (LY- 278, 584), a selective 5 -HT 3 antagonist, abolished the inhibitory effect on <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> seen after central administration of m-CPBG in all groups studied. The central administration of m-CPBG was also able to inhibit <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> induced by pharmacological activation of central cholinergic and angiotensinergic pathways. Third ventricle injections of m-CPBG in the highest dose employed in this study (320 nmol) were unable to modify food intake in food-deprived rats. An aversion test has shown that acute third ventricle injections of m-CPBG do not induce illness-like effects that could explain the <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> inhibition here observed. Also, central administration of m-CPBG did not modify the intake of a “dessert” meal consisting of diluted condensed milk. It is concluded that central 5 -HT 3 receptor activation exerts a specific inhibitory effect on <b>water</b> <b>intake...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Interpretation of {{previous}} associations between <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> and adverse birth outcomes is challenging given that amount {{and type of}} water consumed can be non-specific markers of exposure or underlying behavioural characteristics. We {{examined the relationship between}} <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> measures and adverse birth outcomes in participants from three study sites in the United States. Methods Using a prospective cohort study, we examined daily intake of bottled, cold tap, total tap, and total water in relation to birth weight and risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) among term births and risk of preterm delivery. Results Based on water consumption data collected between 20 - 24 weeks of gestation, the adjusted mean birth weight was 27 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: - 34, 87), 39 (95 % CI: - 22, 99), and 50 (95 % CI: - 11, 110) grams higher for the upper three total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> quartiles (> 51 - 78, > 78 - 114, and > 114 ounces/day) compared to the lowest quartile (≤ 51 ounces/day). Adjusted birth weight results were similar for bottled water, cold tap water, and total tap <b>water</b> <b>intake.</b> An exposure-response gradient was not detected for either preterm delivery or SGA with increasing total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> and total tap <b>water</b> <b>intake,</b> but adjusted relative risks for all three upper quartiles were below 1. 0 (range: 0. 6 - 0. 9) for SGA. Conclusion These data suggest that high <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> may be associated with higher mean birth weight following adjustment for confounding. </p...|$|R

We investigated the influence factors for <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> using 12 rabbits subjected to different feed and water regimes with practical relevance: Hay, fresh parsley, a seed mix and two different pelleted feed were offered in diverse combinations. Water was provided either by open dish or nipple drinker. Water was accessible ad libitum except for four treatments with 6  h or 12  h water access. Under the different feeding regimes, the drinker had no influence on <b>water</b> <b>intake,</b> but faecal dry matter content was significantly higher with nipple drinkers [60. 0  ±  2. 1 vs. 57. 2  ±  2. 1 % of wet weight (mean ±  95 % confidence interval), p =  0. 003]. Dry food led to a higher drinking <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> but total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> was still lower than with addition of 'fresh' food. With restricted water access, rabbits exhibited a significantly higher <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> with open dishes compared with nipple drinkers (54. 9  ±  9. 8 vs. 48. 1  ±  8. 2  g/kg(0. 75) /day (mean ±  95 % confidence interval), p =  0. 04). High proportions of fresh parsley or hay in the diet enhanced total <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> and urine output, and led to lower urinary dry matter content and lower urinary calcium concentrations. Restricted access to drinkers led to a decreased total daily <b>water</b> <b>intake</b> and increased dry matter content of urine and faeces. For optimal water provision and urolith prophylaxis, we recommend a diet with a high 'fresh food' proportion as well as additionally hay ad libitum with free water access, offered in an open bowl...|$|R
