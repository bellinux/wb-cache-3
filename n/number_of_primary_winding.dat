40|$|The Superconducting Fault Current Limiter is {{a device}} placed in {{electric}} network {{to limit the}} peak current {{in the event of}} fault. In inductive SFCL the high temperature superconducting tubes are used as secondary winding. Primary winding is conventionally made of copper wire. The magnetic field distribution analysis is significant to elaborate proper operation of the limiter. The FEM is irrevocable at designing stage to calculate the electrical parameters of the SFCL in resistive and superconducting state. During the normal operation the resistance of superconducting winding is equal zero, and the magnetic flux does not penetrate the iron core because the superconducting tube acts as magnetic screen. The impedance of SFCL is nearly zero. When the fault occurs the increasing current exceed the critical value of the HTS element then resistance of secondary winding is reflected into the circuit, and the magnetic flux penetrates the iron core increasing the impedance of limiter. The voltage on the limiter depends mainly on the structure of the limiter, its geometrical dimensions, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> <b>winding</b> turns, distance between the windings and size of the core. The influence of many different parameters on the SFCL operation makes the analytical calculation very complicated and inaccurate. The Finite Element Method offers the possibility of analysis very close to the reality. Results of numerical analysis of superconducting inductive fault current limiter with an open core based on the FEM have been described in this paper...|$|E

40|$|We conduct 3 D {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the winds collision {{process in the}} massive binary system Eta Carinae, and conclude that accretion occurs during periastron passage. We include radiative cooling of the two winds, one from each star, and {{the gravity of the}} secondary and primary stars. Our new numerical finding is that at an orbital separation of ~ 3 - 4 AU, about three weeks before periastron passage, accretion <b>of</b> dense <b>primary</b> <b>wind</b> gas onto the secondary star begins. To isolate the basic role of the secondary stellar gravity, we neglect the orbital motion and the acceleration zone <b>of</b> the <b>primary</b> <b>wind.</b> Including these effects will strengthen even more our conclusion that accretion near periastron passage of Eta Car is inevitable.

Istraživanja su provedena laboratoriju u uvjetima sobne {{temperature}} u vidu 2 pokusa kroz dvije godine (1973. i 1974). Dobiveni podaci su obrađeni prema blok metodi analize varijance. U analizu su osim običnih vulgare genotipova uključene granate kao i četvoredna linija, te linije izvedene u križanja granata x vulgare. Utvrđeno je da geni koji izazivaju granatost utječu na formiranje većeg broja primarnih korjenčića u odnosu na obične vulgare genotipove. Komparirani su istraživani genotipovi međusobno i utvrđen je veliki raspon između istih u svojstvu „broj primarnih korjenčića“. Bnoj primarnih korjenčića je važno kvantitativno svojstvo i može da posluži u oplemenjivanju pšenice u smislu odbacivanje suvišnih genotipova. Tim putem se djeluje u pravcu ubrzanja procesa oplemenjivanja, naravno podrazumijevajući da postoji korelacija između broja primarnih korjenčića i prinosa. This work {{is concerned}} with studies <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets <b>of</b> winter genotypes - vulgare type, both domestic and foreing proveniences. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets was studied under laborators conditions at room temperature in 5 replications, during two years (1973. and 1974). 40 wheat genotypes were studied in all Laboratory strudies were performed in 2 trials. In the laboratory trial I 25 genotypes of vulgare wheat were analyzed. In the laboratory triar II 15 genotypes were analyzed comprising branched and fourrowed lines as well as lines derived from the crossing branched x vulgare. Amnog 25 wheat genotypes of vulgare type highly significant differences were ascertained in <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets. Variety Vigorka had the largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets (x = 5, 70) while variety Centurk had the smallest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets (x = 3, 30). Among 15 wheat genotypes included in the laboratory trial II, significant difference for <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets was found out only at P= 5 %. Branched add fourrowed lines <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets compared with common genotypes – vulgare type, however, being only signifcant at P= 5 % thus {{it seems that the}} branched genes have effect upon formation <b>of</b> larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets. No significant difference was found for <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets among lines derived from the crossing: branched x vulgare and branched and fourrowed lines. Also, no significant difference was found among lines derived from the crossing branched x vulgare and their parents of vulgare of vulgare type, athough lines derived from the crossing branched x vulgare had larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> rootlets is very important quantitative character of root system at wheat.
