5|$|Considering Ragnvald's background, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> he rose {{to become}} {{an officer of the}} Varangian Guard: he was a wealthy {{chieftain}} who brought many ambitious soldiers to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the cure for {{political}} injustices {{is identical to the}} cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
2500|$|... and so {{it should}} <b>not</b> be <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> massive scalar field theory is not scale-invariant.|$|R
50|$|Occidentale {{produces}} more nectar {{than any other}} American lily, which is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given <b>that</b> hummingbirds are the primary pollinator.|$|R
50|$|At a {{time when}} {{resource}} depletion and global warming are international concerns it is <b>not</b> perhaps <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> these activities should receive various accolades.|$|R
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E
5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> their players {{dominated}} the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs {{at a much}} higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were {{a large part of the}} success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E
50|$|The Constitution's main {{principle}} was {{separation of}} powers. This is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given <b>that</b> it was modeled after democratic constitutions of Europe and the United States.|$|R
50|$|Before their {{eventual}} {{inheritance of}} these lands in Wiltshire, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> then <b>that</b> the Ernle family concentrated their activities on Sussex, {{while maintaining a}} presence in both counties.|$|R
3000|$|... 20 The {{education}} distribution among program participants is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given <b>that</b> {{public works}} jobs were physically demanding. Three-quarters of program {{participants reported that}} their public works jobs are physically demanding.|$|R

25|$|Given the {{emotional}} support connection and happiness dogs provide it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> {{people want to}} honor and reward them with goodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} of subjective tinnitus are often obscure. While it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> direct {{trauma to the}} inner ear can cause tinnitus, other apparent causes (e.g., temporomandibular joint dysfunction) are difficult to explain.|$|E
50|$|Whitehead's {{rebellion}} against a government 3-line whip on Trident renewal is <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> given <b>that</b> archived documents have recently emerged showing that in 1982-83 Whitehead paid {{a subscription to}} Southampton CND.|$|R
50|$|Behaviorism and {{functionalism}} {{in psychology}} and sociology also have ties to pragmatism, which is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> considering <b>that</b> James and Dewey were both scholars {{of psychology and}} that Mead became a sociologist.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> then <b>that</b> Wellesley himself {{dreamed of}} finding a new, more {{promising}} life, in distant lands. In 1866 {{he set out to}} find his fortune in the goldfields of Australia.|$|R
25|$|The film {{industry}} in Azerbaijan {{dates back to}} 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan {{was among the first}} countries involved in cinematography: it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> this new medium soon showed up in cosmopolitan nouveau-riche Baku {{at the turn of the}} 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In the 1961–1962 season, the Duleep Trophy {{was inaugurated}} as a zonal competition. It {{was named after}} Ranji's nephew, Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji (1905–59). With Bombay in its catchment, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the West Zone won six of the first nine titles.|$|E
25|$|A learned man, Hungerford placed much {{emphasis}} on education. Hence, it was <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> his main focus in Congress was serving on the Committee of Education and Labor. After his short stint on Capital Hill, he returned to Corning, New York to resume his banking business.|$|E
5000|$|Northampton was, in the 13th century, a {{far more}} {{important}} town than is evident today, so it is <b>not</b> particularly <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> a university was established there. The town was also, briefly, the King's seat.|$|R
50|$|It would <b>not</b> be <b>surprising</b> for <b>that</b> was the {{procedure}} used by King Solomon's fleet.|$|R
50|$|Most REDD+ {{activities}} or projects implemented since {{the call for}} demonstration activities in Decision 2/CP.13 December 2007 are focused on readiness, which is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given <b>that</b> REDD+ and its requirements were completely new to all developing countries.|$|R
25|$|Precisely {{because he}} had {{submitted}} to Brian's authority, the King of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by Máel Mórda mac Murchada. Given {{the circumstances under which}} Máel Mórda had been appointed, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> he launched an open rebellion against Brian's authority.|$|E
25|$|Pynson became King's Printer to Henry VII (and {{subsequently}} to Henry VIII) in 1506, {{an office}} that carried not only great prestige {{but also an}} annuity of two pounds, later raised to four pounds. Since this was a prestigious lifetime position, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> he was naturalised in 1513.|$|E
25|$|This was no fashionable affectation; {{this was}} {{something}} that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens. In light of this, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> there are many indications that their sexual relationship was indeed lifelong.|$|E
50|$|However, {{surface charge}} {{is but one}} {{component}} of surface energy, and other components are certainly perturbed by induced charge. So, a complete explanation of electrowetting is unquantified, but it should <b>not</b> be <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> these limits exist.|$|R
5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> then <b>that</b> Kaiser, Hunka, and Bianchini (1971) {{concluded}} that the affective symptoms of depression are less specific and appear to shift from loading on one dimension to another {{depending on the type}} of sample being studied.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{electrical}} breakdown mechanisms {{of air and}} PMMA plastic are considerably different, the branching discharges {{turn out to be}} related. So, it should <b>not</b> be <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the branching forms taken by natural lightning also have fractal characteristics.|$|R
25|$|Given his record, it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> {{the other}} Party leaders were {{suspicious}} of Beria's motives. Khrushchev opposed the alliance between Beria and Malenkov, {{but he was}} initially unable to challenge them. His opportunity came in June 1953 when a spontaneous uprising against the East German Communist regime broke out in East Berlin.|$|E
25|$|N-oxides {{are prone}} to undergo the Polonovski {{rearrangement}} when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of oxazepam. It is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product (3) results.|$|E
25|$|The {{mention of}} the Dvina river is in good {{agreement}} with the Wielbark Culture. Historically, the Goths followed the Vistula, but during the Viking Age, the Dvina-Dniepr waterway succeeded the Vistula as the main trade route to Greece for the Gutes (or Gotar in standard Old Norse), and it is <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> it also replaced the Vistula in the migration traditions.|$|E
50|$|As {{the son of}} a {{military}} officer, it should <b>not</b> be <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> he was an active member of one of the early volunteer companies, and was an expert marksman. He was also a member of Adelaide's Bohemian Club.|$|R
5000|$|Wayne Grudem {{suggests}} that [...] "if God loves {{all that is}} right and good, and all that conforms to his moral character, then it should <b>not</b> be <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> he would hate everything that is opposed to his moral character." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 Richard West of the Texas Monthly {{stated that}} Houston, {{the largest city}} in Texas, has [...] "the highest {{percentage}} of demanding food seekers" [...] and therefore [...] "it's <b>not</b> too <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> here one finds the widest spectrum of Mexican cuisine." ...|$|R
