25|$|During May, {{the coal}} strike had {{its effect on}} {{services}}; cars ceased {{at the end of}} the evening peak hour on Mondays to Fridays and at 7.30 p.m. on Saturdays. There was no service on Sundays. Motorbuses were taken off the Bagthorpe and Dunkirk services in the evenings, two being run over the tram route to Bulwell and one to Sherwood.

25|$|On {{occasions}} {{throughout the}} year, Temptation would break from its <b>normal</b> <b>running</b> style {{for a week}} and run a celebrity edition. In most cases these celebrities were playing for home viewers, where the normal prizes and money cards were present. Sometimes the celebrities would be playing for charities, where instead of small prizes cash donations to their charity were given (usually between $500 and $5,000). The money cards still remained.|$|E

25|$|Hours {{before the}} ambush, two RUC Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU) {{officers}} {{were placed in}} the station to accompany the local RUC officer who was to carry on the <b>normal</b> <b>running</b> of the station. The HMSU was the RUC's equivalent of the SAS. Six SAS soldiers in plain clothes, including the commander, were positioned inside the station. Another eighteen SAS soldiers in uniform were hidden in wooded areas in five locations around the station.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, {{following}} a successful trial on the M42 in the West Midlands, the UK government have announced that two {{stretches of the}} M6 will be upgraded to allow the hard shoulder {{to be used as}} a <b>normal</b> <b>running</b> lane during busy conditions under a scheme called Active Traffic Management. The two stretches, between junctions 4 and 5 and between junctions 10a and 8, are two of the busiest sections on the entire motorway. The system could also be extended onto other stretches of the M6 as the government is going to undertake a feasibility study to determine other likely locations where this technology can be used.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} earthquake, the electricity-producing Reactors 1, 2, and 3 {{automatically}} shut down their sustained fission reactions by inserting control rods in a legally-mandated safety procedure {{referred to as}} SCRAM, which ceases the reactors' <b>normal</b> <b>running</b> conditions. As the reactors were unable to generate power to run their own coolant pumps, emergency diesel generators came online, as designed, to power electronics and coolant systems. These operated nominally until the tsunami destroyed the generators for Reactors 1–5. The two generators cooling Reactor 6 were undamaged and were sufficient to be pressed into service to cool the neighboring Reactor 5 along with their own reactor, averting the overheating issues that Reactor 4 suffered.|$|E

50|$|The Hurricane Fault is an intracrustal {{seismic fault}} that {{runs along the}} {{boundary}} between the Colorado Plateau block and the Basin and Range geologic province of western North America. It is a 250-km-long, north-south striking, high-angle, down-to-the-west <b>normal</b> fault, <b>running</b> from about Cedar City, Utah southward into northwestern Arizona. The fault is named for the community of Hurricane.|$|R
50|$|User-mode Linux (UML) enables {{multiple}} virtual Linux kernel-based {{operating systems}} (known as guests) {{to run as}} an application within a normal Linux system (known as the host). As each guest is just a <b>normal</b> application <b>running</b> as a process in user space, this approach provides the user with a way of running multiple virtual Linux machines on {{a single piece of}} hardware, offering some isolation, generally without affecting the host environment's configuration or stability.|$|R
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In <b>normal</b> <b>running</b> configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{due to a}} {{shortage}} of suitable stock for the Bournemouth electrification scheme, BR formed an eight-carriage 8Vab unit, no. 8001. The unit was formed of carriages from three standard sets, nos. 7739/41/42, plus a conventional locomotive-hauled buffet carriage. Three MBSOs were required within the make-up as the standard 'TRB' was not through-wired for traction power distribution. In view of this the two MBSOs in the five-car portion had collector shoes fitted to one bogie on each. The unit worked on occasions with a 4-TC; this usually had a Class 33 attached to provide ETH and train lighting. in the TC unit as the 8-VAB was not fitted with ETH jumper cables on the unit ends. Its <b>normal</b> <b>running</b> formation was with another 4-VEP to make a 12-car set. The 'TRB' vehicle retained its gas-powered appliances so, unlike 4-REP buffet cars, was able to provide hot food and beverages while on diversions away from third-rail areas. Adjacent MBSO 62203 had most of its doors locked out of use and tables fitted across them for the service of meals on a 2-and-2 basis (across seats intended for five persons normally); this vehicle also had most of its luggage racks removed. The unit was later reclassified as Class 480 following the introduction of TOPS.|$|E
2500|$|A magnetic-hydraulic {{circuit breaker}} uses a solenoid coil to provide {{operating}} force {{to open the}} contacts. Magnetic-hydraulic [...] breakers incorporate a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, {{the speed of the}} solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond <b>normal</b> <b>running</b> current for motor starting, energizing equipment, etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a magnetic breaker.|$|E
25|$|Trains run {{every day}} from the {{beginning}} of April to the end of October and on weekends and selected holidays during the winter (with no service from 24–27 December). Trains are mostly steam-hauled; however in some cases heritage diesel is used. At the height of the running timetable, trains depart hourly from each station. As well as the <b>normal</b> passenger <b>running,</b> there are dining services on some evenings and weekends. The extension of steam operated services to the seaside town of Whitby has proved extremely popular.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{an experimental}} platform and some results {{about the problem}} of multi protocol routing and route redistribution. Our particular lab platform, with Zebra / Quagga routing software packages, is analyzed. The particularity of this case study is that we can link <b>normal</b> computers <b>running</b> Zebra / Quagga together with Cisco dedicated equipments. Interrupting various links between routers for studying convergence time as well as shutting down various routers to study network flexibility led to results according to routing protocols specifications...|$|R

50|$|To {{stabilise}} the timetable, in 2006 locomotives on {{the line}} were changed from class 111 to class 112 and the Rhein-Münsterland-Express since then has runs every two hours to Münster. These changes eventually led to <b>normal</b> on-time <b>running.</b> The Zweckverband SPNV Münsterland (Münsterland rail transport association) is planning, however, to extend hourly services to Rheine. As part of {{the second stage of}} modernisation at Rheine station, one of the two disused platforms are to be reactivated, which would make available six platform tracks instead of four. The train could therefore operate without platform conflicts with InterCity services on the Emsland line. In return, Regionalbahn RB 68 services would be discontinued.|$|R
30|$|Many past VMI {{solutions}} {{are sensitive to}} version of OSs, with even a simple patch for an OS having an adverse effect on their operation. Numerous {{attempts have been made}} to inject a function/process in guest VMs. Process out-grafting proposes a solution for monitoring specific processes from a number of guest VM processes. The approach used here is exactly the reverse of that used conventionally. Instead of grafting the monitoring process running on a guest VM, process out-grafting relocates the specific process on-demand from a guest to a secure VM. The advantage of out-grafting is that monitoring tools do not need any modification. They essentially view it a <b>normal</b> process <b>running</b> in a secure VM.|$|R
50|$|Messina Chasma is {{the largest}} canyon {{on the surface of}} the Uranian moon Titania and is named after a {{location}} in William Shakespeare's comedy Much Ado About Nothing. The 1492 km long chasma is made of two <b>normal</b> faults <b>running</b> NW-SE, which bound a down-dropped crustal block forming a structure called graben. The canyon cuts impact craters, which probably means that it was formed at a relatively late stage of the moon's evolution, when the interior of Titania expanded and its ice crust cracked as a result. Messina Chasma has only a few crater superimposed on it, which also implies it is relatively young structure. The chasma was first imaged by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in January 1986.|$|R

30|$|An {{incipient}} mechanical {{fault detection}} method, combining multifractal theory and Mahalanobis-Taguchi system (MTS), {{which is based}} on statistical technology, is proposed in this paper. Multifractal features of vibration signals obtained from machine state monitoring are extracted by multifractal spectrum analysis and generalized fractal dimensions. Considering the situation of mass samples of <b>normal</b> mechanical <b>running</b> state and few fault states, the feature parameters corresponding to different mechanical running states are further optimized by a statistical method, based on which incipient faults are subsequently identified and diagnosed accurately. Experimental results proved that the method combining multifractal theory and MTS can be used for incipient fault state recognition effectively during the mechanical running process, and the accuracy of fault state identification is improved.|$|R
30|$|This is {{generally}} true {{also in the}} <b>normal</b> ECM. When <b>running</b> estimations (1) and (2) on real instead of nominal compensations, we do not obtain significantly different results {{except for the fact}} that there is no public sector size effect neither in the long nor in the short run, which may allude to the fact that the long-term elasticity of manufacturing to government wages is significantly driven by second-round effects via inflation.|$|R
