40|$|The {{distribution}} of several trace elements in different aqueous fractions {{has been studied}} in running waters from Sardinia (Italy). Trace elements and major components were determined in water samples collected at high- and low-discharge from rivers (90 samples) and streams (70 samples). At selected sites, total (non filtered samples) and dissolved (0. 4 mu m and 0. 015 mu m pore-size filtered samples) amounts of trace elements were determined, and {{the composition of the}} solid matter retained on the filters was investigated for estimating the eventual interrelationship. The elements B, Li, Rb, Sr, Ba, As, Sb, Mo, Tl and U in the studied waters showed small differences between total and dissolved amounts; dissolved concentrations were higher under low flow conditions, when the contribution of rainwater to the rivers was minimum; their concentrations were often correlated with total dissolved solids (TIDS), and appeared {{to be related to the}} intensity of water-rock interaction processes. The elements Al, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, Co, Ni, Cs, Y, REE and Th were not related to TDS and/or major ions; they showed higher concentrations under high flow conditions; marked differences occurred between total and dissolved amounts; much lower concentrations were generally observed in the water filtered through 0. 015 mu m than in the water filtered through 0. 4 mu m, especially when sampling was carried out after heavy rain events that enhanced the load of solid matter in the water. These observations indicate an aqueous transport via sorption processes on very fine particles, such as Fe-oxide/hydroxide and clay mineral particles, which have been inferred by SEM-EDX analyses of the matter retained on the filters. Results on modelled aqueous speciation of trace elements. aimed to assess the role of sorption processes, suggest that: (i) those elements speciated as oxyanions (e. g. As(V), Mo(VI)) or as negatively) 4) charged complexes (e. g. UO(2) (CO(3)) (3) (4 -) and UO(2) (CO(3)) (2) (2 -)) are either poorly or not adsorbed onto oxide/hydroxide minerals under neutral to alkaline conditions as observed in the studied waters; (ii) dissolved concentrations of metals prevalently speciated as free, positively charged ions (e. g. Zn, Cd, Ni) are strongly affected by the amount of Fe-oxide/hydroxide particles retained on 0. 015 mu m filters; (iii) trace metals occurring as <b>neutral</b> <b>carbonate</b> complexes (e. g.

It was a very useful white pigment as base and could be applied in painting with various organic dye tints [11]. Two mineral phases, cerussite (PbCO 3) and hydrocerussite (Pb 3 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 2), were the main composition of basic white lead [17]. In the fingerprint region at 1500 – 650  cm− 1, the peaks occurring at 1415, 1046, 681  cm− 1 corresponded to the strong stretching vibrations of CO 32 − for <b>neutral</b> lead <b>carbonate</b> (cerussite), calcium carbonate (aragonite) and basic lead carbonate (hydrocerussite), the weak absorbance band near 3537  cm− 1 was attributable to OH stretching for the latter [13, 18].

40|$|The EPA-designated Superfund site Nuclear Metals, Inc. of Concord, Massachusetts, is {{contaminated}} by depleted uranium, {{a byproduct of}} defense-related uranium metals processing. Uranium retention in the solid phase, either by adsorption or precipitation, impedes its transport and dissemination from the contamination source.

40|$|Contaminants {{are easily}} {{injected}} into karst aquifers through sinking streams, sinkholes, or through open fractures and shafts in the carbonate rock. Transport of the contaminants through the aquifer is {{by a variety}} of mechanisms depending on the physical and chemical properties of the contaminant. Contaminants consist of (1) water soluble compounds, both organic and inorganic, (2) slightly soluble organic compounds, less dense than water (LNAPLs), (3) slightly soluble organic compounds, more dense than water (DNAPLs), (4) pathogens, (5) metals, and (6) trash. Water soluble compounds (e. g. nitrates, cyanides, carboxylic acids, phenols) move with the water. But rather than forming a plume spreading from the input point, the contaminated water forms linear stringers migrating down the conduit system toward the discharge point. LNAPLs (e. g. petroleum hydrocarbons) float on the water table and can migrate down the water table gradient to cave streams where they tend to pond behind obstructions. DNAPLs (e. g. chlorinated hydrocarbons), in contrast, sink {{to the bottom of the}} aquifer. In the conduit system, DNAPLs pond in low spots at the bottom of the conduit and infiltrate sediment piles. Transport of both LNAPL and DNAPL is dependent on storm flow which can force LNAPL through the system as plug flow and can move DNAPLs by mobilizing the sediment piles. Pathogens (viruses, bacteria, parasites) are transported through the karstic drainage system because of the absence of filtration and retain their activity for long distances. Metals (e. g. chromium, nickel, cadmium, mercury, and lead) tend to precipitate as hydroxides and <b>carbonates</b> in the <b>neutral</b> pH, <b>carbonate</b> rich water of the karst aquifer.

40|$|A {{coral reefs}} {{carbonate}} budget strongly influences reef structural complexity and net reef growth potential, {{and thus is}} increasingly recognized as a key “health” metric. Despite this, understanding of habitat specific budget states, how these scale across reef platforms, and our ability to quantify both framework and sediment production values remains limited. Here, we use in-situ census data from an atoll rim reef platform in the central Maldives to quantify rates of both reef framework and sediment production and loss within different platform habitats, and then combine these data with high-resolution habitat maps to quantify contributions to platform wide carbonate budgets. The net reef framework budget for the entire platform is extremely low (0. 12 G, where G = Kg CaCO 3 m− 2 year− 1), with a very high proportion (143, 745 kg or 65. 1 %) of total framework production generated within the platform margin reef zones, despite these comprising only ~ 8 % of platform area. Net platform-scale sediment budgets are higher (1. 04 G), but most is produced in the reef and platform margin hardground habitats, of which ~ 80 % derives from parrotfish bioerosion. Significant quantities of new sediment (up to ~ 1 G derived from the calcareous green algae Halimeda) are produced only in one habitat. All lagoonal habitats have negative or <b>neutral</b> net <b>carbonate</b> budgets. These data demonstrate the marked inter-habitat differences in reef carbonate budgets that occur across reef platforms, and the major dampening effect on overall platform scale budgets when rates are factored for habitat type and size. Furthermore, the data highlights the disproportionately important role that relatively small areas of reef habitat can have on the maintenance of net positive platform scale budgets. Because of the intrinsic link between carbonate production rates and reef-associated landform development and maintenance, these findings also have implications for understanding reef-associated landform stability. In this context the reef island at this site has been highly mobile over the last ~ 40 years, and we hypothesize that such instability may be being exacerbated by the measured low overall rates of framework and sediment generation...|$|R
30|$|A {{variety of}} organic and {{inorganic}} pigments have been previously identified on the corpus of 150 polychromed qeros referred to above, the style-based dates of {{which range from}} the late Inka period to around 1821, when Peru gained independence from Spain [3]. The non-white pigments found include orpiment, pararealgar, cinnabar, copper-based pigments, carbon black, earth pigments, and the organic dyestuffs cochineal and indigo. These materials are known to occur naturally in the Andes or to have been manufactured and used during the pre-Columbian and later periods as mineral pigments applied to wood and other substrates or as textile dyestuffs [20 – 24]. White pigments have received lesser attention. On Andean easel and wall paintings from colonial times, the predominant variety has generally {{been found to be}} lead white, consisting of basic lead carbonate (2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) often mixed with <b>neutral</b> lead <b>carbonate</b> (PbCO 3) [23], while published analyses of occurrences on Inka and pre-Inka painted surfaces most often describe calcium-based minerals, such as calcite, gypsum and apatite [25 – 28]. Occasional instances of early white pigments bearing Ti and/or Si have been reported, most often as clay-based minerals with quartz and/or titanium dioxide as minor constituents [25, 26, 29, 30]. On the qeros that we have studied and that can be stylistically dated to colonial times, we have found the white pigment to be exclusively lead white. However, on earlier examples, we have found the white pigment to be a material rich in Ti and Si with little evidence of clay; this pigment is the subject of the present paper. We discovered it during our early work on the qero project and outlined it briefly in a previous communication [16]. This material occurs on only twelve qeros that we have examined to date, including the excavated example from Ollantaytambo, here identified as Museo Inka 230, and appears to represent the white pigment and binder used on the earliest polychromed qeros. We will argue that the materials and technology of this pigment likely pre-date Spanish influence. We also describe here a geological anomaly known as the “Giacomo Deposit” and situated near the modern city of Tacna in southern Peru that may provide a plausible source for this pigment. This mineral deposit was being offered for exploitation as a commercial mine for titanium dioxide and silica in 2009, and several websites describing it remain as of 2018 [31 – 33].|$|R
40|$|Development of {{biomaterials}} {{is crucial}} for progress {{in the field of}} tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The intention of biomaterials is to interface with biological systems to evaluate, treat, augment or replace any tissue, organ or function of the body. The utility of alginate as a biomaterial in tissue engineering has recently gained increasing interest. A wide variety of uses have been identified including regeneration of various tissues, delivery vehicles for bioactive molecules such as drugs, growth factors and genes, implantable space filling agents and as artificial extracellular matrices (ECM) providing support for cells in both in vivo and in vitro systems. The present work describes the development and characterization of a novel type of macroporous alginate based foams. The alginate foam is prepared by the steps of: (i) high shear mixing for incorporation of air into a viscous solution containing alginate, water, plasticizer, foaming agent and a source of gelling ions that is insoluble at <b>neutral</b> conditions (calcium <b>carbonate</b> (CaCO 3) /strontium carbonate (SrCO 3)), (ii) addition of a hydrolyzing glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) that induce slow dissolution of the carbonate salt, (iii) transfer of the wet foam into trays for gelation, and (iv) air drying to receive pliable and soft sheets of foams. The gelation method is well known for preparation of homogeneous alginate hydrogels, however, it has not before been utilized for preparation of macroporous dried alginate foams. Pore structure, hydration properties, mechanical properties, degradability and biocompatibility are all highly relevant for the functionality of a biomaterial scaffold. The flexibility of the method allows tuning of these properties by process and formulation parameters. The mechanisms that were influenced in the preparation process to modify the foam properties were (a) the foam density controlled by the amount of air incorporated, (b) coalescence and gelling rate of the wet foam before drying controlled by the amount of air incorporated, amount and type of gelling ion and alginate, and gelling time, (c) gel network controlled by the amount and type of gelling ion and alginate, and gelling time, (d) weight average molecular weight (MW) controlled by technique for terminal sterilization. A rabbit study was conducted to evaluate biocompatibility and degradability of the foam in vivo. Intramuscular implantation of alginate foam discs showed degradation rates related to concentration of gelling calcium ions (Ca 2 +) and MW. No adverse systemic signs or mortality were noted and body weights and organ weights of the rabbits were unaffected. Implantation-related inflammation changed over time as typically seen in a healing process and a transient foreign body reaction occurred that mirrored the foam degradation. The overall results showed that the foams were well tolerated. To investigate the possibility of using alginate foams as scaffolds for 3 -dimentional (3 D) cell cultivation, a new technique for cell immobilization was utilized to ensure gentle and fast entrapment of cells that were evenly distributed throughout the thickness of the foam. First the cells were suspended in an alginate solution and applied to a Ca alginate foam. As the solution was absorbed by the foam, the pore walls became rehydrated and Ca 2 + diffused from the foam and induced gelation of the added alginate solution in situ filling the foam pores. Thereby cells were entrapped in a transparent foam-gel composite structure. The cells were cultured in such gels for extended periods and different types of multicellular structures were formed inside. Isolation of cells and intact multicellular structures were possible due to the de-gelling properties of citrate which chelates divalent cations, hence the gel dissolves. High viability of cells was retained inside the gels and controlled modification of the cell-matrix interactions were demonstrated by inclusion of alginates with covalently attached peptide sequences. The peptide sequence used was glycine-arginine-aspartic acid-glycine-proline (GRDGSP), which is present on several ECM proteins and function as a cell adhesion motif. This facilitated cell-matrix interactions which stimulated proliferation in a dose dependent manner, although variations in sensitivity between the different types of cells were seen. Tunable elastic properties of the gels were shown over the range of 1 - 16 kPa, hence the elasticity can be optimized for different cell types and matches the elasticity of different soft tissues. The applicability of macroporous alginate foams as biomaterials was demonstrated here. The demonstrated mechanistic and functional relationships between operational and formulation parameters {{can be used as a}} tool to tailor physical and biological properties. Good biocompatibility was confirmed by in vivo animal studies in addition to in vitro cell cultivation studies. PhD i bioteknologiPhD in Biotechnolog...|$|R
