5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E
25|$|Two units {{claimed the}} name '1st Arkansas' during the American Civil War, one Confederate {{and one on}} the Union side, but neither have a direct {{connection}} to the 153d Infantry. These units were each recruited in the state by national governments for service in their respective army. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> any connection to the militia units of the State of Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|Tate and Polanski later {{agreed that}} <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been {{impressed}} by the other when they first met. Polanski was planning The Fearless Vampire Killers, which was being coproduced by Ransohoff, and had decided that he wanted the red-headed actress Jill St. John for the female lead. Ransohoff insisted that Polanski cast Tate, and after meeting with her, he agreed {{that she would be}} suitable on the condition that she wore a red wig during filming.|$|E

25|$|The team's two {{remaining}} stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson, bickered throughout the season, though <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> any trouble establishing his individual stardom. Jackson {{led the team}} in scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers and was the only Mav to start in all 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game, and {{finished second in the}} league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. George McCloud, who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.|$|E
500|$|Chris Sorrell and Jason Wilson, co-creators of MediEvil, {{had also}} {{expressed}} disappointment with the game. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> any involvement with MediEvil: Resurrection, {{and when they}} were asked about the game during a retrospective interview with RetroGamer, Wilson felt disheartened with having to watch something he [...] "cherished" [...] to be altered with decisions he thought were [...] "questionable". Sorrell felt similar disappointment in the redesign of the game and {{there were a number of}} aspects of it that he disagreed with. He did, however, praise the development team of Resurrection, stating that they did [...] "an awesome job" [...] considering the time constraints they were up against.|$|E
500|$|Hundreds {{of actors}} sought the main {{roles in the}} film, {{including}} Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Richard Gere for Jacob, and Andie MacDowell, Julia Roberts and Madonna for Jezzie. Eventually, Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña were cast; both auditioned early and <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> starred in a feature film before. Robbins said the film presented for him [...] "a great opportunity {{to go in a}} different direction. I love doing comedy, but I know I can do other things as well." [...] The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain Dale Dye, who provided a five-day boot camp military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Ving Rhames).|$|E

500|$|When he felt {{inspired}} to compose songs again, {{he did not}} choose to reunite with his former band 'NSYNC, although he considered it after his first record. Instead, he went to Justified collaborator Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley's studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia to begin sessions for his second album. However, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> {{an idea of what}} the album would be–no plan for it and even a title. [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound" [...] was written and produced by Timbaland, Nate [...] "Danja" [...] Hills and Timberlake himself. The song was recorded by Jimmy Douglas, while its mixing was done by Douglas with Timbaland at The Hit Factory Criteria in Miami. The keys were played by Danja, who also provided the drums with Timbaland. Paul Blake played the guitar and Timberlake sang the background vocals.|$|E
500|$|The MTA's {{proposed}} [...] "40 {{miles of}} new subway" [...] in Queens {{was reduced to}} 15 miles of tracks, and at the end, only three lines were even constructed: the 63rd Street Line, Archer Avenue Line, and portions of the SAS. Construction for the Second Avenue Line was halted indefinitely in 1975, but when the United States government ceased to fund the two remaining projects ten years later, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been completed. The Archer Avenue Line was opened in 1988 and the 63rd Street Line was also opened one year later; both lines, which had three stations each, were scaled-down versions of their original plans. However, construction on the SAS ceased in 1976. The eastern Jamaica elevated in Queens and the entire Third Avenue elevated in the Bronx were closed by 1985; the Jamaica el was only partially replaced by Archer Avenue service, while no rapid transit facilities were ever built to replace Third Avenue service.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{sentencing}} hearing, several witnesses testified to Gall's good character. [...] The defense reminded {{the court that}} two of Gall's accused codefendants had been sentenced to 30 and 35 months, respectively, and <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy as Gall had. [...] Although the Government's attorney urged the court to impose a sentence within the range recommended by the probation office, U.S. District Judge Robert W. Pratt ultimately imposed a sentence of 36 months' probation, explaining that it had considered the purposes of punishment and how a probation-only sentence would further those goals. [...] The Government then appealed the sentence.|$|E
2500|$|In a piece {{written for}} Slate and {{published}} in April 2017, Lorenzo Newman noted the similarities in the career trajectories {{between the two men}} - [...] "Both grew their fortunes on allegedly mafia-linked real-estate developments, transitioned into successful careers as media moguls, and, against all odds, ascended to the helm of their respective national governments" [...] - but also highlighted their shared tendency to question and undermine established institutions such as the judiciary and the press, the way that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been accepted by their countries' respective establishments despite their wealth, and how they channelled the resulting resentment into a populist form of politics by [...] "portraying themselves as everymen, if not in wealth, then in language, tone (and) aspirations". He also pointed out other commonalities, such as responding to concerns about conflicts of interest by delegating responsibility for running their businesses to family members.|$|E
