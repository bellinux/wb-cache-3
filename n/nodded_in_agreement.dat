50|$|While some of {{the content}} of the first 8 Theses may seem harsh and very {{critical}} of Jews and Jewish life, we must remember that the Russian Jews of the late 19th century were aware of self-criticism if anyone was. This criticism does not place Rabinowitz outside the Jewish community, nor can he be accused of being anti-Jewish or anti-Semitic. Up to that point any Jew of the Enlightenment/ Haskala persuasion would have <b>nodded</b> <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> with his criticism of the spiritual and physical condition of many fellow Jews and Jewish life of that era.|$|E

50|$|To {{survive in}} the fast life of Mumbai, he took up a job with The Times of India while trying to gain a {{foothold}} in the film industry. He looked after circulation of the paper in Bengal, Orissa and Bihar and was required to tour 20 days a month. Prem used to cut his touring time by calling the agents to come and meet him at the station so that he could quickly return. This way a tour that would normally take 20 days would get completed in 12, and he would {{spend the rest of the}} time going from one studio to the other. While traveling by the suburban train one day, a stranger accosted him and asked if he was interested in joining films. Chopra <b>nodded</b> <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> and went with that stranger to Ranjit Studios where the producers of Chaudhari Karnail Singh were in search of a hero. Jagjit Sethi, a Punjabi producer, gave him a break as Jabeen's hero in Chaudhary Karnail Singh, a Punjabi film. His debut film was a Hindu-Muslim romantic love story set against the backdrop of Indo-Pak partition and it turned out to be a big hit. The film even won the National award. He was paid Rs 2500 for his debut film. The movie took almost three years to complete.|$|E

He had first-hand experience of the Paris riots and was obsessed with the concept of the [...] "crisis of generations". UNESCO itself was embroiled in working out solutions to the problem and he saw his new post as a golden opportunity to put his ideas into practice. Khalid adopted a [...] "functional approach". He closely collaborated with his Egyptian counterpart Safieddin Abul-Ezz. It was at this time that he had an [...] "interesting and memorable" [...] meeting with the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel-Nasser in Ma’amoura, Alexandria. Hassan Sabri Al-Kholi was in attendance. Nasser asked Khalid what the problems facing Sudan’s youth were.

My field encourages the subjective, anecdotal, oddly shaped experiences that constitute creative writing. ” Where I veered away from agreement was her assumption that using rubrics is antithetical to encouraging critical thinking or to the creative expression of these subjective, anecdotal, oddly shaped experiences. I also disagree that using rubrics is merely a means to “measure students against preconceived expectations. ” In fact, I would argue that creating task-specific rubrics with students does exactly the opposite...|$|E

While not remarkable for most two-year olds, his ability to participate in these activities {{along with the other}} children in his preschool program is a real accom-plishment for Seth. "When Seth joined this classroom, he had no recognizable expressive language. He frequently had tantrums when he was not understood, " said Kate, Seth’s teacher. "We quickly intro-duced Seth to voice output devices and sign language during classroom activities. Seth’s playmates helped us model the use of the devices and simple signs across the day. Almost immedi-ately, Seth began using a voice output device during his favorite activity, snack. Within a couple of weeks, he began using the devices and single signs in circle time, play within centers, and outdoor play. " "We’re so excited about his progress, " added Penny, Seth’s mother. "We know his speech is still very delayed, but he’s com-municating in other ways. He’s also beginning to do new things with toys.

40|$|In {{presenting}} my work to you {{the viewer}} and the reader, I am faced with the perplexity of openly exhibiting my feelings, identity, and actions to help you to understand the paintings. As an artist I seek out the character and idiosyncrasies of my environment. My awareness of and reaction to what is outside myself {{has an influence on}} my work. But unlike a camera or mirror, I will not give back an exact reflection. I will assimilate, choose and transform experiences until I am ready to make an artistic statement that is distinctly personal. As you experience these personal statements which are my paintings, you may begin to apprehend some similarities and some inconsistencies in my perception of and reaction to life as compared with your own view. I will not record for you truisms and shining mottos made by other artists or critics. I cannot gain your understanding by basking in their reflected glory even though I have listened to them and <b>nodded</b> <b>in</b> <b>agreement</b> with their profundities. Instead I will try to reveal the excitement I gain in the act of forming and reacting to layers of pigments to build a balanced, harmonious surface. A basic level of understanding of my work demands an examination of the process I use to produce the paintings you see reproduced on the following pages. After describing this process, I will discuss some {{of the ways in which}} I assess, reflect, and incorporate the realities of change, scale, time and unity into my work. Each of the areas of explanation is preceded by a few more or less relevant thoughts concerning these things that have happened to me as well as feelings that I have had which illuminate my ways of seeing and help me to keep in touch with myself...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} almost a decade now since China regained control of Macau, but the city’s present and future crops up in news {{coverage}} much less than Hong Kong, another reclaimed colony. We’re delighted, then, {{to be able to}} run this piece about Macau from someone who has been spending time there, meditating on not only whether or not Macau is democratizing but also how Macau’s relationship to the mainland and the world is changing its economy and society. For those interested in background information on Macau, see the reading list that follows the piece. Sitting in a hip dessert shop recently, I asked three University of Macau undergraduates, all Macau natives, what they thought about Macau’s new Chief Executive-elect, Fernando Chui. He is only the second person to hold the post since the Portuguese handover in 1999. “I don’t really think about it,” one told me. “Young people here don’t really think about who is in the government. ” The two others <b>nodded</b> <b>in</b> <b>agreement.</b> “Connections are {{the most important thing to}} succeed in Macau. Anyone here who is rich was born rich. ” Such apathy can be understood, given that Chui’s appointment as the new head of Macau was decided by a 300 -member “election committee” comprised of the city’s elite, many of whom have strong ties to PRC officials. Chui, the former Secretary of Social Affairs and Culture and holder of college degrees from the United States, including a PhD in Public Health from the University of Oklahoma, will be officially sworn in this December. The victory of his unopposed election was a foregone conclusion, emphasized by the fact that The Macau Daily lead with a headline declaring Chui’s victory before the vote actually took place. An online pollat the English language MacauNews. com showed that 44 percent of respondents felt that Chui’s top priority should be combating public corruption, while only 2. 3 percent stressed the importance for political reforms. This strong displeasure towards corruption was likely exacerbated by a recent high-profile case involving a former official in Macau, now serving 28 years in prison...|$|E

Snell taunted jailers that something drastic would {{happen on the}} day of his execution. The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed by explosives in the hours before he died. Earlier criminal proceedings had produced evidence that Snell and other affiliates had visited the Murrah Building to examine it as a possible bombing target in 1983. However, when Snell watched televised reports of the Oklahoma City bombing prior to his execution, according to Millar, who was with Snell at the time, Snell was appalled by what he saw.
