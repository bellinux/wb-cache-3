40|$|To {{understand}} the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> price determination process {{it is necessary}} to extend the analysis beyond the markets for petroleum. <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices are determined in two closely related markets: the markets for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and the markets for refined products. <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> is a raw material used in the refinery in a joint products process. For a given level of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> supply, the value of petroleum lies in the value of refined products produced from it. ^ An econometric-linear programming model was developed to capture the linkages between the markets for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and refined products. In the LP refiners maximize profits given <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> supplies, refining capacities, and prices of refined products. The objective function is profit maximization net of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices. The shadow price on <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> gives the netback price. Refined product prices are obtained from the econometric models. ^ The model covers the free world divided in five regions. The model is used to analyze the impacts on the markets of policies that affect <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> supplies, the demands for refined products, and the refining industry. For each scenario analyzed the demand for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> is derived from the equilibrium conditions in the markets for products. The demand curve is confronted with a supply curve which maximizes revenues providing an equilibrium solution for both <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and product markets. The model also captures <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> price differentials by quality. ^ The results show that the demands for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> are different across regions due to the structure of the refining industries and the characteristics of the demands for refined products. Changes in the demands for products have a larger impact on the markets than changes in the refining industry. Since the markets for refined products and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> are interrelated they can 2 ̆ 7 t be analyzed individually if an accurate and complete assessment of a policy is to be made.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to resolve two important issues. First, it investigates the diversification benefit of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> for equities. Second, it examines {{whether or not}} <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derivatives transactions by oil and gas producers can change shareholders' wealth. With these two major goals in mind, I study the risk and return profile of <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> the value effect of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derivatives transactions, and the systematic risk exposure effect of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derivatives transactions. In contrast with previous studies, this study applies the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) methodology to measure the risk and return profile of <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> The results show that <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> is negatively correlated with stocks so adding <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> into a portfolio with equities can provide significant diversification benefits for the portfolio. Given the diversification benefit of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> mixed with equities, this study then examines the value effect of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derivatives transactions by oil and gas producers. Differing from traditional corporate risk management literature, this study examines corporate derivatives transactions from the shareholders' portfolio perspective. The results show that <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derivatives transactions by oil and gas producers do impact value. If oil and gas producing companies stop shorting <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derivatives contracts, company stock prices increase significantly. In contrast, if oil and gas producing companies start shorting <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derivatives contracts, stock prices drop marginally significantly. Thus, hedging by producers is not necessarily good. This paper, however, finds that changes in policy regarding <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derivatives transactions cannot significantly affect the beta of shareholders' portfolios. The value effect, therefore, cannot be attributed to any systematic risk exposure change of shareholders' portfolios. Market completeness, transaction costs, and economies of scale are identified as possible sources of value effect. The following conclusions have been obtained in this study. <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> provides significant diversification benefits for equities.

Waxy <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> tend to gel at a low temperature. Based on gelation theory, the characteristic temperature of waxy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> was determined by analyzing viscosity-temperature data. Two mathematical models were developed for calculating characteristic temperatures of virgin <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> and pour point depressants (PPD) beneficiated <b>crude</b> <b>oils,</b> respectively. By using these two models, the characteristic temperatures of <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> that have experienced shearing and thermal histories can be predicted. The model for predicting the characteristic temperature of virgin <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> has an average relative deviation of 4.5 %, and all predicted values have a deviation within 2 °C.
