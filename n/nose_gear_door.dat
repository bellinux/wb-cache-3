5000|$|The 260C {{introduced}} a new [...] "Tiger Shark" [...] cowling, max gross weight of 3200 pounds, cowl flaps, and an aileron-rudder interconnect. Cruise speed was advertised as 150-161 knots with fuel flow of 12.5 to 14.1 gal per hour. To prevent possible aft center of gravity problems due to the increased gross weight and its fifth and sixth seats, the propeller shaft was extended. This moved {{the center of gravity}} slightly forward. With a useful load of 1427 pounds it has the largest payload of all of the Comanches except the 400. Often mistaken on the ramp for the 400 model, the slightly longer cowling includes a distinctively longer <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> <b>door,</b> as compared to the B models and older versions. The 400 model does not have three side windows as with the B and C models. New, they sold for $36,550 to $45,990.|$|E
50|$|MD 450B Ouragan : Hispano-Suiza-built Nene 104B engine, revised two-section <b>nose</b> landing <b>gear</b> <b>doors</b> as the {{original}} four-section design was prone to damage when the cannon were fired.|$|R
50|$|Beneath {{the forward}} crew {{compartment}} was the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> wheel well, {{through which the}} pilot and gunner entered and exited the aircraft. The forward gear leg retracted to the rear, up against a contoured cover that when closed for flight formed part of the cockpit floor; the gear would not have space to retract with it open. The oleo scissor faced forwards. The nosewheel was centered, with the strut forking to the aircraft's left. The nosewheel was approximately ¾ {{the diameter of the}} main wheels. <b>Nose</b> <b>gear</b> <b>doors</b> were two pieces, split evenly longitudinally, and hinged at each outboard edge.|$|R
50|$|Nose wheel {{steering}} is electronically {{controlled by the}} rudder pedals, utilizing the synchro principle. Hydraulic pressure for retraction and extension of the gear is transmitted by a system of tubing, hoses and actuating cylinders and is electrically controlled by limit switches and solenoid valves. Emergency extension can be accomplished pneumatically in case of hydraulic or electrical system failure. The main gear is enclosed by two doors after retraction. The inboard doors are hydraulically operated while the outboard doors are mechanically operated by linkage connected to the main <b>gear</b> struts. The <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> <b>doors</b> operate mechanically with linkages attached to the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> shock strut.|$|R
5000|$|The Riviera is a unique, {{though not}} unattractive design, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} famous Republic Seabee of the 1940s. The major difference between the Riviera and the Seabee {{is the use of}} a high twin-boom tail arrangement on the Riviera while the Seabee uses a single conventional tail. The Riviera uses a tricycle landing <b>gear,</b> with the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> retracting into the nose and concealed behind two small <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> <b>doors.</b> As a result, forward visibility is somewhat better in the Riviera than in the Seabee when taxiing or taking off on land. The Riviera is powered by a [...] Continental IO-470-P six-cylinder flat engine mounted above the fuselage in a pusher arrangement. A three-bladed propeller was standard.|$|R

40|$|Phil Engelauf, STS- 114 Mission Operations Representative reports: {{the orbital}} {{rendezvous}} was successful, and today's activities includes initial preparations {{of the next}} day's extravehicular activities (EVA); he specifically mentioned tile repair, wiring {{on the outside of}} the vehicle to try to recover CMG 2 (Control Moment Gyro), and preparation for the external stowage platform. John Shannon, Manager of the Space Shuttle Operations and Integration reports from Engineering standpoint that the composites of the underside of the tile surface seen from pictures taken during the pitch maneuver were extremely clean; the Engineering staff continues to look at the focus inspection data from the orbital boom sensor system (OBSS) and other data to assess the condition of the vehicle. Solid rocket boosters were retrieved and are towed back to the Air Force hangar in Cape Carneval. Six target inspection (<b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> <b>doors,</b> gap fillers, chine area, external tank doors, trailing edge, and ice), and arm operations, foam, conservation measures, shuttle air lock, aerodynamics assessment and re-entry were topics covered with the News media...|$|R
50|$|Whatever {{the serial}} {{presentation}} on the fin, the full fiscal serial is always {{presented in a}} technical data block, which is normally on the port (left) side near the cockpit. Often {{a portion of the}} aircraft serial number is also painted on the aircraft nose (as is done with helicopters) or on the <b>nose</b> landing <b>gear</b> <b>door</b> (as is done on fighters and bombers) to help ground and air crew personnel speedily identify a certain aircraft as it approaches while taxiing into or out of parking spots or elsewhere around an airfield.|$|R

500|$|The B-1A's {{engine was}} {{modified}} slightly {{to produce the}} GE F101-102 for the B-1B, {{with an emphasis on}} durability, and increased efficiency. The core of this engine has since been re-used in several other engine designs, including the GE F110 which has seen use in the F-14 Tomcat, F-15K/SG variants and most recent versions of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. It is also the basis for the non-afterburning GE F118 used in the B-2 Spirit and the U-2S. [...] The F101 engine was the basis for the core of the extremely popular CFM56 civil engine, which can be found on some versions of practically every small-to-medium-sized airliner. The <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> cover <b>door</b> has controls for the auxiliary power units (APUs), which allow for quick starts of the APUs upon order to scramble.|$|R
50|$|The {{first flight}} of the He 162 V1, by Flugkapitän Gotthold Peter — the first German jet fighter {{aircraft}} design to be jet-powered from its maiden flight onward — was fairly successful, but during a high-speed run at 840 km/h (520 mph), the highly acidic replacement glue attaching the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> strut <b>door</b> failed and the pilot was forced to land. Other problems were noted as well, notably a pitch instability and problems with sideslip due to the rudder design. None were considered important enough {{to hold up the}} production schedule for even a day. On a second flight on 10 December, again with Peter at the controls, in front of various Nazi officials, the glue again caused a structural failure. This allowed the aileron to separate from the wing, causing the plane to roll over and crash, killing Peter.|$|R
40|$|Wayne Hale Space Shuttle Deputy Program Manager, and Chuck Campbell Subsystem Engineer in Aerothermodynamics {{are seen}} in this post mission {{management}} teem briefing on this seventh day of space flight. Wayne Hale begins with talking about how the International Space Station has been resupplied with its necessities, and that the Control Moment Gyroscope (CSG) has been replaced. Hale expresses his concern {{about the health of}} the Space Shuttle Discovery with the two protruding gap fillers present, and the aerothermodynamics surrounding the gap fillers. These concerns led to the conclusion to have spacewalker Stephen Robinson remove the gap fillers during EVA- 3. Campbell shows a video of the protruding gap filler aft of <b>Nose</b> Landing <b>Gear</b> <b>Door</b> (NLGD). Campbell and Hale answer questions from the news media about the risks of performing this spacewalk, boundary layer transitions, flight safety, inspections, and temperature concerns...|$|R
40|$|A damaged <b>nose</b> landing <b>gear</b> (NLG) <b>door</b> port of an {{aircraft}} {{was sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed foreign object damage (FOD) on the door surface. The direction of movement of the foreign object was determined to be from rear to front. Compositional analysis carried out on the damaged surface showed that the foreign object was metallic in nature and it had a composition similar to 70 - 30 brass. Analysis suggests that the foreign object was probably debris of a body fired either from the aircraft itself or from elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} show the {{potential}} of foam cores in RTM structures, the German Aerospace Centre DLR has developed several structural demonstrators using an autoclave-based resin injection technology called Single-Line-Injection technology (SLI) in combination with PMI (ROHACELL) foam cores. Some of these demonstrators feature a skin that is tolerant to impact by being modified using a Single-Side-Stitching technology. Furthermore the DLR investigates new LRI (Liquid Resin Infusion) /foam core-based design strategies for CFRP fuselage structures that combine highly integrated designs with simple tooling concepts. In the field of series applications the INVENT company in Braunschweig has successfully introduced the LRI/foam-core strategy for the <b>Nose</b> Landing <b>Gear</b> <b>Doors</b> and other class II parts of the newly developed Fairchild Dornier Do 728 Airliner.

50|$|The final {{aircraft}} in the 177 line was the retractable-gear 177RG Cardinal RG, which Cessna began producing in 1971 as a direct competitor to the Piper PA-28-200R Cherokee Arrow and Beechcraft Sierra. The <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> folds rearward; when opened the <b>gear</b> <b>door</b> formed a small air brake behind the propeller.|$|R
40|$|A pre-launch debris {{inspection}} of the pad and Shuttle vehicle was conducted on 2 March 1994. The detailed walkdown of Launch Pad 39 B and MLP- 1 also included the primary flight elements OV- 102 Columbia (16 th flight), ET- 62 (LWT 55), and BI- 064 SRB's. There were no significant facility or vehicle anomalies. After the launch on March 4 th, a debris {{inspection of}} Pad 39 B was performed. Damage to the pad overall was minimal. On-orbit photographs taken by the flight crew and two films from the ET/ORB umbilical cameras of the External Tank after separation from the Orbiter revealed no major damage or lost flight hardware {{that would have been}} a safety of flight concern. Orbiter performance on final approach appeared normal. Infrared imagery of landing gear deployment showed the loss of thermal barrier from the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> wheel well. The missing thermal barrier material was not recovered. The Solid Rocket Boosters were inspected at Hanger AF after retrieval. Both frustums had a combined total of 44 MSA- 2 debonds over fasteners. Significant amounts of BTA had been applied to closeouts on the RH frustum, forward skirt, and aft skirt. Hypalon paint was blistered/missing over the areas were the BTA had been applied. The underlying BTA was not sooted (IFA STS- 62 -B- 1). Investigation of this condition has concluded there was insufficient heat rates to cause blistering of the Hypalon until late in the ascent phase. A post landing inspection of OV- 102 was conducted after the landing at KSC. The Orbiter TPS sustained a total of 97 hits, of which 16 had a major dimension of 1 inch or larger. The Orbiter lower surface had a total of 36 hits, of which 7 had a major dimension of 1 inch or larger. Based on these numbers and comparison to statistics from previous missions of similar configuration, both the total number of debris hits and the number of hits 1 inch or larger was less than average. Six thermal barriers, total size approximately 36 in. x 3 in. x 1. 5 in., and one corner tile piece 4 in. x 4 in., were missing from the <b>nose</b> landing <b>gear</b> <b>doors.</b> Runway infrared cameras recorded these objects falling from the Orbiter when the <b>nose</b> landing <b>gear</b> <b>doors</b> were opened on final approach. A search of the area under the flight path failed to recover the missing thermal batteries, which may be submerged in the large body of water south of the runway. The cause for the loss of the material was attributed to the way the substrate was prepared for bonding at the vendor. Orbiter post landing microchemical sample results revealed a variety of residuals in the Orbiter window samples. These were attributed to SRB BSM exhaust, Orbiter TPS, window protective covers and processing, natural landing site products, and paints/primers from various sources. The residual sampling data do not indicate a single source of damaging debris and all of these materials have been documented previously in analyses for post landing sample reports. Data from residual sampling also showed no trends when compared to previous mission data. A total of ten Post Launch Anomalies, including one IFA, were observed during the STS- 62 mission assessment...|$|R
25|$|The F-111 used {{a three-point}} landing gear arrangement, with a two-wheel <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> and two single-wheel {{main landing gear}} units. The landing <b>gear</b> <b>door</b> for the main gear, which was {{positioned}} {{in the center of}} the fuselage, also served as a speed brake in flight. Most F-111 variants included a terrain-following radar system connected to the autopilot. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines. The F-111's variable-geometry wings, escape capsule, terrain following radar, and afterburning turbofans were new technologies for production aircraft.|$|R
50|$|After about a 30-minute flight, it {{was time}} to land and Welch lowered the flaps and gear. At this point, the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> would not extend completely. For 40 minutes, Welch unsuccessfully tried {{everything}} to extend the <b>nose</b> <b>gear.</b> When he reached a low fuel state, he elected to land on Muroc Lake Bed without a fully extended <b>nose</b> <b>gear.</b> Upon touchdown, in a nose-high attitude, Welch cut the engine and as the XP-86 slowed the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> snapped down and locked. The aircraft was undamaged.|$|R
50|$|On 10 March 2010, Pegasus Airlines Flight 361, an Airbus A319 {{operated}} by IZair on a ferry flight, made {{an emergency landing}} at Frankfurt Airport, Germany after a malfunction in the <b>nose</b> <b>gear.</b> The flight landed safely but blew both front <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> tires. The airport closed runway 07R/25L for 3 hours to allow recovery. The <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> suffered the same problem as JetBlue Flight 292.|$|R
50|$|The T-2's {{tricycle}} {{landing gear}} all featured single wheels, with the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> retracting backward and the main gear retracting forward into the fuselage, rotating 90° to lie flat, and incorporated an antiskid control system. The <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> was offset slightly to the right, with a small fixed vertical airfoil mounted {{in front of it}} to compensate for the extended <b>nose</b> <b>gear's</b> tendency to cause yaw. A runway arresting hook was fitted under the tail behind the engine exhausts.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted at the Langley Research Center to determine a method for towing an aircraft to measure the side forces of a free-swiveling <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> due to variations in bank angle. A F- 106 aircraft and the Space Shuttle orbiter OV- 101 were towed to measure side forces on full-size aircraft for bank angles up to 3 deg. These tests indicate that substantial side forces will occur if an aircraft is rolling on a runway in a banked attitude even when the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> is free to swivel. Corotation of a twin-tire <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> appears to cause {{a substantial increase in}} side force due to bank angle compared with a <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> with indepdendently rotating wheels...|$|R
25|$|On 11 September 1998, China Eastern Flight 586, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11, {{flying from}} Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport, {{suffered}} a <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> failure after take-off. The aircraft landed back in Shanghai with the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> up on a foamed runway.|$|R
50|$|The main {{landing gear}} {{consists}} of sprung fibreglass gear legs with 5X5.00 tires as standard on graphite wheel rims. Larger 6X6.00 tires are optional.
