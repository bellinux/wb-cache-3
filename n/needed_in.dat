The study is an initiative of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) in an effort to improve the access to agricultural information, generation and management of agricultural information <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> these countries with the view of developing their own information and communication management strategies. Objectives Since CTA works mainly through intermediary organisations and partners to promote agriculture and rural development, the identification of appropriate partners is crucial for success. Identification of information needs of potential partners for CTA and their capacity building <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> information and communication management were also important objectives.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of rising necessities is {{studied in the}} mechanism of the dialectical development of production and consumption and is represented {{as a set of}} interrelated aspects. This is {{an increase in the number}} of needs and consumption; distribution of <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> the broader circle of consumers; changed quality of needs; complication of the consumption method; changed forms of consumption; development of intellectual and social needs. The article shows that the process of rising necessities includes the complication of the consumption method, which leads to the formation of <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> services, and then to the emergence of social forms of consumption and services. It reveals the features and effects of this process: broad development of non-vital needs, emergence of quality and quantity hyper-consumption, demonstrative consumption and pursuit of brands; existence of antisocial needs that turns the rise <b>in</b> <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> its opposite; prevalence of consumer demand over income that results in “life on credit” of individuals and entire countries; unrestrained growth of needs, consumption and production respectively that give rise to unprecedented environmental pollution; hedonistic orientation of consumption, violation of dialectical connection of needs-abilities, crisis of culture and morality; formation of poly-needs that combine several components (material and non-material); accelerated development of <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> communication, entertainment and games.
