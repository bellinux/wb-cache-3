5|$|Graph homeomorphism is a {{different}} notion, not related directly to homomorphisms. Roughly speaking, it requires injectivity, but allows mapping edges to paths (<b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> edges). Graph minors are a still more relaxed notion.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{public and}} private affluence. Buildings have {{a wider range of}} purpose, and are {{expected}} to meet increasingly complex demands. For example, the new opera building (designed by Snøhetta) in Oslo reflects an ambition <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> build a vibrant cultural center, but also to create a new architectural icon in the Oslofjord.|$|E

30|$|In {{making such}} decisions, it is <b>not</b> enough <b>just</b> <b>to</b> say that {{expenditures}} {{in a given}} area are meritorious; {{they need to be}} more meritorious than other expenditures. It is <b>not</b> enough <b>just</b> <b>to</b> say that actions in a given area benefit the beneficiaries of the program; the concern needs to be with social benefits to all members of society, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> those members of society who participate in the program in question. And it is <b>not</b> enough <b>just</b> <b>to</b> look at benefits; equal attention needs to be paid to costs, both the direct costs of the action under consideration but also the opportunity cost – that is, what will not be undertaken, because this program is undertaken.|$|R

5|$|In the Second World War, Great Britain granted conscientious-objection status <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} pacifists, but {{to those}} who objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of conscientious objectors {{that occurred during the}} First World War.|$|E

5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small {{foothold}} in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and {{setting the stage for}} the early Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E

5|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed. This {{consisted}} of a rampart, ditch, and possibly a tower, {{in front of the}} gatehouse which could be used to further protect the entrance.

5|$|In 1814 {{under the}} new and ambitious Governor-General Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, the Earl of Moira, the long-standing {{diplomatic}} disputes between British India and the Kingdom of Nepal, caused by expansionist policies of both parties, descended into open hostility. The British East India Company sought to invade Nepal <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> secure the border and to force the Nepali government to open trading routes to Tibet, but also for what Hastings saw as a geo-political necessity to secure the foothold of the Company in the Indian sub-continent.|$|E
5|$|Mysts effects {{extended}} {{to those who}} played the games and technology. The title was widely credited {{as one of the}} first games to appeal <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> hardcore gamers but to casual players and demographics that generally did not play games, such as women. Mysts lack of conventional game elementsviolence, dying, and failureappealed to nongamers and those contemplating buying a computer. The Millers' decision to develop Myst for the nascent CD-ROM format helped boost interest and adoption of disc drives.|$|E

5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. Wheeler {{became part of the}} DuPont design staff. He worked closely with its engineers, commuting between Chicago and Wilmington, Delaware, where DuPont had its headquarters. He moved his family to Wilmington in March 1943. DuPont's task was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> build nuclear reactors, but an entire plutonium production complex at the Hanford Site in Washington. As work progressed, Wheeler relocated his family again in July 1944, this time to Richland, Washington, where he worked in the scientific buildings known as the 300 area.|$|E

5|$|As plans {{moved forward}} the {{decision}} was made <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> play the game but make it an event celebrating New York hockey history. For the game the Crunch played their intrastate rivals the Binghamton Senators. The days before the game local youth hockey teams played on the ice, and then the day after there was a pond hockey tournament played on the rink featuring 16 local teams. The fairgrounds also featured VIP tents, fan zones, bands, and ice sculpting for the celebration, as well as appearances by former players for New York's various professional teams.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E
5|$|Little {{has changed}} in the general sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> Boccaccio's brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E

5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for charitable trusts. They are {{free from the}} income tax paid by individuals and companies, and also the corporation tax paid by incorporated and unincorporated associations. There is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay capital gains tax or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from tax liability applies <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E
5|$|The PanzerI's design {{history can}} be traced to the British Carden Loyd tankette of which it {{borrowed}} much of its track and suspension design. After six prototype Kleintraktor were produced the cover name was changed to Krupp-Traktor whereas the development codename was changed to Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper (LaS) (Agricultural Tractor). The LaS was intended <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> train Germany's panzer troops, but to prepare Germany's industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future; a difficult engineering feat for the time. The armament of production versions was to be two 7.92mm MG 13 machine guns in a rotating turret. Machine guns were known to be largely useless against even the lightest tank armour of the time, restricting the PanzerI to a training and anti-infantry role by design.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
