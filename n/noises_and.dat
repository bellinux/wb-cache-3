5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping <b>noises,</b> <b>and</b> buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction {{in the range of}} movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by <b>noises</b> <b>and</b> shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking <b>noises</b> <b>and</b> wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E

5|$|That night, as Jack and Kate {{decide to}} search for the plane cockpit as its {{transceiver}} would allow the survivors to send a distress signal, loud roaring <b>noises</b> <b>and</b> crashing trees are heard in the nearby jungle. The following morning, the two are accompanied by Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) on their way into the jungle. The cockpit is found leaning against a tree, forcing the trio to climb it to reach the cabin. Charlie disappears into the bathroom while Jack and Kate awaken the concussed pilot (Greg Grunberg) in the cabin. The pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after take off, where it turned back for Fiji and hit wake turbulence. After estimating that the flight was 1,000 miles off course before it crashed, the pilot tries using the transceiver, but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noises heard on the beach the previous night return, and when the pilot investigates, he is seized by something outside and blood splatters on the window, prompting the trio to grab the transceiver and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him, while a terrified Kate runs on. After the monster disappears, Kate, Charlie and Jack reunite and find the pilot's bloodied corpse suspended in a treetop.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: One of the {{chemical}} pollutions which is frequently common in industry-other than noise is carbon monoxide. The present study aimed to assess the putative protective effect of N-acetylcysteine on the function of outer hair cells of rabbits exposed simultaneously to <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> carbon monoxide. Methods: 24 male rabbits are entered in this interventional study. After obtaining baseline distortion product otoacoustic emissions, rabits were randomely devided into four groups. The groups Included: exposed with <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> received saline, exposed with <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> carbon monoxide and received saline, exposed with <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> received N-acetylcysteine, <b>and</b> exposed with <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> carbon monoxide and received N-acetylcysteine. Subsequently, they were evaluated again with distortion product otoacoustic emissions in two stages (two hours and {{one week after the}} exposure). Data were recorded and analyzed using paired and independent sample t-tests. Results: Exposure to <b>noise,</b> <b>and</b> also simultaneous exposure to <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> carbon monoxide, and moreover using N-acetylcysteine in both groups, produced significant changes in distortion product otoacoustic emissions amplitudes (p< 0. 005). Conclusion: The findings of the present research reveal that simultaneous exposure to <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> carbon monoxide may potentiate noise induced hearing loss. In addition, utilizing N-acetylcysteine {{can be used as a}} preventive agent for noise induced hearing loss and to avoid its potentiation with carbon monoxide...|$|R

The noises included the effects of two types of fac¸ade: windows-open and windows-closed. Subjects were exposed to six levels of <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> six magnitudes of vibration, and asked to rate annoyance using an 11 -point numerical scale. The experiment consisted of four sessions: (1) evaluation of noise annoyance in the absence of vibration, (2) evaluation of total annoyance from simultaneous <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration, (3) evaluation of noise annoyance in the presence of vibration, and (4) evaluation of vibration annoyance in the absence of noise. The results show that vibration did not influence ratings of noise annoyance, but that total annoyance caused by combined <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration was considerably greater than the annoyance caused by noise alone. The <b>noise</b> annoyance <b>and</b> the total annoyance caused by combined <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration were associated with subject self-ratings of noise sensitivity.

The network brought together 33 European research centres from 16 countries to establish future research directions and policy needs for <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> health in Europe. ENNAH focused on the study of environmental noise sources, in particular transport noise. This network facilitated high level scientific communication and encouraged productive interdisciplinary discussion and exchange through a series of workshops and reports. An important aspect of the ENNAH Network has been identifying gaps in <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> health research {{while at the same time}} assessing, prioritizing and integrating the future research orientation into policy development which would lead to an efficient investment of resources allocated to <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> health research. <b>Noise</b> maps produced under the direction of the Environmental Noise Directive (2002 / 49 /EC) are potentially a very useful resource for <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> health research. We have reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of current <b>noise</b> maps <b>and</b> recommended future changes that would make these maps more appropriate for <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> health research. We have also considered possible new methods for acoustic measurement and modelling which will help to develop innovative exposure measurement techniques in future <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> health studies. Primarily, ENNAH focused on outlining new priorities for research on environmental <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> health which will hopefully feed into future calls for funding on environment and health matters from the EU. In some areas this means strengthening the evidence on existing exposure effect relationships and using more robust methods such as longitudinal rather than cross sectional studies. This is particularly relevant to the research on environmental <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> hypertension and coronary heart disease and on studies of <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> children’s learning.

Last but not least, a further important area identified is to assess where new investment in noise research should be placed, whether this relates to previously non‐ or poorly studied health outcomes or improvements in the <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> health methodological framework.

40|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>and</b> {{linearity}} {{are the two}} key {{concerns in}} RF transceiver systems. However, the impact of circuit topology and device technology on systems <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> linearity behaviors is poorly understood because of the complexity and diversity involved. There are two general questions that are addressed by the RF device and circuit designers: for a given device technology, how best to optimize the circuit topology; and for a given circuit topology, how best to optimize the device technology to improve the <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> linearity performance. In this dissertation, a systematic <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> linearity calculation method is proposed. This approach offers simple and analytical solutions to optimize the <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> linearity characteristics of integrated circuits. Supported by this approach, the physics of state-of-the-art SiGe HBT technology devices can be decoupled and studied. The corresponding impact on <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> linearity is investigated. New optimization methodologies for <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> linearity at both the device and circuit level are presented. In addition, this thesis demonstrates a technique that accurately extracts ac <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> parameters of devices/circuits in the millimeter-wave range. The extraction technique supports and verifies the device/circuit noise analysis from a measurement standpoint. Ph. D. Committee Chair: John D.
