40|$|Output {{power of}} wind turbine {{generator}} (WTG) is not constant and fluctuates due to wind speed changes. To reduce the adverse effects of the power system introducing WTGs, there are several published reports on output power control of WTGs detailing various researches based on pitch angle control, variable speed wind turbines, energy storage systems, and so on. In this context, this paper presents an integrated control method for a WF to reduce frequency deviations in a small power system. In this study, the WF achieves the frequency control with two control schemes: load estimation and <b>short-term</b> <b>ahead</b> wind speed prediction. For load estimation in the small power system, a minimal-order observer is used as disturbance observer. The estimated load is utilized to determine the output power command of the WF. To regulate the output power command of the WF according to wind speed changing, <b>short-term</b> <b>ahead</b> wind speed is predicted by using least-squares method. The predicted wind speed adjusts the output power command of the WF as a multiplying factor with fuzzy reasoning. By means of the proposed method, the WF can operate according to the wind and load conditions. In the WF system, each output power of the WTGs is controlled by regulating each pitch angle. For increasing acquisition power of the WF, a dispatch control method also is proposed. In the pitch angle control system of each WTG, generalized predictive control (GPC) is applied to enhance the control performance. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the numerical simulations. Frequency control Load estimation Pitch angle control Wind farm Wind speed prediction...|$|R

The other forecasters, such as multiple linear regression (MLR), time series, feed forward neural network (FFNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), clustering, and fuzzy inference neural network (FINN), {{reported in the literature}} are also compared with the present approach. The process of the proposed wavelet decompo-sition approach is that it first decomposes the historical load and weather variables into an approximate part associated with low frequencies and several detail parts associated with high frequen-cies components through the wavelet transform. The historical data are smoothened by deleting the high frequency components and fed as input to the proposed models for the prediction.

Consequently, operators must accurately forecast wind speed/power in the dispatch center to carry out unit commitment, real power scheduling and economic dispatch. This work presents a novel method based on the integration of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast the <b>short-term</b> (1 h <b>ahead)</b> wind speed/power. First, significant parameters for training the ANN are identified using the correlation coefficients. These significant parameters serve as inputs of the ANN.

The final forecasting results are achieved by aggregating all individual forecasting results from all IMFs and their corresponding residual functions.

This <b>navigation</b> requires a <b>short-term</b> memory achieved through the sequential methylations and demethylations of several specific glutamate residues on the chemotaxis receptors, which progressively adjusts the receptors' activity to track the levels of stimulation encountered by the cell with a delay. Such adaptation also tunes the receptors' sensitivity according to the background ligand concentration, enabling the cells to respond to fractional rather than absolute concentration changes, i. e. to perform logarithmic sensing. Despite the adaptation system being principally well understood, the need for a specific number of methylation sites remains relatively unclear. Here we systematically substituted the four glutamate residues of the Tar receptor of Escherichia coli by non-methylated alanine, creating a set of 16 modified receptors with a varying number of available methylation sites and explored the effect of these substitutions on the performance of the chemotaxis system. Alanine substitutions were found to desensitize the receptors, similarly but to a lesser extent than glutamate methylation, and to affect the methylation and demethylation rates of the remaining sites in a site-specific manner. Each substitution reduces the dynamic range of chemotaxis, by one order of magnitude on average. The substitution of up to two sites could be partly compensated by the adaptation system, but the full set of methylation sites was necessary to achieve efficient logarithmic sensing...|$|R

This study used modelling to investigate the benefits of using short-term and long-term solar forecasts to operate a concentrated solar thermal (CST) plant for a year at four sites that covered different climate zones within the Australian National Electricity Market. Using 1 -hour <b>ahead</b> <b>short-term</b> forecasts increased net value by $ 0. 90 -$ 2. 07 million for a CST plant with storage, and by $ 0. 76 -$ 3. 10 million for a CST plant without storage. It also improved reliability by reducing the equivalent forced outage rate by 21 - 38 percentage points for a CST plant with storage, and by 16 - 42 percentage points for a CST plant without storage. Using 1 -hour forecasts achieved 59 %- 94 % of the net value achievable if the 48 -hour forecast were perfect. At each site, the highest net value and reliability were achieved by a CST plant with storage and using 1 -hour forecasts, thus a CST plant should have both storage and short-term forecasts. If only one can be used, then a CST plant with storage and without 1 -hour forecasts achieves higher net value, whereas a CST plant without storage and with 1 -hour forecasts achieves higher reliability. These results demonstrated that using short-term forecasts is beneficial for CST plants that operate in electricity markets that allow updated bids to be submitted at short-term time frames. The results can be used to estimate the return on investment in obtaining short-term forecasts for operating a CST plant. Furthermore, the research method can be adapted into a tool for estimating value to assist CST plant project planning...|$|R

Utility grid operation is not only impacted by the uncertainty of the future production of wind farms, but also by the variability of their current production and how the active and reactive power exchange with the grid is controlled. To address this particular task, a control technique for wind turbines, driven by doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs), is developed to regulate the terminal voltage by equally sharing the generated/absorbed reactive power between the rotor-side and the grid-side converters. To highlight the impact of the new developed technique in reducing the power loss in the generator set, an economic analysis is carried out. Moreover, a new aggregated model for wind farms is proposed that accounts for the irregularity of the incident wind distribution throughout the farm layout. Specifically, this model includes the wake effect and the time delay of the incident wind speed of the different turbines on the farm, and to simulate the fluctuation in the generated power more accurately and more closer to real-time operation. Recently, wind farms with considerable output power ratings have been installed. Their integrating into the utility grid will substantially affect the electricity markets.
