25|$|Two {{significant}} {{factors are}} evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a <b>net</b> <b>benefit</b> that {{is higher than}} any column in Figure 165. In other words, the average married person (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA tax dollar paid than does the average single person – {{no matter what the}} gender or wage level. Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses. Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000. In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year.|$|E

In comparison, the UK budget rebate for 2005 is scheduled to be approx €5.5billion. The popular view in the UK (as, for example, set forth in the tabloid press) is that if the UK rebate were reduced with no change to the CAP, then the UK would be paying money to keep the French farming sector in business – to many people in the UK, this would be seen as unfair.|$|E

First, banning atmospheric tests would prevent the US from ensuring the hardness of its LGM-30 Minuteman missile silos and, second, from developing a capable missile defense system. Third, it was argued that the Soviet Union led the US in high-yield weapons (recall the Soviet Tsar Bomba test of 1961), which required atmospheric testing banned by the treaty, while the US led the Soviet Union in low-yield weapons, which were tested underground and would be permitted by the treaty. Fourth, the ban would prevent peaceful, civilian uses of nuclear detonations. Teller declared that the treaty would be a [...] "step away from safety and possibly... toward war." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1922 Keynes {{continued}} to advocate reduction of German reparations with A Revision of the Treaty. He attacked the post World War I deflation policies with A Tract on Monetary Reform in 1923 – a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation {{even at the}} cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of sterling to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works. During the 1920s Keynes's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion – according to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was [...] "muddled". The Tract had also {{called for an end to}} the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a <b>net</b> <b>benefit</b> for countries such as Britain to participate in the gold standard, as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment.

Objectives: This study was intended to investigate BI and identify the moderating and mediating effects of user satisfaction on the relationship between system quality, information quality and service quality on the one hand and perceived <b>net</b> <b>benefits</b> on the other in South Africa. Methods: The quantitative methods approach was predominantly used in this study. A total of 211 responses were obtained from a random sample of 250 BI users throughout South Africa. A semi-structured online survey questionnaire was used to collect the data, and correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to analyse it. Results: It was found that user satisfaction mediates the relationship between perceived <b>net</b> <b>benefits</b> and system quality and service quality. It also moderates the effects of system quality and service quality on perceived <b>net</b> <b>benefits.</b> Information quality is not related with user satisfaction and perceived <b>net</b> <b>benefits.</b> Conclusion: The implication of the results is that system quality and user satisfaction should be enhanced and maintained to achieve perceived positive <b>net</b> <b>benefits</b> in order to make the BI system more effective and efficient. </p...|$|R
