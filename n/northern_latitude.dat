5|$|Because of Copenhagen's <b>northern</b> <b>latitude,</b> {{the number}} of {{daylight}} hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E

The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more <b>northern</b> <b>latitude.</b> Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to Region Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E

30|$|Angiosperms of Group G {{have not}} been {{observed}} at tropical or subtropical ecoregions in Asian continent. These plants had probably migrated from <b>northern</b> <b>latitudes</b> to Taiwan or vice versa. Migration of plants from <b>northern</b> <b>latitudes</b> to Taiwan {{was supported by the}} phylogenetic studies of Chamaecyparis formosensis and Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana (Li et al. 2003). Migration of plants from <b>northern</b> to southern <b>latitudes</b> might have been caused by global cooling in the late Tertiary and Quaternary that had forced many plants to migrate southward (Chung et al. 2011; Denk 2004; Huang and Lin 2006; Huang et al. 2004).

Migrations of plants from Taiwan to <b>northern</b> <b>latitudes</b> or vice versa were supported by some evidences of published documents. Analysis on the population genetics is suggested to provide evidence for identifying the migration of plants from <b>northern</b> <b>latitudes</b> to Taiwan or vice versa; to date, few study has focused on this topic. Route IV and V had provided pathway for plants to migrate from temperate regions to Taiwan, whereas there are only 150 species of Group G. The number of Group G indicated that Route IV and V are less important on angiosperm species richness in Taiwan.|$|R

25|$|Malmö, {{like the}} rest of {{southern}} Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is surprisingly mild compared to other locations in similar latitudes, or even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the Gulf Stream. Because of its <b>northern</b> <b>latitude,</b> daylight extends 17 hours in midsummer, to only around 7 hours in midwinter. The actual sunshine is measured at 1,700 hours per annum in Falsterbo a bit further south and 1,592 hours per annum in Lund somewhat north, according to the 1961–1990 averages. For 2002–2014, the sunshine is measured at 1,895 hours per annum in Falsterbo and 1,803 hours per annum in Lund.

25|$|Located on the Middle American isthmus joining North and South America between ca. 10° and 22° <b>northern</b> <b>latitude,</b> Mesoamerica {{possesses}} a complex combination of ecological systems, topographic zones, and environmental contexts. A main distinction groups these different niches into two broad categories: the lowlands (those areas between sea level and 1000 meters) and the altiplanos, or highlands (situated between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level). In the low-lying regions, sub-tropical and tropical climates are most common, {{as is true}} {{for most of the}} coastline along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The highlands show much more climatic diversity, ranging from dry tropical to cold mountainous climates; the dominant climate is temperate with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall.

He won international fame after reaching a record <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> of 86°14′ during his North Pole expedition of 1893–96. Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent Arctic and Antarctic expeditions.|$|E
500|$|European {{exploration}} of the Arctic regions began in the 16th century, with searches for new routes to the Pacific via the Northeast and Northwest passages.

[...] In time, the search for trade routes became secondary to the prestige objective of reaching the North Pole itself, or at least of registering a [...] "Farthest North". In 1773 a British naval expedition under Captain Constantine Phipps sought a route to the pole from the Seven Islands, but found the way impassably blocked by ice.

500|$|The {{subtropical}} ridge, {{also known}} as the subtropical high or horse latitudes, is a significant belt of atmospheric high pressure situated around the latitudes of 30°N in the Northern Hemisphere and 30°S in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the product of the global air circulation cell known as the Hadley Cell. The subtropical ridge is characterized by mostly calm winds, which act to reduce air quality under its axis by causing fog overnight, and haze during daylight hours {{as a result of the}} stable atmosphere found near its location. The air descending from the upper troposphere flows out from its center at surface level toward the upper and lower latitudes of each hemisphere, creating both the trade winds and the westerlies. The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer, reaching its most <b>northern</b> <b>latitude</b> in early fall, before moving equatorward during the cold season. The El Niño southern climate oscillation (ENSO) can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge, with La Niñas allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge, while El Niños show flatter, more southerly ridges. [...] The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes the tracks of tropical cyclones that form around their equatorward and western peripheries. As the subtropical ridge varies in position and strength, it can enhance or depress monsoon regimes around their low-latitude periphery. The term [...] "horse latitudes" [...] refers to and is synonymous with the subtropical ridge or subtropical high.|$|E
