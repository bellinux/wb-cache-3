5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> {{is carried}} down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse,</b> calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the muscle cell.|$|E
5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse,</b> allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E

40|$|Extracellular {{recording}} {{techniques have}} been used to study <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> in single sensory nerve terminals in guinea-pig cornea isolated in vitro. <b>Nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> occurred spontaneously and were evoked by electrical stimulation of the ciliary <b>nerves.</b> The <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> were identified as originating in polymodal receptors, mechano-receptors or ‘cold’ receptors. All three types are believed to be nociceptors. Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μm) blocked <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> evoked by electrical stimulation of the ciliary nerves. However, ongoing and/or naturally evoked <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> persisted in the presence of TTX in all three types of receptors. Lignocaine (lidocaine; 1 mm) blocked all electrical activity. TTX-resistant sodium channels therefore {{play a major role in}} generating the action potentials that signal pain to the brain...|$|R

Strong impulses allow for fast recognition of stimulus {{and allow for}} muscle contraction (Deen & Hark 2007).|$|R
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse)</b> which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E

50|$|Bendiocarb is not {{considered}} to be carcinogenic, but it is acutely toxic. Like other carbamates, it reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme required for normal transmission of <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses.</b> Bendiocarb binds to the active site of this enzyme leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine, which is required for the transmission of <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses,</b> at <b>nerve</b> muscle sites.|$|R
25|$|Insects {{that beat}} their wings {{less than one}} hundred times a second use {{synchronous}} muscle. A Synchronous muscle {{is a type of}} muscle that contracts once for every <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse,</b> which is more efficient for fast flight. Insects that beat their wings more rapidly, such as the bumblebee, use asynchronous muscle; this is a type of muscle that contracts more than once per <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse.</b> This is achieved by the muscle being stimulated to contract again by a release in tension in the muscle, which can happen more rapidly than through simple nerve stimulation alone.|$|E
25|$|Flight: Flight {{muscles are}} the most {{specialised}} category of muscle and are capable of rapid contractions. Nerve impulses are required to initiate muscle contractions and therefore flight. These muscles are also known as neurogenic or synchronous muscles. This is {{because there is a}} one-to-one correspondence between action potentials and muscle contractions. In insects with higher wing stroke frequencies the muscles contract more frequently than at the rate that the <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> reaches them and are known as asynchronous muscles.|$|E

Cats need other minerals, such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium, for <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> transmission, muscle contraction, and cell signaling.

50|$|<b>Nerve</b> <b>impulses,</b> {{which serve}} as a typical example of autowaves in an active medium with recovery, were studied {{as far back as}} 1850 by Hermann von Helmholtz. The {{properties}} of <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> that are typical for the simplest self-wave solutions (universal shape and amplitude, independent of the initial conditions, and annihilation under collisions) were ascertained in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|R
25|$|Most phylogenetically {{advanced}} insects {{have two}} pairs of wings located on {{the second and third}} thoracic segments. Insects are the only invertebrates to have developed flight capability, and this has played an important part in their success. Insect flight is not very well understood, relying heavily on turbulent aerodynamic effects. The primitive insect groups use muscles that act directly on the wing structure. The more advanced groups making up the Neoptera have foldable wings, and their muscles act on the thorax wall and power the wings indirectly. These muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse,</b> allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible.|$|E
25|$|The four spectrally {{distinct}} cone pigments {{are derived}} from the protein opsin, linked to a small molecule called retinal, which {{is closely related to}} vitamin A. When the pigment absorbs light the retinal changes shape and alters the membrane potential of the cone cell affecting neurons in the ganglia layer of the retina. Each neuron in the ganglion layer may process information from a number of photoreceptor cells, and may in turn trigger a <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> to relay information along the optic nerve for further processing in specialised visual centres in the brain. The more intense a light, the more photons are absorbed by the visual pigments; the greater the excitation of each cone, and the brighter the light appears.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} a {{neurotransmitter}} is triggered {{by the arrival of}} a <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion (exocytosis). Within the presynaptic nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the down stroke of the action potential (tail current). Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of presynaptic vesicles is called the active zone. The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.|$|E

5000|$|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. AChE is {{an enzyme}} {{associated}} with nerve synapses that it’s designed to regulate <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> by {{breaking down the}} neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are organophosphates and carbamates, which are components found in pesticides (see Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors).|$|R

500|$|The <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> is characterised {{by a great}} {{influx of}} sodium ions through {{channels}} in the neuron's cell membrane followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again {{for a short time}} (known as the refractory period), which is mediated by another potassium channel. The flow through these ion channels is governed by a [...] "gate" [...] which is opened by either a voltage change or a chemical messenger known as a ligand (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Congenital {{stationary}} {{night blindness}} is an ophthalmologic disorder in horses which is present at birth (congenital), non-progressive (stationary) and affects the animal's vision in conditions of low lighting. Horses with CSNB may be hesitant to enter dimly-lit places - such as indoor arenas, dark stalls, or trailers - and be apprehensive when in such conditions, which {{may interfere with}} handling or riding. CSNB is usually diagnosed based on the owner's observations, but some horses have visibly abnormal eyes: poorly aligned eyes (dorsomedial strabismus) or involuntary eye movement (nystagmus). The condition can be confirmed using electroretinography, from which a [...] "negative ERG" [...] indicates CSNB. While the retina is a normal shape, the nerve signal triggered when light reaches rod cells does not reach the brain. Rod cells in the retina are connected to bipolar cells, which transmit the <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> to {{the next set of}} neurons. It is thought that these cells fail to undergo the basic chemical reaction for <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> transmission, which involves shuttling of calcium (Ca2+).|$|E

In both contracting preparations and non-contracting preparations pre-treated with glycerol, 100 or more <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> resulted in a maximal fall in mean {{amplitude of}} about 20 % with recovery apparent over the next 10 - 20 min. In an altered ionic environment with a lowered Ca and raised Mg concentration, 450 <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> did not produce a decrease in mean amplitude but a similar reduction was seen following {{a larger number of}} impulses. The reduction in amplitude was estimated to follow the release of the order of 5000 - 10000 quanta at end-plates in a normal ionic environment and on average 17000 quanta {{in the presence of a}} lowered Ca and raised Mg concentration.

[...] This signals the release of cortisol, the stress hormone, initiating a multitude of physical effects on the body to aid in survival. [...] The negative feedback loop is then needed to return the body to its resting state by signaling the parasympathetic nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} its {{detection}} of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors – while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes {{is in fact a}} temperature sensitive ion channel.
