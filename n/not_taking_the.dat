5|$|Faramir's {{decision}} {{to reject the}} One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon. By <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> Ring, Faramir rejects the desire for power and glory {{and the desire for}} renown which a defeat of Sauron would bring him.|$|E
5|$|Horvath {{was born}} to Croatian {{immigrants}} in South Bend, Indiana in 1921; his family soon moved to Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Parma Senior High School starting in 1936 and played on the track, basketball and football teams until the 11th grade. He decided to switch schools because he felt his basketball teammates were <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> sport seriously. Horvath's family relocated, and in 1938 he enrolled at James Ford Rhodes High School in Cleveland, one of Parma's rivals. Playing as a quarterback for the Rhodes Rams, Horvath guided the team to seven straight wins in 1938, but the team lost to West Technical High School {{for a chance to}} be the Cleveland Senate League's nomination to play in the city championship. He graduated in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

5|$|Nancy {{then starts}} {{to think that}} Darren and Sienna are having an affair, and sleeps with Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham) and his father Rick Spencer (Victor Gardener). Things are {{eventually}} sorted between Darren and Nancy, however as their wedding gets closer, they start to argue again as Nancy believes that Darren is <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> wedding seriously. Nancy sleeps with Rick again although the next morning she has regrets. On the night of her hen do, Nancy is attacked by Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice) following an argument, and he attempts to rape her while wearing a mask. However, she is saved by Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill), and Darren and Nancy get remarried anyway. Finn is arrested and Darren stands by Nancy in court, however due to the DNA tests, Nancy is forced to admit her affair and that she slept with Rick within 24 hours before the attack. This creates more strife between Darren and Nancy; Darren sleeps with Sienna. Darren cannot forgive Nancy for her affair, they realise that married life has not been right {{for a long time}} and they agree to get divorced again. Darren offers to buy Nancy's half of The Dog In The Pond Pub in order to give her enough money to restart her life. The deed of transfer for The Dog has been signed and Darren is now the sole owner of The Dog In The Pond.|$|E

After several budget meetings, O'Brien criticized several councillors for supporting a tax increase within the rate of inflation and for <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> procedures seriously. Councillors later replied that O'Brien's comments do not improve the relations between the mayor and the City Council. On February 26, 2007, news sources reported that the City, while recuperating surplus and reserve funds and raising various user fees, would not increase property taxes that year.|$|E
25|$|A {{basic income}} (or {{negative}} income tax) {{is a system}} of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally. It is argued that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as {{there would be no}} risk of destitution for <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> employment. As a result, the jobseeker could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they could wait until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills in university, which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on Basic Income and NIT in Canada and the USA show that people spent more time studying while the program was running.|$|E
25|$|The {{exercises}} {{were not}} without critics {{as to whether}} they accurately represented real war situations. A number of captains were criticised for <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> rules sufficiently seriously, continuing to fight their ships after they should have considered themselves sunk or captured. Vice-Admiral Batsch of the German navy published a critique of the 88 and 89 exercises, arguing that the objectives of the admirals had become reversed from those of a real war, where coastal raids would follow opportunistically to main fleet engagements, rather than being main aims in themselves. In the '89 exercise the enemy fleet started at a 25% disadvantage, but steady attrition during raiding reduced it to 43% the size of the British fleet, so that any chance of a decisive victory steadily diminished. The result of dividing forces had been that they were picked off one by one. Nevertheless, the exercises served to improve morale for the sailors concerned, and to raise considerable interest amongst the general public in naval affairs.|$|E

25|$|During the Kargil War in 1999, Sharif {{claimed to}} have no {{knowledge}} of the planned attacks, saying that Pervez Musharraf acted alone. In 2008, Lieutenant-General (retired) Jamshed Gulzar Kiani— at that time Kiani was Major-general and served as the Director-General of the Military Intelligence— also publicly confirmed Sharif's statement of not having the knowledge on Kargil debacle. According to Major-General Kiani, General Musharraf had eye-blinded the Prime minister and did not brief him over the true facts or difficult situation which was faced by the Pakistan Army. During the Kargil debacle, the Indian Air Force's two MiG-29 intercepted the Pakistan Air Force's two F-16 fighter jets of the No. 9 Squadron Griffins, initially gaining a missile lock on these jets. This dogfight made a next-day morning headlines in Pakistan, prompting the prime minister to investigate the matter. However, Chief of Air Staff General Pervez Mehdi denied this incident, later accused the Prime minister for <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> Air Force in confidence in the matters of national security.|$|E
25|$|First we {{consider}} the Wallenius model. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the first draw is 1000/2000 = ½. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the second draw, {{under the condition that}} it was not taken in the first draw, is 999/1999 ≈ ½. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the third draw, under the condition that it was not taken in the first two draws, is 998/1998 ≈ ½. Continuing in this way, we can calculate that the probability of <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> red ball in n draws is approximately 2−n as long as n is small compared to N. In other words, the probability of not taking a very heavy ball in n draws falls almost exponentially with n in Wallenius’ model. The exponential function arises because the probabilities for each draw are all multiplied together.|$|E
25|$|In August 1999 two Indian Air Force MiG-21FL {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} a Pakistan Navy Breguet Atlantique reconnaissance aircraft near the Rann of Kutch in India, killing 16 naval officers, {{the greatest number}} of combat-related casualties for the navy since the Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971 Already suffering from public disapproval and bad popularity, this incident came at a particularly bad juncture for the Prime Minister, already under attack from politicians and civil society for ordering a withdrawal of its troops from Kargil. Sharif failed to gather any foreign support against India after this incident, and the navy saw this failure as Sharif's not supporting the navy in wartime. Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Abdul Aziz Mirza turned against the Prime minister, and Sharif soon faced a new cold war with the newly appointed Admiral who had assumed charge of the navy only a few days before. The Prime minister dispatched units of Marines in the vicinity to retrieve the downed aircraft's pilots, but the Marines also turned their back on the Prime minister due to his failure to defend the Navy at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in September 1999. Relations with the Air Force also deteriorated in a matter of months, when Chief of Air Staff General Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi accused the Prime minister of <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> Air Force into his confidence in matters critical to national security.|$|E

When his attempts to control Nancy fails, he reports her to the police, making allegations she is {{having an affair with}} Newt; she is arrested and later fired. Fearing Nancy is <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> allegations seriously, Jake verbally attacks her, branding her pathetic. She cries and begins blaming herself but Jake then comforts her, turning the situation around in his favour. Nancy is later cleared of the charges. Jake begins to distance her from her friends, deleting messages from her phone. Nancy discovers this and goes out with Hannah and Sarah Barnes who tell Nancy they dislike Jake and his treatment of Nancy. Nancy denies that Jake is mistreating her, further distancing herself from them. Jake later breaks her phone so that she can not contact them. When Charlie falls ill Nancy is unable to call for an ambulance so she has to leave Charlie and go for help. Jake blames Nancy for Charlie's condition. Charlie is diagnosed with leukaemia and needs a bone marrow transplant, leading to Nancy discovering Jake is not a donor match and thus not Charlie's biological father.|$|E
