5|$|I-94/I-69 {{turns back}} to the east about a mile (1.6km) north of their {{confluence}} to span the Black River <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown.</b> On the eastern bank of the river, there is one final interchange for M-25 and BL I-69/BL I-94 before the freeway reaches the toll and customs plazas for the twin-span Blue Water Bridge. Past these plazas, I-94/I-69 ascends the approach to the bridge which crosses the St. Clair River to Point Edward (Sarnia), Ontario. At the international boundary {{at the center of the}} river, the Interstate designations jointly terminate, becoming Ontario Highway402.|$|E

5|$|The Georgia Tech {{campus is}} located in Midtown, an area <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown</b> Atlanta. Although a number of skyscrapers—most visibly the {{headquarters}} of AT, The Coca-Cola Company, and Bank of America—are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and {{has a great deal}} of greenery. This gives it a distinctly suburban atmosphere quite different from other Atlanta campuses such as that of Georgia State University.|$|E
5|$|The US131 freeway {{was officially}} opened at 10 a.m. on December 17, 1962, between Pearl Street and (at the time) the I-196/US16 freeway <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown.</b> This freeway section {{encompassed}} all of I-296, which would connect I-196 {{north of town}} with I-96 downtown. (The I-96 and I-196 designations were later flipped west of Grand Rapids.) M-37 was relocated in Grand Rapids to utilize I-96 around the northeast side of town instead of I-296/US131 in 1969.|$|E

The roadway continues northeasterly {{to the top of}} the hill near 5600 South, where pre-existing Adams Avenue (500 East) heads north, passing the Ogden Regional Medical Center to an intersection with Washington Boulevard (US-89) on the Washington Terrace-South Ogden border. Adams Avenue continues through South Ogden and into Ogden as a minor street one block east of US-89, with a gap near 4600 South and more <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown</b> Ogden. In 2006 approximately 1,400cars traveled the parkway on an average weekday.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, due {{in large}} part to the city's {{economic}} prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown.</b> Conceived as a way to energize a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward, I-94 {{traverses}} rural land on {{the north}} side of Marshall. The freeway runs north of, and parallel to, the Kalamazoo River through eastern Calhoun County. It angles southeasterly toward Albion before returning to an easterly course {{on the north side}} of town. I-94 crosses into western Jackson County before intersecting M-99. From there, it runs generally due east with a jog around Parma. West of the county airport, the Jackson business loop follows M-60 southward, and I-94 travels through the north side of Jackson. <b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown,</b> US127 merges in from the north and runs concurrently with I-94 around the city. Southeast of the Michigan State Prison, US127 departs to the south, and I-94 continues eastward through the rest of the county.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1883 by the Art Association of Indianapolis, {{the first}} {{permanent}} museum was opened in 1906 {{as part of}} the John Herron Art Institute. In 1969, the Art Association of Indianapolis changed its name to the Indianapolis Museum of Art, and in 1970 the museum moved to its current location at Michigan Road and 38th Street <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown</b> Indianapolis. Among the Art Association's founders was May Wright Sewall (1844–1920), known for her work in the women's suffrage movement. Other supporters have included Booth Tarkington (1869–1946), Eli Lilly (1885–1977), Herman C. Krannert (1887–1972), and Caroline Marmon Fesler (1878–1960). The associated John Herron Art Institute was established with the help of notable Hoosier Group artists T. C. Steele and William Forsyth.|$|E
5|$|I-35E was {{completed}} <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown</b> Saint Paul in 1970. The first section to open ran north from Maryland Avenue in Saint Paul to I-694 in Little Canada; this {{was completed}} in the early 1960s, concurrently with I-694 west to old MN49 (Rice Street). Later that decade, I-35E was extended south to downtown Saint Paul, opening first to Pennsylvania Avenue and then to I-94, including the I-35E / I-94 concurrency (and I-94 in both directions). In 1970, I-35E was extended north along the I-35E / I-694 concurrency in Little Canada– Vadnais Heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at Columbus near Forest Lake; the adjacent sections of I-35, I-35W, and I-694 opened {{at about the same}} time.|$|E
5|$|I-375 and the Chrysler Freeway {{begin at}} Jefferson Avenue and St. Antoine Street in {{downtown}} Detroit near the Renaissance Center. They run east before turning north. Just {{about a mile}} (1.6km) after the southern terminus, I-375 meets the Fisher Freeway which carries I-75 <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown.</b> At this interchange, I-75 takes ramps to leave the Fisher Freeway and use the Chrysler Freeway, replacing I-375. I-375 is a four-lane freeway south of the I-75 interchange, where it widens to six lanes. The entire length of I-375 is included on the National Highway System, a network of roadways {{that are important to}} the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|I-96 {{has four}} related, {{auxiliary}} Interstate highways that connect the main freeway to downtowns and other cities. I-196 {{is a relatively}} long freeway spur, beginning at I-96 east of downtown Grand Rapids and heading west through downtown to Holland, and then south to I-94 near Benton Harbor. The unsigned I-296 connects I-96 <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown</b> Grand Rapids with I-196 in downtown, and is signed as US131. I-496 is a loop through downtown Lansing, which I-96 bypasses to the south, and I-696 is a northern bypass of Detroit, connecting I-96 in Novi with I-75 in Royal Oak and I-94 in St. Clair Shores.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the MSHD signposted {{the highway}} {{system for the}} first time, and the east–west {{highways}} through Lansing {{were part of the}} original M-29 through downtown and the original M-39 <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown.</b> The north–south highway in Lansing was the original M-14. On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the AASHO, and the new US27 replaced M-29 and M-14 in the area. By the end of the next year, M-78 was extended from Charlotte along US27 to through downtown Lansing. M-78 separated from US27 in downtown Lansing and continued northeasterly through the northern part of East Lansing. M-39 was replaced with an extended M-43 in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In Imperial County, SR78 intersects with SR 86, running {{concurrently}} with it {{southwest of}} the Salton Sea and northwest of San Felipe Creek. SR78 passes through the desert community of Elmore Desert Ranch before entering the city of Westmorland. The route, still concurrent with SR86, enters into the city of Brawley as Main Street, where SR86 splits to the south towards El Centro. SR78 continues north onto the Brawley Bypass, a freeway that passes to the <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>downtown</b> Brawley. SR 111 runs concurrently with SR78 for a short duration before the latter exits from the freeway and continues east.|$|E
