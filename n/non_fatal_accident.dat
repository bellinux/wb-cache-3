40|$|Introduction: Investigation of {{job stress}} {{among people who}} have {{experienced}} accidents could help to recognize causes of events in workplaces. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure frequency and severities of work stressors among staff employed at the Hormozgan Ports & Sailing Organization, and determine its relationship with accidents. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 320 Hormozgan Ports & Sailing Organization staff that completed 3 questionnaires including demographic characteristics, stress frequency and stress reaction. Statistical analysis was performed by One way ANOVA and Chi square test. Results: The averages scores from frequency and reaction stressor questionnaires for all of the study population were 88. 9 and 16. 1 respectively. The scores of stress frequency questionnaire of 78 % with history of accidents were more than median, but only 34 % without history of accidents had scores more than the median. The Odds Ratio of people with positive history of accidents in stress frequency questionnaire was 6. 48. Conclusion: As seen in the results of this study, stress plays a role in <b>non</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and therefore, quality management for the control of stress in workplaces is a necessity...|$|R

Using the contingent valuation method, estimates of what respondents would pay to avoid one of five injury categories are obtained from the MARC survey. The survey was administred by face-to-face interview to a representative sample of young French drivers, aged between 18 and 25 years. The willingness-to-pay increases with the seriousness of the injuries and is positively correlated with income, but it is not affected by gender nor by driving behaviour.

40|$|Road traffic {{accidents}} (RTAs) {{are among the}} ten {{cause of death in}} Malaysia. If is a shocking fact that RTAs killed more people in other developing countries too, every year, than war and disease. More than 20 million people are severely injured or killed on the world 5 roads each year. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the mortality and morbidity pattern ofroad {{traffic accidents}}from 1997 to 2003 in Kelantan. The retrospective study was conducted in which the relevant data were collected by reviewing the records on road traffic accident (RTA) from the year 1997 to 2003. The records included information about monthly data such as number oflatal and nonfatal accidents and distribution of accidents by year. Data gathered were input into SPSS version 11 and simple linear regression to explore the trend in data analysis. A total of 40, 452 accidents were reviewed during seven years period (1997 - 2003). The numbers of <b>non</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> showed an increasing trend from 1998 to 2003 except 2001, decreased in trend. Kelantan experienced a continuous increase of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> from 1997 until 2000, followed by a fluctuation between 2001 and 2003. The numbers of <b>fatal</b> and nonfatal <b>accident</b> cases showed no pattern, but total cases for both accidents increased by months within the one calendar year. Road traffic accidents are still a major public health problem. There were no systematic and consistent seasonal pattern of the mortality and morbidity of accidents. There were significant increasing trend throughout the months for both <b>fatal</b> and nonfatal <b>accident</b> cases within one year calendar...|$|R

Traditionally, the safety of passenger cars has been assessed through the use of laboratory data from the viewpoint of risk of death and injury under the assumption that accidents have already occurred and results have been published in New Car Assessment. On the other hand, we examined safety from the perspective of the occurrence rate of accidents resulting in death (<b>fatal</b> <b>accidents)</b> and accidents resulting in injury or death (hereinafter “accidents”). We conducted negative binominal regression analyses of the occurrence rates of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and accidents, taking into consideration the influence of driver-related factors, and vehicle characteristics.

In addition, the adjusted occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> was not strongly correlated with the score in New Car Assessment.

Using state-by-quarter fixed effects models, the study shows that unemployment rate increases significantly reduce <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> Decomposing the <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> rate into accidents per mile traveled and miles traveled per capita reveals that higher unemployment is significantly associated with fewer accidents per mile, and also reveals that <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> associated with alcohol are more responsive to unemployment rate changes than are accidents overall.

40|$|This conference paper {{presents}} an accident study investigating where fatal alcohol- and drug-related accidents occur {{with respect to}} traffic environment (i. e., urban versus rural), road type, speed limit, annual average daily traffic flow, and road category. The study uses data from in-depth studies of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and from the Swedish National Road Database. Accident data from the 2006 – 2009 period are used. The {{results indicate that the}} proportion of all <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> that are alcohol-related is about the same on urban (21 %) and rural roads (23 %). However, the proportion of alcohol-related <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> is higher on ordinary roads (i. e., two-lane single carriageways with no central reservation or median barrier; 23 %) than on other types of rural state roads (11 %). On ordinary roads, alcohol-related <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> are more common on roads with speed limits of 60 – 70 km/h (35 %) than on roads with speed limits of 80 – 100 km/h (14 %) and more common on second- and third-class county roads (32 %) than on roads in other categories (less than 20 %). The alcohol-related accident risk follows the same pattern, i. e., the accident risk is highest where the proportion of alcohol-related accidents is highest.  It was also found that the distribution of drug-related <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> among various parts of the road network is more similar to the distribution of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> involving sober drivers than to alcohol-related <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> The present results can be used by the police in strategic planning of the surveillance. ...|$|R
