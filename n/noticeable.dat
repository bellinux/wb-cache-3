5|$|A divers' {{cognition}} may {{be affected}} on dives as shallow as , but the changes are not usually <b>noticeable.</b> There is no reliable method to predict the depth at which narcosis becomes <b>noticeable,</b> or {{the severity of the}} effect on an individual diver, as it may vary from dive to dive even on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The penumbral {{phase of}} the eclipse changes the {{appearance}} of the Moon only slightly and is generally not <b>noticeable.</b>|$|E
5|$|A common {{complaint}} was the <b>noticeable</b> digital airbrushing on numerous close-up shots of Jovovich's face, for which reviewers were confused at the use of, or found unnecessary. The film won the Golden Trailer Award for Best Action Poster and {{was nominated for}} Best TV Spot.|$|E
5|$|Adaptive stage – The {{person will}} not {{experience}} any negative symptoms, {{and they believe}} they have the capacity for drinking alcohol without problems. Physiological changes are happening {{with the increase in}} tolerance, but this will not be <b>noticeable</b> to the drinker or others.|$|E
5|$|Any {{stressed}} syllable carries {{one of two}} tones, {{which give}} Swedish much of its characteristic sound. Prosody is often {{one of the most}} <b>noticeable</b> differences between its dialects.|$|E
5|$|During the {{extensive}} research Hergé carried out for The Blue Lotus, he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts. This is especially <b>noticeable</b> in the seascapes, which {{are reminiscent of}} works by Hokusai and Hiroshige.|$|E
5|$|In {{practice}} {{range is}} affected by driving style, hilliness of the terrain, speed and use of passenger compartment heating and cooling. Strong head and following winds also make a <b>noticeable</b> difference.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the renewed NVA artillery fire, on 30 May, 4 M107s and 4 M110s were deployed to KSCB from Camp Carroll and these engaged in a 48-hour artillery barrage named Operation Drumfire II against suspected NVA artillery positions in the Co Roc Range, with little <b>noticeable</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, {{air traffic}} has {{increased}} markedly {{in recent years}} between Paris and the Gulf airports, the emerging nations of Africa, Russia, Turkey, Portugal, Italy, and mainland China, whereas <b>noticeable</b> decline has been recorded between Paris and the British Isles, Egypt, Tunisia, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Marsupials such as opossums and {{the common}} brushtail possum have also {{developed}} <b>noticeable</b> sublingua with a plica mediana and a less specialized, but conspicuous, plica fimbriata.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (76mi, 122km) as its {{re-entry}} altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly {{marks the}} boundary where atmospheric drag becomes <b>noticeable,</b> thus beginning {{the process of}} switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with air surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Nuskhuri letters vary in height, with ascenders and descenders, and are slanted to the right. Letters have an angular shape, with a <b>noticeable</b> {{tendency}} {{to simplify the}} shapes they had in Asomtavruli. This enabled faster writing of manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 2011, The Criterion Collection {{released}} Solaris on Blu-ray Disc. The most <b>noticeable</b> {{difference from}} the previous 2002 Criterion DVD release was that the blue and white tinted monochrome scenes from the film were restored.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{dismissal}} several Ministers of {{the second}} Tymoshenko Government {{have been involved in}} criminal proceedings against them; the most <b>noticeable</b> outcomes of this were the imprisonments of former Prime Minister Tymoshenko and Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko.|$|E
5|$|The J79 engines {{produced}} <b>noticeable</b> {{amounts of}} black smoke (at mid-throttle/cruise settings), a severe disadvantage in that the enemy could spot the aircraft. This was solved on the F-4S fitted with the −10A engine variant which used a smokeless combustor.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{not normally}} <b>noticeable</b> from Earth's surface because Earth rotates, carrying the observer through {{the cycles of}} sunrise and sunset, which obscure the Sun's apparent motion {{against the background of}} fixed stars.|$|E
5|$|The game {{retains the}} classic pastel / crayon visuals from its predecessor. Small changes are <b>noticeable</b> — water {{animation}} has been improved, the black outlines around objects {{are not as}} thick and the backgrounds are less cluttered; but the visuals are still tightly-centered on those of the SNES game.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>noticeable</b> {{difference}} in behaviour between a distributed element filter and its lumped-element approximation {{is that the}} former will have multiple passband replicas of the lumped-element prototype passband, because transmission line transfer characteristics repeat at harmonic intervals. These spurious passbands are undesirable in most cases.|$|E
5|$|Twitter had {{approximately}} ninety-eight percent uptime in 2007 (or {{about six}} full days of downtime). The downtime was particularly <b>noticeable</b> during events {{popular with the}} technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address.|$|E
5|$|Wallace gives {{a lively}} {{description}} {{of the people of}} the town, and of the wildlife of the island. He finds the Chinese the most <b>noticeable</b> of the people, while in one square mile of forest he found 700 species of beetles including 130 longhorns.|$|E
5|$|Weather is {{a chaotic}} {{system that is}} readily {{modified}} by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing <b>noticeable</b> changes.|$|E
5|$|Adventure mode is a turn-based, {{open-ended}} roguelike {{where the}} player starts off as an adventurer. In Legends mode, players can view maps, histories of each civilization and any figure {{who has lived}} or died in the generated world. Any <b>noticeable</b> achievement made by the player {{in any of the}} two game modes is recorded in the Legends. A testing arena is present, where players can simulate battles between selected units in various conditions.|$|E
5|$|After Giovanni Trapattoni led Benfica {{to their}} first league title in 11 years, he {{resigned}} for personal reasons. To replace him, the club hired Ronald Koeman, who was assisted by Bruins Slot and Fernando Chalana. Benfica remained highly active in the transfer market, signing and releasing over twelve players. <b>Noticeable</b> additions were Anderson, Léo and Nélson to the back four; Karagounis and Miccoli to the offence. The departures included Miguel, the biggest loss.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of higher {{education}} for over a century, {{with much of the}} remainder of its economy dependent on state government and health care services. The city has rebounded from the urban decline of the 1970s and 1980s, with <b>noticeable</b> development taking place in the city's downtown and midtown neighborhoods. Albany is known for its rich history, commerce, culture, architecture, and institutions of higher education. Albany won the All-America City Award in both 1991 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although a 2007 study {{estimated}} that introducing DST to Japan would reduce household lighting energy consumption, a 2007 simulation {{estimated that}} DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither study examined non-residential energy use. This is probably because DST's effect on lighting energy use is mainly <b>noticeable</b> in residences.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more <b>noticeable</b> in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{classified}} as a semiregular variable star, indicating that some periodicity is <b>noticeable</b> in the brightness changes, but amplitudes may vary, cycles may have different lengths, {{and there may be}} standstills or periods of irregularity. It is placed in subgroup SRc; these are pulsating red supergiants with amplitudes around one magnitude and periods from tens to hundreds of days.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the storm had begun to abate over Hainan, it was already nearly dissipated, {{and as a result}} {{produced}} few, if any, <b>noticeable</b> effects in mainland China. Across the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam had experienced deadly flooding in the week before Nepartak's approach, and the typhoon initially raised concerns about worsening the situation. Officials made preparations to minimize potentially exacerbating factors, and the cyclone remained far enough east to avoid seriously impacting the country.|$|E
5|$|Color schemes {{included}} light gray, haze gray, ocean gray, and black. Haze gray {{was found}} to provide reasonable protection in the widest range of conditions, and became a standard US Navy paint scheme after World War II. Ocean gray also became a standard paint scheme after the war. Although black is still used for submarines, it was discontinued on destroyers after it had been determined that black ships remained more <b>noticeable</b> than gray ships on even the darkest nights.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{was first}} re-released for the MSX2 system and was {{published}} by Microcabin in Japan in June 1989. It had access to almost {{three times as much}} storage space as the Famicom version but suffered from problems not present in Nintendo's cartridge media, including <b>noticeable</b> loading times. There were also minor graphical upgrades, much-improved music tracks, and sound effects.|$|E
5|$|For Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, {{creating}} the version better known today. In that version, transposed to D major, the laudes interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by flutes and including {{these in the}} tutti movements. Changes in musical texture were even smaller, mellowing the harmony {{near the end of}} the Omnes generationes movement being the most <b>noticeable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{during the}} Second World War, the Gwladys Street Stand {{suffered}} bomb damage. The bomb had landed directly in Gwladys Street and caused serious injury to nearby residents. The bomb splinter {{damage to the}} bricks on the stand is still <b>noticeable.</b> The cost of repair was £5,000 and was {{paid for by the}} War Damage Commission.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range {{it can be seen that}} the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly <b>noticeable</b> when it sings.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sales volume, most of today's beer {{is based on}} the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of Pilsen in the present-day Czech Republic. The modern pale lager is light in colour with a <b>noticeable</b> {{carbonation}} (fizzy bubbles) and a typical alcohol by volume content of around 5%. The Pilsner Urquell, Bitburger, and Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands Budweiser, Coors, and Miller.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham Cricket Club {{play at the}} Frank Taylor Memorial Ground, their 1st XI {{compete in}} the West of England Premier League Division 2.

5|$|Lakefront Station's lack of {{modernization}} since its opening {{has become more}} <b>noticeable,</b> especially its appearance and lack of adequate signage. In August 2012, when the Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland was under construction, a Cuyahoga County official {{expressed a desire to}} keep Lakefront Station out of view. One proposed solution was to build a new station underground, but {{due to a lack of}} funding, the county settled on hiding the station behind trees and shrubs as a short-term solution.|$|E
