For RNP systems, further improvement in holding is available. These RNP improvements include fly-by entry into the hold, minimising the necessary protected airspace on the <b>non-holding</b> side of the holding pattern, consistent with the RNP limits provided. Where RNP holding is applied, a maximum of RNP 1 is suggested since less stringent values adversely affect airspace usage and design.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{rationale}} {{for the emergence of}} European holding groups and especially for the frequently observed intergroup ownership connections. Large holding groups typically control many of the most important companies in the country where they reside and usually consist of (sometimes many) <b>non-holding</b> firms (i. e., industrial companies and banks) with layers of holding companies on top. The holding firms in these layers often show shared ownership between groups, whereas ownership of the <b>non-holding</b> firms may be shared as well. So far no explanation for these intergroup links has been proposed. This paper offers a rationale for this phenomenon. Specifically, drawing on European corporate law, it is shown that holding structures with intergroup connections develop {{as a response to the}} need for a flexible, renegotiation-free cooperation mechanism. This mechanism, which solves a principal-agent problem when decisions are sequential and not fully enforceable, becomes especially important in the face of capital constraints. Finally, the paper also investigates the interaction between holding firms and the frequently used shareholder syndicate contracts. (C) 1998 by Elsevier Science Inc. status: publishe...|$|E

Outstanding Schools Act (OSA) Foundation Funding Formula and subsequent revisions on the equity of statewide educational funding. This research considered the revenue per student per penny of property tax levy, the revenue per student, and the legislative decision to guarantee a minimum (hold harmless) payment per student to analyze whether funding for Missouri public schools was more equitable than the pre- 1993 OSA formula. Specific fiscal years from 1998 - 99 through 2005 - 06 were selected for analysis. The horizontal equity statistics of coefficient of variation, federal range ratio, and McLoone Index were calculated and tracked for the selected years. These measures were applied to the data for all districts and to the data for <b>non-hold</b> harmless districts. The results of this study were compared to the pre-OSA (1992 - 93) statistics reported in the 1999 Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education study. Data for all years selected compared to the pre-OSA year of 1992 - 93 showed improved equity for all districts and for <b>non-hold</b> harmless districts on both the revenue per student per penny of tax rate basis and on a revenue per student basis using the coefficient of variation and the federal range ratio. All years, except 2005 - 06, showed improved equity using the McLoone Index. All statistics analyzed demonstrated dramatically greater improved equity for <b>non-hold</b> harmless districts than for all districts...|$|R

"December 2012 "The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare horizontal equity measures in Missouri school funding through the fifth year of implementation of the Senate Bill 287 (SB 287) funding formula with the final year of the previous Senate Bill 380 formula. In addition, vertical equity funding components under the new formula were correlated with student achievement measures to determine if the intended goal of providing additional resources to districts with high need students was being met. This study replicated the methodology of a study by Ogle (2007) to provide comparisons between the current and previous formula on horizontal equity statistics of coefficient of variation, federal range ratio, and the McLoone Index. These measures were applied to the data for all districts and to the data for <b>non-hold</b> harmless district on a revenue per pupil basis. When considering all districts in the state, horizontal equity has not improved under the SB 287 formula, with each measure far from target values. However, for <b>non-hold</b> harmless districts the equity values have improved and, in some cases, are approaching equity target values. The hold harmless provision in the formula continues to limit overall horizontal equity. The impact on equity of prorating the funding distribution equally for all districts during recent state budget shortfalls has been minimal. Correlation calculations indicate the SB 287 formula has been successful at distributing more funds to districts with populations of students with higher needs, as determined by student achievement outcomes...|$|R

Previous SMT-based BMC approaches for TAs search for finite counter-examples and infinite lasso-shaped counter-examples.

This paper introduces a new SMT-based BMC approach that can find a counter-example to any <b>non-holding</b> Büchi automaton or LTL specification and also, in theory, prove that a specification holds.

40|$|Gold {{loans or}} {{deposits}} are undertaken by monetary authorities {{to obtain a}} <b>non-holding</b> gain return on gold. The physical stock of gold is "lent to " or "deposited with " a financial institution (such as a bullion bank) or another party in the gold market (such as an intermediary for a gold dealer or gold miner with a temporary shortage of gold). In return, the borrower may provide the monetary authority with high quality collateral, but no cash, and will make a series of payments, known as lease payments. The party who borrows the gold from a monetary authority may in turn "lend " the gold to a dealer or miner. This ability to on-lend indicates that, while the package of transactions which makes up a gold loan is clearly very different from an outright sale of the gold, the rights and privileges associated with ownership of the gold have changed from the monetary authority to the borrower. The loan or deposit may be placed on demand or for a fixed period. The amount of gold to be returned {{is based on the}} volume initially lent, regardless of any changes in the gold price. The security and liquidity aspects of the monetary authority's gold loan claims on the depository corporations are regarded as a substitute for physical gold, such that the loan values ar...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to verify whether the trading {{strategy}} can beat the "buy-and-hold" strategy for the securitized real estate indices of six Asian economies: Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This paper constructs a trading strategy from the Shiryaev-Zhou index and tests the strategy on the securitized real estate indices of six emerging Asian economies: Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia. The authors compare the resulting profits from using the trading strategy with the resulting profits from using the "buy-and-hold" strategy. The authors consider three cases: no transaction costs, 0. 1 percent transaction costs, and 0. 2 percent transaction costs. Findings: The results show that the trading strategy the authors constructed generally outperforms the "buy-and-hold" strategy even in the presence of transaction costs. In particular, the authors have a new finding as follows: Thailand and Malaysia's securitized real estate indices fell drastically during the period of observation. However, applying the trading strategy to these two securitized real estate indices can still earn a profit. Practical implications: The trading strategy is particularly useful in protecting investors from huge loss in adverse market conditions. The results can be applied to the field of finance/investment that investors can construct a trading strategy similar to the authors to earn more profits. Originality/value: This study will consider cases where both buying and selling costs exist, so the scenario is more like stock transactions in real-life equity markets. Furthermore, in this paper, for each securitized real estate index, the authors plot a graph to show the holding and <b>non-holding</b> periods under the trading strategy. This would help the authors explain the resulting profit under the trading strategy. This kind of graphical analysis was neglected by Hui and Yam. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
