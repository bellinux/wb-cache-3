40|$|Due to the {{explosive}} growth of electronic businesses carried on the Internet, nonrepudiation services {{turn out to be}} increasingly important. Non-repudiation services protect the transacting parties against any false denial that a particular event or action has taken place, in which evidence will be generated, collected and maintained to enable the settlement of disputes. Several fair non-repudiation protocols have been proposed, which support <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> origin and <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> receipt while neither the originator nor the recipient can gain an advantage by quitting prematurely or otherwise misbehaving during a transaction.

40|$|With {{the phenomenal}} {{growth of the}} Internet and open {{networks}} in general, security services, such as non-repudiation, become crucial to many applications.

40|$|E-Science Grid {{infrastructures}} {{are established}} on the collaboration of multiple and possibly otherwise independent and globally distributed organizations connected via the Internet. Thereby instantiated e-Science Grids provide the researchers of these globally distributed organizations with unified access to large-scale computing and storage services, including {{the access to}} large-scale scientific data as such. It {{is part of their}} purpose that e-Science Grids allow collaborating researchers to introduce their own data and program code {{in the course of their}} work. Beyond, via <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> Grid jobs any program code can be executed as detached computational operation within the distributed computing infrastructure. This openness of allowed introduction and usage of data and program code poses a substantial security threat. The delegation of privileges in the course <b>of</b> Grid jobs <b>submissions</b> in combination with the users’ allowance to introduce and utilize a priori untrusted program code and data is however a widely identified security challenge. The main contribution of this thesis is to propose a new framework for delegation and an according Grid security architecture in response to this challenge. Following a discussion of the goals and requirements of e-Science Grids in general, and an overview and comparison of existing and in-use e-Science Grid architectures in particular, this thesis will analyze security aspects applying to such e-Science Grid infrastructures. The thereof derived and defined security objectives concern data integrity and authenticity, system integrity, availability, <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> Grid job <b>submission</b> and processing as well as confidentiality and data privacy. Looking at the case of an established e-Science Grid framework, vulnerabilities and security implications of existing distributed e-Science Grids will be examined. Furthermore the widely adopted unrestricted delegation based on X. 509 proxy certificates will be assessed, revealing fundamental deficiencies concerning the unverifiable correlation of assignment and delegation of privileges, which facilitates potential misuse of privileges and digital identities. In order to address these issues, this thesis will introduce “mediated definite delegation” as a new framework for delegation. The framework utilizes public-key signatures and affords verifiable integrity and authenticity of Grid data and jobs as well as transparent, dynamic and least-privileged delegation of Grid jobs via one or more brokers to an agent. Its delegation mechanism provides protection against misuse of the delegating user’s identity as well as against unnoticed alteration of the requested actions. Finally, an e-Science Grid security architecture established on this framework will be presented and specified, which is able satisfy the defined security objectives. As a proof of concept, a prototype implementation of this e-Science Grid security architecture will be presented, including a test-based evaluation of its performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{approach}} for securing video transmission on an end system multicast session is described. Existing solutions use encryption techniques {{that require the}} use of a shared key.

This method can be used in an end system multicast infrastructure where video originates from one source, but spreads with the help of receiving peers. Two different methods are described and compared: 1) Encryption of the entire packet. 2) Encryption of the unique digest value of the transmitted packet (i. e. digitally signing). The receivers then check the integrity of the received packets using the public key provided by the sender. Also, this way the <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> the transmitted video is provided. ...|$|R

Certified E-mail Protocols Alice wants {{to send a message}} to Bob, but she does not want him to read it without her obtaining a receipt. A postal worker handles this in real life. How can this be handled over the network? Threat Model Legitimate participants may cheat. E. g, for certified e-mail: receivers may deny having received e-mails (e. g., bills) agents may forge e-mail receipts to falsely claim they have sent messages This threat model is different from what we considered so far. So far: We have analyzed runs between honest agents in the presence of external attackers (external threat model) and spies inside the system (internal threat model). Today: We analyze runs between agents that try to cheat each other. Non-repudiation Non-repudiation protocols protect agents from cheating each other. They provide the agents with evidence that certain steps in the protocol have occurred "Evidence " consists of a set of messages that (in case of dispute) can be given to a judge to prove that the evidenced protocol step has happened. <b>Non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> Origin and Receipt A protocol guarantees <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> origin (NRO) if it provides evidence to receivers that the message has been sent by the claimed sender. NRO can be achieved by the sender digitally signing the message.

We introduce a notion of key-collisions, which may allow an attacker {{to claim that the}} message (presented to a judge) has been signed by someone else. We show how to compute keycollisions for the DSA and ECDSA signature schemes effectively. The main idea of these attacks has been inspired by the well-known notion of message-collisions, where an attacker claims that the signature presented at the court belongs to a different message. Both of these collision-based attacks significantly weaken the <b>non-repudiation</b> property <b>of</b> signature schemes. Moreover, they weaken the <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> protocols based on these schemes.

40|$|Abstract:- An {{efficient}} and secure protocol in certified e-mail delivery is proposed in this paper. With {{the widespread use}} of public Internet, communication via electronic mail (e-mail) becomes a convenience application instead of traditional manuscript letter. People can easily append his/her digital signature to the e-mail in order to achieve the goal <b>of</b> <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> origin. However, the evidence of receipt still relies on the willingness of the recipient in the standard e-mail service. Hence, the recipient has no responsible for the received e-mail. In this paper, we present an {{efficient and}} secure protocol in fair certified e-mail delivery (CEMD). Our protocol efficiently provides <b>non-repudiation</b> <b>of</b> origin and receipt in the fair manner. In other words, the sender can obtain the irrefutable receipt if and only if the recipient gets the certified e-mail from the sender, otherwise, neither of them. Moreover, the proposed CEMD is efficiently in sending the other mails to the same recipient by using the pre-computation function. As the evaluations of computational cost and communication overhead, our protocol is cost-effective and efficient than other relevant protocols...|$|R
