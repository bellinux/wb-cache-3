5000|$|Illusion optics was {{recorded}} in 1968 when Soviet physicist Victor Veselago discovered that he can make objects appear in different areas through negatively refracting flat slab. [...] When light is negatively refracted, the light is directed towards the direction it entered and deflected away from the line of refraction. <b>Normal</b> <b>refraction</b> occurs when light passes through the line of refraction. Veselago used this theory to work the slab into a lens, which he recorded in his experiments. He discovered that unlike a normal lens, the objects resolution {{does not depend on}} the limits of the wavelengths passing through the lens. Veselago’s work has been more prominent in recent years due to the advancement in metamaterials, which are engineered materials that have special internal physical properties and have the ability to negatively refract light.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is explained by}} the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Due to the change of medium, the phase velocity of the wave is changed but its frequency remains constant. This is most commonly observed when a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 0° from the <b>normal.</b> <b>Refraction</b> of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but any type of wave can refract when it interacts with a medium, for example when sound waves pass from one medium into another or when water waves move into water of a different depth. Refraction is described by Snell's law, which states that, for a given pair of media and a wave with a single frequency, {{the ratio of the}} sines of the angle of incidence θ1 and angle of refraction θ2 is equivalent to the ratio of phase velocities (v1 / v2) in the two media, or equivalently, to the opposite ratio of the indices of refraction (n2 / n1). Epsilon (...) and mu (...) represent the dielectric constant and the magnetic moment of the different media:In general, the incident wave is partially refracted and partially reflected; the details of this behavior are described by the Fresnel equations.|$|E
50|$|Due to a <b>normal</b> {{atmospheric}} <b>refraction,</b> sunrise occurs {{shortly before}} the Sun crosses above the horizon. Light from the Sun is bent, or refracted, as it enters earth's atmosphere. This effect causes the apparent sunrise to be earlier than the actual sunrise. Similarly, apparent sunset occurs slightly later than actual sunset.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBoth {{refractive}} {{properties of}} the eyes and ambient light conditions affect emmetropization during growth. Exposure to constant light flattens the cornea making chicks hyperopic. To discover whether and how growing chick eyes restore emmetropia after exposure to constant light (CL) for 3, 7, or 11 weeks, we returned chicks to normal (N) conditions with 12 h. of light alternating with 12 h. of darkness (designated the “R”, or recovery, condition) for total periods of 4, 7, 11, or 17 weeks. The two control groups were raised in CL conditions or raised in N conditions for the same length of time. We measured anterior chamber depths and lens thicknesses with an A-scan ultrasound machine. We measured corneal curvatures with an eight-axis keratometer, and refractions with conventional retinoscopy. We estimated differences in optical powers of CL, R and N chicks of identical age by constructing ray-tracing models using the above measurements and age-adjusted normal lens curvatures. We also computed the sensitivity of focus for small perturbations of the above optical parameters. Full refractive recovery from CL effects always occurred. Hyperopic refractive errors were absent when R chicks were returned to N {{for as little as}} 1 week after 3 weeks CL treatment. In R chicks exposed to CL for 11 weeks and returned to N, axial lengths, vitreous chamber depths and radii of corneal curvatures did not return to <b>normal,</b> although their <b>refractions</b> did. While R chicks can usually recover emmetropia, after long periods of exposure to CL, they cannot recover normal ocular morphology. Emmetropization following CL exposure is achieved primarily by adjusting the relationship between corneal curvature and axial length, resulting in <b>normal</b> <b>refractions...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for obtaining rapid and reliable estimates of acuity in infants, for both monocular and binocular viewing. The method depends on 'preferential looking', where the infant prefers {{to look at}} a striped pattern rather than a blank screen of matched mean luminance. A staircase procedure for testing is followed, with observations being recorded by a 'blind' observer (who does not know on which of the 2 screens the striped pattern is displayed). Monocular acuity estimates have been obtained for a group of infants 3 to 4 months old with <b>normal</b> <b>refractions.</b> Many of these infants show similar acuity values in the 2 eyes, with a few showing reliable differences between the eyes. To check reliability of the method a comparison of 2 independent interleaved staircase estimates of the same eye have been made. In general this check shows highly consistent estimates for a given eye of a given infant. Nearly all infants show slightly higher acuity estimates for binocular viewing than for monocular. The possible reasons for this difference are discussed. The clinical use of such a method is reported for a number of cases. The method {{has been found to be}} useful in a variety of clinical conditions where other available tests are not possible on young infants...|$|R

Sub-refraction {{is perhaps the most}} rare of the four refractive conditions (ducting, super-refraction, <b>normal</b> <b>refraction</b> and sub-refraction), but nevertheless cannot be ignored when assessing the performance of a radio link. Specifically, for a 50 km, low-altitude, over-sea radio path in the British Channel Islands, an attempt has been made to model the propagation conditions during periods of sub-refraction, and the results compared with experimental observations...|$|E

40|$|Evoked {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} to {{the occurrence of}} a disparate stimulus in dynamic random dot stereograms. Seven adult males, {{all of whom had}} vision which was normal or corrected to normal, participated in the experiment. Subjects viewed 100 ms duration stimuli which embodied 30 arc min of either crossed or uncrossed disparity under four conditions of spherical overcorrection: - 0. 25, + 1. 0, + 2. 0, + 3. 0 dioptres. The first condition, essentially <b>normal</b> <b>refraction,</b> yielded reliable behavioural reports of the stimulus and clear evoked potentials to both crossed and uncrossed disparity. With increasing overcorrection the behavioural reports became less reliable, and the evoked potentials were degraded for both conditions of disparity. The responses to the crossed disparity condition, however, showed significantly less degradation in both behavioural and electrophysiological measures. The implications of this finding may be that there are separate cortical subsystems for the processing of crossed and uncrossed disparity and that the former is more robust under non-ideal viewing conditions...|$|E
40|$|In a {{population-based}} infant vision screening programme, 5295 infants {{were screened}} {{and those with}} significant refractive errors were followed up. To assess {{the relationship between the}} development of vision and other domains, we report a longitudinal study comparing infants with significant hyperopia, identified at age 9 months ('hyperopes') with infants with <b>normal</b> <b>refractions</b> ('controls'). Children are included who completed at each age a broad set of visual, cognitive, motor and language measures taken over a series of follow-up visits up to age 5. 5 years. Hyperopes performed significantly worse than controls on the Atkinson Battery of Child Development for Examining Functional Vision at 14 months and 3. 5 years and the Henderson Movement Assessment Battery for Children at 3. 5 and 5. 5 years. The Griffiths Child Development Scales, MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory and British Picture Vocabulary Scales showed no significant differences. Exclusion of those infants who became amblyopic and strabismic did not substantially alter these results, suggesting that the differences between groups were not a consequence of these disorders. These results indicate that early hyperopia is associated with a range of developmental deficits that persist at least to age 5. 5 years. These effects are concentrated in visuocognitive and visuomotor domains rather than the linguistic domain...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{uniaxial}} material, one ray behaves {{according to}} the <b>normal</b> law of <b>refraction</b> (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface. However, as explained above, the other polarization can be deviated from normal incidence, which cannot be described using the law of refraction. This thus {{became known as the}} extraordinary ray. The terms [...] "ordinary" [...] and [...] "extraordinary" [...] are still applied to the polarization components perpendicular to and not perpendicular to the optic axis respectively, even in cases where no double refraction is involved.|$|R
40|$|Seventy {{years ago}} Steiger, a Swiss ophthalmologist, found the {{distribution}} of corneal powers to follow a normal (binomial) curve. He noted {{a wide range of}} values among emmetropes, and he also knew that their axial lengths varied significantly. He expected that normal distributions would be found for other components of refraction and also for refraction as a whole, and in seeking a controlling mechanism he recalled the multifactorial pattern of inheritance of such characteristics as stature. The present study employs modern mathematical techniques to test the validity of 2 related hypotheses: that the components of refraction are correlated and that a polygenic mode of inheritance is responsible for determining the refractive power of the eye. In the light of this study and of other modern knowledge about refraction Steiger's work is reassessed. Most of his views are vindicated, although his assumption of a <b>normal</b> distribution for <b>refraction</b> as a whole could not be justified. His contribution to the understanding of refraction establishes him among the great names in ophthalmology...|$|R

The three case studies examined are: warm air advection over dense pack ice causing strong elevated ducting and subrefraction, cold air advection over relatively open water causing shallow convection and <b>normal</b> <b>refraction</b> condi­tions, large scale subsidence in the western quadrants of an anticyclone leading to super-refraction and weak ducting. Developing synoptic scale cyclones adjacent to the MIZEX- 83 area often determined the airflow over the region. The observed large horizontal SST gradients were the dominant forcing mechanisms on surface layer stability. Trapping layers associated with subsidence inversions can be located on satellite imagery by assuming that stratiform clouds form immediately below the inversion. Uniform cloud and refraction layers were not common during MIZEX- 83 due to strong mesoscale variability. Factors affecting inversion height include subsidence and entrainment mixing. Bulk Richardson number values for locations over the open water and pack ice show significant variability in stability conditions across the MIZ. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{propagation}} {{effects in}} realistic, transparent, metallodielectric photonic band gap {{structures in the}} context of negative refraction and super-resolution in the visible and near infrared ranges. In the resonance tunneling regime, we find that for transverse-magnetic incident polarization, field localization effects contribute to a waveguiding phenomenon that makes it possible for the light to remain confined within a small fraction of a wavelength, without any transverse boundaries, due to the suppression of diffraction. This effect is related to negative refraction of the Poynting vector inside each metal layer, balanced by <b>normal</b> <b>refraction</b> inside the adjacent dielectric layer: The degree of field localization and material dispersion together determine the total momentum that resides within any given layer, and thus the direction of energy flow. We find that the transport of evanescent wave vectors is mediated by the excitation of quasistationary, low group velocity surface waves responsible for relatively large losses. As representative examples we consider transparent metallodielectric stacks such as Ag/TiO 2 and Ag/ GaP and show in detail how to obtain the optimum conditions for high transmittance of both propagating and evanescent modes for super-guiding and super-resolution applications across the visible and near IR ranges. Finally, we study the influence of gain on super-resolution. We find that the introduction of gain can compensate the losses caused by the excitation of surface plasmons, improves the resolving characteristics of the lens, and leads to gain-tunable super-resolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of light with matter has triggered {{the interest of}} scientists for long time. The area of plasmonics emerges in this context through the {{interaction of}} light with valence electrons in metals. The random phase approximation in the long wavelength limit is used for analytical investigation of plasmons in three-dimensional metals, in a two-dimensional electron gas and finally in the most famous two-dimensional semi-metal, namely graphene. We show that plasmons in bulk metals {{as well as in}} a two-dimensional electron gas originate from classical laws, whereas, quantum effects appear as non-local corrections. On the other hand, graphene plasmons are purely quantum modes and, thus, they would not exist in a "classical world". Furthermore, under certain circumstances, light is able to couple with plasmons on metallic surfaces, forming a surface plasmon polariton, which is very important in nanoplasmonics due to its subwavelength nature. In addition, we outline two applications that complete our theoretical investigation. Firstly, we examine how the presence of gain (active) dielectrics affects surface plasmon polariton properties and we find that there is a gain value for which the metallic losses are completely eliminated resulting to lossless plasmon propagation. Secondly, we combine monolayers of graphene in a periodic order and construct a plasmonic metamaterial that provides tunable wave propagation properties, such as epsilon-near-zero behavior, <b>normal</b> and negative <b>refraction.</b> Comment: This is a Chapter of the book: Nanoplasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.

40|$|Shortly {{after the}} 18 May eruption, {{a series of}} {{airborne}} lidar flights were made over the Eastern United States. During the same period, ground-based systems were activated throughout the world. The available worldwide lidar data is put together in a consistent set. These data show the dispersion of material at different altitudes during the early global circuits. The material in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere was very patchy in horizontal extent with backscattering ratio values over {{the east coast of}} the United States greater than 100 at the ruby wavelength of 0. 6943. Two wavelength ratios and depolarization values for the material in the lower stratosphere (12 to 18 km) appear to have returned to the pre- 18 May values within a month after the eruption and this indicated a rapid conversion to spherical shapes and <b>normal</b> indices of <b>refraction.</b> The material above 20 km moved slowly westward while most of the ejecta moved eastward at various speeds and directions which varied considerably with altitude. The westward material was detected first by the Japanese lidar system and then subsequently by the European and American ground-based systems. It circuited the globe in about 60 days. An airborne lidar flight in early September across the continental United States showed the layers to have homogenized considerably one broad layer between about 14 and 21 km peaking at 18 to 19 km and another more intermittent thin layer between 21 and 22 km.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Aging has various {{effects on}} visual system. Vision deteriorate, {{contrast}} sensitivity decreases and ocular aberrations apparently make the optical quality worse across the years. PURPOSE: To prospective evaluate ocular aberrations along the ages. METHODS: Three hundred and fifteen patients were examined, 155 were male (39. 36 %) and 160 were female (60. 63 %). Ages ranged from 5 to 64 year-old, {{the study was}} performed from February to November, 2004. Patients were divided into 4 age-groups according to IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) classification: 68 patients from 5 to 14 year-old, 55 patients from 15 to 24 year-old, 116 from 25 to 44 year-old and 76 from 45 to 67 year-old. All patients had the following characteristics: best corrected visual acuity > 20 / 25, emmetropia or spherical equivalent < 3. 50 SD, refractive astigmatism < 1. 75 CD on cycloplegic <b>refraction,</b> <b>normal</b> ophthalmologic exam and no previous ocular surgeries. This protocol was approved by Federal University of São Paulo Institutional Review Board. Total optical aberrations were measured by H-S sensor LadarWave® Custom Cornea Wavefront System (Alcon Laboratories Inc, Orlando, FLA, USA) and were statistically analysed. Corneal aberrations were calculated using CT-View software Version 6. 89 (Sarver and Associates, Celebration, FL, USA). Lens aberrations were calculated by subtraction. RESULTS: High-order (0. 32 e 0. 48 µm) and ocular spherical aberrations (0. 02 e 0. 26 µm) increased respectively in child and middle age groups. High order (0. 27 µm) and corneal spherical aberrations (0. 05 µm) did not show changes with age. Lens showed a statistically significant spherical aberration increase (from - 0. 02 to 0. 22 µm). Vertical (from 0. 10 to - 0. 07 µm) and horizontal coma (from 0. 01 to - 0. 12 µm) presented progressively negative values with aging. CONCLUSION: High-order and spherical aberrations increased with age due to lens contribution. The cornea did not affect significantly changes observed on ocular aberrations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe made a {{comprehensive}} study, involving observations on 45 marmosets, {{of the effects}} on ocular growth and refraction of wearing spectacles from the ages of 4 – 8 weeks. This period was within the period early in life when the eye grows rapidly and refraction changes from hyperopia to its adult value of modest myopia. In one series of experiments we studied the effect of lenses of powers − 8, − 4, + 4 and + 8 D fitted monocularly. In another series of experiments we studied the effect of lenses of equal and opposite powers fitted binocularly, with the two eyes alternately occluded, so as to give an incentive to use both eyes, and in particular to accommodate, for {{at least part of}} each day, through the negative lens. The vitreous chamber of eyes that wore negative lenses of − 4 D or − 8 D, combined with alternate occlusion, elongated more rapidly than that of the fellow eye (negative lens eye–positive lens eye, 0. 21 ± 0. 03 mm (S. E. M.), P< 0. 01 and 0. 25 ± 0. 06 mm, P< 0. 05, respectively) and became relatively more myopic (2. 8 ± 0. 26 D, P< 0. 01 and 2. 4 ± 0. 61 D, P< 0. 05 respectively). Eyes that wore − 4 D lenses monocularly elongated more rapidly and became myopic than fellow eyes. Eyes that wore + 4 D or + 8 D lenses were less strongly affected: animals that wore + 8 D lenses monocularly (without alternate occlusion) developed a slight relative hyperopia (0. 99 ± 0. 21 D, P< 0. 01), with the more hyperopic eyes also slightly shorter (0. 09 ± 0. 05 mm) than their fellow eyes, but eyes wearing + 4 D lens were not significantly different from their fellow eyes. Animals that wore − 8 D lenses monocularly (without alternate occlusion) developed a slight relative hyperopia after three weeks of lens-wear (0. 85 ± 0. 26 D, P< 0. 05). These were the only eyes that responded in a non-compensatory direction to the optical challenge of spectacle wear, and we interpret this effect as one due to visual deprivation. After the removal of lenses, the degree of anisometropia slowly diminished in those groups of animals in which it had been induced, but in the three groups in which the largest effects had been produced by lens-wear the overall mean anisometropia (0. 68 ± 0. 24 D, P< 0. 01) and vitreous chamber depth (VCD) discrepancy (0. 09 ± 0. 03 mm, P< 0. 01) were still significant {{at the end of the}} experiments, when the animals were 273 days old. The reduction of anisometropia in these groups was associated with an increase in the rate of elongation of the vitreous chamber in the eyes that had previously grown normally i. e. the less myopic eyes grew more rapidly than their fellow eyes: in the seven weeks following lens-wear these eyes became more myopic and longer than <b>normal</b> eyes (<b>refraction</b> P< 0. 001; VCD P< 0. 001). Control experiments showed that occlusion of one eye for 50 % of the day had no effect on eye growth and refraction, and therefore that alternate occlusion itself had no effect...|$|R
