5|$|At this point, McCormack {{had become}} {{apprehensive}} about his career, but in early 1947 a <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> opportunity opened up. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 {{had created the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee {{research and development of}} nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The Act had created a statutory position inside the AEC called the Director of Military Applications, which the AEC commissioners envisaged as a staff post responsible for military planning and policy formulation. By law, the Director of Military Applications had to be a serving armed forces officer.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, {{known as}} Bert Appleroth, was a tram {{conductor}} who created jelly crystals using gelatine {{and sugar in}} his bathtub. He sold these jelly crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his jelly, then formed a company with Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. Planes were considered <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> at the time, so aviation fan Appleroth named the brand Aeroplane Jelly. Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and Aeroplane Jelly's advertising campaigns made the jelly a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite.|$|E

25|$|Lionel ceased toy {{production}} in 1942 to produce nautical {{items for the}} United States Navy during World War II. The company advertised heavily, however, promising <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> products, urging American teenagers to begin planning their post-War layouts. It also introduced the so-called paper train, a detailed set of cut-and-fold models of Lionel trains printed on cardstock that was notoriously difficult to put together.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Tierco shifted its {{strategic}} direction to amusement parks. It sold {{much of its}} property in the late 1980s, generating capital to reinvest in Frontier City. As this reinvestment paid off, more capital became available, creating further growth. By 1991, Tierco opened White Water waterpark in Oklahoma City (the name later became White Water Bay). The company realized the key to boosting a park's attendance was to add <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> rides, and make it family-friendly.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} ten years there have been {{spectacular}} advances in molecular genetic technologies and tools. These advances allow microbial and mycorrhizal ecologists to ask <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> questions about the ecological and evolutionary roles of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi as individuals, in communities and ecosystems. Genetic analyses of AM fungi have been used to explore the genetic structure of single spores using multilocus genotyping, AM fungal diversity and adaptation across multiple grassland communities, {{all the way up to}} a global investigation of AM fungal diversity, which greatly increased the described molecular diversity within the phylum Glomeromycota.|$|E

25|$|As a physicist, Gibbs's primary area of {{interest}} was spectroscopy. At the time, this was the fairly <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> field of research in physics. Physicists investigated the emission and absorption of radiation, creating an understanding of atomic structure. The new theory of quantum mechanics attempted to explain phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level. Gibbs was the author or co-author of over forty research papers, on subjects such as the ultraviolet spectra of isoelectronic sequences, and the hyperfine structure of spectra. He determined the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron by studying the intervals between the H-alpha lines of hydrogen and deuterium, and investigated the absorption spectra of organic compounds in solution.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} Laval in 1964, Mulroney joined the Montreal law firm {{now known as}} Norton Rose Fulbright, {{which at the time}} was the largest law firm in the Commonwealth of Nations. Mulroney twice failed his bar exams, but the firm kept him due to his charming personality. After {{ultimately}} passing his bar exams, Mulroney was admitted to the Quebec bar in 1965, and became a labour lawyer, which was then a <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> field of law in Quebec. Mulroney's superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation, with opponents often polarized and at odds, proved ideal for this field. He was noted for ending several strikes along the Montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer W. David Angus of Stikeman Elliott, who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaigns.|$|E

25|$|At present {{there are}} 24 {{cyanobacteria}} {{for which a}} total genome sequence is available. 15 of these cyanobacteria come from the marine environment. These are six Prochlorococcus strains, seven marine Synechococcus strains, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501. Several studies have demonstrated how these sequences could be used very successfully to infer important ecological and physiological characteristics of marine cyanobacteria. However, {{there are many more}} genome projects currently in progress, amongst those there are further Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus isolates, Acaryochloris and Prochloron, the N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena, Lyngbya aestuarii and Lyngbya majuscula, as well as bacteriophages infecting marine cyanobaceria. Thus, the growing body of genome information can also be tapped in a more general way to address global problems by applying a comparative approach. Some <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> examples of progress in this field are the identification of genes for regulatory RNAs, insights into the evolutionary origin of photosynthesis, or estimation of the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the genomes that have been analyzed.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before it}} was published, Meitner’s and Frisch’s {{interpretation}} {{of the work of}} Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two University of Columbia physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. Bohr soon afterwards went from Princeton to Columbia to see Fermi. Not finding Fermi in his office, Bohr went down to the cyclotron area and found Anderson. Bohr grabbed him by the shoulder and said: “Young man, let me explain to you about something <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>exciting</b> in physics.” It was clear to scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On January 25, 1939, Anderson {{was a member of the}} experimental team at Columbia University that conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States, which was conducted in the basement of Pupin Hall; the other members of the team were Eugene T.

40|$|Onychomycosis (OM) is the commonest {{disorder}} {{affecting the}} nail unit. The {{fact that it}} affects 3 - 26 % people worldwide {{goes to show that}} it is a significant health problem. The prevalence of OM has been reported to be increasing over the years. Although, we know much about various predisposing factors, we are yet unclear about its exact pathogenesis. The peculiarities of the nail unit with respect to its structure and its immune mechanisms make OM an adversary, which once established is difficult to eradicate. There have been many recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of OM and our methods of diagnosing it. The increasingly valuable role of histopathology; refinements in its technique; PCR techniques; Optical coherence tomography and advances in spectrometric techniques have been reported.

The experiment involved placing uranium oxide inside of an ionization chamber and irradiating it with neutrons, and measuring the energy thus released. The results confirmed that fission was occurring and hinted strongly that it was the isotope uranium 235 in particular that was fissioning. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of the George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E
