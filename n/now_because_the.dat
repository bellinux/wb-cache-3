5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
25|$|The 2003–2004 {{observations}} of methane gas on Mars were made remotely by three teams working with separate data. If the methane is truly {{present in the}} atmosphere of Mars, then something must be producing it on the planet <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> gas is broken down by radiation on Mars within 300 years, therefore the importance to search for biological potential or habitability of the Martian arctic's soils. Methane could also be {{the product of a}} geochemical process or the result of volcanic or hydrothermal activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} lasted {{nearly an}} hour. During the foray, Private Tucker attempted {{to rescue the}} captain, but the latter told the former to save himself. Just then, Jones was struck {{in the chest and}} killed. After that, Lujan went to Kirchner and told him that they had unknowingly crossed into Mexico and that they had better leave <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> villagers had sent word to the Mexican Army. Unwilling to leave his captain behind, Kirchner and his men fought it out for the next forty-five minutes before they realized that if the Mexicans were able to flank and surround them then they would all be killed. Accordingly, the Americans fought their way back across the Rio Grande and made it to the small town of Clint, where news of the engagement was relayed to Sheriff Frank B. Simmons in El Paso.|$|E

500|$|The Howell Road {{eastbound}} {{exit ramp}} {{has been closed}} since the bypass opened because of safety concerns. [...] The interchange was originally planned to be a partial cloverleaf, but residents near Howell Road were concerned by sprawl and forced the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to scale back the plans. [...] Instead, a diamond interchange was built. This forced drivers wishing to head northbound on Howell Road to make a left turn, which proved to be dangerous because of the limited sight distance caused by the overpass. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> NJDOT {{does not want to}} pay to fix the problem, the exit has been barricaded since the freeway's extension was opened. [...] The ramp has guardrails blocking access and the NJDOT intends to bulldoze what is left.|$|E

2500|$|The {{elements}} of the infrastructure themselves are also considered possible targets of terrorism. Traditionally, critical infrastructure elements have been lucrative targets for anyone wanting to attack another country. <b>Now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> infrastructure has become a national lifeline, terrorists can achieve high economic and political value by attacking {{elements of}} it. Disrupting or even disabling the infrastructure may reduce the ability to defend the nation, erode public confidence in critical services, and reduce economic strength. [...] Additionally, well chosen terrorist attacks can become easier and less costly than traditional warfare because of the interdependence of infrastructure elements. These infrastructure elements can become easier targets {{where there is a}} low probability of detection.|$|E
2500|$|A {{part of the}} {{discussion}} about the identity of san and sampi has revolved around a difficult and probably corrupted piece of philological commentary by an anonymous scholiast, which has been debated ever since Joseph Justus Scaliger drew attention to it in the mid-17th century. Scaliger's discussion also contains the first known attestation of the name [...] "san pi" [...] (sampi) in the western literature, and the first attempt at explaining it. The passage in question is a scholion on two rare words occurring in the comedies of Aristophanes, koppatias (...) and samphoras (...) [...] Both were names for certain breeds of horses, and both were evidently named after the letter used as a branding mark on each: [...] "koppa" [...] and [...] "san" [...] respectively. After explaining this, the anonymous scholiast adds a digression that appears to be meant to further explain the name and function of [...] "san", drawing some kind of link between it and the numeral sign of 900. However, what exactly was meant here is obscure <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> text was evidently corrupted during transmission and the actual symbols cited in it were probably exchanged. The following is the passage in the reading provided by a modern edition, with problematic words marked: ...|$|E
