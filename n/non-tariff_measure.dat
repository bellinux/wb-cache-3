40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} EU non-tariff barriers in the form sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures and technical barriers to trade (TBT) on gender relations in the agricultural labour market between 1995 and 2012.

However, gender parity achieved in primary education and increased access to time saving infrastructure increases their share of employment in the agricultural sector. Thus, proactive measures aimed at infrastructure investment that reduces women care burdens and building the educational capacity of women to effectively deal with such non-tariff barriers, could work to remove these gender specific obstacles, enable women respond to employment opportunities and minimise any gender disparity caused by trade...|$|E

We represent these trade costs in the context of a Melitz firm heterogeneity framework using Helpman, Melitz and Rubenstein (2008) method. Analysis was based on Africa's exports of tomatoes to the EU from 2008 to 2013, using the gravity model of trade. Our results show that at both the extensive and intensive margins of trade, the high stringency of EU pesticide standard prevents new entry into the EU market, drives less productive firms away, and discourages existing exporters from expanding their market base. Furthermore, we find the EU entry price system acts like an export tax, inhibiting tomatoes export to the EU, but only at the intensive margin...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{a number}} of {{large-scale}} uncertainties have emerged as threats {{to the development of}} regional integration. Most notably, the UK has decided to leave the EU, and the new US president has stated that he would withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). This paper presents a quantitative comparison of the economic impacts of {{a number of}} alternative regional trade agreement (RTA) scenarios. The impacts were estimated using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of global trade. It is estimated that the US would no longer gain and might even lose, if it withdraws from TPP. The benefits of the bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Japan would be smaller than those of TPP. Higher tariffs on US imports from China and Mexico would lead to significant deterioration of the economic welfare of not only China and Mexico but also the US. Furthermore, China’s benefits from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) might be relatively limited depending on the levels of the agreement and weighed against the adverse impacts of the possible US tariffs. The UK economy would suffer as a result of BREXIT, but the cost of BREXIT could be smaller than the possible benefits of joining TPP. All in all, {{it has been shown that}} income gains resulting from <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measure</b> (NTM) reductions are much larger than those arising from tariff removals.

40|$|There are {{differentials}} in {{the conclusion}} of scholars as to what undermines Africa’s export flows to the European Union (EU) and United State of America (USA). While the impact of tariffs has been reduced due to the unilateral preferential tariffs granted to Africa by these countries, empirical {{studies have shown that}} the frequencies of the incidences of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measures</b> have increased. However, most of these studies examine only price-related trade restrictions without considering the <b>non–tariff</b> (non-price) <b>measures.</b> In addition, these studies’ conclusions are based on data limited to Africa south of the Sahara. This study fills these gaps by evaluating the impact of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measures</b> in the EU and USA on African exports. The study covers exports from 25 African countries, spread across three sectors, using a gravity model based on data from 1990 to 2011, which were obtained from World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS). To mitigate the potential endogeneity and heteroscedasticity problems, the generalized method of moments was used in the analysis. This study finds that tariffs are not the cause of Africa’s inability to access export markets in the EU and USA, but that the incidence of the use of <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measures,</b> such as technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, etc., have inhibited Africa’s export flows to these markets, such that non-tariff barriers have larger magnitudes and significant in both markets.

40|$|Empirically {{assessing}} sanitary and {{phytosanitary regulations}} has proven difficult because most data sources indicate whether a regulation exists but provide no {{information on the}} type or importance of the respectivemeasure. In this article,we construct a novel database ofU. S. phytosanitarymeasures and match these to 47 fresh fruit and vegetable product imports from 89 exporting countries over the period 1996 – 2008. Aproduct-line gravity equation that accounts for zero tradeflows is developed to investigate the trade impact of different pest-mitigation measures. While {{the results suggest that}} phytosanitary treatments generally reduce trade, the actual restrictiveness of these measures diminishes dramatically as exporters accumulate experience, and it vanishes when exporters reach a certain threshold.

40|$|This article {{draws from}} the recent {{literature}} on <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measures</b> to {{provide an overview of}} the analysis of these measures, addressing its definition and classification, as well as some recent evidence on its use in the world and in Brazil. <b>Non-tariff</b> <b>measures</b> are defined as any policy measures, except import tariffs, which may have the potential to affect international trade, changing prices, quantities traded, or both. This definition comprises both measures that restrict trade and those that promote it, and includes measures traditionally adopted as substitutes for tariffs (quotas and price control measures, for example) and trade remedies, and more complex measures such as technical and health regulations, whose main purpose is generally not restrict trade, but to achieve other public policy objectives.

40|$|This article investigates Russian <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measures</b> (NTMs) on dairy {{products}} and their implications for EU dairy exports. Based on survey results, numerous and detailed Russian standards on imported {{dairy products}} are considered by respondents as redundant and unnecessary from a food safety perspective. Conformity assessment procedures {{are identified as}} a major problem when exporting to Russia. They are nontransparent, time-consuming and expose exporters to significant risk that their products may be refused entry at the Russian border. Audits by Russian inspectors seem {{to be subject to}} arbitrary rules and exporting companies face great uncertainty because of unclear and often changing rules. Both fixed and variable costs may increase due to Russian <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measures,</b> adding an estimated 5 – 10 % of export value to costs. The gravity model estimates indicate that, after controlling for other variables, <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measures</b> are more restrictive on US exports to Russia than on EU exports to Russia, while New Zealand’s exports to Russia are least affected by NTMs. Overall, the estimates do not confirm that Russia’s NTMs are significantly more restrictive than is the case with other countries’ NTMs. Although Russian standards for dairy imports are inhibiting trade they are not more restrictive than those implemented by other countries.

Results from the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood model show that, compared to existing estimates from the 1980 s and 1990 s, the size of the border effect in trade between Canadian provinces and U.

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the implications of}} Lao PDR’s WTO accessions on the domestic cement, steel bar and brewery industries {{with a view to}} developing recommendations on how to concurrently manage the Government’s domestic strategic objectives with the country’s effective involvement in the global economy. Calculations of total protection (TE) to the industries shows that beer receives the highest level of protection (110 %), followed by steel bars (17 %) and cement (16 %). The actual level of effective rate of protection (ERP) with the existing tariffs and TEs of the <b>non-tariff</b> <b>measures</b> is 62 percent for cement and 50 percent for steel bars. Lowering the existing tariffs to zero on tradable inputs in the cement and steel bar industries would increase the effective rate of protection (ERP) on those industries to 84 percent for cement and 67 percent for steel bars.
