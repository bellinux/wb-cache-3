50|$|The {{young males}} can be {{identified}} {{as soon as they}} display one (or more) pitch-black feathers of their <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> and/or one (or more) pink feathers of their nape bands. Often, the young males develop their <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> and nape bands in two or sometimes three successive moulting seasons. Adult parakeets with neither pitch-black feathers in their <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> nor pink feathers in their nape bands are usually females.|$|R
50|$|<b>Neck</b> <b>rings,</b> or neck-rings, are {{any form}} of stiff {{jewellery}} worn as an ornament {{around the neck of}} an individual, as opposed to a loose necklace. Many cultures and periods have made <b>neck</b> <b>rings,</b> with both males and females wearing them at various times.|$|R
50|$|The {{rose-ringed parakeet}} is sexually dimorphic. The adult male sports a red or black <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> and the hen and {{immature}} birds {{of both sexes}} either show no <b>neck</b> <b>rings,</b> or display shadow-like pale to dark grey <b>neck</b> <b>rings.</b> Both sexes have a distinctive green colour. Rose-ringed parakeets measure on average 40 cm in length, including the tail feathers, {{a large portion of}} their total length. Their average single-wing length is about 15 - 17.5 cm. In the wild, this is a noisy species with an unmistakable squawking call. It is herbivorous and not migratory.|$|R
5000|$|The South Ndebele {{peoples of}} Africa also wear <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> {{as part of}} their {{traditional}} dress and as a sign of wealth and status. Only married women are allowed to wear the rings, called dzilla. Metal rings are also worn on different parts of the body, not just the <b>neck.</b> The <b>rings</b> are usually made of copper or brass. Although it can vary from person to person whether the removal of <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> can cause pain, if they are removed incorrectly this may result in death. The custom requires that the girls who do choose to wear the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> start before puberty {{in order to get the}} body used to them. These heavy coils can weigh as much as 11 pounds (before puberty, as they will add more rings later down the line.) The <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> put a huge strain on the body. Once a persons  neck has adjusted to the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> they have to leave the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> on permanently. Because the rings have been on these women for such a long time, this weakens the neck muscles causing the neck to essentially not being able to support itself. The neck muscles will tire quickly  and not be able to carry the weight of the head in other words; when the neck is no longer able to fulfill its function it is very likely that it will collapse, thus resulting in suffocation.|$|R

50|$|One of the torcs is {{a smaller}} {{bracelet}} decorated with ornament {{in the style}} of Celtic art, and the other three are <b>neck</b> <b>rings.</b> The bracelet and one of the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> are made with twisted gold wire, and the other <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> have finials shaped like trumpets. One of the latter has been broken into two pieces. The gold content of the four torcs has been measured using x-ray fluorescence to be between 74-78% (roughly equivalent to 17-18 carat), with 18-22% silver, some copper, and traces of iron, mercury and tin - a mix consistent with other Iron Age gold finds in Europe. The weight of the pieces varies from 31 g to 230 g, and over 350 g in total.|$|R

50|$|The {{custom of}} wearing <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> {{is related to}} an ideal of beauty: an {{elongated}} <b>neck.</b> <b>Neck</b> <b>rings</b> push the clavicle and ribs down. The neck stretching is mostly illusory: {{the weight of the}} rings twists the collarbone and eventually the upper ribs at an angle 45 degrees lower than what is natural, causing the illusion of an elongated neck. The vertebrae do not elongate, though the space between them may increase as the intervertebral discs absorb liquid.|$|R

50|$|In Remembrance of the Daleks (1988) the Imperial Daleks {{are opposed}} by 'Renegade Daleks'.

The shoulder mesh is also coarser than that previously seen, resembling a perforated, solid material. Renegade drones are painted grey with a black fender, hemispheres, collars, slats and appendages. A Renegade Supreme Dalek also appears, being a BBC promotional prop made by Martin Wilkie and Lorne Martin. It too is primarily based on the Necros design but with a different collar, slat, mesh and neck bin arrangement. It is further differentiated by having a small eyeball and orange dome lights and appears in a black paint scheme with silver <b>neck</b> <b>rings,</b> <b>neck</b> struts, hemispheres, collars, mesh and slats.|$|R

40|$|Many hoards {{found in}} Ireland, Scotland, Orkney Islands, and Scandinavia {{demonstrate}} the vikings ability to fabricate beautiful arm and <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> of twisted {{silver and gold}} rods. Characteristic for such rings is the uniform appearance of the twisted pattern {{along the length of}} the arm ring, as well as from one arm ring to another, also when found at distant geographical locations. How can the appearance of the twisted wires be so perfectly repetitive? We demonstrate that the answer is that the vikings utilized a self-forming motif: The pattern arises from a twisting of the wires to a maximally rotated configuration. That is why the twist patterns in these arm and <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> are beautiful, repetitive, and universal. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|The Aleutian cackling goose has {{the typical}} black head and neck, white cheek patches, grayish brown back and wings, white rump, black tail feathers, legs, and {{feet of the}} species. It is {{distinguished}} by a conspicuous white <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the base of}} the neck that, in adult plumage, is usually greater than 10 mm wide and is subtended by a ring of darker feathers. The cheek patches are usually separated by a black line under the throat and the breast is a pale grayish-brown color, although a small number of lighter and darker breasted birds occur. The westernmost population did not appreciably differ in color, except that the <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> was always very wide and white in the few attested specimens.|$|R
50|$|The gold torc, {{known as}} the Havor Ring (Havorringen) {{was made in the}} 1st century.

The torc is 257 mm in diameter and weighs close to 800 g, with a gold value of about SEK 40,000-50,000 in 2006. However, the value of the <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> as a historic art object is estimated at tens of million SEK. A copy of it was made for a display at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.|$|R
50|$|The variant {{was based}} on a prop owned by screenwriter Terry Nation which had been used in the second Doctor Who film. The neck bin mesh, struts and <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> were removed, the latter items being {{replaced}} by new rings having a flat, recessed edge detailed with small rivets rather than the usual bevel. Lilac dome lights shaped like upturned jam jars were fitted, together with an eyeball resembling a flashlight which lit up when it spoke. It was painted in gloss black with yellow-gold hemispheres, slats, <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> and dome. It is uncertain who carried out the conversion work, although the painting of the prop was undertaken by the BBC Visual Effects Department under the direction of Clifford Culley.|$|R
