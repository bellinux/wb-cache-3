5000|$|There is no universally {{accepted}} {{distinction between a}} screw and a bolt. A simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that a bolt passes through a substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw screws into something, a bolt bolts several things together). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of [...] "screws" [...] you would not expect nuts to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching <b>nuts.</b> <b>Part</b> of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences.

Additives to this mixture include catechu (areca palm extract), spices/sweeteners (e. g., saccharin, cloves), and/or tobacco. Betel use is {{most common in}} Asia and East India; however, {{little is known about}} the availability and characteristics of these products outside of this region. Thus, a representative sample of betel products and additives was purchased in the Richmond, Virginia area. Five venues were visited between March and May, 2006. Products successfully purchased were those containing betel alone (seven), betel/tobacco (three), tobacco alone (four), and additives (four). Most betel products listed ingredients on the packaging, though some did not explicitly distinguish between those with versus without tobacco. Importantly, seven of seven betel alone and one of three betel/tobacco products omitted any health-related warnings. All products were inexpensive and relatively obtainable in the groceries visited. More research is warranted in order to accurately estimate product emergence into the U. S. and other world markets, and the consequent impact on public health...|$|R

30|$|The TC is {{a typical}} double {{overhung}} rotor with a steel turbine and an attached aluminum compressor impeller. That is, the turbine and compressor impellers are outboard of two bearings. The rotor shaft, FRB, shaft seal, thrust collar, shaft <b>nut</b> and other <b>parts</b> {{are included in the}} TC. All rotor components should be taken into account in the rotordynamic computation to investigate the rotor vibration response, such as the stability analysis and the frequency components in the waterfall plot. The compressor and turbine impellers are generally regarded as rigid disk to model. Due to its complex structure, the mass of rotating components, moment of inertia, and the center of gravity position can be obtained by using CAE 3 -dimensional software to model and calculate, and then add to the rotor-shaft regarded as a rigid disk.|$|R

The small amount remaining he took to the Three-Farthing Stone (roughly the centre of the Shire) and cast into the air, prompting the bountiful period of growth starting in the spring of the year 1420 (Shire Reckoning).

The recipe for this cereal was changed in April 2007, so that it no longer actually includes nuts, substituting natural almond flavoring in its place. The picture on the box no longer depicts the same almond clusters, but the name still includes the word nut. These changes may have been implemented to counteract rising Commodity market prices in 2007. It could also be presumed the recipe change was due to people's ever-expanding nut allergies.|$|R
40|$|Although liana cutting benefi ts for {{tropical}} timber management have been documented, benefi ts for {{non-timber forest product}} (NTFP) management have not. We tested the silvicultural recommendation that lianas should be cut from Brazil nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa) to improve host tree fecundity and thus, commercial nut yields. Our 10 -year experiment was conducted where local harvesters collect Brazil <b>nuts</b> as <b>part</b> of their forest-based livelihoods. We cut 454 lianas from 78 of 138 host trees &# 8805; 50 cm DBH. Treated trees were better producers 3. 5 years after liana cutting, and by years 9 and 10 produced three times more fruits than untreated trees. Number of lianas rooted within 5 m of the host tree explained production levels, suggesting both above- and belowground liana competition. Once host crowns were liana free, branch regrowth was highly visible, and crown reassessments suggested that liana cutting improved crown form. Liana cutting may induce non-producing trees to become producers and may circumvent mortality of heavily infested trees. Only lianas associated with Brazil nut trees should be cut to conserve liana ecosystem functions. Liana cutting {{could be applied to}} other tropical trees to boost NTFP fruit and seed production and increase host tree fecundity. 2014 Editado por: John A. Parrota; Cynthia F. Moser; Amy J.

40|$|Macadamia is an {{evergreen}} native rainforest tree {{originating from}} the Australian east coast. The survival of these trees {{in their natural}} habitat was threatened when the land was cleared for agricultural use in the mid- 1800 s. However, commercial cultivation of the macadamia nut through the establishment of plantations in the 1870 s ensured its survival, and today macadamia is Australia’s only indigenous, commercially grown food crop. By the 1890 s, the macadamia nut had been introduced to some regions of the United States, such as Hawaii, where hybridization and cloning developed different varieties, such as Cates, Beaumont’s, and James, turning the nut into a valuable commercial crop. In addition to Australia and Hawaii, the tree is now also cultivated as a food crop in California, Florida, New Zealand, southern Africa, and parts of South and Central America. In Australia, {{there are at least}} five species of macadamia trees, but only two produce edible nuts and are grown as a food crop. They are Macadamia integrifolia (smooth shelled), which contains 80 % oil and 4 % sugar, and Macadamia tetraphylla (rough shelled) with an oil content which ranges from 65 % to 75 % and a sugar content of 6 % to 8 %. M. integrifolia is the species most commonly grown for its crops of nuts.

40|$|The Brazil nut {{industry}} fits {{closely with}} the principal objectives of European policy on development co-operation (poverty reduction linked with environmental protection) and forest conservation (maintaining forest cover). However, European Regulation 1525 - 98 EC, which decreases acceptable levels of aflatoxins in Brazil <b>nuts</b> to 4 <b>parts</b> per billion, may cause a crash in the Brazil nut trade. Thus, European policies on food quality, development co-operation and forest conservation are likely to work in opposition. Brazil nut producer countries have questioned the legal basis of the Regulation in terms of scientific justification for the stricter limits on aflatoxin content and lack of conformity with international standards set by Codex Alimentarius.

40|$|Nutrient {{adequacy}} of tree nut consumers {{has not been}} examined. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 – 2010 data {{were used to assess}} the association of tree nut consumption by adults 19 + years (n = 14, 386) with nutrient adequacy and diet quality. Covariate adjusted usual intake was determined using two 24 -h dietary recalls and the National Cancer Institute method. Percentages of the consumption groups below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) or above the Adequate Intake (AI) were determined. Diet quality was determined using the Healthy Eating Index- 2005 (HEI) score. Usual intake data showed consumers of tree nuts had a lower percentage (p < 0. 0001) of the population below the EAR for vitamins A (22 ± 5 vs. 49 ± 1), E (38 ± 4 vs. 94 ± 0. 4) and C (17 ± 4 vs. 44 ± 1); folate (2. 5 ± 1. 5 vs. 12 ± 0. 6); calcium (26 ± 3 vs. 44 ± 1); iron (3 ± 0. 6 vs. 9 ± 0. 4); magnesium (8 ± 1 vs. 60 ± 1); and zinc (1. 5 ± 1 vs. 13 ± 1). Tree nut consumers had a higher percentage (p < 0. 0001) of the population above the AI for fiber (33 ± 3 vs. 4 ± 0. 3) and potassium (12 ± 3 mg vs. 2 ± 0. 2 mg).
