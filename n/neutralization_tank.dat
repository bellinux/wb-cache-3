40|$|Proper {{treatment}} of palm oil mill effluent (POME) {{is necessary to}} sustain the progress of palm oil industry in Sri Lanka. A case {{study was conducted to}} improve existing wastewater treatment system in a palm oil factory located in Galle district. The system consists of a <b>neutralization</b> <b>tank,</b> anaerobic ponds followed by anaerobic biogas digesters. Lime has been used to neutralize before sending to ponds for biological treatment. However, this treatment did not bring optimum pH for microbial action in anaerobic ponds. Therefore, performance of lime, caustic soda, iron lathe shavings and boiler ash from the same factory were studied for pH adjustment. A lab scale leaching bed with boiler ash was tested as it is freely available. Total carbon and total nitrogen in effluent were also measured. It was found that the Ca(OH) 2 availability in commercially available lime was 31 % and less effective. The effective dosage of caustic soda to obtain neutral pH was 5 kg/m 3 thus lead to high cost. Iron lathe shavings and boiler ash of palm oil mill were effective and economically feasible in balancing pH. The boiler ash has shown significant effect in pH neutralization with the rate of 60 g/l with 4 days hydraulic retention time. Leaching bed with an ash layer shows an acceptable performance...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in prebeneficiadora coffee plant of UAC-CP, located {{in the community of}} Carmen Pampa, Coroico Municipality, Nor Yungas of La Paz department. The objective was to determine the efficiency of wastewater treatment prebeneficiado coffee because it is not known to be effective in reducing the level of contamination of treated wastewater, and according to the results to correct and / or validate directly model system in place. For their study was established seven sampling points within the system of treatment and four replications were made at different times and with different amounts of coffee cherry. We evaluated the parameters of temperature, pH, settleable solids, total suspended solids, fixed and volatile, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen. The temperature of wastewater entering the system has recorded 16. 5 o C, increasing during the treatment process at 17. 5 °C and record the output is 16. 5 ºC. The pH increased from 4. 51 to 6. 04 which occurred at the last two gaps oxygenation and not in the <b>neutralization</b> <b>tank.</b> Settleable solids (SS) increased from 0. 1 mg / L to 0. 15 mg / L, which was recorded at the lakes of oxygen, is attributed to the drag of fine gravel. Total suspended solids (TSS) have been reduced from 1927. 5 mg / L to 299 mg / L gradually throughout the treatment process. Fixed suspended solids (SSF) were reduced from 137. 5 mg / L to 58. 5 mg / L. Volatile suspended solids (VSS) were reduced from 1790 mg / L to 240. 5 mg / L. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) was reduced from 6102. 5 mg O 2 / L to 1245 mg O 2 / L. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) was reduced from 9800 mg O 2 / L to 1658. 75 mg O 2 / L. Dissolved oxygen (DO) increased from 0 to 2. 4 mg O 2 / L, in the last two gaps in oxygenation, due to the reduction of solids and chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen. Of the nine parameters measured, six meet the maximum permissible values for download in source receptor (stream) and three of them are outside the parameter according to the regulation of Law 1333...|$|E
40|$|This thesis details a {{graduate}} research effort written {{to fulfill the}} Magister of Technologiae in Chemical Engineering requirements at the University of South Africa. The research evaluates the ability of equilibrium based software to forecast dissolution, evaluate safety impacts, and determine downstream processability changes associated with using oxalic acid solutions to dissolve sludge heels in Savannah River Site High Level Waste (HLW) Tanks 1 - 15. First, a dissolution model is constructed and validated. Coupled with a model, a material balance determines the fate of hypothetical worst-case sludge in the treatment and <b>neutralization</b> <b>tanks</b> during each chemical adjustment. Although sludge is dissolved, after neutralization more is created within HLW. An energy balance determines overpressurization and overheating to be unlikely. Corrosion induced hydrogen may overwhelm the purge ventilation. Limiting the heel volume treated/acid added and processing the solids through vitrification is preferred and should not significantly {{increase the number of}} glass canisters...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this status report is to {{summarize}} updated data and information from the FY 1994 strategy plan {{that is associated with}} inactive miscellaneous underground storage tanks (IMUSTs). Assumptions and processes to assess potential risks and operational concerns are documented in this report. Safety issue priorities are ranked based on a number of considerations. Sixty-three IMUSTs have been Identified and placed on the official IMUST list. All the tanks are associated with past Hanford Site operations. Of the 63 tanks., 19 are catch tanks, 20 are vault <b>tanks,</b> 3 are <b>neutralization</b> <b>tanks,</b> 8 are settling tanks, 2 are solvent makeup tanks used to store hexone, 2 are flush tanks, 3 are decontamination tanks, 1 is a diverter station, 1 is a receiver tank, 1 is an experimental tank, and 3 are waste handling tanks. It is important to proactively deal with the risks Imposed by these 63 tanks, {{and at the same time}} not jeopardize the existing commitments and schedules for mitigating and resolving identified safety issues related to the 177 SSTs and DSTS. Access controls and signs have been placed on all but the three official IMUSTs added most recently. An accelerated effort to identify authorization documents and perform unreviewed safety question (USQ) screening has been completed. According to a set of criteria consistent with the safety screening data quality objective (DQO) process, 6 IMUSTs are ranked high related to the hydrogen generation potential safety Issue, 1 is ranked high related to the ferrocyanide potential safety issue, 6 are ranked high related to the flammability potential safety issue, and 25 are ranked high related to the vapor emissions potential safety issue...|$|R
40|$|SRTC {{personnel}} {{are developing a}} technique that can determine the concentration of tetraphenylborate (TPB) at 300 grams in 100, 000 gallons of salt solution (0. 8 mg/L) {{in the presence of}} 0. 378 Ci/gal of Cs- 137. The current High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method of analysis can determine the TPB concentration at 5 mg/L and higher. The limit of quantitation was lowered by modification of the sample preparation steps. The HPLC sample preparation method currently used requires <b>neutralization</b> of the <b>tank</b> waste sample followed by extraction with acetonitrile. This method dilutes the tank waste sample 6. 5 to 1 increasing the limit of quantitation. The method described in this report concentrates the sample two-fold lowering the limit of quantitation from 5 mg/L to 0. 25 mg/L. Researchers used solvent extraction of undiluted tank waste to isolate, and concentrate (two-fold) samples of tank supernate and Plant Inhibited Water (PIW) that simulated tank supernate at the cesium level of approximately 0. 3 Ci/gal. The 137 Cs content in the tank supernate measured 0. 65 Ci/gal prior to a two-fold dilution with PIW. The concentration of the TPB was determined by HPLC on a reversed-phase HPLC column using methanol, acetonitrile, and buffered water as the mobile phase. Important Findings: The 0. 8 mg/L quantitation limit was met in the presence of radioactive cesium. A 93 per cent reduction in activity in the acetonitrile layer was achieved. A five-mL acetonitrile aliquot from the extraction of a tank waste sample containing 0. 378 Ci/gal of Cs- 137 could be handled in a radiological hood and comply with the less than 5 mR/hr hood limit. This method is applicable to tank waste solutions of high ionic strength (greater than 2. 0 M Na). The ionic strength of tank waste solutions of low ionic strength will need to be adjusted by the addition of NaOH or 5. 6 M average salt solution to facilitate the formation of two layers (organic and aqueous). Increasing the ionic strength of tank waste samples by blending in a high ionic strength solution will raise the limit of quantitation...|$|R
