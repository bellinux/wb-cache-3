5|$|At {{the end of}} Woolley's directorship, the 74-inch {{telescope}} he had initiated {{finally came}} online. Gascoigne, looking for a <b>new</b> <b>research</b> project and keen {{to use the new}} telescope, took up the study of globular clusters, compact groups {{of tens of thousands of}} ancient stars of similar age. With a new design of photometer, he was able to measure the exceptionally faint stars in these clusters. Gascoigne determined that the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds were both young and old, and had quite different characteristics to those in the Milky Way: this information was important for modelling the evolution of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Born William fitzHerbert in York, William {{was the son}} of Herbert of Winchester, or Herbert fitzAlberic, {{chancellor}} and {{treasurer of}} King Henry I. Most sources say his mother was Emma, half-sister of King Stephen and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and that she was an illegitimate daughter of Stephen II, Count of Blois, Stephen's father. <b>New</b> <b>research,</b> however, suggests that Emma might have been a daughter of Hunger fitzOdin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey. William was born sometime before the 1090s, but the exact date of birth is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{important}} crops, {{little is known}} about the domestication, dispersal and cultivation history of the cowpea. Although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea cultivation the centre of diversity of the cultivated cowpea is West Africa, leading an early consensus that this is the likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. <b>New</b> <b>research</b> using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E
