Passengers discovered it is quite easy to compare fares across different flights or different airlines. This helped put pressure on airlines to lower fares.

Ugarhan Berkok from the Royal Military College of Canada disagreed with Huebert, saying that [...] "multi-function is probably {{the order of the}} day"; he indicated that the Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen and Super Hornet all offer that capability.

40|$|Presentation at the 2014 Charleston Conference: Issues is Book and Serial PublicationsIn 2014, the University of Michigan Business School Library (Kresge Business Administration Library) emptied its {{shelves of}} books in a project that will forever change library support for the school’s {{research}} needs. No longer will the library be format agnostic in acquiring resources; only online resources will be purchased. How did this happen {{and what does it}} mean for the future of the library? More importantly, what may this suggest for other libraries? What does this mean for the future of publishers and vendors? If the library is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> any print books, then the rationale of current models is seriously challenged if not entirely inadequate. Publishers and libraries operate under fiscal and physical conditions that drive them further and further from mutually beneficial arrangements towards ones which are not sustainable nor good for either side. Gone are the days when we thought first and foremost about a quality item that would stand the test of time on our shelves. Instead, we are interested only in our immediate value and extracting value from others in the Information Supply Chain (or circle as many would argue). With these changes on nearly every participant in the scholarly communication space, it is very clear that we are all being squeezed in a tight spot. This session will seek to identify and potentially find a common path where we can build a future that works for everyone. Leading the discussion will be a library director dealing with severe restrictions, a Sales Director from an academic publisher (also specializing in Business), and a representative from a major academic library book distributor Each party will provide a view from their desk that showcases a way that we might find some much needed breathing room in an increasingly small space. We hope you’ll join us for what we’re sure will be a very lively discussion...|$|E

40|$|Lack of {{knowledge}} {{was also a}} barrier. Some lacked food and food preparation knowledge; others lacked nutrition knowledge. Several participants noted that they didn't {{know what to do}} with the new fruits and vegetables available at the grocery store. One said, "The thing is you go to [ [...] . the store] and you see rows of this fruit and you don't know what they are. If you bought them, what would you do with them?" Another stated, "A lot of different vegetables I'd like to try, but you get it home and you're like, now what do you do with this?" When commenting on how many servings should be eaten daily, most participants either did not know or gave vague responses, such as "Well [...] . I think three of the veggies. I think three; I'm not sure-three-cup servings of veggies if they are cooked [...] . Three fruit" or "I have no idea if I'm getting enough" or " One a week?" Both sociopsychological and socioenvironmental factors were identified as barriers to adequate consumption. For some women, having children in the home made eating enough vegetables and fruit more difficult. One woman said, "I find that if I buy a lot of the different fruits, the kids don't eat them. " Another cited "kids' tendencies [...] . to reach for something sweet and sugar [...] . " A third commented, "I [...] . can only get my children to eat one of each thing. They don't seem to want to try anything new. " For others, the presence of a "significant other" in the home resulted in decreased intake. One said, "My husband won't eat any vegetables," while another said, "I can be influenced by my boyfriend who lives with me, and he tends to eat far worse than I do [...] I do corn, always corn, because that's all [the boyfriend] will eat. " Early childhood experiences were also identified as a barrier. Many participants reported limited exposure to a variety of vegetables and fruit while growing up, and negative memories of "cooked, mushy vegetables. " One participant said that "we just always cooked our vegetables [...] . You know, you cook your potatoes and your vegetables to mush. " Another said, "We never had fruit around a whole lot. " Another barrier was lack of availability, which was sometimes due to cost and season. Said one participant, "Cost is probably one of the biggest influencing factors [...] . If it's on sale I'll buy it, and if it is not I generally won't. " Another mentioned that "fruit, especially fruit, it's very, very expensive.
