5|$|Late in the war, the {{provisional}} government existed mostly on paper. However, {{in the summer}} of 1864, Colonel R. A. Alston of the Ninth Tennessee Cavalry requested Governor Hawes' assistance in investigating crimes allegedly committed by Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan during his latest raid into Kentucky. Hawes <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> act on the request, however, as Morgan was suspended from command on August 10 and killed by Union troops on September 4, 1864.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{of their}} lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the {{indigenous}} sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in {{the fact that she had}} <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sit an exam before entering university.|$|E
5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force {{did not know}} the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for them to learn about military cargoes and procedures.|$|E

5|$|Misch was {{transferred}} to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, Misch travelled with Hitler throughout the war. When not serving as bodyguards, Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters. When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him. They <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler. It did cause Misch some concern that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} funded {{flood control}} projects involving {{the building of}} , thus aiding the speed of waterborne transport and allowing undeveloped areas to become irrigated farmlands. These conscription labor projects allowed for the building of new hamlets which were dependent on the government for their livelihoods. When {{the authority of the}} central government declined in the late Eastern Han period, many commoners living in such hamlets were forced to flee their lands and work as tenants on large estates of wealthy landowners. The people of older hamlets which <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> rely on central government projects for their wellbeing or existence often sought support from powerful local families.|$|E
5|$|According to German {{assessments}} of the initial Soviet defeat, 673,000 soldiers had been captured by the Wehrmacht in both the Vyazma and Bryansk pockets, although recent research suggests a lower—but still enormous—figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%. Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command. On 9 October, Otto Dietrich of the German Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast {{in a press conference}} the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps hours away. German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future Lebensraum in the east.|$|E

5|$|During his career, Russell {{was one of}} {{the first}} big earners in NBA basketball. His 1956 rookie {{contract}} was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner Bob Cousy. In contrast to other Celtics, who had to work in the offseason to maintain their standard of living (Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant), Russell <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work part-time. When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received. For his promotion to coach the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player; although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation.|$|E
5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E

Americans could choose their diet from a diverse range of plants and animals from Europe and the Western Hemisphere, and this, combined with favorable weather conditions, ensured that Americans <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with harvest failures. There was little exposure to epidemic diseases, and low wealth inequality, ensuring that even the poor were well-fed.|$|E

25|$|Despite many {{claims of}} {{political}} interference in its construction and subsequent operation, {{the majority of}} IRC from an operations viewpoint remained economically self-sufficient.

25|$|Though the {{president}} endorsed the treaty, issues of territory and race, expressed by {{concern over the}} expansion of slavery, slowed ratification in the Senate. After some revisions, the Senate ultimately ratified the treaty. By taking away Article X, they ensured the Mexican population’s loss of land grants.
