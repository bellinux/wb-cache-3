25|$|There are {{primarily}} two ways that networks can evolve, {{both of which}} can occur simultaneously. The first is that network topology can be changed by the addition or subtraction of nodes (genes) or parts of the network (modules) may be expressed in different contexts. The Drosophila Hippo signaling pathway provides a good example. The Hippo signaling pathway controls both mitotic growth and post-mitotic cellular differentiation. Recently {{it was found that}} the network the Hippo signaling pathway operates in differs between these two functions which in turn changes the behavior of the Hippo signaling pathway. This suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context. Thus, changing network topology can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the final output of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element. Such variation in strength of <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> has been shown to underlie between species variation in vulva cell fate patterning of Caenorhabditis worms.|$|E

50|$|In the spin-foam formalism, the Barrett-Crane model, {{which was}} for a while the most {{promising}} state-sum model of 4D Lorentzian quantum gravity, was based on representations of the noncompact groups SO(3,1) or SL(2,C), so the spin foam faces (and hence the spin <b>network</b> <b>edges)</b> were labelled by positive real numbers {{as opposed to the}} half-integer labels of SU(2) spin networks.|$|E
50|$|If a link becomes {{saturated}} to {{the point}} where there is a significant level of contention (either upstream or downstream) latency can rise substantially. Traffic shaping can be used to prevent this from occurring and keep latency in check. Traffic shaping provides a means to control the volume of traffic being sent into a network in a specified period (bandwidth throttling), or the maximum rate at which the traffic is sent (rate limiting), or more complex criteria such as GCRA. This control can be accomplished in many ways and for many reasons; however traffic shaping is always achieved by delaying packets. Traffic shaping is commonly applied at the <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> to control traffic entering the network, but can also be applied by the traffic source (for example, computer or network card) or by an element in the network.|$|E
5000|$|Dopamine is {{proposed}} {{to act as}} a [...] "global learning" [...] signal, critical to prediction of rewards and action reinforcement. In this way, dopamine is involved in a learning algorithm in which Actor, Environment and Critic are bound in a dynamic interplay that ultimately seeks to maximise the sum of future rewards by producing an optimal action selection policy. In this context, Critic and Actor are characterised as independent <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> that also from single Complex Agent. This Agent collectively influences the information state of the Environment, which is fed back to the Agent for future computations. Through a separate pathway, Environment is also fed back to Critic {{in the form of the}} reward gained though the given action, meaning an equilibrium can be reached between the predicted reward of given policy for a given state, and the evolving prospect of future rewards.|$|E

40|$|As the {{explosive}} growth of smart devices {{and the advent of}} many new applications, traffic volume has been growing exponentially. The traditional centralized network architecture cannot accommodate such user demands due to heavy burden on the backhaul links and long latency. Therefore, new architectures which bring network functions and contents to the <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> are proposed, i. e., mobile edge computing and caching. Mobile <b>edge</b> <b>networks</b> provide cloud computing and caching capabilities at the <b>edge</b> of cellular <b>networks.</b> In this survey, we make an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art research efforts on mobile <b>edge</b> <b>networks.</b> We first give an overview of mobile <b>edge</b> <b>networks</b> including definition, architecture and advantages.

40|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{increasing}} network utilization driven by new mobile clients, and to satisfy demand for new network services and performance guarantees, telecommunication service providers are exploiting virtualization over their network by implementing network services in virtual machines, decoupled from legacy hardware accelerated appliances. This effort, known as NFV, reduces OPEX and provides new business opportunities. At the same time, next generation mobile, enterprise, and IoT networks are introducing the concept of computing capabilities being pushed at the <b>network</b> <b>edge,</b> in close proximity of the users. However, the heavy footprint of today's NFV platforms prevents them from operating at the <b>network</b> <b>edge.</b> In this article, we identify the opportunities of virtualization at the <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> and present Glasgow Network Functions (GNF), a container-based NFV platform that runs and orchestrates lightweight container VNFs, saving core network utilization and providing lower latency. Finally, we demonstrate three useful examples of the platform: IoT DDoS remediation, on-demand troubleshooting for telco networks, and supporting roaming of network functions...|$|R

40|$|While SDN {{promises}} fine-grained, {{dynamic control}} of the network, in practice limited switch TCAM rule space restricts most forward-ing to be coarse-grained. As an alternative, we demonstrate that using destination MAC addresses as opaque forwarding labels al-lows an SDN controller to leverage large MAC (L 2) forwarding tables to manage a plethora of fine-grained paths. In this shadow MAC model, the SDN controller can install MAC rewrite rules at the <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> to guide traffic on to intelligently selected paths to balance traffic, avoid failed links, or route flows through mid-dleboxes. Further, by decoupling the <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> from the core, we address many other problems with SDN, including consistent network updates, fast rerouting, and multipathing with end-to-end control...|$|R

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{congestion}} {{due to the}} future bandwidth- hungry applications in domains such as Health care, Internet of Things (IoT), etc., we study the benefit of introducing additional Data Centers (DCs) closer to the <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> for the optimal application placement. Our study shows that the edge layer DCs in a Mobile <b>Edge</b> <b>Network</b> (MEN) infrastructure is cost beneficial for the bandwidth-hungry applications having their strong demand locality and in the scenarios where large capacity is deployed at the edge layer DCs. The cost savings for such applications can go up to 67 %. Additional intermediate layer DCs close to the root DC can be marginally cost beneficial for the compute intensive applications with medium or low demand locality. Hence, a Telecom Network Operator should start building an edge DC first having capacity up to hundreds of servers at the <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> to cater the emerging bandwidth- hungry applications and to minimize its operational cost...|$|R

40|$|Detection of the modular {{structure}} of biological networks {{is of interest}} to researchers adopting a systems perspective {{for the analysis of}} omics data. Computational systems biology has provided a rich array of methods for network clustering. To date, the majority of approaches address this task through a network node classification based on topological or external quantifiable properties of network nodes. Conversely, numerical properties of <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> are underused, even though the information content which can be associated with <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> has augmented due to steady advances in molecular biology technology over the last decade. Properly accounting for <b>network</b> <b>edges</b> in the development of clustering approaches can become crucial to improve quantitative interpretation of omics data. We present a novel technique for network module detection, named WG-Cluster (Weighted Graph CLUSTERing). WG-Cluster's notable features are the: (1) simultaneous exploitation of network node and edge weights to improve the biological interpretability of connected components detected, (2) assessment of their statistical significance, and (3) identification of emerging topological properties in the connected components. Applying WG-Cluster to a protein-protein network weighted by measurements of differential gene expression permitted to explore the changes in network topology under two distinct (normal vs tumour) conditions...|$|E

Today, however, users and content providers are demanding faster distribution of web content to end users. Also, many users are looking to their ISPs to provide additional content-oriented services, including filtering, security, personalization, and transformation services. At the same time, ISPs and other service providers are facing increased competition- which drives slimmer margins for basic access and data transport services. These recent developments suggest utilizing the existing <b>network</b> <b>edge</b> infrastructure as a platform for a new class of intelligent services.
