5|$|As well {{as being}} an {{important}} industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, <b>new</b> <b>construction</b> added approximately 137,000 square meters (1.5 million square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. More than 1,300 people move into the city daily, bolstering the economy by approximately 100 million Yuan.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, NC98 was rerouted in Durham: {{replacing}} the old alignment to US15 Bus./US501 Bus. via Miami Boulevard and Geer Street, to Holloway Street (westbound)/Chapel Hill Street-Liberty Street (eastbound) and its current western terminus. In 1978, NC98 replaced part of US64's routing {{to its current}} eastern terminus. In 1981, part of NC98 was abandoned and placed on <b>new</b> <b>construction</b> {{as a result of}} the creation of Falls Lake; remnants of the old alignment that were not submerged became secondary roads. In 2006, NC98 was rerouted south along US1 and onto a new four-lane bypass south of Wake Forest to Jones Dairy Road; its old alignment becoming NC98 Business. In 2011, NC98 was removed from US1 and placed onto <b>new</b> <b>construction</b> east of Falls of Neuse Road; NC98 Business was also realigned, starting further east along a new alignment of Durham Road.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1755 earthquake, Boston and its {{surrounding}} towns have become a major metropolitan area. Much <b>new</b> <b>construction</b> has been built on infill, especially in the Back Bay area, which may be prone to greater shaking and to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill. Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick, {{and are likely to}} collapse completely during a major earthquake. Given this, modern observers have expressed concern about the effects of another quake in such a major city. A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds. As a consequence, the state has updated building codes and zoning laws to require that <b>new</b> <b>construction</b> and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|A <b>new</b> <b>construction</b> {{technique}} {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E
5|$|According {{to other}} reports, a {{motivating}} factor was {{the desire to}} establish a historic district in Ypsilanti, to prevent the city from replacing historic buildings on North Huron Street and in Depot Town with <b>new</b> <b>construction.</b> A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival.

5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. Economic problems became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued {{to discriminate against}} blacks. Though new projects such as the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as <b>new</b> <b>construction</b> slowed due to diversion of efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E
5|$|For {{nearly a}} decade, no <b>new</b> <b>construction</b> took place.

Following completion of this first contract, a second contract was awarded for the remaining distance north to Century Road (Regional Road8).|$|E
5|$|From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni {{organised}} {{a series}} of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs.

A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall. The Jews protested and tensions increased.|$|E

5|$|<b>New</b> <b>construction</b> almost halted {{when the}} Great Depression {{began in the}} 1930s. As a result, there are few {{buildings}} in the district in that era's architectural styles. The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The enameled metal facade on a Third Street storefront, dating to 1940, makes it the only building in the district to show any trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|E
