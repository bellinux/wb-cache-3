40|$|The International Health Regulations (IHR), an {{international}} law {{under the auspices}} of the World Health Organization (WHO), mandates that <b>countries</b> <b>notify</b> other <b>countries</b> of "travelers under public health observation.

Given that countries have preidentified focal points as points of contacts for sharing of public health information, notifications could be made by CDC to a trusted public health recipient in another country within 24 hours of receipt of the traveler's information from a US health department.

40|$|The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{and other}} climate {{patterns}} can have profound {{impacts on the}} occurrence of infectious diseases ranging from dengue to cholera. In Africa, El Niño conditions are associated with increased rainfall in East Africa and decreased rainfall in southern Africa, West Africa, {{and parts of the}} Sahel. Because of the key role of water supplies in cholera transmission, a relationship between El Niño events and cholera incidence is highly plausible, and previous research has shown a link between ENSO patterns and cholera in Bangladesh. However, there is little systematic evidence for this link in Africa. Using high-resolution mapping techniques, we find that the annual geographic distribution of cholera in Africa from 2000 to 2014 changes dramatically, with the burden shifting to continental East Africa-and away from Madagascar and portions of southern, Central, and West Africa-where almost 50, 000 additional cases occur during El Niño years. Cholera incidence during El Niño years was higher in regions of East Africa with increased rainfall, but incidence was also higher in some areas with decreased rainfall, suggesting a complex relationship between rainfall and cholera incidence. Here, we show clear evidence for a shift in the distribution of cholera incidence throughout Africa in El Niño years, likely mediated by El Niño's impact on local climatic factors. Knowledge of this relationship between cholera and climate patterns coupled with ENSO forecasting could be used to <b>notify</b> <b>countries</b> in Africa when they are likely to see a major shift in their cholera risk...|$|R

The immunity against poliomyelitis was evaluated by neutralizing antibody titration in tissue culture microplates. Results Seropositivity (neutralising antibodies titre ≥ 8) for polioviruses 1, 2 and 3 was detected in 100 %, 99. 8 % and 99. 4 % of collected sera. Antibody titres were not lower in subjects who received either four doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) or a sequential schedule consisting of two doses of IPV and two of oral polio vaccine than in subjects who received four doses of OPV. Conclusion These results confirmed current data of vaccine coverage for poliomyelitis: during the last ten years in Apulia, the coverage in 24 months old children was more than 90 %. The high level of immunization found confirms the effectiveness both of the sequential schedule IPV-OPV and of the schedule all-IPV.

40|$|This study tested if the {{exclusive}} procuring and pricing policies of two {{state trading enterprises}} (STEs) in international malting barley markets {{could be used in}} a strategic trade context. The research provided four key findings. First, the global malting barley market operated in a quantity-setting oligopolistic structure during the study years. Second, both STEs and other exporting countries were in Cournot competition and thus made available strategic trade possibilities. Third, initial commodity payments were too high to generate a rent-shifting outcome. Fourth, product differentiation was confirmed, which may have dampened the desire/ability of STEs to pursue a rent-shifting objective. Key words: market structure, product differentiation, state trading enterprises. As early as 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) acknowledged state trading enterprises (STEs) as legiti-mate participants in international trade. The World Trade Organization (WTO) defines STEs as “government and nongovernmental enterprises, including marketing boards, which have been granted exclusive or special rights or privileges, including statutory or constitu-tional powers, in the exercise of which they influence through purchases or sales the level or direction of imports or exports ” (USDA 1997). Because STEs may be privately owned, the defining consideration is thus not gover-nance but exclusive privileges. State trading is more prevalent in agriculture than in other economic sectors.

40|$|Ad valorem {{equivalents}} of {{non-tariff measures}} Non-tariff measures (NTMs) {{are complex and}} varied, as emphasized in the report. To fully understand their possible consequences, a case study would be needed {{for each type of}} NTM for each product or group of products. This is not a practicable option for a macroeconomic assessment such as the one provided in the simulation exercise presented in the report. Instead, the best suited approach in this case is to rely upon AVEs in order to capture the essence of their possible economic impact. This approach is customary for such large-scale economic assessments of NTMs (see e. g. Kee et al., 2009) : it relies upon strong but well identified simplifying assumptions, discussed and tested in an extensive literature, and no credible alternative exists at this point, {{to the best of our}} knowledge. Yet, this method is subject to several caveats, worth keeping in mind while interpreting the results:- First, a dummy variable is used for coding the NTM and set to one if the importing <b>country</b> <b>notifies</b> at least one SPS or one TBT measure on a given product (0 otherwise). This treatment, customary in studies on this issue, does not take into account the number of NTMs set by the importer on a product (provided it is larger than zero), nor their degree of restrictiveness. - Second, only NTMs that have been effectively notified (not every NTM is) by importing countries to the WTO up to the end of 2012 are taken into account. - Third, since the product codes are often missing in the WTO data, we use the ones provided by the Centre for WTO Studies of the Indian Institute of Foreign Trad...|$|R
