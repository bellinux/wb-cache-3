40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{presented}} which indicates that the protective action of dogs' sera in irradiation of pancreatin solutions with ultraviolet light {{is the result of}} a competitive absorption (screening action). A similar effect is found in simple pancreatin solutions for which we may account (at least to a first approximation) on the basis of assumed homogeneous absorption by a strong competitor in the solution for the radiations having inactivating power. These observations are of interest in connection with the theory of what has been called <b>negative</b> <b>catalysis,</b> especially in view of the marked effects of small quantities of the protecting substances...|$|E
40|$|We study {{symmetry}} {{breaking and}} gap generation for fermions in the 2 D space of constant negative curvature (the Lobachevsky plane) in an external covariantly constant magnetic field in a four-fermion model. It is shown {{that due to}} the magnetic and <b>negative</b> curvature <b>catalysis</b> phenomena the critical coupling constant is zero {{and there is a}} symmetry breaking condensate in the chiral limit even in free theory. We analyze solutions of the gap equation in the cases of zero, weak, and strong magnetic fields. As a byproduct we calculate the density of states and the Hall conductivity for noninteracting fermions that may be relevant for studies of graphene. Comment: 12 pages, no figure...|$|R
40|$|A Shuttle-compatible {{systems design}} {{based on the}} core concept of {{attachable}} modules for the major vehicle components is proposed. The principal features include a disposable cargo/extra-propellant tank module; a porous, radiative, backscattering drag-brake surface material of thin silica cloth; and a lightweight carbon-composite support structure. The mission payload capability for delivery, retrieval, and combined operations is determined for {{a broad range of}} missions including NASA/DOD requirements and extending through cis-lunar space. The effects of finite-rate surface <b>catalysis,</b> <b>negative</b> lift, and multiple atmospheric passes in reducing the aerothermal heating rates are also investigated. In addition, the structural and thermal-protection problems of the drag-brake support apparatus are analyzed and recommendations are proposed for future design refinements...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous chiral {{symmetry}} {{breaking in}} early molecular networks Ran Kafri † 1, 2, Omer Markovitch † 1 and Doron Lancet * 1 Background: An important facet of early biological evolution is {{the selection of}} chiral enantiomers for molecules such as amino acids and sugars. The origin of this symmetry breaking is a long-standing question in molecular evolution. Previous models addressing this question include particular kinetic properties such as autocatalysis or <b>negative</b> cross <b>catalysis.</b> Results: We propose here a more general kinetic formalism for early enantioselection, based on our previously described Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain (GARD) model for prebiotic evolution in molecular assemblies. This model is adapted here {{to the case of}} chiral molecules by applying symmetry constraints to mutual molecular recognition within the assembly. The ensuing dynamics shows spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, with transitions towards stationary compositional states (composomes) enriched with one of the two enantiomers for some of the constituent molecule types. Furthermore, {{one or the other of}} the two antipodal compositional states of the assembly also shows time-dependent selection. Conclusion: It follows that chiral selection may be an emergent consequence of early catalytic molecular networks rather than a prerequisite for the initiation of primeval life processes. Elaborations of this model could help explain the prevalent chiral homogeneity in present-day living cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} a series of studies (2) made {{recently}} has been to elucidate the mechanism of the so-called promoter action on reactions taking place in homogeneous systems. The reactions chosen for this purpose were the catalytic decompositions of hydrogen peroxide as effected by various salts. Hydrogen peroxide was selected because its decomposition products, oxygen and water, have no effect upon the reaction, and because the mechanism of some of its catalytic decompositions are well enough known to admit of the study of the anomalous effects observed when two or more catalysts are present at once. Sometimes the effect of mixed catalysts is the sum of their separate effects, as when hydrogen peroxide is decomposed by sols of platinum and gold. (3) However, in many cases, the total effect is much greater than the sum of the individual effects; one of the catalysts being then said to exert a promoter action. In other cases, the resultant effect is less than the sum of the individual effects, and one of the substances is then said to produce <b>negative</b> <b>catalysis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ferrus iron {{oxidation}} {{by growing}} cultures of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans was sensitive to <b>negative</b> <b>catalysis</b> (inhibition) by selected oxyanios of sulfur. The relative order of negative catalytic activity for the sulfoxyanions was S_ 20 _ 5 ^(2 -) > S_ 20 _ 3 ^(2 -) > S_ 20 _ 4 ^(2 -) > S_ 40 _ 6 ^(2 -). Inhibition by the sulfoxyanions was greater at μm 1. 5 than at pH 2. 0. A mechanism involving {{the formation of}} radical intermediates, HO_ 2,-OH, HSO_ 3, HSO_ 5, H_ 2 O_ 4, and HS_ 3 O_ 3, induced by Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexes is proposed {{to account for the}} observed inhibitory effects. Orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and tripolyphosphate compounds were also inhibitory to ferrous iron oxidation by T. ferrooxidans. Orthophosphates were increasingly at high concentrations (200 - 300 mM) whereas the apparent toxicity of pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate was inversely related to concentration over the range of 50 - 300 mM with no apparent at pH dependency at pH ≤ 2. Equilibrium models are presented to explain the relative effect of the phosphates in terms of phosphate precipitates, which were actually observed, and soluble complexes, which {{have an effect on the}} thermodynamics of electron transfer...|$|E
40|$|Reactions of {{transient}} species photogenerated from 6 -R- 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydroquinolines (TMDQ) {{are very}} sensitive to medium variation. In anhydrous organic solvents, aminyl radicals were generated. They decay in the reaction of dimerization with the second-order rate constant decreasing in a row heptane>benzene> 2 -propanol. When passing from organic solvents to water, methanol, and water-alcohol solutions, the kinetics and the direction of the reaction crucially change. As a result of the photolysis, the product of the addition of a solvent to the double bond of heterocycle, 4 -hydroxy- or 4 -methoxy- 6 -R- 2, 2, 4 - tetramethyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroquinoline is formed in water and methanol, respectively. The transformation is a complex reaction, and the formation of excited transient species is followed by a sequence of first-order and pseudo-first-order reactions. Unlike the photolysis in anhydrous organic solvents, the reaction in water and methanol does not involve aminyl radicals. In aqueous solutions, the first-order rate constants for the decay of transient species are higher in acidic and neutral solutions. At the pH close to pKa of the transient species, it drops, indicating that the neutral form is less reactive. The same product is formed over the whole range of pH. For the anionic surfactant (SDS) in acidic and alkaline solutions, the apparent rate constant in the micellar solutions is lower than that in the aqueous (<b>negative</b> micellar <b>catalysis).</b> At the medium pH, a positive micellar catalysis is observed, and the rate constant of the decay depends linearly on the concentration of TMDQ in the micelles, indicative of the direct reaction between TMDQ and the cationic transient species...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Streptococcus salivarius is {{a common}} {{commensal}} of the oral mucosa, associated with infections in different sites. Meningitis due to this species are described in a few occasions. In this study refer to a case recently diagnosed in our hospital for treatment of a subsequent dental caries. Case report. A man of 35 years, presents {{to the emergency room}} with fever, headache, confusion, marked nuchal rigor. Anamnesis is the treatment of dental caries on the previous day. The blood count showed 24. 7 x 109 / L with WBC 22. 9 x 109 / L (92. 9 %) neutrophils. The lumbar puncture CSF noted cloudy with 15. 0 x 109 / L WBC, glicorrachia 5 g / L, protidorrachia 6. 5 g / L. Microscopic examination showed numerous granulocytes and prevalence of Gram-positive cocci. The pneumococcal antigen was negative. The blood cultures before starting antibiotic therapy, were negative. CSF was isolated from the culture of a Streptococcus salivarius. To antibiotic therapy started in the ED, after lumbar puncture is associated with the Ampicillin Ceftriaxone and continued for 15 days to improve the patient’s general condition, then resigned in the 17 th day. Materials and methods. From CSF inoculated in blood agar plates and chocolate agar alpha hemolytic colonies were isolated, <b>catalysis</b> <b>negative,</b> optochin resistant. The biochemical identification performed with Phoenix (BD) and confirmed by PCR Pan bacterial (16 S rDNA) bacterial strain identified as Streptococcus salivarius. The antibiogram performed with Phoenix (BD) according to the CLSI guidelines indicated sensitivity to penicillin, vancomycin, cefotaxime, cefepime, and chloramphenicol. Conclusions. Meningitis by Streptococcus salivarius was found in a few cases, mainly related to the transmission of health personnel from the oral cavity during lumbar punctures performed without the use of surgical masks. The following bacterial meningitis in dental treatment having a low incidence and often fatal course be suspected by history. The patient should be further investigated because the infection may indicate a compromised immune unknown (Diabetes, HIV [...] .) ...|$|R
