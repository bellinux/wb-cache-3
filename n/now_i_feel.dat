5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{announced}} on 8 April 2008 on Blue Peter that after three and half {{years with the}} show, he would be leaving {{at the end of}} the current series in June. His spokeswoman said he had always planned to leave when he turned 30. Jones said, [...] "I've had a career on Blue Peter that you wouldn't even dream about and for that I feel privileged and fortunate. ... I've loved it, lived it ... and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> the time is right to leave it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I wrote American Life, I {{was very}} {{agitated}} {{by what was}} going on in the world around me, [...] I was angry. I had a lot to get off my chest. I made a lot of political statements. But <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that I just want to have fun; I want to dance; I want to feel buoyant. And I want to give other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know of {{no reason}} why you should not know it <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> suspect--indeed, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> morally certain--that the man who murdered my father was Arthur Bastow." ...|$|R

500|$|Reid {{seems to}} have joined with the other Household members in {{complaining}} about the Munshi, for the Queen wrote to him, [...] "I thought you stood between me and them, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that you chime in with the rest." [...] In 1899, members of the Household again insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party when the Queen took her annual holiday at Cimiez. The Queen duly had Karim remain at Windsor, then when the party had settled into the Excelsior Regina hotel, wired Karim to come and join them.|$|E
500|$|Cho's {{older sister}} {{prepared}} {{a statement on}} her family's behalf to apologize publicly for her brother's actions, in addition to lending prayers to the victims and {{the families of the}} wounded and killed victims.

[...] "We never could have envisioned that he was capable of so much violence." [...] Cho's grandfather stated, [...] "My grandson Seung-Hui was very shy. I can't believe he did such a thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Getzlaf {{served as}} Canada's captain at the 2012 World Championship. He {{tied for second}} in team scoring with nine points in eight games. However, Canada was {{eliminated}} in the quarterfinal against Slovakia, 4–3. [...] Getzlaf was assessed a major penalty and game misconduct {{late in the game}} for kneeing Juraj Mikúš. A dejected Getzlaf lamented the result and his penalty following the game: [...] "It hurts like hell right <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like I let the guys down. To be in a hard-fought game like that and play the tournament we did and lose in that fashion, it's not easy to swallow as a group." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} to give up the office," [...] {{answered}} my father. [...] "Without him there's not enough to keep it going. He was quite good-tempered about the matter--offered to divide the work, letting me retain the straightforward portion for whatever that might be worth.

500|$|After {{losing his}} job at Kentucky, Collier said he was unsure {{what he would do}} next. [...] "Right <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> I would like to remain in {{football}} if the opportunity presents itself," [...] he said. Two weeks later, Brown brought him back onto the Cleveland Browns staff as an offensive assistant. Collier and Brown had remained close friends during his time at Kentucky.

Brown praised Collier's teaching and called him a [...] "scientific football man" [...] and [...] "one of my closest friends".|$|E
500|$|Concerned {{about the}} plight of fellow ex-servicemen, whose {{businesses}} were often failing, Gellibrand banded together with like-minded individuals to form the Hobart Remembrance Club. This organisation aimed to support ex-servicemen by providing employment and support for their businesses. The Hobart Club inspired the formation of Legacy Australia in Melbourne, which over time became a national movement, expanding its scope to the care of ex-servicemen's widows and their families. The Hobart Club did not join Legacy until 1940, but Charles Bean wrote in 1944 that [...] "coming back to the great and good man from whose original work it all sprang—there was a time when some of us thought that the best monument to John Gellibrand might be the story of Second Bullecourt. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> there will be an even better—the record of Legacy." ...|$|E
500|$|At times Kiedis {{has also}} resented singing the song, {{especially}} during instances {{when he felt}} distanced from the song's lyrics. In the past few years, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: [...] "Although {{there have been times}} when I was over , I've rediscovered it and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song." [...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A lot of the time that is one of the ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E

500|$|Hunt {{approached}} the recording sessions differently than on his previous records. Rather than guiding personnel through replicating his demos for the album, he allowed {{members of his}} backing band to improvise their parts. For most songs, Hunt recorded with drummer Ruth Price, percussionist and engineer Melissa Mattey, and keyboardist and programmer Peter Dyer. Price and Dyer had auditioned {{for him at the}} Musicians Institute in Hollywood and had previously toured with Hunt. He rehearsed with Price for approximately two weeks before recording the final tracks in order to adjust to more rock-based dynamics, including a different set of tempos, chord changes, and faster time cadences, that he wanted for the songs. Price was adept in playing both loose and tight drumming styles for certain songs. Hunt and his band were inspired by recording artists Curtis Mayfield and Iggy Pop, who he said [...] "brought this kind of intelligence along with the rawness. It was really bold. They just didn't give a shit. I was like, that's the attitude that I'm feeling right <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like I've finally shed the music that I grew up with." ...|$|E

I wrote it about the strength of rising after the fall and I’m thankful to be able share it." [...] In an interview for Next Magazine, Lewis further elucidated upon the songs meaning: [...] "It was like coming from a place where you’ve been through a hard situation that has really made you reflect or look deep inside {{to figure out what it}} is that you want to do next," [...] said Lewis. [...] "I had that breakthrough where <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> strong in what I’m doing and strong in my decisions. I’m back and I’m ready to go for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{clinching}} win in {{the second}} match, Racquets player-coach Roche admitted he didn't think it would mean quite so much to win the first World Team Tennis championship. Roche said, [...] "It's great. I'd compare it to a Davis Cup team effort. We started off with a lousy record. Something like 2 and 8. Everybody felt team pressure. Then one night after a loss to Los Angeles, we all went out, had a few beers, and decided to relax. It paid off, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peppino’s mother, Felicia Bartolotta Impastato, {{reacted to}} the {{conviction}} in a very dignified manner: [...] "I never have had any feelings of revenge.

On 11 August, Kierkegaard wrote: [...] "My father died on Wednesday (the 8th) at 2:00a.m. I so deeply desired {{that he might have}} lived a few years more... Right <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> there is only one person (E. Boesen) with whom I can really talk about him. He was a 'faithful friend.'"
