5|$|Freeway {{construction}} had {{its impact}} on the city, with neighborhoods disrupted and housing stock lost. Between 1963 and 1975, Interstate 35W from the south border of the city to its northeastern corner, Interstate 94 from the St. Paul border into downtown, and the Crosstown (County Road 62, later to become Minnesota State Highway 62) on the southern boundary of Minneapolis were built. The remaining portion of Interstate 94, from U.S. Highway 12 to the northern boundary of the city, was completed in 1982. Highway 12 was later rebuilt to Interstate standards in 1992, at which point it was renumbered Interstate 394. Several proposed projects <b>never</b> <b>were</b> built, though. Minnesota State Highway 55, running southeast from downtown to the Fort Snelling area and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, was slated to become a freeway, but the upgrade was canceled due to neighborhood opposition. Similarly, a proposed Interstate 335 was to run from Interstate 35W in northeast Minneapolis to a connection with Interstate 94 just north of downtown. This project was also canceled due to neighborhood opposition.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the seven deaths, 15 people (police, New Libyans, and bystanders) were injured in the shootout.

The couple lived together at Dane's Beverly Hills home, until November 1928, when Valdemar moved out.

25|$|The flow of {{immigrants}} continued {{at a steady}} pace from the 1840s until cut off by World War I. The largest numbers came from Ireland and Britain before 1890, and after that from Quebec, Italy and Southern Europe. The immigrants filled the ranks of factory workers, craftsmen and unskilled laborers. The Irish assumed a larger and larger role in the Democratic Parts in the cities and statewide, while the rural areas remained Republican. Yankees left the farms, which <b>never</b> <b>were</b> highly productive; many headed west, while others became professionals and businessmen in the New England cities.|$|E

The Razorbacks <b>never</b> <b>were</b> within {{striking}} distance, as the Tide jumped {{out to a}} 14–0 lead, the first touchdown being an 80-yard scamper by Williams on the first play from scrimmage. A Crimson Tide field goal and Matt Jones TD run pushed the score to 17–7, but the Razorbacks could not penetrate the end zone again, as the two teams swapped field goals. A fourth quarter 50-yard touchdown pass from Brodie Croyle finished the Hogs, who tacked on an intentional safety to make the final 30–12.|$|E
25|$|The viceroy had to {{overcome}} the distance and poor communication with the royal court in Madrid. It proved almost impossible for the Spanish viceroys both {{to comply with the}} demands of the crown and to satisfy the aspirations of the Sicilians — a situation that also was apparent in Spain's colonies in Latin America. The viceroys secured territorial control and sought to guarantee the loyalty of vassals through distributing patronage in the form of offices and grants {{in the name of the}} king. The monarchy, however, also exercised its power through royal counsels and independent entities, such as the agents of the Inquisition and visitadores or inspectors. Local spheres of royal influence <b>never</b> <b>were</b> clearly defined, and various local political entities within the viceregal system competed for power, rendering Sicily often ungovernable.|$|E

Although Béguin was sentenced for his aforementioned formal misconduct, he was never charged for his actions as commandant of the penal camp from spring 1941 to September 1945. For the crimes in the penal camp Wauwilermoos, the responsible authorities <b>never</b> <b>were</b> accused. Only in 1949 internees, according to the Geneva Convention, received {{the same rights as}} prisoners of war.

Kaspar Villiger apologized on the occasion of an official visit by Dan Culler in 1995. For 70 years, no memorial reminded of the horrors in the prison camp until a plaque was installed in late 2015.|$|E

Guizot, however, was already unpopular with the more advanced liberal party. He remained unpopular all his life. Yet <b>never</b> <b>were</b> his great abilities more useful to his country than while he filled this office of secondary rank but of primary importance in the department of public instruction. The duties it imposed on him were entirely congenial to his literary tastes, and he was master of the subjects they concerned.
