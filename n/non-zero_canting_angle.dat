In the parametric analytical studies NACA series of airfoils are selected. Basic design of the winglet is selected from the literature and flow features of the entire wing including the winglet tip effects have been examined with different <b>cant</b> <b>angles</b> varying from 150 to 600 at different angles of attack up to 140. We have observed, among the cases considered in this study that a case, with 150 <b>cant</b> <b>angle</b> the aerodynamics performance of the subsonic aircraft during takeoff was found better up to an angle of attack of 2. 80 and further its performance got diminished at higher angles of attack. Analyses further revealed that increasing the winglet <b>cant</b> <b>angle</b> from 150 to 600 at higher angles of attack could negate the performance deterioration and additionally it could enhance the peak CL/CD on the order of 3. 5 %. The investigated concept of variable-cant-angle winglets appears to be a promising alternative for improving the aerodynamic efficiency of aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of the kagome-ice insulator against the three dimensionality and the <b>canting</b> <b>angle</b> of the spin anisotropy axes is studied numerically using the exact diagonalization method. The kagome-ice insulator, which was recently found at 2 / 3 electron filling in the double-exchange model on a kagome lattice, is a Chern insulator showing a quantized Hall response {{despite the absence of}} magnetic long-range order. We find that this peculiar state remains stable when the lattice is extended to three dimensions in an anisotropic pyrochlore lattice in the weak interlayer coupling region. On the other hand, we show that the kagome-ice insulator is also stable against the change of the <b>canting</b> <b>angle.</b> Furthermore, we find another kagome-ice insulator at 1 / 3 filling in a different range of the <b>canting</b> <b>angle.</b> Our results indicate that the quantum anomalous Hall response is widely observed in the variants of the kagome-ice double-exchange systems.

40|$|For {{the past}} four decades, Mars {{missions}} have relied on Viking heritage technology for supersonic descent. Extending the use of propulsion, which is required for Mars subsonic deceleration, into the supersonic regime allows the ability to land larger payload masses. Wind tunnel and computational experiments on subscale supersonic retropropulsion models have shown a complex aerodynamic flow field characterized by the interaction of underexpanded jet plumes exhausting from nozzles on the vehicle with the supersonic freestream. Understanding the impact of vehicle and nozzle configuration on this interaction is critical for analyzing {{the performance of a}} supersonic retropropulsion system, as deceleration will have components provided by both the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle and thrust from the nozzles. This investigation focuses on the validity of steady state computational approaches to analyze supersonic retropropulsion flowfield structures and their effect on vehicle aerodynamics. Wind tunnel data for a single nozzle and a multiple nozzle configuration are used to validate a steady state, turbulent computational fluid dynamics approach to modeling supersonic retropropulsion. An analytic approximation to determine plume and bow shock structure in the flow field is also developed, enabling rapid assessment of flowfield structure for use in improved grid generation and as a configuration screening tool. Results for both the computational fluid dynamics and analytic approaches show good agreement with the experimental datasets. Potential limitations of the two methods are identified based on the comparisons with available data. Six additional geometries are defined to investigate the extensibility of the analytical model and determine the variation of supersonic retropropulsion performance with configuration. These validation geometries are split into two categories: three geometries with nozzles located on the vehicle forebody at varying nozzle <b>cant</b> <b>angles,</b> and three geometries with nozzles located on the vehicle aftbody at varying nozzle <b>cant</b> <b>angles</b> and number of nozzles. The forebody nozzle configurations show that nozzle <b>cant</b> <b>angle</b> is a significant driver in performance of a vehicle employing supersonic retropropulsion. Aerodynamic drag preservation for a given thrust level increases with increasing <b>cant</b> <b>angle.</b> However, increasing the <b>cant</b> <b>angle</b> reduces the contribution of thrust to deceleration. The tradeoff between these two contributions to the deceleration force is examined, noting that performance improvements are possible with modest nozzle <b>cant</b> <b>angles.</b> Static pitch stability characteristics are investigated for the lowest and highest <b>cant</b> <b>angle</b> configurations. The aftbody nozzle configuration results show that removing the plume flow from the region forward of the vehicle results in less interaction with the bow shock structure. This impacts aerodynamic performance, as the surface pressure remains relatively undisturbed for all thrust values examined. Static pitch stability characteristics for each of the aftbody nozzle configurations are investigated; noting that supersonic retropropulsion for these configurations exhibits a transition point from static stability to instability as a function of this center of mass location along the axis.

Contrary to previous reports, only one spin <b>canting</b> <b>angle</b> of Cr ions was observed. The spin <b>canting</b> <b>angles</b> of Mn and Cr ions in the ferrimagnetic spiral obtained at a liquid-He temperature were 43 ° and 110 °, respectively. The nuclear spin-spin relaxation {{was determined by the}} Suhl-Nakamura interaction at low temperatures but the relaxation rate T 2 - 1 increases rapidly as the temperature approaches T s. This indicates that the fluctuation of the spiral component becomes faster as the temperature increases but not fast enough to leave an averaged hyperfine field to nuclei in the time scale of nuclear spin precession in the ferrimagnetic phase, which is on the order of 10 - 8 s. The spiral volume fraction measured for various temperatures reveals that the collinear and the spiral ferrimagnetic phases are mixed below the transition temperature of the spiral order. The temperature hysteresis in the volume fraction implies that this transition has first-order characteristics. &# 169; 2010 The American Physical Society. open 3...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explore relationships between the microphysical properties of precipitation and optimal polarizations. The dependence of three optimal polarization parameters (asymmetry ratio A, optimal tilt tau(sub op), and optimal ellipticity epsilon(sub op) on the reflectivity-weighted mean drop shape, mean <b>canting</b> <b>angle,</b> and standard deviation of a Gaussian <b>canting</b> <b>angle</b> distribution is studied. This is accomplished by using computer simulations that provide the rms scattering matrix for an ensemble of canted drops with a prescribed two-parameter <b>canting</b> <b>angle</b> distribution. Also examined are the effects of propagation on the polarization parameters for nonattenuating wavelengths. The asymmetry ratio A is simply {{the ratio of the}} maximal to minimal total backscattered energy (ratio of the largest and smallest eigenvalue of the Graves power matrix G is identically equal to S dagger S). Similar to Z(sub DR), this ratio decreases with increasing mean axial ratio, but unlike Z(sub DR), it is not affected by canting (for a single drop). The dependence of A on the reflectivity-weighted mean drop shape is examined, and a power-law relationship similar to that which exists for Z(sub DR) is established. The asymmetry ratio A can be regarded as a generalization of Z(sub DR) because it requires only a measurement of linear depolarization ratio (in addition to Z(sub DR)), is independent of the propagation phase, and is less sensitive to canting. In a similar manner, the dependence of optimal ellipticity and tilt on the microphysical parameters is studied. In particular, it appears that the rms tilt of the optimal polarization ellipse is proportional to the variance of the <b>canting</b> <b>angle</b> distribution. Several other promising relationships between optimal polarizations and the microphysical variables of an ensemble of hydrometeors are also discussed...|$|R
