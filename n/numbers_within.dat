5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in giant otter <b>numbers</b> <b>within</b> the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} giant otter range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter.|$|E

5|$|The {{moisture}} classification includes climatic {{classes with}} descriptors such as hyperhumid, humid, subhumid, subarid, semi-arid (values of −20 to −40), and arid (values below −40). Humid regions experience more precipitation than evaporation each year, while arid regions experience greater evaporation than precipitation {{on an annual}} basis. A total of 33percent of the Earth's landmass is considered either arid or semi-arid, including southwest North America, southwest South America, most of northern and {{a small part of}} southern Africa, southwest and portions of eastern Asia, as well as much of Australia. Studies suggest that precipitation effectiveness (PE) within the Thornthwaite moisture index is overestimated in the summer and underestimated in the winter. This index can be effectively used to determine the number of herbivore and mammal species <b>numbers</b> <b>within</b> a given area. The index is also used in studies of climate change.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{despite a}} level of war-weariness in Australia, <b>numbers</b> <b>within</b> the Citizens Force were {{maintained}} through voluntary recruitment and the compulsory training scheme, and due to strategic concerns around the expansion of Japanese naval power within the Pacific, {{there was a need}} to maintain a strong part-time military force. As a result, each infantry battalion within the brigade was able to report being at full strength, with over 1,000 men {{in each of the four}} battalions. However, in 1922 following the conclusion of the Washington Naval Treaty, which theoretically resolved Australia's security concerns, the decision was made to reduce the Army's budget and reduce the authorised strength of each battalion to 409 men.|$|E

25|$|During the Vietnam War, the A-3 attack {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} KA-3B tankers while some were modified into a multimission tanker variant, the EKA-3B, {{that was a}} real workhorse for the carrier air wing. Electronic jamming equipment was added without removing tanker capability so the EKA-3B could jam enemy radar while waiting to refuel tactical aircraft. Eventually, the EKA-3B was replaced by the smaller dedicated Grumman KA-6D Intruder tanker, which although it had less capacity and endurance, was deployed in greater <b>numbers</b> <b>within</b> the carrier's air wing. Two additional Naval Reserve units were established in the early 1970s as air refueling squadrons, VAQ-208 and VAQ-308, at NAS Alameda, California. Both units operated aircraft with electronic warfare equipment removed and were redesignated as KA-3Bs. VAK-208 and VAK-308 were decommissioned in the early 1990s.|$|E
