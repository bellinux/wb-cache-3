5|$|The Annal stone gives {{absolutely}} <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> of {{a division}} of the Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} that the Council of Chelsea {{approved}} Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, remained a bishop at its conclusion; he signed the council's report still as a bishop.

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{the fleet}} sent by Darius {{consisted}} of 600 triremes. There is <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> {{in the historical}} sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during Xerxes's invasion in 480 BC.

5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear.

There is <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this {{to the fact that}} the deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.|$|E
