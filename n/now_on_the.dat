5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. <b>Now</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Eastern front, the Junkers {{assisted}} Army Group Centre in its {{drive toward}} Moscow.

StG 77 finished the campaign as the most effective dive bomber wing. It had destroyed 2,401 vehicles, 234 tanks, 92 artillery batteries and 21 trains for the loss of 25 Ju 87s to hostile action. At the end of Barbarossa, StG 1 had lost 60 Stukas in aerial combat and one on the ground. StG 2 lost 39 Ju 87s in the air and two on the ground, StG 77 lost 29 of their dive-bombers in the air and three on the ground (25 to enemy action).

5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right <b>now.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
5|$|I-695 turns south past MD 43 and {{interchanges}} with US 1 (Belair Road) {{south of}} White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) {{a short distance}} after US 1 in Rossville. This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully directional interchange where the carriageways of both routes crossed over each other onto the opposite side, then crossed over each other again; {{at the site of}} each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional flyovers. In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were <b>now</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did).|$|E
5|$|Implementation of {{the plan}} will reduce waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until <b>now.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance. According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation {{of the plan}} will increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other things being equal).|$|E

5|$|In 1811, Bavaria legally {{defined the}} apothecaries' pound as 360.00g (an ounce of 30.00g). In 1815, Nuremberg lost {{its status as}} a free city and became part of Bavaria. From <b>now</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nuremberg apothecaries' pound was no longer the {{official}} apothecaries' pound in Nuremberg; but the difference was only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries' pound was officially defined by this standard, four years after Otto, the son of the king of Bavaria, became the first king of Greece. But only few German states followed the example of Bavaria, and with a long delay. The apothecaries' pound of 360g was also adopted in Lübeck, where it was official as of 1861.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{is passing}} through an ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial period. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from <b>now.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the North Korean Army at Pusan made communist continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone.

The North Koreans totally collapsed as a fighting force, and the remainder of their routed military retreated into North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force, which was <b>now</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered North Korean units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands {{to just a few}} hundred men.|$|E

The times of 3min 35.6s and 7min 59.5s, respectively, were world records.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati's kickoff {{after the}} {{touchdown}} {{was returned to}} the Virginia Tech 24-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their first offensive possession of the game. That play was a 27-yard run by wide receiver Dyrell Roberts, who ran an end-around for the big gain. <b>Now</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cincinnati side of the field, Virginia Tech running Back Darren Evans ran for one yard, then Hokies quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed a 34-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Coale. The catch gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Cincinnati 14-yard line. On the first play following the long completion, Evans was tackled for a six-yard loss, pushing the Hokies back to the Bearcats' 20-yard line. On the next two plays, Tyrod Taylor rushed {{for a total of}} 11yards, but was unable to gain another first down. Facing fourth down, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent kicker Dustin Keys into the game to attempt a 26-yard field goal. The kick sailed right of the uprights, however, and Virginia Tech was denied a scoring opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{carried out}} a second {{commission}} from Eusebi Güell between 1884 and 1887, the Güell Pavilions in Pedralbes, <b>now</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of Barcelona. Güell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarrià, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuyàs de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for}} the Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaudí undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real Cátedra Gaudí, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|E
