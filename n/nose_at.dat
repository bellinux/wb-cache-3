5|$|Banks {{broke his}} <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> Craven Cottage {{on the opening}} day of the 1962–63 season, in a 2–1 defeat by Fulham. Leicester went to chase a {{possible}} double, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals whilst lying top of the table in April. City beat Liverpool 1–0 at Hillsborough to reach the final, with Banks keeping a clean sheet despite his goal being under a near-constant siege from the Merseyside club. The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester's one, and Banks later stated that it was his finest performance at club level. Unluckily, Banks then broke a finger in a 2–1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, and was out injured as Leicester lost their final three league games, ending the season in a disappointing fourth place. In the 1963 FA Cup Final Banks {{and the rest of the}} team underperformed, and lost the game 3–1 to Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a {{challenge}} for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact that}} Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the start of the eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{served to}} protect Sutton Pool, {{which is where}} the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the {{establishment}} of Plymouth Dockyard. In 1512 an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth. A series of fortifications were built, including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers <b>Nose</b> <b>at</b> the south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596; it was the site of the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below).|$|E

In addition to suffering a broken <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the hands of the officers, Lifeson was tased six times. His son was also tased repeatedly.|$|E
25|$|The {{excitement}} and {{interest of the}} dying game now centred around the batting performance of Alan Knott. His last day survival {{was more than just}} occupation of the crease. Beginning the day without a run to his name, he consistently thumbed his <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the Australian attack for over three hours, playing shots even though he knew that his ship was sinking under his very feet. It was a magnificent solo effort of defiance.|$|E

25|$|During the feast, Mrs. Karvel asks Jaynes {{to bring}} out more dessert, and Sausage Nose and a child follow him inside the Biodome. The child dies in a river from the rat poison, and Sausage Nose realizes the trick that is being played on the Snow Honkies. He charges at Jaynes and is killed by an ax to the head, {{courtesy}} of Garth. To avoid suspicions of Sausage Nose going missing, Jaynes forces Garth into a robe and smears toothpaste {{on his face and}} hands. The Snow Honkies discover that something is amiss and that Garth is not Sausage <b>Nose</b> <b>at</b> all. The Snow Honkies begin to attack the humans when an earthquake occurs, killing all except Jaynes, Garth, and Pym.|$|E
25|$|Rats, {{like most}} mammals, also form family groups {{of a mother}} and her young. This applies to both groups of males and females. However, rats are {{territorial}} animals, meaning that they usually act aggressively or scared of strange rats. Rats will fluff up their hair, hiss, squeal, and move their tails around when defending their territory. Rats will chase each other, groom each other, sleep in group nests, wrestle with each other, have dominance squabbles, communicate, and play in various other ways with each other. Huddling is an additional important part of rat socialization. Huddling is often supposed to have a heat-conserving function. Nestling rats especially depend on heat from their mother, since they cannot regulate their own temperature. Huddling is an extreme form of herding. Other forms of interaction include: crawling under, which is literally the act of crawling underneath one another; walking over, also explained in the name; allo-grooming, so-called to distinguish it from self-grooming; and nosing, where a rat gently pushes with its <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> another rat near the neck.|$|E

500|$|After the Yankees won Game 2 at the Polo Grounds, the Series {{returned}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 3. Stengel won it, 1–0, {{on a home}} run into the right field bleachers. As the Yankee fans booed Stengel, he thumbed his <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the crowd and blew a kiss toward the Yankee players, outraging the team's principal owner, Jacob Ruppert, who demanded that Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis fine or suspend Stengel. Judge Landis declined, [...] "a man who wins two games with home runs may feel a little playful, especially if he's a Stengel". The Yankees won the next three games to take the Series; Stengel batted [...]417 in the six games, completing his World Series career as a player with a [...]393 batting average.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{ideas for}} the game were thought up by Warren Davis and Jeff Lee. The initial concept began when artist Jeff Lee drew a pyramid of cubes {{inspired}} by M. C. Escher. Lee felt a game could be derived from the artwork, and created an orange, armless main character. The character jumped along the cubes and shot projectiles, called [...] "mucus bombs", from a tubular <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> enemies. Enemies included a blue creature, later changed purple and named Wrong Way, and an orange creature, later changed green and named Sam. Lee had drawn similar characters since childhood, inspired by characters from comics, cartoons, Mad magazine and by artist Ed [...] "Big Daddy" [...] Roth. Q*bert's design later included a speech balloon with , [...] "", which Lee originally presented as a joke.|$|E

500|$|Pompeo's second {{contract}} with Grey's Anatomy expired after the eighth season, and speculation arose {{that she would}} be leaving subsequently. [...] In September 2011, Pompeo reported that she is open to the idea of extending her contract, if invited. She told TV Guide: [...] "I would never turn up my <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> [...] As long as the stories are honest and truthful, and Patrick [...] and I feel there is material for us to be passionate about, it still beats a 9-to-5 job any day.

Online reported in May 2012, that Pompeo, as well as all original cast members have signed on for two more years. With the Huffington Post announcement of season nine having officially been renewed, the contract is set into place for Pompeo to return.|$|E
500|$|Looking {{for a new}} {{headquarters}} Comcast asked Arden Group and Mariner Commercial Properties to {{work together}} and combine the properties into one building. The two developers briefly held discussions about combining the two sites, but by 2001 no agreement was reached and both developers had decided to move on with their own towers. As they sought to build competing condominium towers, {{the relationship between the two}} developers soon turned into a feud between the firm's lead partners, Craig Spencer of Arden Group and Tim Mahoney of Mariner Commercial Properties. In 2003 Mahoney received permission from the City Zoning Board of Adjustment to build a 50-story residential tower at the 1441 Chestnut Street site. At the zoning hearing Spencer attempted to block approval by saying the building was too tall and that it would damage his site by blocking views and casting shadows. He also said the tower was [...] "snubbing his <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the traditional zone of respect around City Hall." [...] Spencer filed a lawsuit to block construction of the building and a Court of Common Pleas ruled that the Zoning Board erred in approving 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner appealed the ruling.|$|E

She later said the serial was brave for tackling gay domestic violence.

She later expressed her view that [...] "Ste hasn’t experienced much normality in his young life". She concluded that Ste never seemed to have a trouble free day.

500|$|The {{small head}} of Massospondylus was {{approximately}} half {{the length of}} the femur. Numerous openings, or fenestrae, in the skull reduced its weight and provided space for muscle attachment and sensory organs. These fenestrae were present in pairs, one {{on each side of the}} skull. At the front of the skull were two large, elliptical nares, which were roughly half the size of the orbits. The orbits were proportionally larger in Massospondylus than in related genera, such as Plateosaurus. The antorbital fenestrae, smaller than those seen in Plateosaurus, were situated between the eyes and the <b>nose.</b> <b>At</b> the rear of the skull were two more pairs of temporal fenestrae: the lateral temporal fenestrae immediately behind the eye sockets, which were shaped like an inverted [...] "T" [...] in Massospondylus, and the supratemporal fenestrae on top of the skull. Small fenestrae also penetrated each mandible. The shape of the skull is traditionally restored as wider and shorter than that of Plateosaurus, but this appearance may be due just to differential crushing experienced by the various specimens. Some features of the skull are variable between individuals; for example, the thickness of the upper border of the orbit and the height of the posterior maxilla. These differences may be due to sexual dimorphism or individual variation.|$|E
