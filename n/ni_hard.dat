40|$|Abstract. Metallic glasses often undergo glass {{transitions}} {{at temperature}} Tg well below their crystallisation temperature T x and thus possess so-called super-cooled liquid temperature range ∆T = T x –Tg {{to which they}} can be heated in principle without crystallization. Metallic glass heated to its ∆T regime can be pressed onto a warm substrate to engrave selected patterns. The metallic glass surface then takes on a surface pattern that is the negative of that on the substrate. Subse-quently the initial pattern on the substrate can be reproduced on a third target surface at room temperature by cold pressing (punching) the negative pattern on the metallic glass surface onto the target surface. We report the transfer of arbitrary motifs initially on WC or <b>Ni</b> <b>hard</b> surfaces onto Al thin foils via creation of the negative of the pattern on a metallic glass stamp used for punching. 1...|$|E

40|$|With {{the ability}} of {{simultaneous}} transmissions, multi-channel multi-interface Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have emerged with great potential in the improvement of network throughput and fairness. However, most proposed channel assignment algorithms for WMNs made an assumption that the Network Interface Cards (NICs) are evenly assigned to the mesh routers. In this paper, we investigate the problems of NIC assignment and bandwidth allocation to minimize the infrastructure cost, and meanwhile guarantee the application requirements. We argue evenly assigning NICs to all routers is neither a necessary condition nor an effective solution, since not only the interference but also the traffic flows are important factors that will affect the parallel use of the bandwidth. One of the principal challenges addressing these problems is their interactive impact on the optimization of network throughput. By analyzing all kinds of constraints for traffic, NIC and performance, we formally define a problem space that addresses the relationships between different assignment and allocation problems.

The yield strength and fracture strength of the alloys increased with the ageing temperature and maximum at peakaged condition (1 hr at 225 oC) where as ductility and impact toughness decreased with ageing temperature reaching the minimum at the peakaged condition.

In Al-Si-Ni alloys where silicon and nickel have little solid solubility in α-aluminium and Si and <b>Ni</b> Al 3 <b>hard</b> phases are formed, the minimum bearing parameter decreased with the parameter V (The product of vol. % of hard phases in the disk and the shoe). Apparently the silicon and NiAl 3 particles provided discontinuities in the matrix and reduced the probability (1 − V) of the α-aluminium phase in the disk coming {{into contact with the}} α-aluminium phase in the shoe. The copper and magnesium containing Al-Si-Ni alloys with lesser volumes of hard phases exhibit considerably better seizure resistance indicating that a slight increase in the solute content or the hardness of the primary α-phase leads to a considerable increase in seizure resistance.

40|$|The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} Ni-P/SiC nanocomposite coatings annealed at different temperatures (350 – 500 °C) were investigated {{in order to}} determine the optimal temperature needed to enhance their wear resistance as well as to reveal the underlying wear mechanisms. With increasing annealing temperature, the hardness of the annealed coatings gradually decreased from 8. 2 ± 0. 5 to 7. 1 ± 0. 6 GPa as a result of the Hall-Petch effect, nevertheless these values obtained were constantly higher than that of the as-plated coating (6. 3 ± 0. 3 GPa) due to the formation of a <b>hard</b> <b>Ni</b> 3 P phase. Regarding to tribological properties, the Ni-P/SiC coating annealed at 350 °C presented a poorer wear resistance (6. 1 × 10 ? 5 mm 3 /Nm) compared to the as-plated coating (3. 9 × 10 ? 5 mm 3 /Nm) owing to a rougher original contact surface and the subsequent generation of nickel and iron oxides on the wear track. In contrast, coatings annealed at temperatures ranging between 400 – 500 °C exhibited the improved wear resistance (4. 3 × 10 ? 5 – 7. 8 × 10 ? 6 mm 3 /Nm) attributable to their smoother surfaces and to the lubrication effect of H 3 PO 4 arising from the tribochemical reaction between Ni 3 P and the environment.

40|$|The structural, {{mechanical}} and tribological properties of Ni-P/MWCNT coatings annealed at various temperatures (350 - 500 °C) were investigated using XRD, SEM, nanoindentation and tribometer {{to determine the}} optimal annealing temperature for their enhanced tribological properties. The {{results showed that the}} annealed coatings comprised a <b>hard</b> <b>Ni</b> 3 P phase, and consequently presented a higher hardness (from 7. 0 ± 0. 3 to 8. 2 ± 1. 4 GPa) than the as-plated sample (6. 0 ± 0. 9 GPa). With the annealing temperature increasing from 350 °C to 500 °C, the crystallinity of coating was enhanced with larger crystal grains of Ni and Ni 3 P, which led to a decline in hardness (from 8. 2 to 7. 0 GPa) due to the Hall-Petch effect. Owing to the lubrication effect of H 3 PO 4 arising from the tribochemical reaction of Ni 3 P with ambient environment, the annealed samples exhibited lower friction coefficients (0. 71 ~ 0. 86) compared to the as-plated coating (0. 87). A combination of low surface roughness and the reduction of oxides on wear track contributed to the lowest friction coefficient of Ni-P/MWCNT annealed at 400 °C. However, the decomposition of amorphous carbon in MWCNT over 380 °C produced less dense coatings (for annealing temperatures 400 - 500 °C), and their incompact structure led to a higher wear rate (2. 9 - 3. 0 × 10 - 5 mm 3 /Nm) compared to the as-plated sample (2. 4 × 10 - 5 mm 3 /Nm). In contrast, Ni-P/MWCNT coating annealed at 350 °C (< 380 °C) exhibited a better wear resistance (4. 3 × 10 - 6 mm 3 /Nm).

40|$|Metal cation {{adsorption}} is {{the predominant}} chemical mechanism governing the attenuation of toxic metal movement in soils. Clay minerals are the primary adsorbent surfaces in soils due to their ubiquitous nature and large reactive surface area. This study examined the relative affinity of the metals cadmium, nickel and zinc for the clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite. The influence which different mineral adsorbents and different complexing ligands in solution have on the adsorption of metal ions was assessed using the Hard-Soft Acid-Base Principle as a theoretical framework for predicting the maximum extent of adsorption and rate of adsorption. The HSAB principle is that hard bases prefer to complex hard acids and soft bases prefer to complex soft acids. The hypothesis that initiated these investigations was that the hard-soft character of mineral surfaces is due to their surface functional groups and can be measured using metal cation adsorption selectivity experiments where pH and complex ion formation are controlled. When complex ion formation in aqueous solution was minimized (i. e. in Ca(ClO₄) ₂), adsorption decreased {{in the order of}} decreasing softness, CD > Zn > Ni for both clay minerals. Montmorillonite behaved as a slightly harder Lewis base than kaolinite, sorbing the <b>harder</b> <b>Ni</b> and Zn ions {{to a greater extent than}} Cd, although both minerals behaved as soft Lewis bases. In the presence of chloride and sulfate ligands, adsorption sequences changed and reflected results from typical soil solution studies. In some cases the adsorption sequences can be explained using the HSAB principle together with computer speciation data and this approach merits further consideration and research. Adsorption over time and calculated adsorption rate constants were generally consistent with equilibrium selectivity data. Adsorption rates decreased in the order Cd > Zn > Ni in Ca(ClO₄) ₂ for both clay minerals. The adsorption curves reflect a two-step adsorption process involving a rapid exchange-type reaction followed by a much slower adsorption involving diffusion into the crystal or alteration of the surface through the formation of a new solid phase involving the adsorbed ions...|$|R
40|$|Electroless Ni-P {{coatings}} {{were obtained}} on steel substrates using different bath compositions, {{which lead to}} different phosphorous contents of the coatings. In this paper {{the effect of the}} P-content in the Ni-P coatings was experimentally studied on the thickness of the coating, on its nano-micro-structure and on its micro-hardness. The as-received samples were nano-crystalline (mostly amorphous according to XRD) and their micro-hardness was found to decrease with increasing the P-content. Upon annealing at 400 ◦C a new Ni 3 P phase was formed and the nano-cystalline Ni-rich grains coarsened to micro-grains. In this annealed state the micro-hardness was found to increase with increasing the P-content. A complex model was built to explain the experimental results. It was supposed that the as-received Ni-P coating contains almost pure Ni nano-grains surrounded by segregated P atoms; as the grain grows, its surface is covered more and more by the P atoms. When the grain is fully covered by the P atoms, further grain growth is inhibited and the coating can grow further only due to nucleation of a new grain. Thus, the size of the grains was found inversely proportional to the P-content of the Ni-P alloy. The need for a larger number of nucleation events with decreasing grain size explains why the coating has a smaller thickness for smaller grain size, i. e. higher P-content. The inverse Hall-Petch rule was found for the grain size dependence of micro-hardness of the as deposited samples due to the grain boundary sliding of relatively hard Ni-rich nano-crystals along the soft P atoms (higher P-content lead to lower micro-hardness through smaller grain size). After annealing the micro-hardness was found to increase with the volumetric phase fraction of the <b>harder</b> <b>Ni</b> 3 P phase within a relatively soft Ni matrix, i. e. it was found to increase with the P-content of the Ni-P coating.

According to their Density-of-States (DOS) both boride families are metallic. DFT calculations show that Nb 6 MIr 6 B 8 M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) and T 2 FeB 2 (T = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W) are hard compressible compounds and that the strength of the chemical bonding influences the bulk modulus and the shear modulus, the latter is also influenced by the DOS. Looking at the isotropic elasticity the Nb 6 MIr 6 B 8 compounds (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, <b>Ni)</b> are <b>hard</b> but ductile. Unexpectedly both the shear and bulk modulus of the compounds Nb 6 MIr 6 B 8 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) show isotropically elastic behavior in the ab-plane so that the ductility and hardness are independent of the direction in the ab-plane. In the ab-plane these borides are ductile, but hard. Along the c-direction the borides are brittle and very hard, but not superhard. Between the a- and c-axis they are ductile and not hard. Looking at the isotropic elasticity of the borides T 2 FeB 2 (T = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W) it appears that they are hard materials. Especially hard materials are V 2 FeB 2 und Cr 2 FeB 2 which are highly suggested to be synthesized. Besides of W 2 FeB 2 which is ductile the other borides V 2 FeB 2, Nb 2 FeB 2, Ta 2 FeB 2, Cr 2 FeB 2 and Mo 2 FeB 2 are brittle. The T 2 FeB 2 compounds (T = V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W) are hard and brittle in the ab-plane.

The observed anisotropy of the elastic entities could not only be verified with some formulas qualitatively, but also can be compared with other solid state materials with these formulas.

40|$|Small {{automotive}} plain engine bearings {{are used}} to provide the relative motion between the engine block and the crankshaft via the connecting rod. Under rapidly changing engine loads, these bearings may suffer fatigue damage during service. In modern multilayered bearing designs, fatigue resistance is a complex function of engine loading coupled with the layer architecture and a multiphase lining alloy. This research has mostly focussed upon micro-scale fatigue damage initiation on thin (0. 2 - 0. 3 mm thickness) lining surface and its subsequent growth leading towards gross failure. The systems examined comprise Al alloys and sintered bronze as relatively soft and conformable lining layers. The weight percent composition of Al lining alloy was Al- 6. 5 Sn- 2. 5 Si- 1 Cu- 1 Ni- 0. 25 Mn roll bonded to a stiffer and thicker backing steel layer (1. 5 - 1. 8 mm thick) via an even thinner Al foil (0. 04 mm) as an interlayer. The other system comprised an Al lining (Al- 20 Sn– 1 Cu) alloy spray coated on to a medium carbon steel layer {{in the form of}} a flat bar. All these systems were compared with the previously investigated Al based designs with lining compositions: Al- 12 Sn- 4 Si- 1 Cu and Al- 20 Sn- 1 Cu- 0. 25 Mn (manufactured by roll bonding processes). The performance evaluation was based upon the investigation of microstructural features involved in early fatigue initiation and their effect upon short crack growth on the surface. Subsurface crack growth through the layers has also been assessed and finally the observed fatigue life of various components linked to these behaviours. A 3 -point bend test configuration was adopted for laboratory fatigue tests. Fatigue comparison was made on the basis of lining surface plastic strain amplitude vs. number of cycles to failure according to a uniform predefined criterion for all the systems. Maximum plastic strains developing at the lining surface were estimated using a combination of finite element analysis (FEA) and strain gauge measurements so that the fatigue life of all systems studied was presented as strain-life data. Specimens in the form of both finished bearings and flat bars were tested. Similar fatigue behaviour was observed for the two testing geometries, giving greater confidence in the fatigue evaluation process and allowing detailed observations of small crack initiation and growth processes in flat bars to be related to behaviour of the actual bearing geometry. In the previous research, the coarser Si particles in the Al- 12 Sn- 4 Si- 1 Cu lining and Sn particles in the Al- 20 Sn- 1 Cu- 0. 25 Mn alloys were identified as potential crack initiation sites, though the relationship between particle geometry and arrangement/clustering was found to be important. The newly developed Al- 6. 5 Sn- 2. 5 Si- 1 Cu- 1 Ni- 0. 25 Mn lining alloy with finer and fewer Sn and Si particles showed a delayed initiation of short fatigue cracks compared to the previous systems. However, a large number of widely scattered intermetallics in the new linings were observed to fracture causing early fatigue initiation at the micro-scale level with some more complex processes of detaching Sn layers from harder intermetallics and Si particles. Using the mechanical property data for bulk lining and secondary phase particles obtained from tensile testing and instrumented hardness testing, stress fields were investigated within the hard particles (intermetallics), surrounding thin layers and the matrix on the basis of the analytical and numerical modelling. On the basis of these modelling results, optimum particle shapes were defined to minimize tensile stresses (within the particles) and hydrostatic stresses (at the particle matrix interfaces). The experimental growth data of a dominant crack when combined with a Hobson type growth model based upon measured particle distributions and experimental crack growth rates, helped in predicting fatigue life of a similar component at different stress levels. Surface crack driving force reduces considerably when subsurface crack deflection occurred within softer Al interlayer. Replacing this interlayer with a harder brazed sheet did not give any significant difference in the observed fatigue life. In the HVOF systems, crack initiation was observed to be from the weaker interface between a harder matrix and softer circular unmelts as well as from various scattered pores. The overall fatigue life of the HVOF systems was comparable to the previous roll bonded systems; however subsurface deflection of crack at the lining-backing interface resulted in the debonding of the lining and hence the observed lining fatigue resistance may not be a good indication of the overall performance in a bearing system. At similar lining surface plastic strain levels, the bronze bearing with very thin Sn and Ni as overlay layers (~ 7 microns each) showed comparable fatigue resistance to the currently investigated RB Al based designs. However annealing this system resulted in the formation of <b>hard</b> <b>Ni</b> 3 Sn intermetallics at the Sn-Ni interface, and the observed fatigue resistance of this system was higher than the RB systems. This has been linked to very fine scale local crack deflection in the overlay layers (although these have not been observed clearly). All these layered bearing systems provide a complex fatigue problem. Factors which reduce initiation /early growth behaviour are likely to offer the best service performance enhancements in view of the relatively HCF nature expected in service.
