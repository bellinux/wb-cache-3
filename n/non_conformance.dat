Each time the process does not conform to the process, the event should be properly documented, investigated and corrected so that the temperature excursion do not occur on future shipments. Any anomaly is thus considered to be a <b>Non</b> <b>Conformance</b> and should be assigned as a trackable event. The event must be reported immediately when it is identified and it is the expectation of the FDA that all adverse events be documented and investigated.

The system may potentially stay in a Validated state if the root cause identifies that a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was not followed or followed incorrectly. If however a SOP needs to be changed or modified, then the system must be re-validated to demonstrate that the change to the SOP maintains the integrity of the process/system. A Non-Conformance may also generate a Corrective Action Preventative Action (CAPA), again, a documented process to make corrective or preventative actions to SOP's and other documents.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though the}} captain had the most mistakes, the first officer was also noted by the CAA in his failure of raising the landing gear while an {{in-flight}} emergency occurred. Investigators concluded that cockpit crew neither discussed nor raised the landing gears after takeoff. The wreckage also confirmed the landing gears in extended position {{at the time of}} ground impact. The Beechcraft-1900C aircraft will have very low rate of climb with landing gears in down position due to increased drag while operating with single engine. Any angle of bank is going to aggravate the situation and the marginal rate of climb would at one stage change into a rate of descend which actually happened in this particular case. The first officer was a qualified captain on Beechcraft-1900C aircraft, however his actions and assistance available to the captain of aircraft was not at optimum level. He failed to retract the landing gears after takeoff and undertook remedial actions well below the defined minimum safe altitude contrary to the recommended procedures, which shows his pre-occupation, anxiety and stress in handling abnormal situation. Due to these <b>non</b> <b>conformances,</b> the aircraft failed to achieve the safe flying parameters despite having a serviceable engine.|$|R
40|$|During a ferry flight, in a {{standard}} operation condition and at cruising level, a military cargo experienced a double hydraulic system failure due to a structural damage of the dual booster actuator. The booster actuator is the main component in mechanism of aileron’s deflection. The crew was able to arrange an emergency landing thanks to the spare oil onboard: load specialists refilled the hydraulic reservoirs. Due to safety concerns {{and in order to}} prevent the possibility of other similar incidents, a technical investigation took place. The study aimed to carry out the analysis of root causes of the actuator failure. The Booster actuator is composed mainly by the piston rod and its aluminum external case (AA 7049). The assembly has two bronze caps on both ends. These are fixed in position by means of two retainers. At one end of the actuator case is placed a trunnion: a cylindrical protrusion used as a pivoting point on the aircraft. The fracture was located {{at one end of the}} case, on the trunnion side, in correspondence to the cap and over the retainer. One of the two fracture surfaces was found separated to the case and with the cap entangled inside. The fracture surfaces of the external case indicated fatigue crack growth followed by ductile separation. The failure analysis was performed by means of optical, metallographic, digital and electronic microscopy. The collected evidences showed a multiple initiation fracture mechanism. Moreover, 3 D scanner reconstruction and numerical simulation demonstrated that dimensional <b>non</b> <b>conformances</b> and thermal loads caused an abnormal stress concentration. Stress concentration was located along the case assy outer surface where the fatigue crack originated. The progressive rupture mechanism grew under cyclical axial load due to the normal operations. Recommendations were issued in order to improve dimensional controls and assembly procedures during production and overhaul activities...|$|R

The Six-sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) approach has been used for the process improvement. This results in reduction of the rework time and cost. The increase in the sigma level from 2. 30 to 3. 28 and from 3. 00 to 3. 10 for Left hand and Right hand Deck respectively was achieved. Six Sigma improves the process performance which leads to predictable input and predictable output, leading to better utilization of resources, decreases variations resulting in continuous improvement and maintains consistent quality of the process output...|$|E

40|$|In today's company climate, {{certification}} and/or accreditation by {{an appropriate}} body {{is becoming the}} norm. There are many reasons to explain this tendency and in IRMM's case (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements, one of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre's (JRC) seven institutes), these were so as to enhance safety, health, environmental and security performances; assure compliance with regulatory requirements and with EC policies; improve customer satisfaction (quality); enhance image of the institute and improve cost efficiency. IRMM {{can be considered as}} similar, in some ways, to EU Member State national laboratories but being at EU level and having the other "Directorates-General" (DGs) of the Commission as customers. These customers {{need to be able to}} categorically state that the measurements carried out in the JRC laboratories are of top quality and that in striving to obtain these high quality results, all environmental and occupational health and safety regulations of the Commission and of the respective member state were followed. As mentioned above, having appropriate accreditation and triple certification provides a management system through which these demands can be met. Aiming to attain triple certification (OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001 and ISO 9001) in ~ 2 years would normally be considered too much of a burden to place on staff and internal auditors alike. However, approaching this in an integrated way, conversely provided not only the mechanism for achieving it in such a short time but also the vehicle for maintaining it, with minimal resources (if comparing against going for certification one by one), and dramatic simplification. IRMM's long (50 years) experience in the nuclear field meant that the long standing good practices in this area could be immediately applied to the bio-safety and chemical laboratories, so it would be untrue to say that the starting point was zero. Nevertheless, the triple certification process brought a synergy to the institute which had hitherto been unknown with the net encompassing: the legal register and how new or changed regulations are followed up; the methodology for risk assessments; the scoring of the environmental aspects; the integration of safety and environmental objectives in the staff evaluation system; certain Safety, Health, Environment (SHE) procedures with a management support overlap e. g. coding system for purchases; internal and external communication aspects; integrated auditing; the reporting of <b>non</b> <b>conformances,</b> incidents and accidents and the way management reviews are carried out. The integration process also involved an examination of the Performance Indicators (including core process and SHE indicators), highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. This work includes some newly chosen performance indicators and their respective targets in the areas of Safety, Health and Environment. It also includes the first score cards of our Integrated Management System which when displayed on a "dashboard" provide a straightforward means of benchmarking our institute with our fellow institutes in the JRC. Last but not least, the fact that this institute wide effort, fully supported by the director, resulted in improvements in inter-departmental communication, enhanced awareness by the hierarchical line of their SHE responsibilities and duties and involvement of all staff, in one way or another. How this was achieved in this 2 year period, starting in January 2006 and ending with the external audit in December, 2007 will be described in this work with the aim of showing all (including SHE) benefits of a truly integrated management system.

40|$|Passive {{testing is}} an {{alternative}} testing approach whose purpose is to passively analyze an implementation behaviour without disturbing it. Usually, passive testing methods extract traces by means of sniffer-based tools, running in the same environment as the implementation. Nevertheless, many implementation environments prevent from setting a sniffer-based tool for security or technical reasons. We propose a passive testing method based {{on the notion of}} proxy-tester which represents an intermediary between client applications and the implementation. We define a proxy-tester as a product between the specification and its canonical tester, which is able to receive the client traffic and to forward it to the implementation and vice versa. It also aims to analyze the implementation traces to detect faults. We define a <b>non</b> <b>conformance</b> relation between the implementation, its specification and the external environment from which is received the client traffic. We also provide some preliminary results on the Amazon E-commerce Web service and discuss about the proxy-tester benefits...|$|E

40|$|The {{activities}} {{developed in}} collaboration with MBDA have followed two different research lines. In the first line a framework of statistical methods useful in the industrial qualification phase of an innovative process based on Additive Manufacturing technologies has been proposed. This technology has been recognized as the next chapter in the industrial revolution. Exactly in the qualification process of a new industrial technology, when is inadequate the practitioner's experience, statistics play a strategic role to help management in making-decision by planning experimental activities, analyzing statistical results and catalyzing technological interpretations. The second research line aims at providing a suitable statistical quality control methodology to monitor the <b>non</b> <b>conformance</b> management (NCM) process applied to a MBDA dedicated production line. The NCM process data are highly autocorrelated and cannot be assumed homogeneous because of the significantly different impact on non-quality costs.

40|$|It {{is crucial}} {{than ever to}} measure {{manufacturing}} losses due to non-compliance of customer specifications. To assess these losses, industry is widely using proportion of <b>non</b> <b>conformance</b> PNC for performance evaluation of their manufacturing processes. Various methods have been proposed to estimate PNC for univariate quality characteristics; however estimating an accurate PNC for non-normal multivariate correlated quality characteristics is still a challenge for researchers. In this paper we review fitting Burr XII distribution to continuous positively skewed multivariate data using different search algorithm techniques. The proportion of nonconformance PNC for process measurements is then obtained by using only Burr XII distribution, rather than through the traditional practice of fitting different distributions to real data. We also employ artificial neural network based on Burr XII distribution to estimate PNC. The results based on the proposed methods are then compared with the exact proportion of nonconformance using real data from a manufacturing process.. Using the PNC criterion, {{the results show that}} the estimated PNC values obtained based on all three methods; simulated annealing, hybrid and artificial neural network are reasonably close to the actual PNC value. However, the estimated PNC based on the simulated annealing method is the closest to the actual PNC valu...|$|E

This study will adopt Juran (1960) model on Cost of quality and relate the model to measure quality performance. The objectives of the study are: to determine the cost of quality in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) according {{to the cost of}} quality components; to determine the collection methods that are used to collect the cost of quality; and to determine the relationship among the three quality cost components using "Prevention-Appraisal-Failure" (PAF) model. The study was conducted by interviewing the Head of Quality (Coordinator), Assistant Treasurer in the respective branch campuses and Centre of Total Quality Education in Shah Alam in order to gather the qualitative and quantitative data. It is found that the Prevention Cost is the highest portion of the COQ, followed by Appraisal Cost and Internal Failure Cost. UiTM does not identify any External Failure Cost at the time being. The study also revealed that, there is a relationship between conformance and <b>non</b> <b>conformance</b> cost accordance to the Traditional Model of COQ suggested by Ittner (1994). The adjustment on the existing accounting system is in a great need. The Balanced Scorecard, the unique tools of performance indicator is also consider to be a good tool to apply in UiTM as it focus on four key areas: Financial measures; Customer measures; Internal business process measures; and Innovation and growth measures.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed for finding the Quality and Profitability Improvement by Technical Audit, through {{a case study}} and further {{establishing}} {{the relationship between the}} product quality, profitability and technical audit. Quality audit generates the report of <b>non</b> <b>conformance</b> which basically represents the deviation from committed quality of products, or in short, it may be called as postmortem of product quality. By virtue of quality audit, the commitment, implementation and follow up for product quality are aligned. This delivers a good quality of product to the customers and thus the customer is benefited. In industries, Quality Inspectors are giving their decision for quality of product in two categories, "ACCEPTED" or "REJECTED". The accepted products are coming to the customers and the rejected products become the burden / problem to the manufacturers. If accepted product quantity is within the “NORMS”, no one cares regarding the rejected product quantities, what so ever. When the rejected product quantity increases beyond the “NORMS”, the analysis process starts to find out the reasons of rejections. Sometimes, it becomes too late to search out the reasons of rejections and survival of the industry becomes a problem. By technical audit and audit report implementation such type of conditions can be avoided and controlled. Basically, Quality is the function of Man, Machine, Materials, Methods, Movement, Manufacturing Processes, Monitoring and Management (8 M’s). If the technicality of 8 M’s is corrected by Technical Audit, the product quality will improve automatically and the profitability of the organization will improve. In short it can be solicited that if 8 M’s are all right, the product quality and profitability will automatically be set right. This may become an important aspect in the scenario of Indian Industries. The findings are supported by a case study of a Process Plant (Slag Dryer) of a reputed Indian Industry...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: The {{implementation}} of quality system and continuous evaluation of all {{activities of the}} Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) can help to achieve the maximum {{quantity and quality of}} safe blood. Optimizing blood collection and processing would reduce the rate of discard and improve the efficiency of the BTS. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the rate of discard of blood and blood component and identify its reasons at the National Blood Centre (NBC), Kuala Lumpur, during the year of 2007 in order to introduce appropriate intervention. Study Designs and Methods: Data on the number of discarded whole blood units and its components, reasons for discard, and the number of blood components processed as well as the number of collected blood units were obtained from the Blood Bank Information System - NBC database. These were analyzed. Results: The total number of blood units collected in 2007 was 171169 from which 390636 units of components were prepared. The total number of discarded whole blood units and its components was 8968 (2. 3 %). Platelet concentrate recorded the highest of discard at 6 % (3909) followed by whole blood at 3. 7 % (647), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at 2. 5 % (2839), and cryoprecipitate at 2 % (620). The rate of discarded packed red blood cells RBCs, plasma aphaeresis, and PLT aphaeresis was less than 1 % at 0. 6 % (902), 0. 6 % (37), and 0. 29 % (14), respectively. RBC contamination of PLT and plasma were the major cause of discard at 40 % (3558). Other causes include leakage (26 % - 2306), lipemia (25 % - 2208), and underweight (4 % - 353). Conclusion: Good donor selection, training and evaluation of the staff, as well as {{implementation of}} automation will help to improve processes and output of BTS.

40|$|The overall {{research}} question originated through the question “how did the underground {{economy in the}} lobster fishery arise and why”. In the mid- 1990 s, a growing underground economy was uncovered by chance in the Atlantic Canada lobster fishery. When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police proceeds of crime unit found a series of large money transfers into a Royal Bank branch in Halifax, they thought that drug money was being moved. It {{turned out to have}} been cash sales of lobster. This represents $ 40 to $ 60 million in lost tax revenue, and a similar challenge for the common resource model for lobster fisheries management. To help answer the {{research question}} I examined the history and structure of the Atlantic Canadian lobster fishery, the impact of government and non-government policies and interactions with the lobster fishery and examined the tax evasion, statistical fraud detection and collusion/market power literature. The literature review gave rise to a number of potential variables for inclusion in a model that would serve to predict illegal and underreported activity in the lobster fishery. First, Benford’s Law was tested as a possible variable for inclusion. Non-conformity with Benford’s Law was observed in both the lobster fishery in LFA 33 and LFA 34 plus the snowcrab fishery. However, <b>non</b> <b>conformance</b> with Benford’s Law does not mean that there is certainty of fraud or human manipulation. Second, a market power screen was applied to the lobster fishery. Quantitative support for community-based differences in compliance with fisheries regulations has been demonstrated there is value in including a market power indicator variable as a variable of interest in the model. Last logistic panel data models were developed and tested. The outcome of the model building process were two models that have a better than chance discriminatory ability and a reasonable classification of transactions that may lead to sanctions. Model 4 was significant but was not able to classify licensees that {{were more likely to have}} sanctions. A factor analysis showed that there were three factors for each of the transactional and licensee models. For licensee models,sanctions were not loading on the same factor as the Benford’s Law and market power independent variables. In the case of the underground economy of the Atlantic Canadian lobster fishery, the Government of Canada has information and a fresh analysis of the information that may enable them to better target audits or inspections. There is no illusion that the information will, in sports parlance, “win the championship” however, it is hoped that with this analysis and continued improvement that the Government of Canada will outperform those that seek to evade tax and fisheries policy...|$|E

Considerando a existência dos riscos em todas as atividades e a falta de percepção por parte do empregador e do trabalhador no processo de pós-colheita do café, bem como a falta de conformidade das propriedades quanto à aplicação das normas regulamentadoras do Ministério do Trabalho e do Emprego (M. T. E), o objetivo deste trabalho foi diagnosticar os riscos envolvidos em cada uma das etapas da pós-colheita do café e sua percepção por parte dos trabalhadores e proprietários. Além disso, precisamos verificar se unidades de processamento de café estão em conformidade com as normas regulamentoras, a fim de determinar os pontos de risco que levem os órgãos governamentais a auxiliar os produtores na modificação do processo para possibilitar a exportação do café. O trabalho foi realizado a partir da aplicação de questionário em trinta propriedades localizadas em três associações rurais do município de São Sebastião do Paraíso - MG, definidas por sorteio. A análise dos questionários mostrou que, somente 23 % das pessoas entrevistadas possuíam percepção dos riscos existentes nas propriedades e somente 3 % delas estavam dentro dos padrões de conformidade com as NR's.
