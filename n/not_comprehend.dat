No one cared to rescue Judd when he was harmed throughout his youth. Despite Judd's growing into a harsh man, reviewer Hary Sheehan noted, he preserves a glimmer of empathy. Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the love his family nurtured in him.|$|E
5|$|Within the year, Edward {{caused a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by announcing {{his desire to}} marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against {{the teaching of the}} Anglican church, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could <b>not</b> <b>comprehend</b> why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings. Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately. She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.|$|E

She ordered an immediate upgrade of Pegu's moats and fortified walls. Zeik-Bye meanwhile kept Nwe apprised of the developments. By then, her authority was too weak. When Nwe and his small army appeared outside Pegu's walls on 10 December 1383, she could do nothing other than hunker down inside the city walls.|$|E
25|$|The supreme deity of Tolkien's {{universe}} is called Eru Ilúvatar. In the beginning, Ilúvatar created spirits named the Ainur from his thoughts, {{and some were}} considered brothers or sisters. Ilúvatar made divine music with them.

25|$|With his {{air power}} {{destroyed}} and his forces not yet concentrated for a fleet battle, Yamamoto maneuvered his remaining forces, still strong on paper, to trap the US forces. He {{was unable to}} do so because his initial dispositions had placed his surface combatants too far from Midway, and because Admiral Raymond Spruance prudently withdrew to the east in a position to further defend Midway Island, believing (based on a mistaken submarine report) the Japanese still intended to invade. Not knowing several battleships, including the powerful , were on the Japanese order of battle, he did <b>not</b> <b>comprehend</b> the severe risk of a night surface battle, in which his carriers and cruisers would be at a disadvantage.

25|$|Held {{that the}} word 'amendment' {{was used in the}} sense of {{permitting}} a change, in contradistinction to destruction, which the repeal or abrogation brings about. Therefore, the width of the power of amendment could not be enlarged by amending the amending power itself. The learned Judge held that the essential elements of the basic structure of the Constitution are reflected in its preamble and that some of the important features of the Constitution are justice, freedom of expression and equality of status and opportunity. The word 'amendment' could not possibly embrace the right to abrogate the pivotal features and the fundamental freedoms and therefore, that part of the basic structure could not be damaged or destroyed. According to the learned Judge, the provisions of Article 31d, as they hen, conferring power on Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for giving effect to the principles specified in Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39, altogether abrogated the right given by Article 14 and were for that reason unconstitutional. In conclusion, the learned Judge held that though the power of amendment was wide, it did <b>not</b> <b>comprehend</b> the power to totally abrogate or emasculate or damage any of the fundamental rights or the essential elements of the basic structure of the Constitution or to destroy the identity of the Constitution. Subject to these limitations, Parliament had the right to amend any and every provision of the Constitution.|$|E

500|$|Soviet foreign {{relations}} with the People's Republic of China quickly deteriorated after Nikita Khrushchev's attempts to reach a rapprochement with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia and the west. When Brezhnev consolidated his power base in the 1960s, China was descending into crisis because of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, {{which led to the}} decimation of the Communist Party of China and other ruling offices. The Brezhnev leadership who promoted the idea of [...] "stabilisation", could <b>not</b> <b>comprehend</b> why Mao would start such a [...] "self-destructive" [...] drive to finish the socialist revolution, according to himself. At the same time, Brezhnev had problems of his own, the Czechoslovakian leadership were also deviating from the Soviet model. In the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet leadership proclaimed the Brezhnev doctrine, which said the USSR had the right to intervene in any fraternal communist state that did not follow the Soviet model. This doctrine increased tension not only with the Eastern Bloc, but also the Asian communist states. By 1969 relations with other communist countries had deteriorated to a level where Brezhnev was not even able to gather five of the fourteen ruling communist parties to attend an international conference in Moscow.

500|$|Measure for Measure has {{frequently}} {{been considered a}} [...] "problem play". It was a problem for Hazlitt in that it contains almost no character with whom one can feel complete sympathy. [...] "here is in general a want of passion; the affections are at a stand; our sympathies are reflected and defeated in all directions." [...] Angelo, the Deputy ruler of Vienna, is forgiven by the Duke but draws only Hazlitt's hatred, as [...] "he {{seems to have a}} much greater passion for hypocrisy than for his mistress." [...] "Neither are we enamoured of Isabella's rigid chastity, though she could not act otherwise than she did." [...] Isabella's brother Claudio [...] "is the only person who feels naturally", yet even he does not show well in his pleading for life at the sacrifice of his sister's virginity. There is no easy solution for his plight, and [...] "he is placed in circumstances of distress which almost preclude the wish for his deliverance." [...] Over a century later, commentator R.W. Chambers placed Hazlitt as the first of a long line of notable Shakespearean critics who felt the same way, and he quoted Characters of Shakespear's Plays in establishing his contention (as a basis for arguing his own different view of the play) that Hazlitt was among the first of dozens of distinguished critics who could <b>not</b> <b>comprehend</b> how Mariana could love and plead for someone like Angelo, and in general showed a distaste for much in Measure for Measure.|$|E
500|$|The Greeks could <b>not</b> <b>comprehend</b> {{an absence}} of slaves. Slaves exist even in the [...] "" [...] of Aristophanes' The Birds {{as well as in}} the ideal cities of Plato's Laws or Republic. The utopian cities of Phaleas of Chalcedon and Hippodamus of Miletus are based on the equal {{distribution}} of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen and land workers. The [...] "reversed cities" [...] placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in Lysistrata or Assemblywomen, but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the Golden Age, where all needs were met without anyone having to work. In this type of society, as explained by Plato, one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' Amphictyons barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honor of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Similarly, Aristotle said that slaves would not be necessary [...] "if every instrument could accomplish its own work... the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them", like the legendary constructs of Daedalus and Hephaestus. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a [...] "normal" [...] society, one needs slaves. Aristotle argues that slave are a necessity though, saying [...] "Property is part of the household,... For no man can live well or indeed live at all, unless he provided with necessaries." [...] He also argues that slaves are the most important part of the property as they [...] "take precedence of all the instruments." [...] This would suggest that at least some slaves would be treated well for the same reason one would take great care of their most important tools. By viewing slaves as tools of a household, it creates another reason for acceptance of slavery. Aristotle says [...] "indeed the use of slaves and of tame animals is not very different," [...] showing as well that at least in part, some slaves were thought of no higher than the common tamed animals in use at the time. Antiphon viewed slaves as a bit more than common animals or tools. On the topic of a man killing his own slave, he says that the man should [...] "purify himself and withhold himself from those places prescribed by law, in the hope that by doing so he will best avoid disaster." [...] This suggests that there still is some sense of inappropriateness in killing a slave, even one owned by the killer.|$|E
