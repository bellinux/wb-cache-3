5000|$|St. Augustine had a {{very deep}} sense of the {{difficulty}} of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question [...] "I Am" [...] what? From John 8, 24: [...] "If you do <b>not</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Am, you will die in your sins." [...] But Augustine asked, [...] "si non credideritis quia ego sum?" [...] (I Am What?) There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing. [...] "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing." [...] Augustine: [...] "If you do <b>not</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Am the Christ; if you do <b>not</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Am the Son of God; if you do <b>not</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Am the Word of the Father; if you do <b>not</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Am the author of the world; if you do <b>not</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you do <b>not</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Am <b>that,</b> you will die in your sins.

Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity.

[...] Both of them also commented the song [...] "lacks rhythmic drive and the backing track is fuller, with smoother and rounder synthsized instruments", while describing Spears' vocals as more natural when compared to [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy".|$|E

He had no prior {{intention}} to leave Hungary until he learned from his mother that the Hungarian Secret Police were looking for him. Racz said if they found him, [...] "That would have meant the end of my dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would have ended up in prison. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had done anything but many other people ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime." [...] He arrived in the Austrian town of Eisenstadt where buses were waiting to take refugees to their new homes. Racz chose the bus to England, and he along with his family and other members of his group were transported to a military base in the Midlands.|$|E
500|$|From 2006 to 2008, M.I.A. {{lived in}} the Bedford-Stuyvesant {{neighbourhood}} of Brooklyn, New York, where she met Benjamin Bronfman (a.k.a.

They became engaged and she gave birth to their son, Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman, on 13 February 2009, just three days after performing at the Grammy Awards. In February 2012, it was announced that she and Bronfman had split. In a 2013 interview with Ferrari Sheppard, M.I.A. commented on her relationship with Bronfman and his family's wealth: [...] "I think it’s weird. It’s <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got with Ben and then suddenly I was a billionaire. You know? I got with Ben, and I realised that we do come from different worlds, but it’s interesting that it is more about the concepts of, again, elitism and power. Who Ben is on paper sounds way more powerful than who I am because of where he comes from." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Tony Benn reiterated his {{previous}} opposition to European integration.

Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will tell you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ...

She used the opportunity to discuss the plight of women in Afghanistan leading up to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, saying, [...] "The brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists." [...] Her husband was originally to give the address but he felt that she should do it; she later recalled, [...] "At that moment, it was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> found my voice.

In May 2002, she made a speech to the people of Afghanistan through Radio Liberty. [...] In March 2005, she made the first of three trips to that country as First Lady.|$|E
500|$|Khloé married {{basketball}} player Lamar Odom during a fourth-season premiere aired in 2009. He later {{had a major}} role {{as part of the}} supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khloé. Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim. However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: [...] "You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get." [...] He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about the way how the show is filmed. In the eighth season, Caitlyn Jenner's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, as well as Brandon's wife Leah, joined the cast for regular appearances.|$|E
500|$|Following its broadcast, [...] "Brother's Little Helper" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. About nine {{years after its}} original broadcast, Robert Canning of IGN posted a [...] "flashback review" [...] of [...] "Brother's Little Helper". Canning, calling the episode [...] "funny" [...] and [...] "a standout episode in this later season", was particularly fond of the episode's opening. However, he was less impressed with the third act of the episode, calling it [...] "lackluster". He felt that the part involving Mark McGwire was [...] "a silly cop out" [...] and that it wasn't as funny as what was leading up to it. He also stated that he was {{put off by the}} writers wanting to come across a message. [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> necessarily disagreed with this sentiment", Canning wrote, [...] "but at the time, I didn't think I needed to be taught a lesson while I watched The Simpsons.

[...] He did, however, [...] "love" [...] the [...] "tag back" [...] to the volunteer fire department seen {{in the beginning of the}} episode, and [...] "the fact that they can't find how to fight a satellite fire in their handbook".|$|E

The album's title track reached number one in more than 23 countries and sold over 10million copies worldwide.

500|$|In 1962 he {{appeared}} in Wendy Toye's comedy film We Joined the Navy before teaming up again with Peter Sellers in Only Two Can Play, Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure [...] "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—Waltz of the Toreadors—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy The Wrong Arm of the Law. Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that [...] "I thought I knew by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (<b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could ever get tired of any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year {{he appeared}} in a third Sellers film, The Pink Panther, as a defence lawyer, {{and in the second}} Tony Hancock vehicle, The Punch and Judy Man. Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role [...] "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.|$|E

[...] The writer pointed out that Timberlake was not even noted on the set until he began his verse. In an interview with MTV News, Ciara went into detail about the setup of the performance, stating: [...] "I just kind of felt cool, 'cause Justin can play [...] real well and he really gets into the music and it was, like, 'Hey, let's make you part of the band.' Having Justin in the background for the live performance was very different from the music video for the song, where we two dance quite provocatively with one another.
