40|$|The {{pervasive}} {{nature of}} computing and communications is bringing about {{a paradigm shift}} in the way these technologies are being used. The shift is {{in the direction of}} nomadic computing and communications. <b>Nomadicity</b> refers to the system support needed to provide a rich set of computing and communication capabilities and services to the nomad as he or she moves from place to place in a transparent, integrated and convenient form. This new paradigm is already manifesting itself as users travel to many different locations with laptops, PDA's, cellular telephones, pagers, etc. In this paper we discuss a vision of <b>nomadicity</b> as well as open issues, architecture and design concerns that must be addressed as we bring about the system support necessary for <b>nomadicity...</b>|$|E
40|$|We are in {{the midst}} of some truly revolutionary changes in the field of computer-communications, and these offer {{opportunities}} and challenges to the research community. One of these changes has to do with nomadic computing and communications. <b>Nomadicity</b> refers to the system support needed to provide a rich set of capabilities and services to the nomad as he moves from place to place in a transparent and convenient form. This new paradigm is already manifesting itself as users travel to many different locations with laptops, PDA's, cellular telephones, pagers, etc. In this paper we discuss some of the open issues that must be addressed as we bring about the system support necessary for <b>nomadicity.</b> In addition, we present some of the considerations with which one must be concerned in the area of wireless communications, which forms one (and only one) component of <b>nomadicity.</b> 1.

40|$|Recent CSCW {{research}} has shown that <b>nomadicity</b> {{can be seen as a}} dynamic process that emerges as people engage with practices supporting them in the mobilisation of their workplace to accomplish work in and across different locations. This paper elaborates on the emergent aspects of the process by detailing a spectrum of motivational and contextual forces that surround and shape nomadic practices. The paper contributes to existing CSCW literature on <b>nomadicity</b> and extends it by articulating the complex intersections of motive and context that shape nomadic practices. The findings that the paper presents emerged from an ethnographic study of a group of academics and their nomadic work/life practices...|$|E
40|$|While {{information}} and communication technology enables freelancers to work “anytime anywhere”, it has become apparent that not all places seem to be equally suitable for their work. Drawing from CSCW literature on the practical accomplishment of mobile work and theoretical literature on creativity, insights from ethnographic studies in New York, Berlin and Wiesbaden are discussed. The paper follows workers in their everyday attempts to seek out and enact work environments, which enable them to be creative and productive. In these processes, mobility features both as a problem and a resource. The search for the right place makes these workers restless, but sometimes restlessness and <b>nomadicity</b> can inspire creativity. Similarly, new mobile, social and collaborative technologies allow a new balancing of solitude and sociality. I call this emerging nexus of practices which entails aesthetic, affective, social and socio-political dimensions the care of place. A conjoint theoretical and empirical analysis aims {{to draw attention to}} everyday lived practices of <b>nomadicity</b> and the care of place in a wider discursive and socio- political context to inform CSCW design...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the Virtual Organization (VO) {{paradigm}} has been emerging as an ideal solution to support collaboration among globally distributed entities (individuals and/or organizations). However, due to rapid technological and societal changes, {{there has also been}} an astonishing growth in technologies and services for mobile users. This has opened up new collaborative scenarios where the same participant can access the VO from different locations and mobility becomes a key issue for users and services. The <b>nomadicity</b> and mobility introduces additional challenges for managing collaboration in VO environments. This paper focuses on the Identity Management challenge in a Mobile Dynamic VO environment, which is a VO that takes into account <b>nomadicity</b> and seamless mobility aspects as elaborated within the EU funded project Akogrimo (Access to Knowledge through the Grid in a mobile world). The resulting work is the design of the Akogrimo Identity Management system supporting the authentication and authorization process across the different administrative domains of the Mobile Dynamic VO. This design follows the service oriented approach and integrates the different perspectives: that of the network, that of the user and that of the service provider. Such an integration requires facing challenges; both from the architectural and technological viewpoints because different ‘worlds’ (i. e. network and service level) leverage different (and sometimes conflicting) approaches when addressing Identity Management...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Replication is {{extremely}} important in mobile environments because nomadic users require local copies of important data. However, today’s replication systems are not “mobile-ready”. Instead of improving the mobile user’s environment, the replication system actually hinders mobility and complicates mobile operation. Designed for stationary environments, the replication services do not and cannot provide mobile users with the capabilities they require. Replication in mobile environments requires fundamentally different solutions than those previously proposed, because <b>nomadicity</b> presents a fundamentally new and different computing paradigm. Here we outline the requirements that mobility places on the replication service, and briefly describe ROAM, a system designed to meet those requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{growing trend}} of nomadic and mobile {{computing}} raises serious security concerns. <b>Nomadicity</b> has become common; users are in constant transit, migrating with their mobile devices through many diverse wireless environments. Some users are innocent—potentially vulnerable, but benign—while others are malicious or carry compromised devices. The mobile commons brings {{all of these}} users and devices together. Both clients and hosting environments must be protected. To that end, we are developing QED, a new security model for computer networks. QED enables environments to quarantine devices, examine them, and potentially update or “decontaminate ” client nodes. We present the design of our QED prototype and evaluate its performance in our laboratory. 1...|$|E

40|$|Our goal is {{to define}} a {{communication}} architecture for nomadic applications. We notice that the mobile agent paradigm is particularly suitable for nomadic applications. Although many mobile agent systems are being proposed, few of them raise {{the problem of the}} interface between applications and mobile agents. We propose to use the MAP (Mobile Assistant Programming) architecture and add a middleware layer that adapts MAP to nomadic environments. The nomadic adaptation layer provides enhanced services to nomadic applications: result collector is managed as a predictif cache, partial or approximate results may be delivered, and network connections are optimized. An application controls the layer by defining politics to adopt for connection management and result delivery. 1 Introduction Main issues in nomadic computing include mobility, communication performance, and application support. To achieve <b>nomadicity,</b> a nomadic host should be able to move from place to place while operating as ef [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} a study of an Anoto ® digital pen and paper usage in three student project groups over three months. We {{have set up a}} system {{including}} a digital pen and paper, handwriting recognition software, and provided the conditions for wireless note sharing over Bluetooth, and thereafter we let the students use the technology as they went about their activities. Our goal was to evaluate the system's potential for student groups as usage naturally occurred and to assess how the participants integrated the technology in their work and whether it bridged the physical-digital gap. We found that even if the technology works well for individual use, collaborative use of digital pen and paper posed important issues, which we discuss in the light of our notion of <b>nomadicity</b> as a work condition, {{as well as in the}} light of the increasingly opportunistic nature of handwriting nowadays...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{takes us}} {{on a short}} journey from {{traditional}} desktop computing to the three emerging dimensions of: <b>Nomadicity</b> (the system support needed to provide a rich set of computing and communication capabilities and services to nomads as they move {{from place to place}} {{in a way that is}} transparent, integrated, convenient and adaptive); embeddedness (small intelligent devices embedded in the physical world and connected to the Internet); and ubiquity (Internet service availability wherever the nomad travels on a global basis). These three dimensions give us a powerful system that supports global access for mobile users interacting with smart spaces. When we add intelligence distributed across this global infrastructure, we form a new "space", which is the basis of a vision I articulated for the Internet in 1969 and which has yet to be achieved. In that vision, I foresee that the Internet will essentially be an invisible global infrastructure serving as a global nervous system for the peoples and processes of this planet...|$|E
40|$|Broadband access {{technology}} has significant influences in the telecommunication industry. Worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) is a broadband wireless technology which brings broadband experience to a wireless context. There {{are two different}} types of broadband wireless services. One is fixed wireless broadband which is similar to the traditional fixed line broadband access technology like DSL or cable modem but using wireless as a medium of transmission. Another type is broadband wireless known as mobile broadband which has additional functionality of portability, mobility and <b>nomadicity.</b> The IEEE 802. 16 family WiMAX is designed to accommodate both fixed and mobile broadband application. WiMAX promises to solve the last mile problem which refers to the expense and time needed to connect individual homes and offices to trunk route for communications. WiMAX also offer higher peak data rates and greater flexibility than 3 G networks and Wi-Fi. This thesis is provides the analysis of the broadband wireless access (BWA) technology with a focus on WiMAX and compare it with the other wireless technology like Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and third-generation (3 G) ...|$|E
40|$|This article takes {{departure}} in Barbara Czarniawska’s {{discussion of}} ‘Nomadic Work as Life-Story Plot’. It contextualises her analysis of actors’ interpretations of nomadic {{work with a}} bi- focal review of the ambiguous realities of these phenomena. Firstly, an examination of key aspects of the socio-economic and political context of nomadic work in global neoliberal economies reveals precarious conditions that cloud romantic interpretations of <b>nomadicity.</b> Secondly, a review of studies of everyday practices of nomadic work shows how neoliberal, but also alternative futures are enacted through creative appropriation of collaborative technologies. One example {{is the work of}} digital ‘disaster deck’ volunteers and its potential for the mobilization of ‘rapid, highly localized assistance’ through closer collaboration between a distributed crowd, local communities, and official emergency responders (Starbird and Palen 2013). This and other examples suggest emergent new practices and politics of dwelling in mobility that are focused on sociality and collaboration, straddling virtual and physical commons. The twin critique developed in this response can augment narrative analysis to inform more integrated CSCW innovation that challenges the ‘brave new world of work’...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An ad hoc {{network is}} a {{multihop}} wireless communication network supporting mobile users without any existing infrastructure. To become commercially successful, the technology must allow networks to support many users. A complication is that addressing and routing in ad hoc networks does not scale up {{as easily as}} in the Internet. By introducing hierarchical addresses to ad hoc networks, we can effectively address this complication. Clustering provides a method to build and maintain hierarchical addresses in ad hoc networks. Here, we survey several clustering algorithms, concentrating on those {{that are based on}} graph domination. In addition, we describe results that show that building clustered hierarchies is affordable and that clustering algorithms {{can also be used to}} build virtual backbones to enhance network quality of service. 1. Introduction. In a speculative paper, Kleinrock [32] described ad hoc networking technology as a blend of <b>nomadicity,</b> embeddedness, and ubiquity. In a network of the future, users and computing devices will be able to connect to such a network conveniently and even transparently. Computing and communication capabilities will not only be restricted to standard electronic devices, but every gadge...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCurrent trends towards {{automatic}} {{network management}} have {{lead to the}} definition of policies providing a better control on today's Internet domains. These domains can be composed of more than one access network each with its capabilities, devices, users and a specific behavior defined by policies. Thus, policies are defined to control service provisioning and automate network resource configuration. However, being aware of all the changes occurring in these domains is a difficult task. The difference in the quality of services provided by different pervasive environments and the growth in the mobility nature of users, and the heterogeneity of access networks lead to the problem of providing services adapted to users' needs and context. In this paper, we present a policy-driven approach to control the <b>nomadicity</b> of users and provide them services in agent-based pervasive environments. The agents achieve distributed tasks like gathering relevant context information in order to build up profiles helping adapt the requested service. Policies are applied to network devices and agents to control their behaviors. New policies are created automatically after a negotiation process between the user and the network in order to handle the events occurring in the surroundings. This framework helps tailoring services and policies according to the new environment's information while respecting a limited delay and a good scalability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Compact routing schemes were until {{recently}} considered {{as the main}} alternative to overcome the fundamental scaling limitations of the Internet routing system. Such schemes have been introduced to address the fundamental and unavoidable trade-off between the stretch of a routing scheme and the routing table size it produces. Recent {{studies have shown that}} static routing on topology-dependent identifiers (that includes "some " topological information) scales (poly) logarithmically on the number of nodes in scale-free graphs such as the Internet. Nevertheless, evolution of the Internet routing system also demonstrates that i) topology-independence of the numbering scheme becomes a fundamental requirement for e. g. multi-homing, <b>nomadicity,</b> and mobility, and ii) "static " routing is unable to handle dynamic graphs, i. e., routing update messages (triggered by topology-driven, policy-driven, and other protocol-driven events) must be exchanged to timely inform remote routers such that each router maintains a consistent view of the non-local topology. This tutorial starts by reviewing the fundamental dimensions of routing schemes. It then introduces the compact routing theory and its application to scale-free graphs. Next, it describes and analyses the consequences resulting from i) routing on topology-independent numbering space and ii) dynamic routing information exchanges and resulting costs. This tutorial will conclude by outlining the open research coupled-challenges (stretch x routing table size x dynamics) and possible direction(s) to address them...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of the nomadic lives of a cohort of knowledge workers and explores {{the ways in which they}} are mediated by computer technologies. Although increasing attention has been paid to the wide range of their practices and related phenomena, which I term Technologically-mediated <b>Nomadicity</b> (Tm-N), in the past few years little has been said about how this way of engaging in work at multiple locations happens to people and is integrated in their work-life. Tm-N is herein discussed as the process through which the workplace is mobilised to an assortment of locations so that productive activities can be accomplished from these locations, often with the help of computer technologies. It is argued here that the relationship between Tm-N and the factors that lead to it are central to understanding why this approach to work-life is becoming increasingly common in contemporary society – especially among workers who hold knowledge-based positions. An understanding of this relationship gives further insights into the role of computer technologies in this scenario. The thesis focuses on academics developing work in and across several locations as the flexibility of many of their work activities means that they can be performed at home, in the office, in cafés, restaurants, airports, airplanes, to name but a few locations. This potential “lack of a stable and fixed location” where work can be carried out characterises them as instances of T-Nomads (Tech Nomads), who are understood here as people who do Tm-N. This is an ethnographically-informed study, i. e. methods based on direct observation and in-depth interviews were used to collect data for the research. The fieldwork data suggest that Tm-N is a complex phenomenon showing that it can be understood as a process that emerges from people’s engagement with an ecology of practices, involving a dialogue between human bodies and technologies as work gets accomplished in and across different sites. Empirical evidence shows that Tm-N should be seen as dynamic and emergent; it is reconfigured according to the ways in which people think of their work-life, strategise about it and react in situations where tasks cannot be accomplished as planned. Furthermore, the findings point towards the existence of a spectrum of factors driving Tm-N that ranges from choice, through opportunity to obligation. Finally, the findings suggest that Tm-N should not be regarded as a process to do only with work, but as encompassing practices that often blur the boundaries between the professional and the personal spheres of people’s lives...|$|E
