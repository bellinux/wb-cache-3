The deposited Ni layers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDS), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).

The oxygen content was found to be uniform in the Ni layer and was higher close to the Si/metal interface. The silicide formation from alkaline Ni deposits was characterized by 4 point probe measurements, in-situ x-ray dispersion (XRD) measurements, and TEM measurements. Results were compared to silicides formed from ‘pure’ sputtered Ni layers.

To understand this, several experiments and theoretical calcu-lations were performed.

40|$|In this paper, we {{have studied}} the effect of boric acid (H 3 BO 3) on the {{nucleation}} of nickel (Ni) nanoparticles on titanium nitride (TiN). We linked the potential transients during galvanostatic deposition to the different regimes of <b>Ni</b> <b>deposition.</b> The two most important regimes, i. e. nucleation and growth regime, were found {{to depend on the}} H 3 BO 3 concentration. Indeed, by lowering the amount of H 3 BO 3 the particle density increased (nucleation), while it also resulted in an earlier growth termination. Based on these findings, we propose a growth-inhibited nucleation model to explain the impact of H 3 BO 3 on the formation of Ni nanoparticles. During Ni nucleation the surface pH increases due to local H+ reduction, leading to the formation and adsorption of Ni(OH) 2 on the Ni particles. As a result, the growth of the particles is inhibited and new nucleation is promoted. The formation of this inhibiting hydroxide is counteracted by the presence of H 3 BO 3 as it buffers the surface pH. Therefore, a higher particle density is obtained at low H 3 BO 3 concentrations. However, when the concentration of H 3 BO 3 is too low, Ni(OH) 2 is already formed in the diffusion layer during the nucleation regime as the onset of H 2 O reduction occurs sooner. This results in the termination of <b>Ni</b> <b>deposition</b> before the nucleation of Ni is complete yielding almost no deposited Ni at the surface at low H 3 BO 3 concentrations. Therefore, an optimum H 3 BO 3 concentration is needed where the degree of growth-inhibition is high while Ni is still deposited for a sufficient amount of time. status: publishe...|$|E
