5|$|The group {{regularly}} {{argued in}} the press, though Townshend said disputes were amplified {{in print and}} the group simply {{found it difficult to}} agree on things. Tommy mutually benefitted Townshend and Daltrey's standing in the band because of the former's songwriting and the latter's stage presence, yet even this did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> close friends. The pair quarrelled, particularly in the mid-1970s, over the group's direction. During his time with the band, Jones was subject to intermittent criticism from Daltrey.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> feel very welcome. They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 another Parliamentary select {{committee}} recommended the compulsory {{adoption of the}} metric system after a two-year permissive period. The 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade, but did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> mandatory. A bill to make the metric system compulsory in order to enable the British industrial base to fight off {{the challenge of the}} nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not pass in the House of Commons before the next general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118.|$|E

Chilli is {{commonly}} found in Malaysian dishes, although this does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> spicy. Noodles are common. Pork is rarely used in Malaysia, {{because of the large}} Muslim population. Some celebrations have food associated with them, and mooncakes are often eaten during Mooncake Festival.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of the axiom schema of separation, Russell's paradox becomes a proof that there is no set of all sets. The axiom of regularity (with the axiom of pairing) also prohibits such a universal set, however this prohibition is redundant when added to the rest of ZF. If the ZF axioms without regularity were already inconsistent, then adding regularity would <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> consistent.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{minorities}} (including the Albanians, Bosnians, Crimean Tatars, and various peoples from the Caucasus, {{as well as}} some of the Turks themselves) are descendants of Muslims (muhajirs) who were expelled from the lands lost by the shrinking Ottoman Empire, but they have assimilated into and intermarried with the majority Turkish population and have adopted the Turkish language and way of life, though this does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> ethnic Turks.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{arguments}} against {{the authenticity of the}} James passage has been that in the Jewish Wars Josephus portrays the High Priest Ananus in a positive manner, while in the Antiquities he writes of Ananus in a negative tone. Louis Feldman rejects these arguments against the authenticity of the James passage and states that in several other unrelated cases the Jewish War also differs from the Antiquities, and that an interpolator would have made the two accounts correspond more closely to each other, <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> differ.|$|E
25|$|In the Anguttara Nikaya (5:33), Buddha tells future wives {{that they}} should be obedient to their husbands, please them, and <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> angry through their own desires. Furthermore, the Buddha offers advice to married women in the Anguttara Nikaya (7:59; IV 91-94), from the Pali (Theravada) canon, where he tells of seven types of wives—the first three types are destined for unhappiness, while the last four, as they are imbued with long term self-control, are destined to be happy. These latter wives are characterised as caretakers (motherly-wife), companions (friend-wife) and submissives (sister-wife and slave-wife)—the Buddha thus {{endorsed}} a variety of types of wives within marriage.|$|E

The film, according to another reviewer, is [...] "cheerfully fluffy and consistently erotic ... outside of his Henry Paris titles, film stands as Metzger's funniest achievement ... a fitting epilogue for the age of sexual freedom; they may <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> like this anymore, {{but as long as}} these films continue to be appreciated, viewers can relive the experience and have quite a few good, hearty laughs along the way".|$|R

25|$|The Singer World Series was {{the first}} senior cricket tournament {{to be held in}} Sri Lanka after the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Security threats due to the Sri Lankan Civil War and {{potential}} terrorist attacks from the LTTE had led Australia to refuse to visit Sri Lanka for their scheduled match in the island nation. This time, Australia agreed to participate amidst intensive security arrangements. Following their 1996 World Cup triumph, Sri Lanka had emerged as clear favourites. The Australian team was considered the most serious challenger to their prospects. Zimbabwe's struggling, lacklustre performances did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> serious contenders. The Indian team had come off a string of successive ODI tournament defeats and a poor showing in their tour of England, which led to the replacement of the team captain Mohammad Azharuddin with his deputy, Sachin Tendulkar. The Singer World Series was to be Tendulkar's first ODI tournament leading the national team.|$|E

[...] on 31 October 2009, Woon expressed {{the view that}} prosecuting teenagers from having underage sex with each other served little purpose. [...] "It's basically kids having sex ... What {{do you do if}} the couple think they're in love? It's less easy if the girl consents. ... The judges cannot do very much by themselves.

500|$|Church women {{personalize}} their attire, {{according to}} Patricia Fortuny. [...] Rebozos are worn by indigenous members and specially designed veils by other female members. Fortuny says that, [...] "...wearing long skirts does not negate {{the meaning of}} being a woman and, although it underlines the difference between men and women, [...] say that it does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> feel like inferior human beings". Fortuny says women describe their attire as part of obeying biblical commands found in 1 Timothy 2:9, and 1 Corinthians 11:15 for long hair. Female members say the Church's dress code makes them feel they are honoring God {{and that it is}} part of their [...] "essence".|$|E
500|$|On August 28, the FBI New York {{field office}} {{requested}} that {{a criminal case}} be opened to determine whether Mihdhar {{was still in the}} United States, but the request was refused. The FBI ended up treating Mihdhar as an intelligence case, which meant that the FBI's criminal investigators could not work on the case, due to the barrier separating intelligence and criminal case operations. [...] An agent in the New York office sent an e-mail to FBI headquarters saying, [...] "Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die, and the public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain 'problems.'"

500|$|In May, {{successive}} draws {{at home to}} Birmingham City and Portsmouth left Arsenal with 84 {{points from}} 36 games. Reyes scored the only goal of the match against Fulham; he profited from a mistake by goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar: [...] "The Dutchman tried to go past the Arsenal forward, but instead gifted possession {{and with it the}} easiest of open goals." [...] Arsenal's final game of the league season was against Leicester City. They conceded the opening goal, but turned the match around in the second half through goals from Henry and Vieira. With 26 wins, 12 draws and no defeats, the team became the first since Preston North End in 1888–89 to go through a league season undefeated. Reviewing the match and overall season, Amy Lawrence of The Observer wrote: [...] "Arsenal's achievement may <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> 'great' in everyone's opinion – those who define greatness only by European Cups, back-to-back titles, and triple cartwheels on the way to every goal – but it is staggering in its own right." ...|$|E

TSN added that the network only wanted the sport for October anyway. Going into , ABC had reportedly purchased 20 Monday night games but only used eight of those slots.
