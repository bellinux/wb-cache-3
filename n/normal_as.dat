5|$|After {{returning}} home and accepting that the Griffins {{may never be}} together again, Lois walks in, revealing she has completely recovered and reobtained custody of the children. Peter is overjoyed that everything is back to <b>normal,</b> <b>as</b> well {{as the fact that}} Lois will smell like French fries for the next six months.|$|E
5|$|At 14:50 CDT, Flight 191 {{pushed back}} from gate K5 and was cleared to taxi to runway 32R. Maintenance crews {{present at the}} gate did not notice {{anything}} unusual during push back, engine start, or taxi. Everything looked <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> the flight began its takeoff roll at 15:03.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they can}} {{complete}} the mission, Silik is {{killed by a}} guard near the conduit, and Archer is nearly shot by a confused Tucker. With the alien shields down, Enterprise then completes an atmospheric entry, flying over New York City and destroying the alien facility with photon torpedoes. The episode ends with Daniels showing Archer the threads of the timeline resetting themselves back to <b>normal,</b> <b>as</b> the Temporal Cold War finally ends {{with the death of}} Vosk. Archer demands that Daniels should never visit or bother Enterprise again. With their mission completed, Enterprise finally arrives back in its proper time period, where the crew are welcomed and escorted by an entire squadron of Starfleet and alien vessels.|$|E

5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than <b>normal,</b> <b>as</b> their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic and vaginal {{ultrasounds}} {{are helpful}} {{in the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear <b>normal.</b> <b>As</b> the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center uses ACE to rank {{hurricane}} {{seasons as}} above-normal, near-normal, and below-normal. It defines below-normal {{as having an}} ACE less than 95*104kn2; It defines above <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> having an ACE above 150*104kn2 along with the numbers of any two of the following above average: tropical storms (15), hurricanes (9), or major hurricanes (4); It defines near-normal as having an ACE between 100*104kn2 and 150*104kn2, or an ACE above 150*104kn2 with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average: tropical storms (15), hurricanes (9), or major hurricanes (4).|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Homer remains {{oblivious to}} Ned's animosity. He {{arrives at the}} Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but Ned and his family get in their car and race off without him. Pulled over by Chief Wiggum for speeding, Ned takes a sobriety test as disapproving townspeople watch. At church, when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer, Homer inhales very loudly through his nose, causing Ned to yell at Homer. This alarms the congregation, who become even more upset with Ned. But Homer sticks up for Ned and convinces the congregation to give him another chance. The next week, everything returns to <b>normal,</b> <b>as</b> Homer once again is annoyed by Ned.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 race, {{officials}} {{decided to}} advance the competition's start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early start date was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9days and 26minutes. That race was marked by good weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to <b>normal,</b> <b>as</b> violent storms blasted the trail and mushers {{during the second half}} of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to public relations director, appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish fourth floor with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of}} a circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people. Ron believes everything will eventually go back to <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands that Ron talk to him. On the fourth floor, Tom's attempts to charm some of the elderly women into doing his work fails miserably, as they ignore him and all adore Andy.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, this {{typology}} {{has been}} used without being empirically tested. A recent study showed empirical support {{for the existence of}} the own, the wise, and <b>normals</b> <b>as</b> separate groups; but, the wise appeared in two forms: active wise and passive wise. Active wise encouraged challenging stigmatization and educating stigmatizers, but passive wise did not.|$|R

5|$|Sid {{finds the}} eighth spirit at the crater {{site of the}} alien asteroid's impact on Earth. He lowers a {{shielded}} vehicle, with Aki and Gray aboard, into the crater to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into the crater, not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has {{a vision of the}} Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.|$|E
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to <b>normal.</b> <b>As</b> a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E
25|$|In CKD {{numerous}} uremic toxins {{accumulate in}} the blood. Even when ESKD (largely synonymous with CKD5) is treated with dialysis, the toxin levels {{do not go}} back to <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> dialysis is not that efficient. Similarly, after a kidney transplant, the levels may {{not go back to}} <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> the transplanted kidney may not work 100%. If it does, the creatinine level is often normal. The toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum and have different molecular weights, {{and some of them are}} bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Such toxic protein-bound substances are receiving the attention of scientists who are interested in improving the standard chronic dialysis procedures used today.|$|E

25|$|An {{antisense}} GFAP retrovirus (PLBskG) {{to reduce}} GFAP mRNA expression, has been implemented in suppressing growth and arresting astrocytes in the G1 {{phase of the}} cell cycle. However, a main caveat to the clinical application of retroviral use is the non-discriminatory effects of PLBskG on <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> well as injured astrocytes. Further in vivo {{studies are needed to}} determine the systemic effects of PLBskG administration.|$|E
25|$|A labour ward, {{also called}} a {{delivery}} ward or labour and delivery, is generally {{a department of}} a hospital that focuses on providing health care to women and their children during childbirth. It is generally {{closely linked to the}} hospital's neonatal intensive care unit and/or obstetric surgery unit if present. A maternity ward or maternity unit may include facilities both for childbirth and for postpartum rest and observation of mothers in <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> well as complicated cases.|$|E

25|$|Comedian Louis C.K. made {{headlines}} in 2011, {{with the release}} of his concert film Live at the Beacon Theater as an inexpensive (US$5), DRM-free download. The only attempt to deter unlicensed copies was a letter emphasizing the lack of corporate involvement and direct relationship between artist and viewer. The film was a commercial success, turning a profit within 12 hours of its release. Some, including the artist himself, have suggested that file sharing rates were lower than <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> a result, making the release an important case study for the digital marketplace.|$|E
25|$|Open {{units are}} {{psychiatric}} units {{that are not}} as secure as crisis stabilization units. They are not used for acutely suicidal persons; the focus in these units is to make life as <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> possible for patients while continuing treatment {{to the point where}} they can be discharged. However, patients are usually still not allowed to hold their own medications in their rooms, because of the risk of an impulsive overdose. While some open units are physically unlocked, other open units still use locked entrances and exits depending on the type of patients admitted.|$|E
25|$|Everything {{went back}} to <b>normal</b> <b>as</b> soon as the Jin forces retreated. Lavish parties {{continued}} to be held daily at the imperial palace.

Emperor Qinzong rejected the proposal by citing that the Jin forces might never come back. Many experienced generals who defended the city in the first siege of Bianjing were removed from the capital and posted elsewhere in the country. Many army groups were decommissioned or sent back to their prefectures of origin.|$|E
