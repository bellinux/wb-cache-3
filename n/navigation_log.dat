50|$|The {{motivation}} for this initial deception {{was most likely}} {{to allow him to}} claim an attention-getting record prior to entering the doldrums. However, from that point on, he started to keep two logs — his actual <b>navigation</b> <b>log,</b> and a second log in which he could enter a faked description of a round-the-world voyage. This would have been an immensely difficult task, involving the need to make up convincing descriptions of weather and sailing conditions in {{a different part of the}} world, as well as complex reverse navigation. He tried to keep his options open as long as possible, mainly by giving only extremely vague position reports; but on 17 December he sent a deliberately false message indicating that he was over the Equator, which he was not. From this point his radio reports — while remaining ambiguous — indicated steadily more impressive progress around the world; but he never left the Atlantic, and it seems that after December the mounting problems with his boat had caused him to give up on ever doing so.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel Web Usage Manipulation Language (WUML) {{which is a}} {{declarative}} language for manipulating Web log data. We assume that a set of trails formed by users during the navigation process can be identified from Web log files. The trails are dually modelled as a transition graph and a navigation matrix {{with respect to the}} underlying Web topology. A WUML expression is executed by transforming it into <b>Navigation</b> <b>Log</b> Algebra (NLA), which consists of the sum, union, difference, intersection, projection, selection, power and grouping operators. As real navigation matrices are sparse, we perform a range of experiments to study the impact of using different matrix storage schemes on the performance of the NLA. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The World Wide Web has {{provided}} users {{with the opportunity}} to access from any computer the largest set of information ever existing. Researchers have analyzed how such users surf the Web, and such analysis has been used to improve existing services (e. g., by means of data mining and personalization techniques) as well as the generation of new ones (e. g., online targeted advertisement). In recent years, a new trend has developed by which users do not need a computer to access the Web. Instead, the low prices of mobile data connections allow them to access it anywhere anytime. Some studies analyze how users access the Web on their handsets, but these studies use only <b>navigation</b> <b>logs</b> from a specific portal. Therefore, very little attention (due to the complexity of obtaining the data) has been given to how users surf the Web (off-portal) from their mobiles and how that information could be used to build user profiles. This paper analyzes full <b>navigation</b> <b>logs</b> of a large set of mobile users in a developed country, providing useful information about the way those users access the Web. Additionally, it explores how <b>navigation</b> <b>logs</b> can be categorized, and thus users interest can be modeled, by using online sources of information such as Web directories and social tagging systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Drop-on-demand {{weed control}} is a field of {{research}} within precision agriculture. The herbicide application is controlled down to individual droplets. In this master thesis the precision spray matrix for an autonomous field robot, Asterix, is designed. Asterix is currently under development by Adigo AS, and focuses on carrot and turnip cabbage. Such applications can reduce the herbicide usage drastically. The overall system is presented with connections and timing concerns. This includes how the camera {{and the rest of}} the application is synchronized. With the use of a trigger from the camera, the time for each image can be logged on the printed circuit board and the inertial measurement unit can give each image an accurate time, position and orientation stamp. As a result the computer do not need to be synchronized with the rest of the system and may perform the calculations needed with relative times. An algorithm for valve control which generate spray commands from a spraymap and <b>navigation</b> <b>log</b> was designed and implemented. A second revision of the printed circuit board was designed and tested. The design chosen for controlling the micro-dispensing valves is pulse-width modulation. A much used strategy for closing solenoid valves is by discharging the energy in the coil over two schottky diodes in reverse series. However the pulse-width modulation is used to close the valve by reversing the voltage in this design. Testing of the droplet tail and laboratory experiments verify this control strategy, and the reverse voltage time can be calculated for different valves...|$|E

In order to increase screening rates in Hispanic women in the Houston area, the CLS program was adapted to the Houston area. One product of the adaptation process was {{the development of a}} community-based navigation component that was implemented in order to provide personalized instrumental and informational support. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to conduct and report the findings of a process evaluation of the navigation component of the CLS-adapted breast and cervical cancer prevention program for Hispanic women in Houston. ^ Methods: The process evaluation utilized a mixed-methods approach, using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. IRB approval was embedded within the previously approved study through the UTHealth Committee. ^ I collected quantitative data from a navigation electronic database 2 ̆ 2 Plan de Acción 2 ̆ 2 and the electronic 2 ̆ 2 tracking master list 2 ̆ 2 used by the navigators to summarize participant information and encounters. I conducted descriptive analysis of data from the <b>navigation</b> <b>log</b> using Excel and Stata. ^ Qualitative analysis sources included three structured interviews with two LHWs and one key personnel. Interviews were transcribed and if necessary, translated. Data was examined and overarching themes emerged. ^ Results and Conclusions: The evaluation described the navigation component of the adapted CLS program in the areas of context, reach, dose delivered/reached, and fidelity. The four areas of improvement for this adapted CLS program identified in this process evaluation included a more intensive navigator training, monitoring of follow-up protocols, monitoring tracking/documentation of calls, and staff size. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Antarctic fast-ice {{variation}} is investigated using satellite images and ship’s ice <b>navigation</b> <b>logs,</b> focusing on break-up phenomena in Lützow-Holm Bay. Although spatio-temporal scales for break-up events vary somewhat for each event, their commencement is generally in autumn {{and almost always}} in the same region. Specifically, the 1997 / 98 break-up event occurred over a wide area and continued {{for a long time}} after the initial break-up. Since then, break-ups have recurred until 2004, and a total of 20 annual events have been detected and monitored since 1980. Moreover, information from icebreaker <b>navigation</b> <b>logs</b> shows that unstable fast-ice conditions occurred in the 1980 s and after the late 1990 s. From the analysis of surface meteorological data and the offshore pack-ice distribution, anomalously shallow snow-cover depths and a peculiar retreat pattern of the ice edge are found to be factors that favour fast-ice break-up. The pack-ice distribution controls the propagation of ocean swell inside the bay; encroaching swells are likely to mechanically disintegrate fast-ice during autumn prior to the annual formation of the protective pack-ice cover to the north. Less snow cover also leads to fast-ice weakening as the melt season progresses and broken floes are then transported offshore by prevailing southerly winds. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis work in Electrical Engineering at Telecommunication Department {{focuses on}} {{development}} of Android application for testing purpose such as testing the network performance {{and trying to}} collect data (e. g., signal strength, network type, phone type, SIM state, call state etc) which will be saved into the phone memory and used later to determine the network performance. This application has to be used on a handheld device running the Android Operating System (OS) for testing and logging purpose. How to build Android applications using eclipse software is explained. In this work, three applications are built, an application for SMS, one for GPS and an application for making phone calls. These three applications are used for testing the network performance and information (such as cell ID, service provider for the GPS, etc) is collected and saved into a text file on the phone memory. One application is for sending SMS periodically to a test number at Telenor and also the application is capable of receiving SMS. Another application is to make phone calls to a test number and log all data needed to a file on the phone. The data collected such as cell ID, network type, signal strength, operator name and much more, these data can then be logged into a file for future examining. This application is also capable of receiving phone calls and collect data needed for performing handover. The last app is a location based service app (GPS). These three apps are to be combined into one single application and to be run without user interaction. All information related to SMS, GPS and making phone calls will be saved into a file. This is done to monitor {{the behavior of the}} network and {{to improve the quality of}} service promised to the customer. This thesis serves as a testing application between the different environments of the Telenor network including handover between 2 G and 3 G. It also provides a guideline to Android developers, seeking solutions to the problems, which are not simply available. Android is a platform consisting of an operating system and a Software Development Kit (SDK) for handheld devices. It originates from a small software company, acquired by Google and is now owned by Open handset Alliance (OHA), where Google is a member. A description of Android application used for special purpose has been discussed in this thesis work. This involves storing of calling, SMS, and GPS <b>navigation</b> <b>log</b> reports in the phone memory. Resources and recommendations on further Android development are presented. Strategies on development of applications are also suggested throughout this thesis. The development for an Android device and its data traffic characteristics is of interest, which is also included in this thesis.

40|$|International audiencePresent-day web browsers possess several {{features}} that facilitate browsing tasks. Among these features, {{one of the}} most useful is the possibility of using tabs. Nowadays, it is very common for web users to use several tabs and to switch from one to another while navigating. Taking into account parallel browsing is thus becoming very important in the frame of web usage mining. Although many studies about web users' navigational behavior have been conducted, few of these studies deal with parallel browsing. This paper is dedicated to such a study. Taking into account parallel browsing involves to have some information about when tab switches are performed in user sessions. However, current browsers do not allow to explicitly acquire such an information, and the data available for web usage mining is usually made of raw <b>navigation</b> <b>logs</b> in which parallel sessions are mixed. Therefore, we propose to get this information in an implicit way. We thus propose the TABAKO model, which is able to detect tab switches in raw <b>navigation</b> <b>logs</b> and to benefit from such a knowledge in order {{to improve the quality of}} web recommendations. Experimental studies are performed on an open browsing dataset. Results validate the ability of our algorithm to detect parallel sessions, and to exploit them to enhance the results compared to a state-of-the-art recommendation model...|$|R

In this article we describe a framework for detecting anomalous events in such data using an unsupervised learning approach.

We outline a Bayesian framework for learning the parameters of this model from count time-series. Two large real-world datasets of time-series counts are used as testbeds to validate the approach, consisting of freeway traffic data and logs of people entering and exiting a building. We show that the proposed model is significantly more accurate at detecting known events than a more traditional threshold-based technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects, and to make inferences about different aspects of events such as number of vehicles or people involved. The results indicate that the Markov-modulated Poisson framework provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events fro...|$|R
