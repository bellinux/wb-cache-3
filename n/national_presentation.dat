5000|$|Jennifer Lawrence {{portrays a}} younger Mystique in the 2011 prequel X-Men: First Class. Morgan Lily briefly plays Mystique {{as a child}} while Rebecca Romijn makes a cameo as a {{transformation}} Mystique takes to seduce Magneto. She is raised as Charles Xavier's foster sister, and helps found the X-Men, but eventually defects to Magneto as she is dissatisfied with Xavier's constant attempts {{to ask her to}} hide where Magneto encouraged her not to fear her true appearance. Lawrence reprises her role as Mystique in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past. In the film, it was her assassination of Bolivar Trask that leads to his martyrdom, resulting in the fruition of his Sentinel program. Mystique was subsequently captured and experimented upon, leading to the Sentinels' unstoppable shapeshifting abilities and a dystopian future. The film revolves around Wolverine's attempts to stop her assassination of Trask and avert the dark future after he is sent back in time by Kitty Pryde projecting him into his younger self. The group stops Mystique's attempt to kill Trask, but the altercation exposes mutants to the world for the first time earlier than in the previous timeline, prompting President Nixon to approve the Sentinel program while Trask studies a blood sample Mystique left behind during the attack. While Trask Industries ships the Sentinels to Washington, D.C. for their <b>national</b> <b>presentation,</b> Magneto secretly surrounds the Sentinels in steel, allowing him to control them. He subsequently commandeers the Sentinels to attack the crowd and hold off Wolverine, Xavier, and McCoy, but before he can kill what he believes to be Nixon (really a disguised Mystique), McCoy suppresses his mutation with a serum causing a Sentinel to turn on Magneto. Magneto quickly disables it, but the distraction allows Mystique to shoot him with a plastic gun, wounding him and releasing his control of the Sentinels. After Xavier convinces Mystique to let Trask live, the world sees that a mutant saved the President and the Sentinel program is shut down. Trask is arrested for selling military secrets to foreign powers, erasing the dystopian future seen earlier in the film. Mystique remains a rogue agent, disguising herself as William Stryker to retrieve Wolverine from the Potomac River. Lawrence reprise her role as Mystique in X-Men: Apocalypse. The film is set in the 1980s, with Mystique now the 'public face' of the idea of heroic mutants, and not aligned with Magneto as she did in the original timeline after {{the events of the last}} film. Despite being idolized by other mutants as a hero, she rejects the notion while focusing simply on getting the oppressed to safety. Younger mutants like Ororo Munroe, Scott Summers, and Jean Grey see her as an inspiration, and some have begun trying to use their powers for heroics or vigilantism based on her examples. After she sees a news report about the death of Magneto's family while she is trying to help Nightcrawler, she has him take her back to Xavier's mansion so that Xavier can help her find Erik. In the process, she unintentionally alerts the powerful new foe Apocalypse to their existence, prompting him to abduct Xavier. After briefly being held captive by Colonel Stryker, Raven and the other adults are rescued by Scott, Jean, and Nightcrawler, prompting Raven to accompany them on the mission to rescue Xavier from Apocalypse. At the film's conclusion, Mystique returns to the X-Men as one of Xavier's lieutenants (along with Beast) and field commander.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the <b>national</b> <b>presentation</b> of the Czech Republic at EXPO 2010 in Shanghai in terms of mythology, symbols, signs and codes. It {{describes}} {{the history of the}} World Exhibitions, attempts to highlight Czechoslovak achievements and on the basis of that to define key points of successful communication for an international, predominately Chinese audience. By comparing information on traditional Chinese symbols and values with that of Czech explains correlations between Czech and Chinese culture. This can help visitors from China identify with the Czech Republic. A mythological analysis is executed examining the exterior of the Czech pavilion, the exhibition inside, and notes narrative structures of individual exhibits and how they work to provide the preferred interpretation. Part of the overall analysis includes an overview of supporting events, which also help to strengthen the perception of Czech Republic to visitors. The information gleaned is used to summarize learnings that could be useful for the upcoming EXPO in Milan in 2015...|$|E

40|$|Science and {{technology}} is regularly featured on radio, in newspapers, and on television, {{but most people}} only get ﬁrsthand exposure to ‘cutting-edge’ technologies in museums and other exhibitions. During this period, the Science Museum was the only permanent <b>national</b> <b>presentation</b> of science {{and technology}}. Thus, {{it is important to}} acknowledge the Museum’s history and the socio-political framework in which it operated. Understanding the delays in the Museum’s physical development is critical, as is understanding the gradual changes in the Museum’s educational provision, audience, and purpose. While the Museum was the main national exhibition space, the Festival of Britain in 1951 also provided a platform for the presentation of science and technology and was a statement of Britain’s place within the new post-War world. Speciﬁcally, within its narrative, the Festival addressed the relationship between the arts and the sciences and the inﬂuence of science and technology on daily life. Another example of the presentation of science was the quest for a planetarium in London - a story that involves the Science Museum, entrepreneurs, and Madame Tussauds. Comparing the Museum’s efforts with successful planetarium schemes isolates several of the Museum’s weaknesses - for example, the lack of consistent leadership and the lack of administrative and ﬁnancial freedom - that are touched on throughout the work. Since most of this history is unknown, this work provides a fundamental basis for understanding the Museum’s current position, for making connections and comparisons that can apply to similar problems at other institutions, and for learning lessons from the struggles that can, in turn, be applied to other institutions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Policy The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) {{supports}} the incorporation and adoption of principles {{of social justice}} into social policy, public health curricula, workforce development initiatives, and the design of program evaluation measures as strategies to eliminate health inequities. Based on those principles, 1 NACCHO encourages local health departments to act on class, race, and gender oppression as {{the root causes of}} health inequity. As part of that work, NACCHO specifically encourages the transformation of public health practice to include the following: a) The development, tracking, and regular presentation of social indicators that (1) measure social health and well-being, including inequities in health status, similar to the <b>national</b> <b>presentation</b> of economic indicators; and (2) identify the institutional sources of decision-making cumulatively generating health inequities(e. g., investment in local infrastructure by neighborhood; distribution of city fiscal resources by neighborhood; bank loans, lending practices, and foreclosures by neighborhood; political influence, etc) b) Recruitment of a racially/ethnically diverse workforce c) Anti-racism training for the public health workforce d) Support for local policies that begin to address root causes, such as paid sick leave (see NACCHO statement of policy 11 - 07), living wage, and so forth. e) Support for the use of Health Impact Assessments (see NACCHO statement of policy 06 - 01) f) Cooperation in the production and sharing of information with constituents and community organizations g) Support for research that explores the generation of social and economic inequality, the role of privilege and organized wealth, and the power arrangements or mechanisms that increase inequality h) Building networks of power with community organizers to change the processes which generate health inequities Justification Inequality in the United States is at the highest level since before the Great Depression and the United States has the worst health in the industrialized world. 2 The first words from the Worl...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to build on the literature concerning presentation practices of racial and national identity. The research examines presentation practices of race and national identity among Haitian heritage residents of the Dominican Republic (DR). Haitian immigrants have been {{an important part of the}} Dominican economy and the Dominican way of life since the beginning of the 20 th century. Their descendants have to manage between Haitian and Dominican identities, while under the incredible pressure of anti-Haitian prejudices. The current literature concerning Dominican presentation practices asserts that normative presentation practices hide racial blackness. However, more recent literature questions the existence of a relationship between Dominican presentation practices and race. This research is placed to adjudicate between the two arguments within the literature. While {{this research}} is accomplished in a different environment among adifferent population, the research conclusions of this thesis support the connection between race and presentation practices. This study offers a preliminary look at how a substantive minority group manages racial and <b>national</b> <b>presentation</b> practices. This is accomplished through the investigation of hair styling norms of Haitian-Dominican women living in a batey in the Eastern region of the country. The study analyzes data from ten semi-structured interviews, one follow up focus group, and participant observation in Batey El Prado. The research results show that presentation practices of hair styling and hair management reflect race, social class, and nationality. Hair management practices allow women to manage how others perceive their racial and national identity. The respondents show normative hair presentation practices that are nearly identical to that of the dominant culture. The major finding is that hair styling techniques are used by the respondents as a status attainment strategy. By manipulating their hair, the respondents of this study attempt to hide racial blackness, avert the Haitian label, and assert a Dominican identity...|$|E
