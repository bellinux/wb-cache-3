40|$|Nasal {{carriage}} of Staphylococcus aureus is {{an important}} risk factor for S. aureus infections. Mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> is presently the treatment of choice for decolonizing the anterior nares. However, recent clinical trials show limited benefit from mupirocin prophylaxis in preventing nosocomial S. aureus infections, probably due to (re) colonization from extranasal carriage sites. Therefore, we studied the effectiveness of mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> treatment on the dynamics of S. aureus nasal and extranasal carriage. Twenty noncarriers, 26 intermittent carriers, and 16 persistent carriers had nasal, throat, and perineum samples taken 1 day before and 5 weeks after mupirocin treatment (twice daily for 5 days) and assessed for growth of S. aureus. The identities of cultured strains were assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the coagulase and protein A genes. The overall carriage rate (either nasal, pharyngeal, or perineal carrier or a combination) was significantly reduced after mupirocin treatment from 30 to 17 carriers (P = 0. 003). Of the 17 carriers, 10 (60 %) were still colonized with their old strain, 6 (35 %) were colonized with an exogenous strain, and 1 (5 %) was colonized with both. Two noncarriers became carriers after treatment. The acquisition of exogenous strains after mupirocin treatment is a common phenomenon. The finding warrants the use of mupirocin only in proven carriers for decolonization purposes. Mupirocin is effective overall in decolonizing nasal carriers but less effective in decolonizing extranasal sites...|$|E

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients admitted for surgery were treated with <b>nasal</b> mupirocin <b>ointment</b> and chlorhexidine soap for 5 days, irrespective of S. aureus carrier status. Nasal swabs were obtained before decolonization (T 1) and 4 days after surgery (T 2) and were inoculated onto agars containing 8 mg/L mupirocin. Staphylococci were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and mupirocin resistance was confirmed by Etest.

40|$|AbstractIn the 1950 s {{an unusually}} virulent and {{transmissible}} penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clone harbouring Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, known as phage type 80 / 81 and subsequently identified as multilocus sequence type (ST) 30, emerged and caused serious infections {{in hospitals and}} the community. We describe an outbreak of skin infections caused by a PVL-positive, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strain of ST 1472, related to phage type 80 / 81, in three associated occupational centres. After identification of the first patient an active case-finding strategy was initiated among the three centres. Epidemiological and clinical features were indistinguishable from outbreaks currently caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The S. aureus was cultured and identified from nasal swabs and skin lesions by conventional methods; PVL was detected using a PCR assay. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and DNA-array-based genotyping were applied to MSSA isolates. MSSA was identified in nasal swabs from 49 of 133 individuals (37 %). A single pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern, belonging to ST 1472 (CC 30) and PVL positivity, were detected in 20 individuals, including eight of 18 skin cultures, i. e. 15 % of the screened individuals were colonized by the epidemic strain.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preoperative {{screening}} for nasal S. aureus carriage, followed by eradication treatment of identified carriers with <b>nasal</b> mupirocine <b>ointment</b> and chlorhexidine soap was highly effective in preventing deep-seated S. aureus infections. It is unknown how cost-effectiveness of this intervention {{is affected by}} suboptimal S. aureus screening. We determined cost-effectiveness of different preoperative S. aureus screening regimes. METHODS: We compared different screening scenarios (ranging from treating all patients without screening to treating only identified S. aureus carriers) to the base case scenario without any screening and treatment. Screening and treatment costs as well as costs and mortality due to deep-seated S. aureus infection were derived from hospital databases and prospectively collected data, respectively. RESULTS: As compared to the base case scenario, all scenarios are associated with improved health care outcomes at reduced costs. Treating all patients without screening is most cost-beneficial, saving € 7339 per life year gained, as compared to € 3330 when only identified carriers are treated. In sensitivity analysis, outcomes are susceptible to {{the sensitivity of the}} screening test and the efficacy of treatment. Reductions in these parameters would reduce the cost-effectiveness of scenarios in which treatment is based on screening. When only identified S. aureus carriers are treated costs of screening should be less than € 6. 23 to become the dominant strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative screening and eradication of S. aureus carriage to prevent deep-seated S. aureus infections saves both life years and medical costs at the same time, although treating all patients without screening is the dominant strategy, resulting in most health gains and largest savings...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Experts {{and policy}} makers have {{repeatedly}} called for universal screening at hospital admission to reduce nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. OBJECTIVE: To {{determine the effect of}} an early MRSA detection strategy on nosocomial MRSA infection rates in surgical patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective, interventional cohort study conducted between July 2004 and May 2006 among 21 754 surgical patients at a Swiss teaching hospital using a crossover design to compare 2 MRSA control strategies (rapid screening on admission plus standard infection control measures vs standard infection control alone). Twelve surgical wards including different surgical specialties were enrolled according to a prespecified agenda, assigned to either the control or intervention group for a 9 -month period, then switched over to the other group for a further 9 months. INTERVENTIONS: During the rapid screening intervention periods, patients admitted to the intervention wards for more than 24 hours were screened before or on admission by rapid, multiplex polymerase chain reaction. For both intervention (n= 10 844) and control (n= 10 910) periods, standard infection control measures were used for patients with MRSA in all wards and consisted of contact isolation of MRSA carriers, use of dedicated material (eg, gown, gloves, mask if indicated), adjustment of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis of MRSA carriers, computerized MRSA alert system, and topical decolonization (<b>nasal</b> mupirocin <b>ointment</b> and chlorhexidine body washing) for 5 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection, MRSA surgical site infection, and rates of nosocomial acquisition of MRSA. RESULTS: Overall, 10 193 of 10 844 patients (94 %) were screened during the intervention periods. Screening identified 515 MRSA-positive patients (5. 1 %), including 337 previously unknown MRSA carriers. Median time from screening to notification of test results was 22. 5 hours (interquartile range, 12. 2 - 28. 2 hours). In the intervention periods, 93 patients (1. 11 per 1000 patient-days) developed nosocomial MRSA infection compared with 76 in the control periods (0. 91 per 1000 patient-days; adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 85 - 1. 69; P =. 29). The rate of MRSA surgical site infection and nosocomial MRSA acquisition did not change significantly. Fifty-three of 93 infected patients (57 %) in the intervention wards were MRSA-free on admission and developed MRSA infection during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: A universal, rapid MRSA admission screening strategy did not reduce nosocomial MRSA infection in a surgical department with endemic MRSA prevalence but relatively low rates of MRSA infection.

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} the clinically relevant aspects of nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus. The epidemiology, associated risk, {{and the effects}} of eradication are discussed. The main conclusions are that nasal carriage of S. aureus is a well-defined risk factor for subsequent infection in nearly all categories of hospitalized patients that have been studied. However, studies that have been performed to evaluate the effect of eradication of carriage using mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> have been inconclusive so far in most subgroups. Only in patients on hemodialysis or chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was a significant reduction of the infection rate found.

In surgical patients two randomized studies have found an effect on the surgical site infection rate in carriers that, when those studies are combined, was close to being statistically significant (p = 0. 06). In non-surgical patients a significant delay in the onset of infection was found but the overall infection rate was not significantly different. When the results of all well-designed studies that have been performed are combined, a significant reduction of the nosocomial S. aureus infections in carriers is found (approximately 50 % lower).

MRSA-positive patients were started on suppression therapy of mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> (2 per cent) and undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate bodywash. Results: A total of 18 810 samples were processed, of which 850 (4 · 5 per cent) were MRSA positive.

40|$|Background: A multi centre {{double-blind}} randomised-controlled trial (M-RCT), {{carried out}} in the Netherlands in 2005 – 2007, showed that hospitalised patients with S. aureus nasal carriage who were treated prophylactically with mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> and chlorhexidine gluconate medicated soap (MUP-CHX), had a significantly lower risk of health-care associated S. aureus infections than patients receiving placebo (3. 4 % vs. 7. 7 %, RR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 23 – 0. 75). The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether treatment of patients undergoing elective cardiothoracic or orthopaedic surgery with MUP-CHX (screen-and-treat strategy) affected the costs of patient care. Methods: We compared hospital costs of patients undergoing cardiothoracic or orthopaedic surgery (n = 415) in one of the participating centres of the M-RCT. Data from the ‘Planning and Control ’ department were used to calculate total hospital costs of the patients. Total costs were calculated including nursing days, costs of surgery, costs for laboratory and radiological tests, functional assessments and other costs. Costs for personnel, materials and overhead were also included. Mean costs in the two treatment arms were compared using the t-test for equality of means (two-tailed). Subgroup analysis was performed for cardiothoracic and orthopaedic patients. Results: An investigator-blinded analysis revealed that costs of care in the treatment arm (MUP-CHX, n = 210) were on average J 1911 lower per patient than costs of care in the placebo arm (n = 205) (J 8602 vs. J 10513, p = 0. 01).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical impact of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] infections on the total burden of disease. A guideline on empirical antimicrobial eradication of MRSA in carriers was developed based on a systematic review of literature. A distinction was made between uncomplicated and complicated carriage depending on {{presence or absence of}} skin lesions, foreign body material, mupirocin resistance or detection of MRSA exclusively outside the nose. First choice empirical treatment in uncomplicated carriage is a combination of mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> and disinfecting soap. First choice empirical treatment in complicated carriage is mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> and disinfecting soap together with a combination of two antibiotics. We evaluated the effectiveness of this guideline in a prospective cohort study in 18 Dutch centres. Eradication occurred more frequently among those treated according to the guideline. However, adding systemic antibiotic therapy to topical treatment in all patients with extranasal carriage, chronic pulmonary disease or ADL-dependence may further increase treatment success. We quantified changes in annual trends of nosocomial bacteraemias [NB] in a Dutch tertiary care centre. We concluded that the incidence density is sensitive to changes in hospital number of patient-days over time and most accurately reflects the risk per day in the hospital. We hypothesized that an increased incidence density of NB caused by MRSA was associated with a reduced incidence of NB caused by other pathogens, resulting in similar trends in total incidence rates of NB in hospitals with and without MRSA endemicity. We therefore calculated annual incidence densities of NB of MRSA and all other pathogens in 7 hospitals with, and 5 hospitals without emergence of MRSA from 1998 through 2007. Originating from a comparable total burden of NB in 1998, the incidence density of MRSA and non-MRSA antibiotic-resistant bacteria increased more in MRSA endemic hospitals, resulting in a 29 % higher total burden of NB after 10 years, demonstrating that emergence of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurs in addition to infections caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria. We quantified inadequate antibiotic therapy for S. aureus bacteraemia in Western Europe and aimed to identify determinants of inadequate treatment and variables associated with 30 -day mortality by including all adult patients with S. aureus bacteraemia in 60 randomly selected hospitals over a period of two months. 21 % of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] bacteraemias received inadequate empirical therapy, versus 28 % of MRSA bacteraemias. Neither inadequate empirical treatment nor methicillin resistance was associated with 30 -day mortality. We aimed to quantify the risk of mortality associated with MRSA versus MSSA bacteraemia, and to determine the effect of confounding factors hereon in a meta-analysis of observational studies. Comorbidity, severity of illness at onset of bacteraemia and appropriateness of treatment were considered the most important confounders. In 73 studies the unadjusted attributable mortality risk for mortality due to a bacteraemia caused by a MRSA versus MSSA was 13 %. In 35 studies that adjusted for confounders the adjusted attributable mortality risk decreased to 9 %. Finally, 7 studies that adjusted for the three key confounding variables yielded an attributable mortality risk of 4 %...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of mupirocin prophylaxis in preventing nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus infections in nonsurgical patients. Design. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial. Method. In three tertiary-care university hospitals and one peripheral teaching hospital, 1602 culture-proven nasal S. aureus carriers hospitalized on nonsurgical wards were treated with mupirocin 2 % <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> (n = 793) or placebo ointment (n = 809), twice daily for 5 days, starting 1 to 3 days after admission. Data collected included nosocomial S. aureus infections according to defined criteria, in-hospital mortality, duration of hospitalisation, and time to nosocomial S. aureus infection. S. aureus isolates were genotyped to assess whether infection was caused by endogenous strains. Results. The mupirocin and placebo {{groups did not differ}} statistically significantly in the rates of nosocomial S. aureus infections (mupirocin group: 2. 6 %; placebo group: 2. 8 %; risk difference: 0. 2 % (95 % CI: - 1. 5 %- 1. 9 %)), mortality (mupirocin: 3. 0 %; placebo: 2. 8 %; risk difference: - 0. 2 % (95 % CI: - 1. 9 %- 1. 5 %)), or duration of hospitalisation (median for both groups: 8 days). However, the time to nosocomial S. aureus infection was increased in the mupirocin group from 12 to 25 days (p = 0. 28). A total of 77 % of S. aureus nosocomial infections were endogenous. Conclusion. Routine culture for nasal carriage of S. aureus at admission and subsequent mupirocin prophylaxis in the carriers did not prevent nosocomial S. aureus infections in nonsurgical patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Skin infections due to Staphylococcus aureus have {{recently}} become a public concern, {{mainly because of}} emerging resistance against widely used antibiotics and specific virulence determinants. Strains harboring the lukS-lukF gene (which codes for Panton-Valentine leukocidin) are frequently associated with severe furunculosis. Generally applicable strategies for the control of community outbreaks of furunculosis have not been defined. Methods: We report the investigation and successful termination of an outbreak of furunculosis due to lukS-lukF-positive S. aureus in a German village (n= 144). Nasal swab specimens were obtained from village residents. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Nasally colonized persons, persons who had current furuncles or who had experienced relapsing furuncles since 2002, and their family members underwent stringent decolonization measures using mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> and disinfecting wash solution. Multiple nasal swab specimens were obtained to monitor the long-term outcome of decolonization measures. Results: From January 1998 through December 2004, 42 cases and 59 relapses of furunculosis were identified by active case finding. Of 140 participants tested, 51 (36 %) {{were found to be}} nasally colonized with S. aureus. In 9 participants, the strain was positive for lukS-lukF. No methicillin resistance was detected. Risk of furunculosis was associated with contact with case patients (relative risk, 6. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 2 - 14. 3) and nasal colonization with a lukS-lukF-positive strain of S. aureus (relative risk, 3. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 3 - 5. 9). Passive surveillance implemented in January 2005 did not detect any case of lukS-lukF-positive, S. aureus-associated furuncles in this village. Conclusion: This report describes a successful strategy for terminating the transmission of epidemic strains of S. aureus among a nonhospitalized population...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundChronic airway {{infection}} with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF) is an increasing clinical problem, and therapeutic options are limited. Because chronic {{infection with}} MRSA {{can be associated with}} accelerated decline in lung function, eradication of MRSA is attempted in most CF centres today. The aim of this observational prospective cohort study was to determine whether it is possible to eradicate MRSA from airways of CF patients using prolonged oral antibiotic combination therapy together with topical decolonization measures. ResultsEleven CF patients, (median age: 9 years (range 1 – 43); median FEV 1 : 91 %pred (95 %CI 74 %– 100 %pred)) who were chronically infected with MRSA, were treated daily for six months with rifampicin and fusidic acid orally. This study did not include a patient control group. Two patients had to switch to an alternative schedule, using rifampicin and clindamycin, due to the resistance pattern of MRSA. Topical decolonization measures were applied to all patients and included mupirocin-containing <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> in both nostrils three times daily for five days and chlorhexidine hair and body wash once daily for five days. Microbiological eradication was achieved in all patients {{at the end of the}} six-month eradication protocol, even when significant time (range 18 months to 9 years) had elapsed since initial isolation. In only one patient MRSA reappeared in the six-month follow-up period after the initial study period. Side-effects, like nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were seen in five out of eleven patients, but did not lead to therapy cessation. ConclusionChronic MRSA infection can be eradicated from respiratory tract samples using a six month dual antibiotic regimen and topical MRSA decolonization measures...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the clinical course and successful treatment of two cases of methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) keratitis. In case 1, MRSA keratitis occurred 5 days after cataract extraction, associated with endophthalmitis; in case 2, diagnosis was made 19 months after penetrating keratoplasty. Treatment {{in both cases}} consisted of topical fortified vancomycin and fortified bacitracin. A third topical antibiotic, polymyxin B-trimethoprim, {{was added to the}} therapeutic regimen in case 2, one month into the treatment. Oral doxycycline was prescribed to reduce collagenase activity and treat blepharitis. Mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment</b> and skin antiseptics were used to decrease and eliminate potential MRSA colonization. Topical prednisolone acetate 1 % was applied conservatively to mitigate inflammation in both cases. In case 2, topical cyclosporine A was also used for similar purposes. Keratitis may have worsened while on these immune-modulating drops, especially in case 2, and eradication of infection may have been slowed. Eventually both patients achieved full resolution of infection. Duration of keratitis was 3 and 1. 5 months, respectively. Polyantimicrobial therapy is effective in eradicating MRSA-related postoperative keratitis. Topical fortified vancomycin and fortified bacitracin were used in both cases, with a third topical antibiotic, polymyxin B-trimethoprim, also required in case 2. Oral doxycycline, nasal mupirocin, and antiseptic soap may be useful adjuncts in management. Treatment time to achieve full resolution may be prolonged relative to other types of bacterial keratitis. Alterations in immune status may have lengthened the time of treatment. Our two patients were immune compromised and were also susceptible to endophthalmitis. It is possible that topical immune-modulating drops such as prednisolone acetate may potentiate MRSA infection, and if used, should be only done so with great caution...|$|E
40|$|A six month {{prospective}} study {{was carried out}} in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) of a university hospital to assess the incidence and routes of exogenous colonization by Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 157 patients were included in the study. One thousand one hundred and eleven specimens (nasal, surgical wound swabs, tracheal secretions obtained on admission and once a week thereafter, and all clinical specimens) were collected over a four month period from patients without nasal decontamination (A). They were compared with 729 specimens collected over a two month period from patients treated with nasal mupirocin ointment (B). All S. aureus strains were typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis after SmaI macrorestriction. The nasal colonization rates on admission were 25. 5 and 32. 7 % in groups A and B, respectively. Thirty-one untreated patients (31. 3 %) and three patients (5. 1 %) treated with <b>nasal</b> <b>ointment,</b> acquired the nasal S. aureus in the SICU (P = 0. 00027). Nasal carriers were more frequently colonized in the bronchopulmonary tract (Bp) and surgical wound (Sw) (62 %) than patients who were not nasal carriers (14 %) (P < 0. 00001). The patterns were identical for nasal, Bp and Sw strains from the same patient. RFLP analysis characterized seven epidemic strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) which colonized 60 % of group A and 9 % of group B patients (P < 0. 00001). The bronchopulmonary tract infection rate was reduced in group B (P = 0. 032). In conclusion, in an SICU, nasal carriage of S. aureus appeared to be the source of endogenous and cross- colonization. The use of nasal mupirocin ointment reduced the incidence of Bp and Sw colonization, as well as the MRSA infection rate...|$|E
