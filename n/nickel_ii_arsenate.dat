In the present study, a novel adsorbent called mesoparticle graphene sand composite (MGSCaps) was synthesised from arenga palm sugar and sand by using a green, simple, low cost and efficient methodology. Subsequently, this composite was characterised and identified using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and elemental mapping (EM). The adsorption process was investigated and optimised under the experimental parameters such as pH, contact time and bed depth. The results showed that the interaction between <b>nickel</b> (<b>II)</b> and MGSCaps was not ion to ion interaction hence removal of Ni (II) can be applied at any pH. The results were also exhibited the higher contact time and bed depth, the higher removal percentage of <b>nickel</b> (<b>II)</b> occurred.
