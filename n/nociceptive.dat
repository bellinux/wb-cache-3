5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. pinching) or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling nerve endings found {{in most parts of}} the body (called <b>nociceptive</b> pain), or it may be caused by diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as pins and needles.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than <b>nociceptive</b> pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in any sensory modality—visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, proprioceptive, equilibrioceptive, <b>nociceptive,</b> thermoceptive and chronoceptive.|$|E
25|$|Injection of {{formalin}} {{into the}} cheliped of shore crabs (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) evokes specific <b>nociceptive</b> behavior and neurochemical {{responses in the}} brain and thoracic ganglion.|$|E
25|$|When shore crabs (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) have {{formalin}} {{injected into}} the cheliped (claw), this evokes specific <b>nociceptive</b> behavior and neurochemical responses in the thoracic ganglia and the brain.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{pain can}} be caused by {{pressure}} on, or chemical stimulation of, specialised pain-signalling nerve endings called nociceptors (<b>nociceptive</b> pain), or by damage or illness affecting nerve fibers themselves (neuropathic pain).|$|E
25|$|The pain {{associated}} with RA is induced {{at the site}} of inflammation and classified as <b>nociceptive</b> as opposed to neuropathic. The joints are often affected in a fairly symmetrical fashion, although this is not specific, and the initial presentation may be asymmetrical.|$|E
25|$|The sensory {{function}} of the trigeminal nerve is to provide tactile, proprioceptive, and <b>nociceptive</b> afference to the face and mouth. Its motor function activates the muscles of mastication, the tensor tympani, tensor veli palatini, mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric.|$|E
25|$|Nociception {{has been}} {{documented}} in non-mammalian animals, including fish and {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including leeches, nematode worms, sea slugs, and fruit flies. As in mammals, <b>nociceptive</b> neurons in these species are typically characterized by responding preferentially to high temperature (40° Celsius or more), low pH, capsaicin, and tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|The (spinal cord) {{dorsal horn}} neurons {{give rise to}} the spinothalamic tract (STT), which {{constitutes}} the major ascending <b>nociceptive</b> pathway. As a consequence of spontaneous activity arising in the periphery, STT neurons develop increased background activity, enlarged receptive fields and increased responses to afferent impulses, including normally innocuous tactile stimuli. This phenomenon is called central sensitization. Central sensitization is an important mechanism of persistent neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{chronic pain}} {{associated}} with non-healing wounds {{is caused by}} tissue (<b>nociceptive)</b> or nerve (neuropathic) damage and is influenced by dressing changes and chronic inflammation. Chronic wounds {{take a long time}} to heal and patients can suffer from chronic wounds for many years. Chronic wound healing may be compromised by coexisting underlying conditions, such as venous valve backflow, peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled edema and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{acetic acid}} (or the acetate ion) can cause {{additional}} problems. One {{study found that}} injecting sodium acetate into rats caused them to have <b>nociceptive</b> behavior (headaches). In addition, there is a biochemical explanation for this finding. High acetate levels cause adenosine to accumulate {{in many parts of}} the brain. But when the rats were given caffeine, which blocks the action of adenosine, they no longer experienced headaches.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nociceptive</b> {{threshold}} testing deliberately applies a noxious {{stimulus to}} a human or animal subject in order to study pain. In animals, the technique {{is often used to}} study the efficacy of analgesic drugs and to establish dosing levels and period of effect. After establishing a baseline, the drug under test is given and the elevation in threshold recorded at specified time points. When the drug wears off, the threshold should return to the baseline (pre-treatment) value.|$|E
25|$|Further, recent {{research}} has found that ketamine, a sedative, is capable of blocking referred pain. The study was conducted on patients suffering from fibromyalgia, a disease characterized by joint and muscle pain and fatigue. These patients were looked at specifically due to their increased sensitivity to <b>nociceptive</b> stimuli. Furthermore, referred pain appears in a different pattern in fibromyalgic patients than non-fibromyalgic patients. Often this difference manifests as a difference in terms of the area that the referred pain is found (distal vs. proximal) as compared to the local pain. The area is also much more exaggerated owing to the increased sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|The higher brain {{works by}} {{regulating}} subcortical processes. High placebo responses link with enhanced dopamine and mu-opioid {{activity in the}} circuitry for reward responses and motivated behavior of the nucleus accumbens, and, on the converse, anti-analgesic nocebos responses were associated with deactivation {{in this part of}} the brain of dopamine and opioid release. (It has been known that placebo analgesia depends upon the release in the brain of endogenous opioids since 1978.) Such analgesic placebos activation changes processing lower down in the brain by enhancing the descending inhibition through the periaqueductal gray on spinal <b>nociceptive</b> reflexes, while the expectations of anti-analgesic nocebos acts in the opposite way to block this.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{who suffer}} from chronic pain {{experience}} prolonged pain at sites {{that may have been}} previously injured, yet are otherwise currently healthy. This phenomenon is related to neuroplasticity due to a maladaptive reorganization of the nervous system, both peripherally and centrally. During the period of tissue damage, noxious stimuli and inflammation cause an elevation of <b>nociceptive</b> input from the periphery to the central nervous system. Prolonged nociception from the periphery then elicits a neuroplastic response at the cortical level to change its somatotopic organization for the painful site, inducing central sensitization. For instance, individuals experiencing complex regional pain syndrome demonstrate a diminished cortical somatotopic representation of the hand contralaterally as well as a decreased spacing between the hand and the mouth. Additionally, chronic pain has been reported to significantly reduce the volume of grey matter in the brain globally, and more specifically at the prefrontal cortex and right thalamus. However, following treatment, these abnormalities in cortical reorganization and grey matter volume are resolved, as well as their symptoms. Similar results have been reported for phantom limb pain, chronic low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
500|$|In {{the long}} term, {{the loss of}} muscle {{function}} can have additional effects from disuse, including atrophy of the muscle. [...] Immobility can lead to pressure sores, [...] particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure. In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure. [...] Another complication is pain, including <b>nociceptive</b> pain (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and neuropathic pain, when [...] nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals {{in the absence of}} noxious stimuli. Spasticity, the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI. It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes. [...] It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy. Spasticity increases the risk of contractures (shortening of muscles, tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day. [...] Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure. Loss of bone density (bone demineralization), thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures. Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas, [...] called heterotopic ossification. [...] It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27% of people.|$|E
2500|$|The common brown shrimp Crangon crangon and the prawns Palaemon serratue and Palaemon elegana all {{exhibit a}} <b>nociceptive</b> {{sensitivity}} to both {{hot and cold}} temperatures. [...] Both thermal sensitivity levels and <b>nociceptive</b> thresholds change with changes in acclimation temperature.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of research on pain in crustaceans has used (semi-) aquatic, decapoda species. [...] Animals living in largely different environments are unlikely to have developed the same <b>nociceptive</b> or pain-detecting neural mechanisms. Different environments will result in diverse selection pressures on different animal groups, as well as exposing them to differing types of <b>nociceptive</b> stimuli. For example, crustaceans living in an aquatic world can maintain {{a certain level of}} buoyancy, so the risk of collision due to gravity is limited compared with a terrestrial vertebrate. Similarly, noxious chemicals might be diluted considerably in an aquatic environment compared to terrestrial. [...] Therefore, <b>nociceptive</b> and pain systems in aquatic animals may be quite dissimilar to terrestrial animals.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nociceptive</b> {{responses}} are reflexes {{that do not}} change regardless of motivational priorities. [...] In contrast, a painful experience may change the motivation for normal behavioural responses, thereby indicating a plastic response to an aversive stimulus, rather than a simple reflex response.|$|E
2500|$|In vertebrates, <b>nociceptive</b> {{responses}} {{involve the}} transmission of a signal along a chain of nerve fibres {{from the site of}} a noxious stimulus at the periphery, to the spinal cord. This process evokes a reflex arc response such as flinching or immediate withdrawal of a limb, generated at the spinal cord and not involving the brain. [...] Nociception is found, in one form or another, across all major animal taxa. Nociception can be observed using modern imaging techniques and both physiological and behavioural responses to nociception can be detected. [...] Many crustacean species, including the rockpool prawn (Palaemon elegans), exhibit the caridoid escape reaction – an immediate, <b>nociceptive,</b> reflex tail-flick response to noxious stimuli (see here).|$|E
2500|$|Afferent <b>nociceptive</b> fibers (those {{that send}} {{information}} to, {{rather than from}} the brain) travel back to the spinal cord where they form synapses in its dorsal horn. This <b>nociceptive</b> fiber (located in the periphery) is a first order neuron. The cells in the dorsal horn are divided into physiologically distinct layers called laminae. Different fiber types form synapses in different layers, and use either glutamate or substance P as the neurotransmitter. Aδ fibers form synapses in laminae I and V, C fibers connect with neurons in lamina II, Aβ fibers connect with lamina I, III, & V. [...] After reaching the specific lamina within the spinal cord, the first order <b>nociceptive</b> project to second order neurons that cross the midline at the anterior white commissure. The second order neurons then send their information via two pathways to the thalamus: the dorsal column medial-lemniscal system and the anterolateral system. The first is reserved more for regular non-painful sensation, while the lateral is reserved for pain sensation. Upon reaching the thalamus, the information is processed in the ventral posterior nucleus and sent to the cerebral cortex in the brain via fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. As there is an ascending pathway to the brain that initiates the conscious realization of pain, there also is a descending pathway which modulates pain sensation. The brain can request the release of specific hormones or chemicals that can have analgesic effects which can reduce or inhibit pain sensation. The area of the brain that stimulates the release of these hormones is the hypothalamus.|$|E
2500|$|Nociception {{has been}} {{documented}} in non-mammalian animals, including fish [...] and {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including leeches, nematode worms, sea slugs, and fruit flies. Although these neurons may have different pathways and relationships to the central nervous system than mammalian nociceptors, <b>nociceptive</b> neurons in non-mammals often fire in response to similar stimuli as mammals, such as high temperature (40 degrees C or more), low pH, capsaicin, and tissue damage.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{component}} is {{the experience of}} [...] "pain" [...] itself, or suffering – the internal, emotional interpretation of the <b>nociceptive</b> experience. Again in humans, this is when the withdrawn finger begins to hurt, moments after the withdrawal. Pain is therefore a private, emotional experience. <b>Nociceptive</b> reflexes act to immediately remove the animal {{or part of the}} body from a (potentially) damaging stimulus. [...] However, without learning from this experience, the animal would likely expose itself to the damaging stimulus repeatedly. [...] Pain has the adaptive advantage that it invokes a level of learning, thereby preventing the animal from repeatedly exposing itself to potential injury. Pain cannot be directly measured in other animals, including other humans; responses to putatively painful stimuli can be measured, but not the experience itself. To address this problem when assessing the capacity of other species to experience pain, argument-by-analogy is used. This is based on the principle that if an animal responds to a stimulus in a similar way to ourselves, it is likely to have had an analogous experience.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the beta}} cell {{produces}} insulin from proinsulin, a connecting peptide (or C-peptide) is also manufactured and {{released into the}} bloodstream. [...] Absence of C-peptide in the blood indicates that insulin has not been released from the pancreas, and this fact confirms the diagnosis of diabetes type 1. [...] C-peptide {{was believed to be}} only a by-product of natural insulin production; however, recent studies suggest that C-peptide exerts beneficial therapeutic effects on diabetic <b>nociceptive</b> neuropathy.|$|E
2500|$|Complex {{regional}} pain {{syndrome is}} a multifactorial disorder with clinical features of neurogenic inflammation (swelling {{in the central}} nervous system), <b>nociceptive</b> sensitisation (which causes extreme sensitivity or allodynia), vasomotor dysfunction (blood flow problems which cause swelling and discolouration) and maladaptive neuroplasticity (where the brain changes and adapts with constant pain signals); CRPS {{is the result of}} an [...] "aberrant [...] response to tissue injury". The [...] "underlying neuronal matrix" [...] of CRPS is seen to involve cognitive and motor as well as <b>nociceptive</b> processing; pinprick stimulation of a CRPS affected limb was painful (mechanical hyperalgesia) and showed a [...] "significantly increased activation" [...] of not just the S1 cortex (contralateral), S2 (bilateral) areas, and insula (bilateral) but also the associative-somatosensory cortices (contralateral), frontal cortices, and parts of the anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast to previous thoughts reflected in the name RSD, it appears that there is reduced Sympathetic Nervous System outflow, at least in the affected region (although there may be sympatho-afferent coupling). Wind-up (the increased sensation of pain with time) and central nervous system (CNS) sensitization are key neurologic processes that appear {{to be involved in the}} induction and maintenance of CRPS.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nociceptive</b> pain {{is caused}} by {{stimulation}} of sensory nerve fibers that respond to stimuli approaching or exceeding harmful intensity (nociceptors), and may be classified according to the mode of noxious stimulation. The most common categories are [...] "thermal" [...] (e.g. heat or cold), [...] "mechanical" [...] (e.g. crushing, tearing, shearing, etc.) and [...] "chemical" [...] (e.g. iodine in a cut or chemicals released during inflammation). Some nociceptors respond {{to more than one}} of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{may take}} place at the central level after peripheral nerve damage. The loss of afferent signals induces functional changes in dorsal horn neurons. A decrease in the large fiber input decreases the activity of interneurons inhibiting <b>nociceptive</b> neurons i.e. loss of afferent inhibition. Hypoactivity of the descending antinociceptive systems or loss of descending inhibition may be another factor. With the loss of neuronal input (deafferentation) the STT neurons begin to fire spontaneously, a phenomenon designated [...] "deafferentation hypersensitivity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, the {{adaptive}} value of sensitisation due to injury {{was tested using}} the predatory interactions between longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii) and black sea bass (Centropristis striata) which are natural predators of this squid. [...] If injured squid are targeted by a bass, they began their defensive behaviours sooner (indicated by greater alert distances and longer flight initiation distances) than uninjured squid. [...] If anaesthetic (1% ethanol and MgCl2) is administered prior to the injury, this prevents the sensitisation and blocks the behavioural effect. [...] The authors claim {{this study is the}} first experimental evidence to support the argument that <b>nociceptive</b> sensitisation is actually an adaptive response to injuries.|$|E
2500|$|Another partial splint is the <b>nociceptive</b> trigeminal {{inhibition}} tension {{suppression system}} (NTI-TSS) dental guard. This splint snaps onto {{the upper front}} teeth only. It is theorized to prevent tissue damages primarily by reducing the bite force from attempts to close the jaw normally into a forward twisting of the lower front teeth. The intent is for the brain to interpret the nerve sensations as undesirable, automatically and subconsciously reducing clenching force. However, there may be potential for the NTI-TSS device {{to act as a}} Dahl appliance, holding the posterior teeth out of occlusion and leading to their over-eruption, deranging the occlusion (i.e. [...] it may cause the teeth to move position). Hence, ongoing follow-ups are recommended.|$|E
2500|$|GIRK {{channels}} {{have been}} demonstrated in vivo {{to be involved in}} opioid- and ethanol-induced analgesia. These specific channels have been the target of recent studies dealing with genetic variance and sensitivity to opioid analgesics due to their role in opioid-induced analgesia. [...] Several studies have shown that when opioids are prescribed to treat chronic pain, GIRK channels are activated by certain GPCRs, namely opioid receptors, which leads to the inhibition of <b>nociceptive</b> transmission, thus functioning in pain relief. [...] Furthermore, studies have shown that G proteins, specifically the Gi alpha subunit, directly activate GIRKs which were found to participate in propagation of morphine-induced analgesia in inflamed spines of mice. Research pertaining to chronic pain management continues to be performed in this field.|$|E
2500|$|C fibers synapse to second-order {{projection}} neurons in {{the spinal}} cord at the upper laminae of the dorsal horn in the substantia gelatinosa. The second-order projection neurons are of the wide dynamic range (WDR) type, which receive input from both <b>nociceptive</b> terminals as well as myelinated A-type fibers. There are three types of second order projection neurons in the spinothalamic tract: wide dynamic range (WDR), high threshold (HT), and low threshold (LT). These classifications are based on their responses to mechanical stimuli. [...] The second-order neurons ascend to the brain stem and thalamus in the ventrolateral, or anterolateral, quadrant of the contralateral half of {{the spinal cord}}, forming the spinothalamic tract. The spinothalamic tract is the main pathway associated with pain and temperature perception, which immediately crosses the spinal cord laterally. This crossover feature is clinically important because it allows for identification of the location of injury.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nociceptive</b> pain {{may also}} be divided into [...] "visceral", [...] "deep somatic" [...] and [...] "superficial somatic" [...] pain. Visceral {{structures}} are highly sensitive to stretch, ischemia and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures, such as burning and cutting. Visceral pain is diffuse, difficult to locate and often referred to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull. Deep somatic pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fasciae and muscles, and is dull, aching, poorly-localized pain. Examples include sprains and broken bones. Superficial pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue, and is sharp, well-defined and clearly located. Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor (first degree) burns.|$|E
2500|$|Under normal conditions, pain {{conduction}} {{begins with}} some noxious signal {{followed by an}} action potential carried by <b>nociceptive</b> (pain sensing) afferent neurons, which elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. That message is then relayed to the cerebral cortex, where we translate those EPSPs into [...] "pain." [...] Since the discovery of astrocytic influence, {{our understanding of the}} conduction of pain has been dramatically complicated. Pain processing is no longer seen as a repetitive relay of signals from body to brain, but as a complex system that can be up- and down-regulated by a number of different factors. One factor at the forefront of recent research is in the pain-potentiating synapse located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the role of astrocytes in encapsulating these synapses. Garrison and co-workers were the first to suggest association when they found a correlation between astrocyte hypertrophy in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and hypersensitivity to pain after peripheral nerve injury, typically considered an indicator of glial activation after injury.|$|E
2500|$|Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray {{matter of}} the {{midbrain}} activates enkephalin-releasing neurons that project to the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. 5-HT (serotonin) released from the raphe nuclei descends to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where it forms excitatory connections with the [...] "inhibitory interneurons" [...] located in Laminae II (aka the substantia gelatinosa). When activated, these interneurons release either enkephalin or dynorphin (endogenous opioid neurotransmitters), which bind to mu opioid receptors on the axons of incoming C and A-delta fibers carrying pain signals from nociceptors activated in the periphery. The activation of the mu-opioid receptor inhibits the release of substance P from these incoming first-order neurons and, in turn, inhibits the activation of the second-order neuron {{that is responsible for}} transmitting the pain signal up the spinothalamic tract to the ventroposteriolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. The <b>nociceptive</b> signal was inhibited before it was able to reach the cortical areas that interpret the signal as [...] "pain" [...] (such as the anterior cingulate). This is sometimes referred to as the Gate control theory of pain and is supported by the fact that electrical stimulation of the PAG results in immediate and profound analgesia. The periaqueductal gray is also activated by viewing distressing images associated with pain.|$|E
2500|$|Male Chasmagnathus granulatus crabs {{exhibit a}} [...] "defensive response" [...] to {{electric}} shocks. [...] During {{a study on}} the ability of shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) learning to avoid an electrical shock, it was observed that many crabs emerged from the dark shelter to avoid the shock thus entering a brightly light area which would normally be avoided. [...] Immediately after the injection of formalin (an irritant in mammals) or saline into one cheliped (the leg which ends with the claw), shore crabs move quickly into the corner of the aquarium and [...] "freeze" [...] after 2 to 3 seconds. [...] After 1 to 3 minutes, these injected animals are fidgety and exhibit a wide range of movements such as flexion, extension, shaking or rubbing the affected claw. Formalin-treated animals show 20-times more rubbing behaviour during the first minute after injection than saline-treated crabs. Intense rubbing of the claw results in autotomy (shedding) in 20% of animals of the formalin-treated group whereas saline-injected crabs do not autotomise the injected cheliped. [...] During the 10 minutes after injection, crabs in the formalin-treated group tried to use the intact cheliped, guarding the damaged cheliped. [...] The scientists conducting this study commented [...] "the present results obtained in crabs may be indicative of pain experience rather than relating to a simple <b>nociceptive</b> reflex". Other species of crab have been shown to autotomise legs when placed on a hot plate or exposed to a small electric shock.|$|E
