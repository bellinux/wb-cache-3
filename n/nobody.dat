5|$|An earlier, longer, {{work-in-progress}} {{version of}} the film was rejected for competition by the Cannes Film Festival, which offered that cut of Mr. <b>Nobody</b> an out-of-competition berth. Producer Philippe Godeau turned that down. The decision by the Cannes Film Festival not to exhibit the film created a national controversy. Eventually, the studio held the film's world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009. Six days later, Mr. <b>Nobody</b> screened as a special presentation during the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Additionally, the film was screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival before its theatrical release. Mr. <b>Nobody</b> had its American premiere on 25 June 2011, at the Los Angeles Film Festival, nearly two years since its original debut. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown at the festival. The Consul General of Belgium, Geert Criel, held a second United States screening of Mr. <b>Nobody</b> on 21 December 2011, at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica.|$|E

5|$|All of Van Dormael's films contain surreal elements. In {{his first}} two films, these moments were few, like dancing flowers in Toto le héros or Georges flying around the room in Le huitième jour. Mr. <b>Nobody</b> makes much more {{extensive}} use of surreal imagery throughout the film.|$|E

5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's <b>Nobody</b> in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the Whole Room... and There's <b>Nobody</b> in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E

5|$|Mr. <b>Nobody</b> has {{received}} accolades in categories ranging from {{recognition of the}} film itself, to its cinematography, direction and editing, to the cast's performance, particularly Jared Leto's portrayal of the film's protagonist, Nemo <b>Nobody.</b> The film was submitted for consideration for the Golden Lion at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, but lost to Lebanon (2009). Sylvie Olivé was later given the Golden Osella for Outstanding Technical Contribution for the production design while the film received the Biografilm Lancia Award.

5|$|Mr. <b>Nobody</b> is a 2009 {{science fiction}} drama film written and {{directed}} by Jaco Van Dormael and starring Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Linh Dan Pham, Rhys Ifans, Natasha Little, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple. The film tells the life story of Nemo <b>Nobody,</b> a 118-year-old man who is the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. Nemo, memory fading, refers to his three main loves and to his parents' divorce and subsequent hardships endured at three critical junctions in his life: at age nine, fifteen, and thirty-four. Alternate life paths branching out from each of those critical junctions are examined. The speculative narrative often changes course with the flick of a different possible decision at each of those ages. The film uses nonlinear narrative and the multiverse hypothesis style.|$|E
5|$|Mr. <b>Nobody</b> won six awards, {{including}} Best Film and Best Director for Jaco Van Dormael.
