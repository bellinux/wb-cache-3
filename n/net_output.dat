The typical base of various policy instruments used for this purpose is gross energy output of renewable energy. However, we show that basing policy instruments on gross energy output will result in problems associated with energy waste, economic inefficiency, and negative environmental effects. We recommend using <b>net</b> energy <b>output</b> as the base to apply price or quantity measures because it is <b>net</b> energy <b>output,</b> not gross energy output, which contributes to energy security.

25|$|How the {{distinction}} between productive and unproductive labor is drawn obviously has a big mathematical effect on the estimated total profit rate on production, if unproductive labor costs are excluded from the total variable capital outlay, and included {{in the part of}} total <b>net</b> <b>output</b> which represents total surplus value produced. If the proportion of unproductive labor increases, paradoxically the total surplus value will then also increase, with the effect of raising the rate of profit. Prof. Moseley resolves this paradoxical effect by distinguishing between primary and secondary income distributions, and between gross and net surplus value. In his account, first the total net value-added is produced by the productive workers, and then the gross wages of the unproductive workers are deducted from the gross surplus value; in that interpretation, it follows that the larger the wage-bill of unproductive workers is, the lower the netted surplus value will be. Chris Harman noted large quantitative differences in the estimates of unproductive labor by different orthodox Marxists. Moseley's calculations and his definition of unproductive labor have been criticized by other Marxists. The main objections discussed are conceptual and empirical.|$|E

2500|$|Generous {{depreciation}} write-off provisions or depletion allowances are {{in reality}} pure profit, or {{are at least}} partly a de facto profit component. The government may give tax incentives, provide guaranteed minimum prices, various economic subsidies etc. The statistical concept of [...] "economic depreciation" [...] (consumption of fixed capital) diverges considerably from actual depreciation – thus, economic depreciation is only an imputation, and is not directly derived from real gross revenue. If the total actual write-off is larger than economic depreciation, for example because of tax incentives for new fixed investment, {{it is likely that}} a component of profit income is being ignored in the statistical measure (there exists no other way to verify what the value of total <b>net</b> <b>output</b> is, than adding together the various components of factor income/expenditure).|$|E
2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of <b>net</b> <b>output</b> not returned as wages to the aggregate fixed capital stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated fixed capital stock plus inventory holdings (C), it is certainly true that almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the operating surplus associated with that physical stock, in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of capital value, raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E

40|$|A {{heat source}} can be {{considered}} as the Brayton cycle’s life support. This heat source can be extracted from solar energy. The small-scale open and direct solar thermal Brayton cycle with recuperator has several advantages, including lower cost, low operation and maintenance costs and it is highly recommended. The main disadvantages of this cycle are the pressure losses in the recuperator and receiver, turbo-machine efficiencies and recuperator effectiveness, which limit the <b>net</b> power <b>output</b> of such a system. The irreversibilities of the solar thermal Brayton cycle are mainly due to heat transfer across a finite temperature difference and fluid friction. Thermodynamic optimization can be applied to address these disadvantages to optimize the receiver and recuperator and to maximize the <b>net</b> power <b>output</b> of the system at any steady-state condition. The dynamic trajectory optimization method is applied to maximize the <b>net</b> power <b>output</b> of the system by optimizing the geometries of the receiver and recuperator limited to various constraints.
