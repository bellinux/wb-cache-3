5|$|With no secure bridges {{over the}} Nederrijn, the Allies {{were unable to}} advance further and the front line stabilised south of Arnhem. The British 1st Airborne Division had lost nearly three-quarters of its {{strength}} and did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> combat again.|$|E

50|$|In the Bahá'í Faith, God is <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> to be incarnated {{into this}} world and is <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> {{to be part of}} {{creation}} as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures. The Manifestations of God are also <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> as an incarnation of God, but are instead understood to be like a perfect mirror reflecting the attributes of God onto this material world.|$|R

5|$|Although Yorkshire and Lancashire were {{traditionally}} {{more relaxed}} about professionalism than other counties, cricket did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the same regional schisms {{on the topic}} that rugby and football did – there were debates over amateur status in first-class cricket, but these tensions were given release in the Gentlemen v Players fixture. Nevertheless, the annual North v South games {{were among the most}} popular and competitive in the sport, running annually from 1849 until 1900 and intermittently thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Walmsley {{joined the}} Army Air Forces {{and spent the}} 1940s as an {{instructor}} pilot in the United States and Japan, but did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> combat. He was deployed with the 8th Bombardment Squadron to the Korean War, flying B-26 Invader aircraft. During this time, Walmsley volunteered for a risky bombing campaign, Operation Strangle.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12. They {{took part in the}} Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes, but did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> combat with the Ottoman fleet. They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I, and they spent the war in Venice. The ships were discarded shortly {{after the end of the}} war, both having been stricken in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Both ships {{took part}} in the Italo-Turkish War in 1911–1912 in the 3rd Division with the two s. Emanuele Filiberto {{took part in}} the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, though Ammiraglio di Saint Bon did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action in the first months of the war. Both ships participated in the seizure of the island of Rhodes, where Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{provided}} gunfire support to the soldiers ashore.|$|E
5|$|Bovington Tank Museum, Dorset, UK. Tiger II {{with early}} {{production}} turret is on display. This vehicle {{was the second}} soft steel prototype made and did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> active service. This Tiger II's engine was removed {{for use in the}} restoration of Tiger 131, the only working example of a Tiger I. A production turret Tiger II is on loan from the Defence Academy, Shrivenham, UK. See below.|$|E
5|$|Carnot had {{a fairly}} uneventful career. She spent the {{majority}} of her service life in the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons of the French fleet, where she participated in extensive, annual maneuvers. She was withdrawn from service by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, and so did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action during the conflict. She remained in the French Navy's inventory until 1922, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap.|$|E

Durant was on the sidelines as starting quarterback Kerry Joseph led Roughriders to a victory over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Grey Cup.|$|E
5|$|During wartime, Swift {{became a}} special constable with {{responsibility}} for traffic control. He was enrolled in the RAF, and travelled to France after the Invasion of Normandy, but was stationed well behind the front line and did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> combat. This did not prevent risk to his life, however, as in 1944 a Dakota on which he was a passenger {{was involved in a}} near miss.|$|E
5|$|España {{served in}} the 1st Squadron after her commissioning, along with her two sisters. Spain {{remained}} neutral during World War I, so the Spanish fleet did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action during the conflict. España provided gunfire support during the Rif War in the early 1920s. During these operations, she ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas, Morocco in August 1923. The Navy was unable to raise the ship, and severe storms destroyed the wreck in 1924, which led the Navy to abandon her.|$|E

5|$|Following his January 1860 {{resignation}} from Parliament, Ollivier spearheaded a requisition, broadly {{supported by}} influential people, to have Brittan make himself {{available for the}} resulting by-election in the Christchurch Country electorate. Brittan declined the requisition, mostly because he was opposed to the rail tunnel scheme which had overwhelming support by the population, and he could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion. Isaac Thomas Cookson, who had earlier supported the Brittan requisition, was elected.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of the NEI, the Japanese Navy's main {{aircraft}} carrier force raided the Indian Ocean. This force attacked Ceylon in early April, and Vampire was sunk off Trincomalee on 12 April while escorting , which was also lost.

5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} {{it differently}} from the way non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E

Still, it did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> release as a whole for over four years after the last track was recorded.|$|E
