40|$|When the {{net effect}} of each of {{fourteen}} factors upon the profits for the year 1921 on 231 Warren County farms is measured by coefficients of <b>net</b> <b>correlation,</b> it is found that the most important factors, in order of importance, are the production per animal unit, efficiency in the use of man labor, value of the real estate per acre because it influences the deduction made for the use of land, crop yields, and the amount of pasture used to carry one animal unit. All other coefficients are too small to carry definite significance. The results, 2 ̆ 7 while not as conclusive as were expected, confirm in general the value of hypotheses tentatively held in organizing the analysis and demonstrate that care must be exercised in analyzing farm management data in order to determine whether apparent results are in fact due to the causes to which they are imputed. With data collected when farming conditions are more stable than were conditions in 1921, much better results can be expected. When economic conditions are in such a turbulent state, there are many additional and unusual factors introduced which cause wide variations in profits. In the absence of these unusual influences under more normal conditions, {{it is much easier to}} select a group of variables which will account for most of the significant influences on profits on individual farms. Much careful study is needed preliminary to launching upon the correlation problem to make sure that the variables included are the most important factors affecting the results studied and that they are in their simplest form. Each variable should afford an answer to a specific and definite question. It is very necessary to avoid including any phase of the same factor in more than one variable. The fact that relationships within economic data are seldom of a linear nature must be borne in mind in making a strict interpretation of results obtained by assuming straight-line relationships. If the precautions are taken necessary to secure satisfactory results, the method of partial or <b>net</b> <b>correlation</b> offers a much needed statistical tool for singling out the effect of anyone of many concomitant variables...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} total measure of multi-particle quantum {{correlation}} {{in a system}} of N two-level atoms (N qubits). We construct a parameter that encompasses all possible quantum correlations among N two-level atoms in arbitrary symmetric pure states and define its numerical value to be the total measure of the net atom-atom correlations. We use that parameter to quantify the total quantum correlations in atomic Schrödinger cat states, which are generated by the dispersive interaction in a cavity. We study the variation of the net amount of quantum correlation as we vary the number of atoms from N= 2 to N= 100 and obtain some interesting results. We also study the variation of the <b>net</b> <b>correlation,</b> for fixed interaction time, as we increase the number of atoms in the excited state of the initial system, and notice some interesting features. We also observe the behaviour of the net quantum correlation as we continuously increase the interaction time, for the general state of N two-level atoms in a dispersive cavity.

This protocol provides a versatile procedure for the synthesis of the title compounds with the advantages of easy work-up, mild reaction conditions and good yields. All compounds were also tested for antifungal properties against two clinically important fungi; Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{quenched}} random disorder (QRD) effects created by aerosil dispersion in octylcyanobiphenyl (8 CB) liquid crystal (LC) using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technique. Gelation process in the 8 CB+aerosil gels yields a QRD network which also changes the surface topography. By increasing the aerosil concentration, the original smooth pattern of LC sample surfaces is suppressed by creating a fractal aerosil surface effect, these surfaces become more porous, rougher with more and bigger crevices. The dispersed aerosil also serves as pinning centers for the liquid crystal molecules. It has been observed that via the diffusion-limited-aggregation process, aerosil nano-particles yield a fractal like surface pattern for the less disordered samples. As the aerosil dispersion increases, the surface can be described by more aggregated regions which also introduce more roughness. Using this fact, we have shown {{that there is a}} <b>net</b> <b>correlation</b> between the short-ranged x-ray peak widths (-the results of previous x-ray diffraction experiments-) and the calculated surface roughness.

30|$|In Brazil (Fig.  1), {{among all}} age-education groups (besides the less than primary completed), there are {{negative}} correlations between group size and earnings {{in the earliest}} period. The estimated elasticities in 1970 for the proportions of men in each age-education group generally indicate greater negative correlations for workers with primary completed or secondary completed. These negative effects are offset by the positive interactions throughout time for men up to 49  years of age, increasing the elasticities through time. Indeed, by 2010 the coefficients on the interaction terms nearly offset the negative coefficients of the main effect terms, {{so that in the}} more educated groups the <b>net</b> <b>correlation</b> of a change in the group proportions with earnings was much reduced. For men in the first three age groups (15 – 24, 25 – 34 and 35 – 49 years) with less than primary completed, the group proportions have positive correlations with earnings in 1970 and they become negative over time. Mexico (Fig.  2) has much weaker elasticities than Brazil in terms of magnitude. In the earliest period (1990) in Mexico, the greatest negative correlations between age-education-group proportions and earnings are observed for younger men (15 – 24 and 25 – 34) with secondary completed and older men (35 – 49 and 50 – 64) with less than primary completed. Proportions in age-education groups tend to have positive correlations with earnings among men with primary completed or university completed, but these correlations decrease over time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Gene set {{analysis}} (in {{a form of}} functionally related genes or pathways) {{has become}} the method of choice for analyzing omics data in general and gene expression data in particular. There are many statistical methods that either summarize gene-level statistics for a gene set or apply a multivariate statistic that accounts for intergene correlations. Most available methods detect complex departures from the null hypothesis but lack the ability to identify the specific alternative hypothesis that rejects the null. Results GSAR (Gene Set Analysis in R) is an open-source R/Bioconductor software package for gene set analysis (GSA). It implements self-contained multivariate non-parametric statistical methods testing a complex null hypothesis against specific alternatives, such as differences in mean (shift), variance (scale), or <b>net</b> <b>correlation</b> structure. The package also provides a graphical visualization tool, based on the union of two minimum spanning trees, for correlation networks to examine {{the change in the}} correlation structures of a gene set between two conditions and highlight influential genes (hubs). Conclusions Package GSAR provides a set of multivariate non-parametric statistical methods that test a complex null hypothesis against specific alternatives. The methods in package GSAR are applicable to any type of omics data that can be represented in a matrix format.

40|$|Interspecific {{associations}} {{in the plant}} community may help to understand the self-organizing assembly and succession of the community. In present study, Pearson correlation, <b>net</b> <b>correlation,</b> Spearman rank correlation, and point correlation were used to detect the interspecific (inter-family) associations of grass species (families) using the sampling data collected in a grass community of Zhuhai, China. We found that most associations between grass species (families) were positive associations. The competition/interference/niche separation between grass species (families) was not significant. A lot of pairs of grass species and families with statistically significant interspecific (inter-family) associations based on four correlation measures were discovered. Cluster trees for grass species/families were obtained by using cluster analysis. Relationship among positive/negative associations, interspecific relationship and community succession/stability/robustness was discussed. I held that species with significant positive or negative associations are generally keystone species in the community. Although both negative and positive associations occur in the community succession, the adaptation and selection will finally result in the successful coexistence of the species with significant positive {{associations in}} the climax community. As the advance of community succession, the significant positive associations increase and maximize in climax community, and the significant negative associations increase to a maximum and then decline into climax community. Dominance of significant positive associations in the climax community means the relative stablility and equilibrium of the community. No significant associations usually account {{for the majority of}} possible interspecific associations at each phase of community succession. They guarantee the robustness of community. They are candidates of keystone species. Lose of some existing keystone species might be filled with some species previously with no significant associations. In addition, a Java program, associCoeff, re-writed from my earlier work, was introduced. A large number of data were thus given also...|$|E
40|$|Context. The surface {{structures}} and dynamics of cool stars {{are characterized by}} the presence of convective motions and turbulent flows which shape the emergent spectrum. Aims. We used realistic three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulations from the Stagger-grid to calculate synthetic spectra with the radiative transfer code Optim 3 D for stars with different stellar parameters to predict photometric colors and convective velocity shifts. Methods. We calculated spectra from 1000 to 200 000 A with a constant resolving power of 20 000 and from 8470 and 8710 A (Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer - RVS - spectral range), with a constant resolving power of 300 000. Results. We used synthetic spectra to compute theoretical colors in the Johnson-Cousins UBV(RI), SDSS, 2 MASS, Gaia, SkyMapper, Stromgren systems, and HST-WFC 3. We showed that 1 D versus 3 D differences are limited to a small percent except for the narrow filters that span the optical and UV region of the spectrum. In addition, we derived the effect of the convective velocity fields on selected Fe I lines. We found the overall convective shift for 3 D simulations with respect to the reference 1 D hydrostatic models, revealing line shifts of between - 0. 235 and + 0. 361 km/s. We showed a <b>net</b> <b>correlation</b> of the convective shifts with the effective temperature: lower effective temperatures denote redshifts and higher effective temperatures denote blueshifts. We conclude that the extraction of accurate radial velocities from RVS spectra need an appropriate wavelength correction from convection shifts. Conclusions. The use of realistic 3 D hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere simulations has a small but significant impact on the predicted photometry compared with classical 1 D hydrostatic models for late-type stars. We make all the spectra publicly available for the community through the POLLUX database. Comment: Accepted for publication on Astronomy & Astrophysics.

The {{current state of the}} art algorithm for learning relational Bayes <b>nets</b> captures only <b>correlations</b> among entity attributes given the existence of links among entities. The models described in this paper capture a wider class of cor-relations that involve uncertainty about the link structure. Our base line method learns a Bayes net from join tables directly. This is a statisti-cally powerful procedure that finds many correlations, but does not scale well to larger datasets. We compare join table search with a hierarchical search strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose the}} Temporal <b>Correlation</b> <b>Net</b> (TCN) as an ob-ject {{recognition}} system implementing three basic principles: forming tem-poral groups of features, learning in a hierarchical structure and using feedback for predicting future input. It is an {{improvement of the}} Tem-poral Correlation Graph and shows improved performance on standard datasets like ETH 80 and COIL 100. In contrast to its predecessor it can be trained online on all levels at once {{instead of having to}} be trained in batch mode level per level. Training images are presented in a tempo-ral order showing objects undergoing specific transformations in viewing conditions the system is supposed to become invariant to. Computa-tion time and memory demands are low because of a sparse connectivity structure resulting from the learning algorithm and efficient handling of neural activities. ...|$|R
40|$|We present {{measurements}} of net charge fluctuations in Au+Au collisions at √[subscript s[superscript [NN]]= 19. 6, 62. 4, 130, and 200 GeV, Cu+Cu collisions at √[subscript s[superscript [NN]]= 62. 4 and 200 GeV, and p+p collisions at √s= 200 GeV using the dynamical net charge fluctuations measure ν[subscript +-,dyn]. We observe that the dynamical fluctuations are nonzero at all energies and exhibit a modest dependence on beam energy. A weak system size dependence is also observed. We examine the collision centrality {{dependence of the}} net charge fluctuations and find that dynamical net charge fluctuations violate 1 /N[subscript ch] scaling but display approximate 1 /N[subscript part] scaling. We also study the azimuthal and rapidity dependence of the <b>net</b> charge <b>correlation</b> strength and observe strong dependence on the azimuthal angular range and pseudorapidity widths integrated to measure the correlation.

40|$|AbstractCeliac {{disease is}} an immune-mediated {{disorder}} triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible persons. Despite its detrimental effects on human health, {{it has not}} disappeared over time. The current evolutionary theory is that celiac disease {{is more common in}} areas reached later by agricultural revolution than in countries that started consumption of wheat earlier, due to negative selection caused by celiac disease. We reviewed data on worldwide prevalence of celiac disease, wheat consumption, and frequencies of HLA-celiac-disease-predisposing-genotypes to investigate their mutual relationship. Studies assessing prevalence of celiac disease were identified through a MEDLINE search. Wheat consumption and frequencies of HLA-DQ 2 -DQ 8 were obtained from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and allelefrequencies. <b>net</b> database. <b>Correlations</b> between celiac disease, wheat consumption, and HLA were analyzed by linear regression. We observed a significant correlation between wheat consumption and HLA DQ 2 (p= 0. 01) and the sum of DQ 2 and DQ 8 (p= 0. 01) frequencies. Wheat consumption and HLA-DQ 2 tend to co-localize in different continents. The correlation between the prevalence of celiac disease and either DQ 2 and/or DQ 8, or the product of DQ 2 +DQ 8 *wheat consumption was not statistically significant. Co-localization of gluten consumption and HLA-celiac-disease-predisposing-genotypes can be explained by positive selection of HLA-DQ 2 genes in wheat-consuming areas, and “demic diffusion” of Middle East farmers into Europe...|$|R
