His land reform measures for example, while {{not going to the}} extent urged by American advisers (such as more sharply limiting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hectares</b> one farmer could own), {{in the words of one}} historian, [...] "did succeed in breaking up the vast estates in the delta, and it changed the landless peasants in the South from the large majority to a minority. The Communists would later lament that this redistribution of land “seriously interfered” with their subsequent efforts to win over the peasantry through land reform." [...] Ironically, Diem's American backers also failed to provide him with adequate funding to help buy land for redistribution to small peasants. Diem's other reforms emphasized agriculture rather than the forced-draft industrial development of the north, and the general restoration of order under his regime saw rising indicators of prosperity. Rice production for example which had fallen below pre-World War II production levels in 1954, surpassed the previous level by 1959. Production of rubber rose from 54,917 tons in 1954 to 75,374 in 1950, and cattle and pigs registered a threefold jump over the same period.
