The Soviet Army also possessed a 152mm nuclear shell, but it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> that shell could be used with the D-1.|$|E

5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E

It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E

Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E

5|$|Between 1111 and 1117 {{the ancient}} clas church was granted by Gilbert fitz Richard to St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester (a Benedictine house), as a cell or priory of St Peter's Abbey. This may have meant the {{construction}} of a stone church, perhaps the first on the site; a new tower and porch were built. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the Celtic monks and priests (married and single) were expelled, or whether they were joined by brethren of a new sort. A few years later, in 1141, Ewenny Priory, in the Vale of Glamorgan, was founded as a priory of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester. As with Llanbadarn, there was a pre-existing church, in this case definitely one in stone, and probably dating from the 1120s, as it was consecrated 1126 by Bishop Urban of Llandaff.|$|E
5|$|Chanel {{bought the}} five acre plot on which La Pausa {{was built for}} 1.8 million French francs in February 1929. The plot had {{formerly}} {{been part of the}} hunting grounds of the ruling family of Monaco, the Grimaldis, and contained wild olive and orange groves. The villa was built less than a year later. The final cost of the villa was 6 million francs, a large sum for the time. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Chanel or her lover, Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster financed the building and furnishing of La Pausa. La Pausa was built by architect Robert Streitz, who sought to build 'the ideal Mediterranean villa'.|$|E
5|$|Chesney died in 1174, {{having had}} three daughters {{with his wife}} Gilla. Her ancestry is unknown, and it is {{possible}} that William married another time, to Aubrey de Poynings, because a Lewes Priory charter dated to around 1165 names a William de Chesney and Aubrey his wife, but it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> this charter is referring to William de Chesney the sheriff or to another William. William and Gilla's daughters were Margaret, Clemence, and Sara, all of whom were unmarried {{at the time of their}} father's death. Margaret married twice– first to Hugh de Cressy and second to Robert fitzRoger. Clemence married Jordan de Sackville, and Sara married Richard Engaine. Margaret inherited the majority of her father's estates.|$|E

It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|In her car, {{she packed}} clothing, toiletries, college textbooks, and birth-control pills.

It's <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> men {{or women}} have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – {{are more likely to}} have low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers {{are more likely to have}} low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} announced {{that there would}} be a simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows as well as concurrent Japanese and American release, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an Xbox release, but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive. Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference, there was a great deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the game would have a structured story, which it ended up having, and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested. Following an August 2001 beta test in Japan, a public Japanese beta test was done in December 2001.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
