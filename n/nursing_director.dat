40|$|Recently, mass {{employment}} of care-workers is in progress, especially in geriatric institutions. We examined {{the trend of}} the recruitment and {{employment of}} care-workers and analysis of related organizational factors in geriatric hospitals which adopt the partial capitation system. A survey of 339 hospitals revealed that individuals with various kinds of unqualified talent were employed as care-workers. Although most hospitals could employ {{a sufficient number of}} care-workers, many <b>nursing</b> <b>directors</b> had difficulty in their recruitment. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors related to this awareness of <b>nursing</b> <b>directors.</b> The ratio and the average age of care-workers and the location of hospital show a significant correlation.

40|$|Aims The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the role {{stressors}} experienced by executive <b>nurse</b> <b>directors</b> and strategies employed to maintain resilience. Background Recent financial pressures on and care quality scandals in the UK NHS impact on the work of executive <b>nurse</b> <b>directors.</b> The short length of tenure and the high number of vacancies for these posts point to the exacting demands of the role and raise questions about the support mechanisms available for the most senior nurses in NHS organizations. Design A grounded constructivist study. Methods Semi-structured telephone interviews conducted between February–July, 2014. Results Stressors were both chronic (workload, lack of corporate responsibility for quality, reductions in quality team staffing, tensions between financial solvency and care quality and personal vulnerability) and acute (dealing with complaints and major incidents). Resilience required the support of fellow executives, peers, family and mentors and could be enhanced by self-discipline, good preparation for the post and ongoing coaching. Conclusion Recent fiscal austerity and scandals relating to quality of care have increased pressure on executive <b>nurse</b> <b>directors.</b> Increasing size of organizations, limited resources devoted to quality combined with poorly defined limits of responsibility are all major stressors and executive <b>nurse</b> <b>directors,</b> both in the United Kingdom and internationally, need clear strategies to maintain resilience. Repetitive demands for data by oversight organizations may detract from more important quality assurance strategies...|$|R

40|$|Radiotherapy {{effectively}} palliates malignant {{sources of}} pain. However, once enrolled on hospice, patients are rarely referred for this treatment. To develop educational strategies that can improve access to care, {{a survey of}} hospice providers investigated potential misconceptions about its benefits and availability. Individual surveys were distributed to administrators, <b>nursing</b> <b>directors,</b> and medical directors at 16 licensed hospices within 25 miles of a radiation oncology facility. Ninety-three percent of hospice professionals stated radiotherapy provides pain relief and is appropriate for patients with more than 1 month of life expectancy. However, less than 1 % of their cancer patients had been referred to a radiation oncologist over the past year, citing concerns about cost and travel burden. Whereas most medical directors (75 %) were aware {{it is just as}} effective when delivered in a single fraction, very few administrators (22 %) and <b>nursing</b> <b>directors</b> (21 %) had this knowledge. Meanwhile, reluctance of a radiation oncologist to offer single-fraction palliative radiotherapy was experienced by 43 %. Access to palliative radiotherapy for this unique population can be increased by improving education for hospice administrators and <b>nursing</b> <b>directors</b> and reminding radiation oncologists that single-fraction palliative radiotherapy is acceptable and ideal for patients with limited financial resources at the end of life...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{transport}} of critically ill patients to children 2 ̆ 019 s hospitals {{is essential to}} current practice. The AAP Section on Transport Medicine has raised concerns about future leadership in the field as trainees receive less exposure to transport medicine. This study identifies the priorities of pediatric subspecialty fellows, fellowship <b>directors</b> and <b>nursing</b> <b>directors</b> in transport medicine education. Methods Internet based surveys were distributed to fellows, fellowship <b>directors</b> and <b>nursing</b> <b>directors</b> of transport teams affiliated with ACGME-approved fellowships in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine (NPM), Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (PCCM), and Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM). Data collection occurred November 2013 to March 2014. Results Four hundred and sixty-six responses were collected (357 fellows, 82 <b>directors,</b> 27 <b>nursing</b> <b>directors)</b> : Six curricular elements were ranked by respondents: Transport Physiology (TP), Medical Control (MC), Vehicle Safety (VS), Medicolegal Issues (ML), Medical Protocols (MP) and State and Federal Regulations (SFR). Fellows and fellowship directors were not significantly different: TP (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 63), VS (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 45), SFR (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 58), ML (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 07), MP (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 98), and MC (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 36). Comparison of subspecialties found significant differences: PEM considered TP less important than NPM and PCCM (p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001, p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001), VS less important than NPM (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 001). PEM viewed SFR and MC more important than PCCM (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 006, p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 002); ML more important than PCCM and NPM (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 001, p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001). PCCM ranked MC more important than NPM (p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 004). <b>Nursing</b> <b>directors</b> considered TP less important than NPM and PCCM (p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001, p 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 002). Conclusions When ranking curricular elements in transport medicine, fellows and fellowship directors do not differ, but comparison of subspecialties notes significant differences.

40|$|Wandering, {{a common}} {{behavior}} {{exhibited by the}} confused elderly (Mayer and Darby, 1991; Monsour and Robb, 1982), poses a significant problem to the individual, to the family, and to care providers. The research supporting the effectiveness of various interventions in managing wandering behavior indicates that simple procedures and environmental modifications {{may be used to}} good effect. It is unclear, however, which interventions are being utilized in the nursing home setting (Fisher, Fink, and Loomis, 1993), and which interventions are the most economically practical. ^ This study had three main goals. The first was to obtain descriptive data on the problem of wandering in the nursing home setting, including the prevalence of wandering, the reasons why it is considered a problem, and the interventions used to manage it. The second goal was {{to determine whether or not}} specific factors, such as staff-to-patient ratio, exercise and activities reduce the problem of wandering.

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} global {{shortage}} of mental health nurses. Within Australia, the principal strategy of offering a postgraduate education programme with various incentives to encourage nurses back to study has not been successful. This {{has led to the}} consideration of radical alternatives, including the return to pre-registration specialisation in mental health. The successful introduction of this strategy would require the full support of industry partners. To date, the voice of industry has not been heard in relation to this issue. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the views of an Australian sample of mental health <b>nursing</b> <b>directors</b> regarding the resources and other factors required, should undergraduate specialist programmes in mental health be developed, to ensure they are relevant and likely to be successful. A qualitative exploratory research project was undertaken to explore the perspectives and opinions of industry partners. In-depth interviews were conducted with <b>nursing</b> <b>directors</b> (n = 12) in Queensland Australia. Five main themes were identified: relationships with universities; clinical placement preparation and support; workplace culture; facilitators and preceptors; and practical student learning. Genuine collaboration between the two organisations was considered crucial for delivering a quality programme and providing the required support for students.

40|$|The {{profession}} of nursing occurs in complicated work environments that require individuals to be immersed {{in areas with}} vulnerable populations that demand nurturing relationships between patients, family, friends, and employees. With the majority of nurses obtaining their initial education at a community college, strong leadership {{at the helm of}} the nursing programs is critical. The community college nurse leader is charged with tackling the challenges of: staying abreast of a rapidly changing healthcare system, providing quality educational programs for future nurses, addressing a national nursing shortage, and confronting a nurse educator shortage that oftentimes supplies the pool of future nurse leaders in higher education. Yet, there appears to be a dearth of literature about community college <b>nursing</b> <b>directors</b> and their professional pathways.
