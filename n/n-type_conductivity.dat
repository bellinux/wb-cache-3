The conductivity in the β, γ and δ-phases is predominantly ionic with oxide ions being the main charge carrier. δ- Bi2O3 has a defective fluorite-type crystal structure in which two of the eight oxygen sites in the unit cell are vacant. These intrinsic vacancies are highly mobile due to the high polarisability of the cation sub-lattice with the 6s2 lone pair electrons of Bi3+.

Band alignment shows that the band gap becomes larger with x due to the increasing conduction band minimum, rendering it hard to establish <b>n-type</b> <b>conductivity</b> in CuGaSe 2. From the defect formation energies, we find that In/GaCu is a shallow donor, while VCu, VIn/Ga and CuIn/Ga act as shallow acceptors. Using total charge neutrality of ionized defects and intrinsic charge carriers to determine the Fermi level, we show that under In-rich growth conditions InCu causes strongly <b>n-type</b> <b>conductivity</b> in CuInSe 2. Under In-poor growth conditions the conductivity type in CuInSe 2 alters to p-type and compensation of the acceptors by InCu reduces, as observed in photoluminescence experiments.

Rapid transient anneals of two sets of such samples at temperatures of up to 800 deg C lead to {{the complete loss of}} the H-C(p) pairs and large decreases of [C(p) ], from initial values of 5. 8 x 10 (exp 18) and 2. 5 x 10 (exp 18) cm(exp - 3). The layers remain semi-insulating up to 700 deg C and, even after annealing at 800 deg C, they show only low <b>n-type</b> <b>conductivities</b> (n about 10 (exp 16) cm(exp - 3)) implying the continued presence of a sufficient concentration of donor centers to effect near compensation. Raman scattering measurements reveal LVM's (IR inactive), close to 1800 cm(exp - 1) and broadbands, due to amorphous carbon, that show increased strengths after annealing. The LVM's are attributed to deep donor dicarbon split-interstitial centers occupying phosphorus lattice sites, analogous to corresponding centers observed in annealed highly carbon-doped p-type GaAs and AlAs that have been investigated by local-density-functional calculations. No evidence is found for the presence of shallow donors, namely V(In) H 4 complexes, C(In) donors or P(In) antisite defects. Changes in the unusual electric-field broadening of the C(p) LVM, revealed by IR measurements, are related to the reductions in die concentration of C(p) defects resulting from the anneals. These calculations give further insight about the compensating defects and may imply reductions in strain after the higher-temperature anneals...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study on {{electrochemistry}} and applications of some thiophene-based conducting polymers, which include polythiophene (poly-Th), polybithiophene (poly-BTh), polyterthiophene (poly-TTh), poly(4 -dicyanomethylene- 4 H-cyclopenta[2, 1 -b: 3, 4 -b’]dithiophene) (poly-CDM), O₂-modified poly-CDM, poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (poly-EDOT), poly-(CDM-co-EDOT), and poly[3 -(p-fluorophenyl) thiophene] (poly-PFPT). [...] Chapters 3, 4 and 6 focus on electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements of the band-gaps of the starting monomers and oligomers, and their polymers. As expected, {{increasing the number of}} thiophene units in the oligomer decreases the band-gap. There is a linear relationship between the band-gap and the inverse of the number of thiophene units in the oligomer, from which, a band-gap of ca. 1. 9 eV is predicted for a perfect polymer. The band-gap of the polymers, however, decreases with increasing chain length of the starting oligomers, with the average effective conjugation length for poly-Th, poly-BTh, and poly-TTh found to be 16, 9 and 8 respectively. [...] Poly-CDM has a significantly reduced band-gap because of the strong electron-withdrawing group, dicyanoethene, which decreases the LUMO energy level substantially. The small change of the electronic absorption upon n-doping reveals that n-type charge carriers to not delocalize well along the thiophene backbone. In situ conductivity measurements yielded maximum p- and <b>n-type</b> <b>conductivities</b> of 0. 59 and 5. 4 x 10 ⁻³ S cm⁻¹ respectively, and an intrinsic conductivity of 1. 0 x 10 ⁻⁸ S cm⁻¹, in agreement with the band-gap of 0. 8 eV. [...] Reaction of n-doped poly-CDM with O₂ was found to produce a modified form of the polymer with a tunable and extremely low band-gap. The maximum p- and <b>n-type</b> <b>conductivities</b> both decrease upon reaction with O₂, but the minimum conductivity increases remarkably by several orders of magnitude. An intrinsic conductivity of 1. 3 x 10 ⁻⁶ S cm⁻¹ measured for an O₂-modified polymer corresponds to a band-gap as low as 0. 22 eV. It is proposed that this reduced band-gap is due to substitution of the polymer in the β positions with hydroxyl groups. [...] Due to the strong electron-donating effect of dioxyethylene, poly-EDOT has a much lower oxidation potential compared to poly-Th. Poly-EDOT can be heavily p-doped and exhibits excellent cycling stability for p-doping. Maximum conductivities for p- and n-doping were obtained to be 0. 60 and 5. 7 x 10 ⁻³ S cm⁻¹, respectively. [...] Compared to Th, CDM has a lower LUMO energy level, and EDOT has a higher HOMO energy level. Thus copolymerization of these two monomers has successfully produced copolymers with very low band-gaps and high intrinsic conductivities. A copolymer synthesized at 1. 32 V had a band-gap of 0. 19 eV and an intrinsic conductivity of 0. 69 mS cm⁻¹. Strong evidence from voltammetric studies and Raman spectra supports the contention that poly-(CDM-co-EDOT) is a true copolymer. [...] Poly-PFPT is used as the electrode active material for supercapacitors. For the polymer synthesized using constant current, after 1000 deep charge/discharge cycles p-type stability is close to or over 80 %. This is much better than the n-type stability, for which the best figure is 47 % after 1000 cycles. In order to improve the n-type stability, cyclic voltammetry mode has been employed as the synthesis method. Test results show that n-type stability has been improved to as high as 67 %...|$|R

30|$|Graphene oxide {{quantum dots}} (GQDs) possess the sp 2 domain as a {{transport}} mobility intermediary {{as well as}} disordered sp 3 hybridized carbon and oxygen atoms. Therefore, the emission wavelengths can be modulated from blue to green {{because of the presence}} of these disordered oxygen-containing edge states [19 – 22]. The tunable fluorescent emissions of QDs can be exploited for applications in devices such as LEDs, photodiodes, photodetectors, bioimagers, and photovoltaic cells [23 – 25]. In addition to the oxygen functionalization of GQDs, nitrogen doping can yield stable emission through the formation of covalent bonds with sp 2 carbon in the aromatic chain. Nitrogen-doped GQDs that exhibit both p and <b>n-type</b> <b>conductivities,</b> as confirmed through electrochemical Mott–Schottky analysis, have been developed [26]. The main approaches to synthesize GQDs can be classified as top-down or bottom-up techniques. In comparison to the bottom-up approach, the top-down approach for GQDs production is more preferable for mass production as it does not require tedious purification steps for the removal of unreacted precursor molecules. However, the top-down approach produces a lower quantum yield (less than 50 %) of GQDs than the bottom-up approach does [27, 28]. As a result, various optimizations are required in top-down fabrication processes of GQDs such as size control, chemical doping, or surface modification. The present study demonstrates a nitrogen-doped GQDs method to repair the defects that occur during a top-down process. Some electron-donating nitrogen functionalities can be incorporated into the GQDs and hydrothermal treatments with NH 3 to avoid the formation of carbon-containing groups that might complicate the analysis of the nitrogen functionalities [29].|$|R
