It otherwise frequents mid-depth waters {{away from the}} coastal zone, but <b>not</b> <b>over</b> the ocean deeps. In the breeding season, it is mainly found between the 10–25°C July isotherms. In Europe, it is rarely seen from land except in autumn storms.|$|E
5|$|Even with Lancaster defeated, {{the battle}} against the rebels was <b>not</b> <b>over.</b> Edmund was charged with {{overtaking}} Wallingford Castle from Maurice de Berkeley in January 1323, a task which he fulfilled with great success. For his loyalty, Edmund was rewarded with substantial holdings in Wales, primarily land forfeited by Roger Mortimer. The greater part of the spoils of war, however, went to the Despensers, who both benefited greatly from the forfeiture of the rebels. By 1326, the Despensers, father and son respectively, enjoyed incomes of £3,800 and £7,000, while Edmund's annual income was at only 2,355 marks (£1,570).|$|E
5|$|Lana is Sindi (Marisa Warrington) and Penny Watts' (Andrea McEwan) cousin. She {{was born}} in Australia, but her family moved to Canada when she was young. They {{returned}} to Australia a few years later, and Lana began attending Wattle Heights High School, where she was bullied over her sexuality. This led her to transfer to Erinsborough High. Lana finds employment at the Coffee Shop alongside Serena Bishop, whom she befriends. Lana is convinced {{that she had seen}} Serena before, and she realises that Serena had been in some photos taken by dodgy photographer Chris Cousens. Lana admits to Serena that she had also been taken in by Chris and that she was <b>not</b> <b>over</b> it. Lana did not get on with Serena's cousin, Sky, and one day they fight at school. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) places them in detention and urges them to work things out.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia {{rejected}} Singapore's {{argument that}} the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and <b>not</b> <b>over</b> territory. It stated that authority in states throughout the world {{is based on a}} combination of control over people and territory, and that this applies to the Malay States as it does to any other state. Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century, it always had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived.|$|E
5|$|Marcus tears out the {{hardware}} linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Kickinger). Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John {{comes to his}} aid. Marcus eventually defeats the T-800, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together explosives. John, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury to his heart. Marcus offers his own heart for transplantation, sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still <b>not</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nearly 5,000 RAF airmen {{prepared}} {{to take part in}} 817 heavy bombers which were fueled and armed in the evening. A trigger plan was prepared, which would act as a feint but, this night, Bomber Command amended the feint which was partially compromised by weather conditions. Restrictions on the flight path of the bombers was also changed. Bomber streams were permitted to fly over Ingoldmells Point to Filey; but <b>not</b> <b>over</b> coastal areas where no ground defences were stationed. The route took them downstream to southern England by Reading, and across the English Channel, as the trigger plan required. However, they were then ordered to turn back toward the North Sea. The reason behind this was the low-lying cloud which was ever-present over the continent that night. The clouds made it difficult for pilots to see and steer clear of zones heavily guarded by Allied ground defences near to the frontline. The possibility of losing aircraft to Friendly fire was too great.|$|E

5|$|New Yorks ordeal was <b>not</b> <b>over,</b> however. Badly {{damaged by}} the loss of a propeller, the ship sailed to Rosyth under heavy escort for repairs on 15 October. At 01:00 the next morning, a U-boat {{launched}} three torpedoes at the damaged vessel, all of which passed ahead of her. Unlike in previous cases, sufficient evidence existed to suppose that this torpedo attack was not a false alarm—a number of officers and men aboard New York clearly saw the wakes of the torpedoes in the full moonlight, and a submarine was spotted in the immediate vicinity by a patrol shortly after the attack.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Jack Matlock, United States {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union, told Gorbachev {{of the possibility of}} a coup attempt against him, and the Soviet leader became worried when Anatoly Chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside Moscow. On 21 June, four days after Pavlov's speech, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and Pavlov. Even when {{he had been able to}} secure his position, Gorbachev's power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was <b>not</b> <b>over,</b> with Gorbachev promising Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the Chairman of the KGB, would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch-Mataram {{victory at}} Kediri {{weakened}} Trunajaya's rebellion. However, {{the war was}} <b>not</b> <b>over.</b> Trunajaya and his retinue was still at large in the highlands of Malang around east Java; he was not captured until December 1679. His ally Raden Kajoran established a new base in Mlambang, Central Java, and engaged in successful operations there up to his death in September 1679. Amangkurat's brother Pangeran Puger still held Mataram's court at Plered where he maintained a rival claim to the throne until 1681. Amangkurat also faced difficulty in establishing his authority in Cirebon and Madura.|$|E

5|$|To {{support its}} {{assertion}} that the Sultan of Johor did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Singapore contended that the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and <b>not</b> <b>over</b> territory. Thus, the only reliable way {{to determine whether a}} particular territory belonged to a ruler was to find out whether the inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler. This was difficult to do with respect to Pedra Branca since it was isolated and uninhabited, and Malaysia had not provided clear evidence of a direct claim to or actual exercise of sovereign authority over the island.|$|E
5|$|With The Evil Thing destroyed, Max, Sean and Cassie save Priscilla. She angrily {{yells at}} Cassie and calls her a witch, and Sean rejects Priscilla {{in favor of}} Cassie. After Priscilla leaves, they save the pizza {{delivery}} man, who offers them free pizza in return for releasing him, then follows Priscilla to hit on her, to her disgust. Cassie and Sean burn the book and set aside all their thoughts about The Evil Thing. Sean leaves shortly afterward. Cassie and Max's parents then come home and find the book in the fireplace. The father mockingly reads it out loud, reviving The Evil Thing. The film concludes with Cassie realizing that The Evil Thing has been brought back to life {{and that it is}} <b>not</b> <b>over</b> yet.|$|E
5|$|Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but {{the theatre}} {{was forced to}} pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was {{organized}} by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, <b>not</b> <b>over</b> objections {{to the content of}} Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.|$|E

After more arguments Rhys suggests they spend time apart. Jacqui then goes missing, but is later found safe. She goes to see a counsellor and she and Rhys begin to rebuild their relationship.|$|E
