2500|$|Similar to the band's third studio album, Amputechture, {{the album}} {{does not contain}} a single unifying narrative.

Following the Civil War, it looked like cricket might expand beyond its strongholds at Haverford College and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1881 delegates from several collegiate cricket clubs, including Harvard University, Columbia University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania and Trinity College, joined together to form the Intercollegiate Cricket Association. The group was plagued by troubles and withdrawals. Haverford College and Cornell University later joined the ICA, but Yale University and Johns Hopkins University <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>around</b> to fielding teams. The ICA lasted until 1924 when it crowned its last champion. These collegiate clubs generally drew their talent from pools at secondary schools which also fielded team and played in interscholastic competitions in this period.|$|E

Finn was in love with a female classmate, Holly, who invited him over, only to have her and her friend drench him with a hose; humiliated, he rode home on his bicycle. [...] "All of This" [...] is a gothic-tinged pop song that uses strings and guitar effects to create a moody atmosphere.

[...] "I'm Lost Without You" [...] mixes an industrial loop with piano. The latter track took many months to create, and took [...] "over 50" [...] different tracks, including two drum sets combined during the last minute of the song.

500|$|Although Smith {{has never}} {{been one of the}} most commercially {{successful}} or career-driven artists, she is one of country music's most celebrated and respected. Music critics, fans, and counterparts alike have considered Smith to be one of the best and most underrated female vocalists in country music history. Music critics have often compared Smith's vocals to that of country legend Patsy Cline, due to her emotional delivery and her strong use of diction and phrasing. In his review of Smith's 1996 compilation The Essential Connie Smith, Jurek explained why Smith's vocals are usually compared to Cline's, [...] "Connie Smith is perhaps the only female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to Patsy Cline's throne. It's not that there aren't many amazing vocalists in the field, and plenty of legends among them. But in terms of the pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction, Smith is it." [...] Many artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists. Chely Wright said that she spent most of her childhood listening to records by Smith. George Jones cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography. Elvis Presley had many of Smith's albums in his record collection at his Graceland home and intended on recording Smith's version of [...] "The Wonders You Perform", but <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>around</b> to doing so.
