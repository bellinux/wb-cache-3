5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (<b>neat</b> <b>soap</b> phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E

First, the nematic phase he characterized as having microscopic threads (these threads are today interpreted as disclinations in the director-field in the mesophase). Second, Friedel coined the term smectic phase for a layered mesophase having the structure of <b>neat</b> <b>soap.</b> Third, Friedel use the term cholesteric phase for materials like cholesteryl benzoate, and noted that such mesophases [...] "involve strong twists around a direction normal to the positive optical axis".|$|E

40|$|Eight lanthanide(III) oleates {{have been}} {{prepared}} and characterized. The chelation and self-assembly structures of these rare-earth oleates have been studied by elemental analysis, Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. Elemental analysis and FTIR results indicate that three oleate anions are complexed with one lanthanide cation and, {{with the exception of}} anhydrous cerium(III) oleate, form either a mono- or a hemihydrate. The X-ray analysis showed that the <b>neat</b> lanthanide <b>soaps</b> have a lamellar bilayer structure at room temperature. The thermal behavior has been investigated by cross-polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). POM scans showed that all the lanthanide oleates form a lamellar phase in the presence of excess water. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and XRD were used to investigate the internal structure of the bulk lanthanide oleates in excess water, and these X-ray results conﬁrmed that the lanthanide oleates do not swell in water. Select lanthanide oleates were dispersed in water to form nonswelling lamellar submicrometer particles, conﬁrmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and synchrotron SAXS measurements. NMR results indicated that colloidal dispersions of lanthanide oleates containing paramagnetic ions, such as gadolinium(III), terbium(III), and dysprosium(III), have a signiﬁcant effect on the longitudinal (T 1) and transverse (T 2) relaxation times of protons in water. Time-resolved ﬂuorescence measurements have demonstrated that colloidal dispersions of europium(III) oleate exhibit strong luminescence. The rare earth metal soaps exemplify the potential of self-assembled chelating amphiphiles as contrast agents in medical imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ﬂuorescence imaging...|$|R
