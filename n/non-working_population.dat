40|$|Following {{a series}} of imposed {{redundancies}} in the Royal Navy (RN) {{there was a need}} to understand the career desires of remaining personnel and how these interact with important organisational behaviours and turnover. Taking a social psychology perspective, this thesis addresses criticisms over the high use of <b>non-working</b> <b>populations</b> in research and provides the first empirical evidence for the utility, applicability and relevance of specific psychological theories to the RN. Chapter 2 explores the relationship between career anchors and psychological contract violation, organisational commitment and turnover. Evidence was found for the applicability and potential generalisability of civilian-based research to the RN. RN career anchor preferences were similar to some non-military organisations, and these preferences differentially influenced the variables explored. Chapter 3 presents an intervention developed to support newly appointed Career Managers to increase awareness of human resource issues, representing the first exploration of induction on later attitudes of ‘experienced newcomers’ in the RN. The induction did not influence attitudes; although time did, indicating the importance of role clarity. Chapter 4 provides a critical literature review of work-family conflict (WFC) and its influence on turnover intentions of military personnel and effects on military spouses. The expected negative relationship between WFC and turnover was found, although not consistently; types of satisfaction mediated this relationship, and WFC was linked to stress. Chapter 5 provides new empirical understanding of the interactions between ethos, organisational identity, and engagement on career motivation, perceived future opportunities and intentions to stay. Differences in these constructs were also explored between discrete RN groupings. The relationship between identity and ethos, and engagement, identity and ethos were explored to advance theoretical understanding of these constructs, finishing with an extension to Chapter 2 through revisiting career anchors. In conclusion, this thesis provides new contextual insights, interactions and relationships for academic knowledge, psychological theory and addresses a practical organisational issue within a highly regarded and inaccessible organisation. The outcomes provide the first empirical evidence of career-related behaviours within the RN, and more generally indicate the applicability of civilian based psychological theories to a military population, in particular, career anchors, ethos and focus on opportunities and their importance for people strategy decisions supporting evidence-based decision making within the workplace...|$|R

If you take away the negative impact of ageing populations on the overall economy, it is quite likely that you solve most of the other problems too. The second message is that we believe that, in flexible labour markets, ageing populations should lead to lower unemployment and higher labour force participation, without too much government intervention. A combination of lower unemployment and higher labour force participation can almost fully compensate for the negative effect of ageing on the economy. At the European Council meeting held in Lisbon in March 2000, European leaders agreed a new strategic goal for the E. U. in order to strengthen employment, economic reform and social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy. As part of the employment strategy, the European Council agreed to aim for a rise in the participation rate from 61 per cent today to as close as possible to 70 per cent by 2010. Although this shows that Europe has accepted the challenge, it is still up to the individual Member States to set national targets and implement strategies to achieve these targets. The other one-third of the potential negative impact of ageing populations on the economy is generated through budgetary effects. Europe has already implemented strict budgetary controls, and total debt relative to GDP for the 15 E. U. Member States has dropped from around 72 per cent of GDP in 1995 to around 63 per cent of GDP in 2001. If Europe is to continue to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact, it is important that pension reform continue, with a small reduction in the generosity of the public retirement systems included in the reforms. The most important reform, however, would be an increase in the average retirement age in Europe by a couple of years. Without this increase, it will be difficult to keep pension budgets and overall budgets under control and it will not be possible to raise labour force participation rates sufficiently. The economic models show that by combining labour market reforms and budgetary reforms it should be possible to increase living standards even beyond levels we have experienced over the past decade. Our more positive tone as regards the impact of ageing populations on the economy does not take away from the fact that some countries in Europe will have more to do than others. Labour market reform is the key. We believe that those countries that are able to implement widespread labour market reforms, resulting in lower structural unemployment and higher labour force participation rates, should not see any impact from an ageing population. It is often argued that it is the baby-boom generation now moving through its prime earning years that is causing the economic as well as the stock market boom. By the same argument, one should expect lower economic growth and a more difficult stock market environment if and when the baby-boom generation retires. We have looked extensively at some of the arguments behind this theory and have come to two conclusions. First, there is not too much evidence that it is the impact of the baby-boomer alone that is causing this economic and stock market boom. There is even less evidence of this in Europe than in the U. S. Second, there is a lot of evidence in countries such as the U. S. and the Netherlands, which have reformed their labour markets, that the labour market has reacted naturally to demographic changes. Looking forward, we therefore expect labour markets in those countries that have implemented labour market reform to also react naturally to the ageing of the population. This means lower unemployment and higher labour force participation rates. Theoretically, baby-boomers are now in their prime saving years. They have reached the top of their career and earnings paths, the children are independent (at least Financially), the mortgage has been reduced and they should be saving. This savings boom is stimulating today's economy and asset markets. When the baby-boomer retires he will consume his savings (negative savings), economic growth will slow down and asset markets will collapse. This is the theory. The good news is that, in reality, savings rates have come down over the past ten years and we are not sure how savings rates will develop in the future.

50|$|The {{unemployment}} rate in Luxembourg is relatively low compared with other European countries. Income inequality and poverty are also less significant on an international scale. As at October 2016, the unemployed in Luxembourg amounted to 16,960 individuals or 6.3% of the population, 2% higher than ten years previously. Those unemployed {{for more than a}} year count for 1.6% of individuals without work, but in terms of job security and social welfare the expected loss of earnings resulting from unemployment is lower than the OECD average of 6.3% at 2.1%. By exploring median percentages relating to Luxembourg’s particular ‘sensitivity’ the poverty line, Allegrezza found that while ‘extreme poverty’ is ‘non-existent’, at the same time there is a relatively important number of the population that is ‘at risk of becoming poor’, in other words, a minor degradation in salary may induce poverty. However, the <b>non-working</b> <b>population,</b> that is, children and the elderly, display divergent results in relation to risk of poverty; the risk to the elderly in Luxembourg has reduced considerably from the 1990s, with a less than 1% incidence of poverty in this demographic group. On the other hand, children in Luxembourg seem to be at a more significant risk with many living in ‘households that are at imminent risk of poverty’, in spite of a comparatively larger social welfare benefit system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The 61 st {{round of}} NSS {{shows that there}} is a {{turnaround}} in employment growth in rural India after a phase of ‘jobless growth’. Paradoxically, this employment growth occurred during a period of wide spread distress in agriculture sector that include low productivity, price instability and stagnation leading to indebtedness. Under the typical neoclassical tradition, this trend would have predicted further contraction of employment in the rural economy. However, further probing reveals that employment growth in the rural areas is probably a response to the crisis that is gripping the agriculture sector. Under conditions of distress, when income levels fall below sustenance then that part of the normally <b>non-working</b> <b>population</b> are forced to enter the labour market to supplement the household income. The decline of agricultural sector has also probably created forced sectoral and regional mobility of the normally working population with the normally <b>non-working</b> <b>population</b> complementing them.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the annual socioeconomic burden imposed by alcohol misuse on Scottish society. Design and setting: Resource use attributable to alcohol misuse {{was obtained from}} appropriate databases, published literature and a Working Party on Social Work Caseload and Alcohol Misuse. Unit resource costs at 2001 / 2002 prices were applied to the resource use estimates to determine the annual direct cost attributable to alcohol misuse. Indirect costs arising from excess unemployment, absenteeism from work and premature mortality were also estimated as was the human cost of alcohol misuse arising from premature mortality among the <b>non-working</b> <b>population.</b> Main outcome measures and results: The annual healthcare cost of managing alcohol misuse {{was estimated to be}} Lstg 95. 6 million. Hospital admissions (57 %) and accident and emergency attendances (10 %) accounted for the greatest health service costs. Social work services including the Children's Hearing System were estimated to cost Lstg 85. 9 million whilst the criminal justice system was estimated to cost Lstg 267. 9 million. Indirect costs were estimated to account for Lstg 404. 5 million. The human cost of premature mortality among the <b>non-working</b> <b>population</b> was estimated to be Lstg 216. 7 million. Conclusions: Alcohol misuse imposes a substantial burden on Scottish society, costing Lstg 1071 million per year at 2001 / 2002 prices, which is greater than many prevalent illnesses such as stroke, depression and diabetes mellitus. In terms of the statutory agencies, alcohol misuse imposes a greater burden on the criminal justice system than both the health service and social work services.

40|$|In this thesis, I attempt, {{to analyse}} {{consumption}} behaviour in India during, the period 1950 - 51 [...] 1972 - 3. Before applying to Indian, data, the existing theories of personal consumption, have been analysed. The aggregate time-series {{tests of the}} major, theories of consumption reveal that current per-capita absolute, income strongly, influences current per-capita consumption, and that there has been, a declining trend, of consumption over, time, because of, growing urbanisation, rising, inequality in. the distribution of income and spread of education, during the period studied. The effect of past consumption standards is seen to be weak because of high priority attached to saving. For want of Data, no wealth theory, other, than, the, permanent income theory could, be tested for India. Results of testing permanent income theory reveal that both permanent and transitory incomes are equally significant in explaining personal consumption and therefore, the theory is denied by Indian data. Tests of the same theory with the help, of cross-section data for the year 1967 - 8 do not reveal conclusive results. I also attempt to explain, with family budget data for 1963 - 4, the existing regional, and rural-urban disparities in consumption of food and clothing in terms of disparities in total consumpion expenditure, price of the commodity and household size between regions and rural-urban areas within a region. Finally, an aggregate consumption function has been developed and tested {{in the context of}} an econometric model for India.

In this study socioeconomic differences in avoidable mortality in Sweden from 1986 to 1990 are analysed and related methodological issues discussed. Methods. The 1985 Swedish Population and Housing Census was linked to the National Cause of Death Register 1986 - 1990. Mortality from potentially 'avoidable ' causes of death was analysed for the age group 21 - 64 years. Analyses were performed for different socioeconomic groups, blue-collar workers, white-collar workers and the self-employed as well as for individuals outside the labour market Standardized Mortality Ratios were calculated using standardization by age and sex. Results. For all indicators studied, the death rates for those not in work were higher than for people at work. The largest differences were found for chronic bronchitis, diabetes, bacterial meningitis, ulcer of the stomach and duodenum, chronic rheumatic heart disease, asthma and hypertensive and cerebrovascular disease. For these causes of death the risk of dying was between 3. 1 and 7. 5 times greater in the <b>non-working</b> <b>population</b> than in the work-force.

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} the surplus {{accounting}} methodology {{to analyze the}} distribution of the fruits of growth between production factors over the period 1950 - 2008. Three production factors are distinguished: paid employment, self-employment and capital. The surplus distributed to capital is nil on average. The employees received a surplus linked to the evolution of total factor productivity, which experienced a slowdown in the 1980 s Since 2007, the distributed surplus has sharply dropped, due to an increase in external deduction. The evolution of the surplus is, then, confronted to value-added distribution, by focusing on the capital-labour substitution in the 1980 s. The standard framework of surplus accounting is, finally, extended by taking the Welfare System and its financing into account. Indeed, even if the Welfare System is mostly financed by social contributions paid by production factors, social benefits are also distributed to agents who are not involved in the production process, namely the pensioners, the unemployed, and the <b>non-working</b> <b>population.</b> We find that the surplus distributed to employees is lower when social contributions are taken into account. In the meantime, a half-percentage point of the value-added growth rate is assigned each year to the financing of the old-age insurance, whose main part however (0. 4 point) accrues tothe growing number of new pensioners. Nevertheless, the incomes after social benefits allocated to the employed, the unemployed, and pensioners grow at a similar pace.

However, these inequalities {{have not always been}} observed and results may vary according to the indicator of social position, mental health outcome and population studied. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the association between social position (educational level) and two mental disorders (major depressive disorder—MDD and general anxiety disorder—GAD), measured using a structured diagnostic interview (MINI), and to evaluate the contribution of work status in the explanation of this association. Methods : The study was based on a national representative sample of the French general population of 11, 777 people including 8, 072 workers. All analyses were done using weighted data. Bivariate Rao–Scott Chi-square tests were conducted, and multivariate analysis was performed using weighted logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age. Results : The prevalences of MDD/GAD and of less educated people were lower in the working population than in the <b>non-working</b> <b>population.</b> Educational inequalities were observed for MDD and GAD in the general population. Non-working status contributed to explain these inequalities by 23 – 28 % for MDD and by 23 – 37 % for GAD when the less educated group was considered.

The future evolution is simulated on a time span of 35 years, taking as base the popula-tion structure and demographic indicators of 1998. The projections are made according to two scenarios: in the absence of, and taking into account, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is spreading with unprecedented rapidity. The past evolution of the age structure is characterized, according to the results, by a demographic malus generated by an increased economic dependency of the <b>non-working</b> <b>population</b> on the working population, with the corollary growth of social investment needs to the disadvantage of wealth-creating economic investments. Despite acknowledged efforts, the economic and social response of the state was not equal to the needs inherent in the change in age structure. In 1998, nearly one child out of three between 6 and 14 years was not provided with education, nearly one person out of three was unem-ployed, and 64 % of the children from 12 to 23 months were not completely vaccinated. The future would have been more optimist ica l ly envisioned, because of the assumed emergence of a modest demographic bonus charac-terized by a gradual diminution of the proportion of the young population to the advantage of a steady increase in the working population and a con...|$|E
40|$|The life {{expectancy}} has increased rapidly in Norway in recent decades, with about ¼ year per year. The increase {{has been particularly}} fast for men, following a temporary decline in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Statistics Norway’s mortality projections using the Lee-Carter method indicate further improvements in this century – about 10 years higher {{life expectancy}} at birth. This implies significant mortality declines for older persons as the mortality is now small for young people. With no deaths below age 50 the life expectancy would be only 1 - 2 years higher. Population projections are for several reasons important for studying population ageing, including to have knowledge about the future age structure, and to estimate the effects of possible policy changes. In addition, the mortality projections are used for several other purposes than for projecting the population, such as calculating future pensions {{according to the new}} pension system, where life expectancy improvements reduce the annual pensions. The population projections show that the population will age regardless of plausible assumptions made about the demographic components births, deaths, immigration and emigration. Policies to affect these components may only marginally affect future ageing, and in some cases in the wrong direction. The only factor that may significantly affect the future ratio of the working to the <b>non-working</b> <b>population,</b> the potential support ratio, is that people work longer. This ratio will remain at the current level if the pension age is increased from the current 67 years to 78 years {{at the end of the}} century. This may be possible if the health of old persons continues to improve. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in a general population according to employment status and to assess the proportion of cases attributable to work. CTS occurring in patients aged 20 - 59 years living in the French Maine and Loire region were included prospectively from 2002 to 2004. Medical and occupation history was gathered by mailed questionnaire. Incidence rates of CTS and relative risks (RRs) of CTS were computed in relation to employment status. The attributable fractions of risk of CTS to work among the exposed persons (AFEs) were calculated. A total of 1168 patients (819 women, 349 men) were included during the 3 -year period. The mean incidence rate of CTS per 1000 person-years was higher in employed than unemployed persons (1. 7 vs. 0. 8 in women and 0. 6 vs. 0. 3 in men). The excess risk of CTS was statistically significant for male (RR 4. 2) and female (RR 3. 0) blue-collar workers and female lower-grade white-collar workers (RR 2. 5). The AFE to work in general was 47 % (95 % confidence interval: 39 - 54) in women. AFEs reached higher values in female blue-collar workers [67 % (65 - 68) ] and lower-grade services, sales, and clerical white-collar workers [61 % (57 - 64) ]. The AFE in male blue-collar workers was 76 % (72 - 80). These data show a higher incidence of CTS in the working than the <b>non-working</b> <b>population</b> and suggest that a substantial proportion of CTS cases diagnosed in lower-grade white-collar and blue-collar workers are attributable to work.

40|$|Social {{distance}} scales can {{be defined}} in contemporary Western societies, based on the Weberian assertion that “social status” could be observed through close relationships between individuals, like marriage or friendship (see T. W. Chan, J. Goldthorpe, 2004). Here, we will consider scales built in France {{on the basis of}} the homogamy tendency. Our main concern will be on the gender neutrality of these scales. Indeed, whereas Goldthorpe and Chan assert that the status hierarchy is gender-neutral, they underline, using a multidimensional scaling analysis of the British matrix of friendship, that a second dimension expresses the degree of sex segregation of occupational categories. The aim of this paper is to assess this result when gender differences are more accurately taken into account than they are in previous analysis. That’s why we include <b>non-working</b> <b>population,</b> people without partners and part-time work for women. When taking into account all these elements, can we still assert that men and women in a same occupational category always have an equivalent status? More theoretically, is occupation sufficient to define social status ? The data come from the Echantillon Démographique Permanent (permanent demographic sample). The analysis will cover only 30 - 59 years old men and women in 1999. The method used is Multidimensional scaling. Hierarchy of status is actually similar for both genders, even if clear differences in scores appear for some categories. However, second dimensions are not correlated, thus revealing distinct overall structure by gender. When full-time/part-time work status is introduced among women’s occupational categories, it reveals the valuation of higher and intermediate categories working part-time compared to their counterparts working full-time. Finally, these findings question the meaning of social distance scales based on occupation only, and advocate taking into account the combination of family and occupational roles for a better appraisal of gender differences in social status. ...|$|E
40|$|Demographic changes {{after the}} Second World War have {{resulted}} in the Japanese people having the world 2 ̆ 7 s highest life expectancy. This, coupled with the declining birth rate, has caused a rapid growth in the proportion of aged people in the population and a declining proportion of the population in the workforce to support the <b>non-working</b> <b>population.</b> At the same time, post-War changes in social conditioning and family structures are diminishing the availability and reliability of family members to act as caregivers to the aged. Historical evidence suggests that the Japanese people, and in particular the government, are open to finding technological solutions to address their social and economic problems. One method of dealing with the scarce resources for aged care in Japan is to develop and utilise technology that assists the elderly to maintain as much independence {{for as long as possible}} and to assist care-givers by easing their workload. This thesis examines three technology options that can be used to help aged care in Japan today. Option One uses only standard technology from other countries; Option Two calls for investment primarily in high-level technology development, exemplified by robotics technology; Option Three concentrates on developing and using smaller-scale technology such as barrier-free technology for aged care. Details of the development of robotics and barrier-free technologies and the assumptions underlying their development for aged care are examined. The thesis discusses ways in which these options affect various stakeholders—the government, researchers, professional care-givers, family care-givers and recipients of the care. This framework for assessing technology for aged care—spelling out options, unearthing assumptions underlying the options and surveying effects—is a useful and convenient tool for policy makers and other interested parties...|$|E
40|$|Based upon a {{wide range}} of archive records, the article covers issues {{relating}} to particular aspects of life and living standards of silk weaving factory workers’ families in a village of Fryanovo of Moskovski county in XVIII — fi rst quarter of XIX centuries. Workers’ daily life was signifi cantly infl uenced by living conditions. It is via this article that we analyze dimensions and types of living premises provided to workers by the factory owners, as well as its improvements. The Fryanovo factory offi ce records that remain intact allow consideration of issues relating to food for workers, including sources for providing Fryanovo inhabitants with bread and other food products, the composition and the average amount thereof. One chapter of the article is specifi cally devoted to workers’ worship service attendance, as well as diff erences in religion belief of Fryanovo inhabitants. In addition to the orthodox Christian majority of its population, there were also Catholics and Old Believers among its inhabitants. The issues directly relating to working at the silk weaving factory include work schedule and rules, average age of workers, wage payment methods, as well as workers motivation by the silk weaving factory owner. Considered are the issues relating to employment of children and women at the silk weaving factory. An important part of the research relates to living conditions of <b>non-working</b> <b>population</b> groups: young children, retired and handicaps who were given some money or bread, on monthly bases, by silk weaving factory owners. Medical services for the silk weaving factory workers, personal taxation and other fees, participation by factory workers, in recruitments, penalties and fi nes system as implemented by the silk weaving factory in Fryanovo are also within the spectrum of questions that are discussed within the article. The fi nal chapter of the research points out the village inner life issues, such as alcohol abuse among workers, crimes they committed, as well as workers’ interrelations with other neighbor villages inhabitants. In general, the matters considered allow improving understanding the life of workers and their families by large possession enterprises of Russia in XVIII — fi rst quarter of XIX centurie...|$|E
