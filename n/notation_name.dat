The notation of these modes was accomplished primarily through using ligatures in varying lengths and with varying degrees of complexity, where the rhythms would be derived from context. For most of their notated history, this was the purpose of ligatures: to indicate the rhythmic mode.|$|R
50|$|The Schoenflies (or Schönflies) <b>notation,</b> <b>named</b> {{after the}} German {{mathematician}} Arthur Moritz Schoenflies, {{is one of}} two conventions commonly used to describe point groups.

A point group in the Schoenflies convention is completely adequate to describe the symmetry of a molecule; this is sufficient for spectroscopy. The Hermann-Mauguin notation is able to describe the space group of a crystal lattice, while the Schoenflies notation isn't. Thus the Hermann-Mauguin notation is used in crystallography.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of sensor technology and electronic miniaturization, wireless sensor networks have shown {{a wide range of}} promising applications as well as challenges. Early stage sensor network analysis is critical, which allows us to reveal design errors before sensor deployment. Due to their distinguishable features, system specification and verification of sensor networks are highly non-trivial tasks. On the other hand, numerous formal theories and analysis tools have been developed in formal methods community, which may offer a systematic method for formal analysis of sensor networks. This paper presents our attempt on applying formal methods to sensor network specification/verification. An integrated <b>notation</b> <b>named</b> Active Sensor Processes is proposed for high-level specification. Next, we experiment formal verification techniques to reveal design flaws in sensor network applications. ...|$|R

The {{purpose is to}} find a mean square stable MJLS of lower order such that the time-weighted H 2 norm of the corresponding error system is minimized for a given mean square stable discrete MJLS. A new <b>notation</b> <b>named</b> time-weighted H 2 norm of discrete MJLS is defined for the model reduction purpose for the first time. Then a computational formula of the time-weighted H 2 norm is given. Based on this formula, a gradient flow method is proposed to solve the optimal time-weighted H 2 model reduction problem. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2014 TCCT, CAA. postprin...|$|R
