Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One {{of the other things}} I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be a}} sex kitten, she's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl.

It conveys its [...] "absurd" [...] plot through suggestion, leaving any special-effects sequences of Tooms' abilities until the audience is [...] "already suitably adjusted to the absurdity". However, Shearman and Pearson found the monologue likening the crimes committed by Tooms to the Holocaust, given by the retired detective Briggs, to be [...] "not only unnecessary but tasteless to boot".

2500|$|In {{the top of}} the eighth, the Red Sox had Dave Henderson {{on second}} with one out. Manager John McNamara sent rookie Mike Greenwell to pinch hit for Roger Clemens in an effort to match Greenwell, a left-handed batter, against the Mets' {{dominant}} short-relief man Roger McDowell even as righty slugger Don Baylor sat on the bench; Greenwell struck out and the Sox scored no runs that inning. It was initially said that Clemens was removed from the game due to a blister forming on one of his fingers, but both he and McNamara dispute this. Clemens said to Bob Costas on an MLB Network program concerning the 1986 postseason that McNamara decided to pull him despite Clemens wanting to pitch. McNamara said to Costas that Clemens [...] "begged out" [...] of the game. Bruce Hurst and Calvin Schiraldi, who also appeared on the program, said that because McNamara had started warming Schiraldi in the bullpen in the previous inning, {{there would have been no}} bearing on the decision whatsoever as Clemens was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out for the bottom of the inning.|$|E

5000|$|Reviews of {{the film}} have been positive. Film Threat's Bradley Gibson gives Traceroute 10/10 points and writes: [...] "Traceroute is the most fun I've ever had {{watching}} a documentary. If you're a nerd (and you are) this is the road trip you've always wanted to take with your smartest, geekiest friend. You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home. It's Cosmos. It's DragonCon on wheels. It's your favorite sex fantasy. It's alcohol soaked nonviolent subversive protest mobile and WiFi linked. It's On The Road updated with tech, science, pseudoscience, sex, and fandom." [...] Mental Floss' Chris Higgins writes about Traceroute: [...] "As many nerds have noticed, there's a glut of nerd-positive documentaries out there, {{but they tend to}} be either too self-serious, or too focused on the trappings of fandom to actually say much. Traceroute manages to be a real film, with humor and true insight (sometimes called out for us—and delightfully nullified—with a blinking 'INSIGHT' faux-HTML tag onscreen), primarily because it focuses on Grenzfurthner's personal journey, and he doesn't take himself too seriously. Let's put that another way: The director uses himself and a handful of subjects to create his story, and that specificity—coupled with his playfulness—makes it work. At one point he licks the chrome head of a Terminator prop. Then he licks a zombie head prop. Then he licks the propmaster himself. It's delightful." [...] Pop culture magazine Boing Boing calls Traceroute [...] "a brilliantly careening biography of a highly enigmatic species. ... Traceroute is radical individual empiricism, a narrative biographical puzzle and an experimental projection matrix. Despite continual stimulus satiation, it is wonderful fun: the film tickles the synapses with a perfectly mixed cocktail of collectively shared context and quirkiness." [...] Patrick Lichty of net culture magazine Furtherfield calls it [...] "magical (...) After watching Traceroute, I was left with a real exhilaration and a deeply reflective feeling at once. (...) What Traceroute reveals is the tradition of alterity just beneath the surface of Western culture, and that it has a powerful effect on our mass consciousness, whether it is in plain sight or not." [...] Felix Knoke of Engadget Germany writes: [...] "For me it is the best nerd documentary I've seen so far. Simply for the fact that it doesn't take itself as deadly serious as the other ones. (...) Traceroute deserves high praise because it represents an old-school definition of nerd culture, one that is never compatible with fintech, unicorn and iGod." [...] Pop culture critic Thomas Kaestle comments: [...] "Traceroute is game, challenge, encyclopedia, and sentimental journey all in one. As a documentary it is most skillfully composed. And as a narration it is highly compatible. This film will, in passing, sweep proclaimed nerds off their feet. And it will touch the hearts of those who still need some explanation." [...] Diamond in the Rough Films praises Grenzfurthner's hosting and storytelling: [...] "This doc works in some very unconventional ways, {{not the least of which}} is our plucky protagonist. Grenzfurthner is an absolute charmer as our host and his narration is note-perfect (the accent is so cool in that Werner Herzog kind of way). It's really rare in a documentary about a not-that-famous person where you become almost instantly won-over and invested in their personal journey." [...] Blogger and sci-fiction author Cory Doctorow states about Traceroute that [...] "Johannes is a brilliant lunatic of surpassing and delightful weirdness." [...] MicroFilmmaker Magazine writes: [...] "The different people Grenzfurthner chatted with were genuinely interesting and the organic way he moved from place to place was intriguing. ... You'll find that you've learned an awful lot about technology, nerdiness, and America." [...] Richard Propes (The Independent Critic) writes: [...] "It's challenging. It's thought-provoking. It's remarkably honest. It's well researched. ... If you're expecting nothing more than your usual nerd doc with its cosplay cuteness and asocial gamers, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>not</b> just disappointed but probably traumatized. Grenzfurthner is clearly full-on willing to challenge culture, stereotypes, accepted thoughts and just about everything else. There's a healthy dose of sexuality in Traceroute, which one might expect, yet Grenzfurthner also immerses the film in politics, activism and social shifts. ... Refreshingly devoid of the pretentiousness so often found amongst truly intellectual films, Traceroute is simultaneously a pretty wonderful personal journey and an immensely satisfying cinematic experience." ...|$|R

When the Public Opinion Strategies poll put Colbert ahead of Bill Richardson, Richardson's spokesman responded: [...] "This is a serious election with serious consequences {{and we are not}} going to comment on this ridiculous exercise". Katon Dawson, South Carolina's Republican party chairman believed Colbert would be better off using the $35,000 entrance fee to [...] "buy a sports car and get a girlfriend".

He had the same brisk, light step, and though his beard was well whitened and his auburn hair had grown ashen through the red, his face had the freshness and his eyes the clearness of a young man's. I suppose the novelty of his life kept him from thinking about his years; or perhaps in contact with those great, insenescent Englishmen, he could not feel himself old. At any rate he did not once speak of age, as he used to do ten years earlier, and I, then half through my forties, was still [...] "You young dog" [...] to him. It was a bright and cheerful renewal of the early kindliness between us, on which indeed there had never been a shadow, except such as distance throws.

Three-quarters of an hour passed without any further sound being heard, and then Godfrey, who had been stamping his feet and swinging his arms to keep himself warm, heard a confused murmur. Looking along the line he saw that the others were all on the alert, and he accordingly took up his gun and began to gaze across the snow. The right-hand barrel was loaded with shot, the left with ball. Presently a shot rang out away on his right, followed almost immediately afterwards by another. After this evidence that there must be something in the forest he watched more eagerly for signs of life. Presently he saw a hare coming loping along.

Others followed to the right and left of him, and presently a hare, which he had not noticed, dashed past at full speed, almost touching his legs. He was so startled for the moment that the hare had got some distance before he had turned round and was ready to fire, and he was in no way surprised to see it dash on unharmed by his shot. When there was a pause in the firing the shouting recommenced, this time not far distant, and he soon saw men making their way towards him through the trees.|$|E

Our idea is that Northwick didn't go to Europe--of course he didn't!--but he's just holding out for terms with the company.
