We measuredthe asymmetry ACPKπ of the branching fractions of D → K−π+ in CP-odd and CP-even eigenstates to be (12. 7 ± 1. 3 ± 0. 7) × 10 − 2. ACPKπ {{can be used}} to extract the strong phase difference δKπ between the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed process D̅ 0 → K−π+ and the Cabibbo-favored process D 0 → K−π+. Using world-average values of external parameters, we obtain cos δKπ = 1. 02 ± 0. 11 ± 0. 06 ± 0. 01. Here, the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively, while the third uncertainty arises from the external parameters.
