40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{modelling}} the morphological of Block Copolymers (BCPs) by using computer simulation. In this work, the Cell Dynamics Simulation (CDS) method is used, {{which is a}} good compromise between computational speed and physical accuracy. First, it has been performed a 3 -dimensional study of diblock copolymer standing up cylinders in two different types of confinement: topographical and chemical patterns. In the case of square walls of small sizes the system is dominated by the walls, inducing a 2 x 2 square lattice of cylinders, while in large boxes the system is dominated by hexagonal packing. For intermediate sizes topographical confinement has a stronger influence than chemical pattern confinement and can induce a better system of 3 x 3 square lattice cylinders. For square confinement compatible with a 4 x 4 square lattice the tetragonal phase is observed to be a transient system leading towards a twisted hexagonal packing. Simulations have also been performed in a diamond lattice which can naturally accommodate hexagonal packing, and rectangular boxes which can induce better orientation of the hexagonal lattice along the direction parallel to the long side. Next, diblock copolymer cylinder-forming thin films confined between two parallel selective homogeneous walls have been investigated. By changing the value of the surface field and the value of the film thickness several morphologies have been observed. In order to tailor desired structures some of these morphologies are studied under a simple steady shear flow. Shear flow is observed to induce a better hexagonal packing of a monolayer of perforated lamellae and of a monolayer of cylinders perpendicular to the thin film plane. A monolayer of cylinders parallel to the thin film plane with random orientation is found to align perfectly in the shear flow direction. Further increase of the shear rate induces a phase transition: from one perforated lamellae layer to one lamellae layer; from a double layer of perforated lamellae to parallel cylinder layers; and from a monolayer of cylinders perpendicular to the thin film plane to two half parallel cylinder layers. In the end, self-assembly of lamellae-, cylinder-, bicontinuous, and sphere-forming diblock copolymers in spherical confinement is studied. The effects of different confine- ment size and selective surface are examined systematically. The simulations reveal that a rich variety of morphologies, ranging from onion-like structures, perforated lamellae, helices structures, and the coexistence of perforated and lamellae structures, can be formed spontaneously from a randomly generated initial state. The structure diagrams of lamellae-forming diblock copolymers show that the morphologies obtained with a selective surface are similar to those obtained with a <b>negative</b> <b>selective</b> <b>surface,</b> but different to those found with a neutral selective surface. The structural diagrams of bicontinuous-, sphere-, and cylinder-forming diblock copolymers show that the morphologies found for surfaces selective for different blocks are different from each other. In the case of bicontinuous-forming diblock copolymers the morphological behaviour obtained with a neutral surface is similar to those obtained when the surface is selective for the minority block. In the case of sphere-forming diblock copolymers the morphologies obtained with a neutral surface are similar to those found with surface selective for the majority block. Instead, for cylinder-forming diblock copolymers the morphology obtained under a neutral surface is totally different from those obtained when the surface is selective...|$|E

40|$|Reconfigurable antennas have {{recently}} formed a popular research topic. They are attracting {{the interest of}} many industry professionals. This is basically due to the growing demands for more functionality while occupying the same or even smaller physical volume. Using various antennas for wireless applications is no longer effective because having several antennas take too much space. Reconfigurable antennas are the best solution to provide a better performance in terms of flexibility, efficiency and combination of several electromagnetic spectrum applications. Frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> are exploited in many communication applications, especially in designing reconfigurable antennas due {{to their ability to}} control the electromagnetic field. A frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> is an important figure concept in reconfigurable antenna structures and has developed rapidly due to their unique properties in suppressing the surface wave propagation. The main topic of this research is to design new reconfigurable radiation pattern antennas with enhanced performance by using switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The antenna consists of a central radiating source surrounded by switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> unit cells to give the antenna beam, shaping capability to scan 360 degree in the azimuth plane. Novel switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> unit cells with various structures are designed and their characteristics are compared in both the reflective and transparent states. The reconfigurable response is the basic concept in the antenna design. This is achieved by adding PIN diodes to the lines that will connect or disconnect the unit cells and transform the frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> to be either a reflective or a transparent surface. As a consequence, switching the frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> PIN diodes leads to control the antenna beam direction. In this thesis, two novel reconfigurable antennas with frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> unit cells are presented, each antenna works at a different frequency band. The switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> utilized in the proposed antennas operates at different frequency bands. The research topic in this thesis includes investigations and techniques to increase the bandwidth and improve the radiation characteristics of the reconfigurable antennas by using new switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> unit cells. Experimental results show the preference of the proposed antennas over those presented in the literature. Thus, two new reconfigurable antennas are implemented and their enhanced performances in terms of bandwidth are proven...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that for {{high-power}} microwaves and other extreme environments, the use of resonant metallic elements in frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be problematic. The solution developed within this dissertation to solve these problems was to use guided-mode resonance phenomenon to create all-dielectric frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> that could survive these extreme environments. ^ To fully understand how these devices work, three different computational electromagnetic methods are formulated and implemented. The formulation of these methods start with the differential form of Maxwell’s equation and are derived {{all the way down}} to the final simulation state. This is done sequentially and all the work is shown for comprehension and completeness. ^ These computational electromagnetic methods are then implemented into two different heuristic optimization algorithms. These optimization algorithms are used to develop three new and novel devices that solve the problems associated with all-dielectric frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces.</b> All the devices developed in this work have been manufactured and experimentally tested. In the case of the high power devices, these were tested at the High Power Microwave Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to solve a constrained inverse problem encountered {{in the design of}} frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> (FSS's). Due to the many-to-one nonlinear functional relationship between an FSS and its frequency response, there is no closed form solution directly from the given desired frequency response to the corresponding surface. Therefore, to design an FSS for a given response, one has to search in the knowledge base through a trial-and-error procedure. This procedure can be a very laborious and tedious process. Our approach adopts an iterative regularized inversion technique, which starts with an inversion algorithm for multilayer perceptrons to generate the corresponding 2 -D surface for the given desired frequency response, a constraint satisfaction mechanism is then used to reshape the 2 -D surface to satisfy the constraints, and the resulting surface is used as the initial point for the next inversion algorithm.
