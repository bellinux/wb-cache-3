30|$|There is {{therefore}} a strong reason to hypothesise that blending common mineral N fertilisers with organic materials as organo-mineral fertilisers could reduce off-site fertiliser N loss.

40|$|Abstract—In modern agriculture, {{polymeric}} hydrogels {{are known}} as a component able to hold an amount of water due to their 3 -dimensional network structure and their tendency to absorb water in humid environments. In addition, these hydrogels are able to controllably release the fertilisers and pesticides loaded in them. Therefore, they deliver these materials to the plants ' roots and help them with growing. These hydrogels also reduce the pollution of underground water sources by preventing the active components from leaching. In this study, sIPN acrylamide based hydrogels are synthesised by using acrylamide free radical, potassium acrylate, and linear polyvinyl alcohol. Ammonium nitrate is loaded in the hydrogel as the fertiliser. The effect of various amounts of monomers and linear polymer, measured in molar ratio, on the swelling rate, equilibrium swelling, and release of ammonium nitrate is studied.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show the results of the Italian {{research}} project of national interest (PRIN) launched in 2006 and finished in 2008, concerning the "assessment of groundwater contamination risk by nitrates assessment". The project verified the IPNOA method for nitrate groundwater contamination risk assessment in four test-sites of Italy. The IPNOA is a parametric index which assesses the potential hazard of nitrate contamination originating from agriculture on a regional scale. The method integrates two categories of parameters: the hazard factors (HF), which represent all farming activities that cause, or might cause, an impact on soil quality in terms of <b>nitrate</b> (use of <b>fertilisers,</b> application of livestock and poultry manure, food industry wastewater and urban sludge), and the control factors (CF) which adapt the hazard factors to the characteristics of the site (geographical location, climatic conditions and agronomic practices). Finally, the Potential Risk Map is obtained by coupling the potential hazard of nitrate pollution (IPNOA) and the aquifer Contamination Vulnerability Map. The project was carried out by five Research Units (RU) from the Politecnico di Torino, Universities of Piacenza, Florence, Naples and Palermo. The geochemistry of groundwaters from the four test-sites was studied to determine the distribution of nitrate, and to evaluate groundwater chemical facies. All the study areas are affected by groundwater nitrate contamination and often by hydrogeochemical peculiarities.

50|$|Usable {{nitrogen}} may be {{lost from}} soils when {{it is in the}} form of nitrate, as it is easily leached. Further losses of nitrogen occur by denitrification, the process whereby soil bacteria convert nitrate (NO3−) to nitrogen gas, N2 or N2O. This occurs when poor soil aeration limits free oxygen, forcing bacteria to use the oxygen in nitrate for their respiratory process. Denitrification increases when oxidisable organic material is available and when soils are warm and slightly acidic. Denitrification may vary throughout a soil as the aeration varies from place to place. Denitrification may cause the loss of 10 to 20 percent of the available nitrates within a day and when conditions are favourable to that process, losses of up to 60 percent of <b>nitrate</b> applied as <b>fertiliser</b> may occur.|$|R

40|$|Aim The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} {{epidemiological study}} was to investigate possible associations between occupational exposure, respiratory symptoms and change in lung function among employees at a mineral fertiliser production plant. Material and methods Lung function indices (forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and lung diffusing capacity (DLCO)) were measured in 2007 and 2010 among employees at a fertiliser production plant. In 2007, 349 persons participated (86 % of those eligible). Of the 283 participants remaining at work three years later, 6 % did not participate in the second phase of lung function measurement. In addition to those participating in 2007, 34 additional employees participated in 2010, for a total of 383 participants. The employees consented to spirometry test and diffusing capacity test and answered a respiratory symptoms questionnaire during each testing session. In 2007, rhinometry was performed {{at the same time as}} the lung function testing. In 2010, the subjects at the plant answered a questionnaire on work history with an emphasis on the three-year follow-up period. The employees were classified in job groups by production department according to their principal affiliation during follow-up. Study participants tested only once were grouped in the department they served on the day of lung function testing. Employees in the administration or working in average less than 2 hours/week in the production were assigned to the job-group “Other”. The exposure assessment was performed in 2007 - 08 in all the departments at the plant; ammonia, nitric acid, compound fertiliser, and calcium nitrate departments, as well as a shipping area. A total of 178 inhalable and 179 thoracic personal aerosol mass fraction samples were collected from randomly chosen workers (N= 141), whereof 23 % of the workers participated more than once. Masses of inhalable and thoracic aerosol fractions were measured gravimetrically. Water-soluble and water-insoluble aerosol fractions were analysed for the major constituents, Ca, K, Mg, and P. Concentrations of F-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, PO 43 -and SO 42 - in the water-soluble aerosol fraction and leachates from impregnated gas filter-pads were analysed. NH 3, CO, and NO 2 were measured using direct-reading electrochemical sensors. In addition, a sub study on exposure assessment using video exposure monitoring strategy was conducted during a week in May 2009 to identify short-term peak episodes. Results An adjusted, statistically significant decline in FEV 1 of 18 mL/year during the followup was found for the total group, but no significant decline in FVC. The workers in the nitric acid department had a statistically significant decline in FEV 1, but the absolute decline was of the same magnitude as for those in the Ammonia and Compound fertiliser A departments. DLCO showed a statistically significant decline of 0. 068 mmol/min/kPa/year for the total group. The prevalence of selected self-reported respiratory symptoms; morning cough, cough with phlegm, cough with phlegm > 3 months/yr, and wheezing, varied between 6. 5 to 26. 2 %, with only morning cough showing a statistical significant increase from 8. 0 % in 2007 to 13. 7 % in 2010. No association was found between respiratory symptoms and the decline in lung function indices, and borderline significant correlation was found between nasal patency and FEV 1 % predicted. The median inhalable and thoracic aerosol mass concentration exposure levels were 1. 1 mg/m 3 (min-max: < 0. 93 - 45) and 0. 21 mg/m 3 (min-max: < 0. 085 - 11), respectively. The highest median aerosol mass concentrations were found in the compound fertiliser departments with median inhalable mass air concentration of 3. 0 mg/m 3 in Compound fertiliser C and median thoracic mass air concentration of 0. 78 mg/m 3 in Compound fertiliser A. The median air concentrations of CO, NH 3, and NO 2 in all departments were predominantly below the limit of detection (2 ppm, 3 ppm, 0. 2 ppm, respectively). However, some short-term peak episodes of NH 3 and NO 2 were detected, e. g. when performing tasks like cleaning and sampling for quality control. Conclusion An observed adjusted decline in lung function indices was found in this three-year follow-up of workers at a <b>nitrate</b> <b>fertiliser</b> plant. The prevalence of morning cough increased in the follow-up period, but no association between respiratory symptoms and decline in lung function indices was found. A borderline correlation was found between nasal patency and FEV 1 % predicted. The exposure levels for aerosols and gases were generally low with many measurements below the limit of detection. No plausible exposure related explanation for the overall lung function decline during follow-up was found. List of papers. The papers are removed from the thesis due to publisher restrictions.

Scheduling irrigation using the calendars gave similar irrigation applications, water losses and yields compared to a more scientific real-time scheduling (in response to soil water depletion by the crop). While site-specific irrigation scheduling calendars can easily be generated by consultants and irrigators, even simpler monthly estimates of average daily water use can also be useful.

In support of my hypothesis, growth of Cynodon dactylon was greater from ammonium than nitrate nutrition in terms of aboveground and total plants yields at 200 ppm and 400 ppm and this was associated with efficient utilisation of this form of nitrogen by this species. Production from the nitrate treatments was restricted and showed no change with increase in external nitrogen supply. Decreased dry weights from the ammonium nutrition at 600 ppm were associated with toxicity of ammonium ions in plant tissues. High levels of nitrogen measured from the nitrate treatments {{were associated with the}} soluble nitrogen that was not assimilated for yield increase by this grass, Uptake of ammonium ion was shown to result· in high of uptake phosphorus. This study shows that Cynodon dactylon has the capacity for increased growth under ammonium nutrition while this was limited in the nitrate nutrition. However, response is restricted when excessively fertilised with ammonium nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|Pratylenchus thornei {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} {{of wheat}} in Australia. Two glasshouse experiments with four wheat cultivars that had different final populations (Pf) of P. thornei in the field were used to optimise conditions for assessing resistance. With different initial populations (Pi) ranging up to 5250 P. thornei/kg soil, Pf of P. thornei increased to 16 weeks after sowing, and then decreased at 20 weeks in some cultivar x Pi combinations. The population dynamics of P. thornei up to 16 weeks were best described by a modified exponential equation P f (t) = aP i e kt where P f (t) is the final population density at time t, P i is the initial population density, a is the proportion of P i that initiates population development, and k is the intrinsic rate of increase of the population. The cultivar GS 50 a had very low k values at Pi of 5250 and 1050 indicating its resistance, Suneca and Potam had high k values indicating susceptibility, whereas intolerant Gatcher had a low value at the higher Pi and a high value at the lower Pi. <b>Nitrate</b> <b>fertiliser</b> increased plant growth and Pf values of susceptible cultivars, but in unplanted soil it decreased Pf. Nematicide (aldicarb 5 mg/kg soil) killed P. thornei more effectively in planted than in unplanted soil and increased plant growth particularly {{in the presence of}} N fertiliser. In both experiments, the wheat cultivars Suneca and Potam were more susceptible than the cultivar GS 50 a reflecting field results. The method chosen to discriminate wheat cultivars was to assess Pf after growth for 16 weeks in soil with Pi ~ 1050 – 5250 P. thornei/kg soil and fertilised with 200 mg NO 3 –N/kg soil...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogenous {{fertilisers}} {{are under}} consideration for promoting {{the growth of}} nursery-reared hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A. Cunn) seedlings in the establishment phase of second rotation (2 R) plantations. Using 15 N-labelled fertilisers, we investigated the effect of different forms (ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and urea) and rates of application (0, 150 and 300 mg N kg- 1 dried soil) of fertilisers on the growth, 15 N recovery and carbon isotope composition (d 13 C) of hoop pine seedlings in a 12 -month glasshouse trial in southeast Queensland, Australia. The 15 N-labelled fertilisers were applied to nursery-reared hoop pine seedlings, which were then grown in pots, containing ca. 1. 2 kg dried soil, under well watered conditions for 12 months. Four seedlings from each treatment were harvested at 4 -month intervals, divided into roots, stem and foliage, with a further subdivision for new and old foliage, and then analysed for 15 N, total N, d 13 C and total C. There was no significant response in the seedling growth to the form or rate of application of nitrogen (N) fertiliser within the 12 -month period, indicating that the seedlings did not experience N deficiency when grown on second rotation hoop pine soils. While the combined 15 N recovery from soil and plant remained at around 70 % throughout the experiment, the proportion of 15 N recovered from the plants increasing steadily over time. <b>Nitrate</b> containing <b>fertilisers</b> at 150 mg N kg- 1 soil gradually increased seedling foliage ? 13 C over the 12 -month period, indicating an increase in seedling water use efficiency.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an {{important}} and potent greenhouse gas (GHG). Although application of nitrogen (N) fertiliser is a feature of many grazing systems, limited data is available on N 2 O emissions in grassland {{as a result of}} the interaction between urine, dung and fertiliser N. A small plot study was conducted to identify the individual and interactive effects of calcium ammonium <b>nitrate</b> (CAN) <b>fertiliser,</b> dung and urine. Application of CAN with dung and urine significantly increased the mass of N 2 O-N emission. Importantly, the sum of N 2 O-N emitted from dung and CAN applied individually approximated the emission from dung and CAN fertiliser applied together, that is, an additive effect. However, in the case of urine and CAN applied together, the emission was more than double the sum of the emission from urine and CAN fertiliser applied individually, that is, a multiplicative effect. Nitrous oxide emissions from dung, urine and fertiliser N are typically derived individually and these individual emission estimates are aggregated to produce estimates of N 2 O emission. The presented findings have important implications for how individual emission factors are aggregated; they suggest that the multiplicative effect of the addition of CAN fertiliser to urine patches needs to be taken into account to refine the estimation of N 2 O emissions from grazing grasslands. peer-reviewedThe authors wish to thank the Environmental Protection Agency for funding support under the Environmental Research Technological Development and Innovation programme and the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for funding support (Grant numbers RSF 13 S 430 and 11 S 138).
