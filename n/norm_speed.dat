40|$|Speed {{communication}} analysis (Wicklund & Vandekerckhove, 2000) {{suggests that}} the interplay between communicative velocity and sensorial bandwidth is fundamental to predict psychological consequences in mediated communication. In line with this viewpoint, Bertacco and Deponte (2005) found that students using e-mail communication (speedy media) were more concise and less inclined to take the recipient's perspective than were students who communicated by postal letter (slow media). Drawing on speed communication analysis, two experiments were conducted to examine (a) the presence of social norms and (b) behavioral regulation in e-mail versus postal letter communication. In Experiment 1, students anticipated either an e-mail or a postal letter interaction with a fictitious confederate. Results supported the existence of social <b>norms</b> for <b>speed</b> communication because the simple anticipation of an e-mail interaction resulted in a shortfall in the recipient's perspective taking. In experiment 2, students who were typing either an e-mail or a postal letter were unexpectedly interrupted. Findings were in line with an attentional model of mediated interactions based on the speed communication analysis: Students who wrote a postal letter were (a) more likely to remember the interruption and (b) less sensitive to external stimuli than were e-mail students.

40|$|Objective: This thesis {{examines}} {{the timing of}} having the first child in relation to when Swedish men and women leave the parental home. The aim is to explain if any childbearing trends can be detected based on whether one leaves the parental home at a younger or older relative age than the current age norms. The timing of having the first child might be affected by either a speed up/slow down effect (one continues to experience other stages of adulthood faster or slower relative to people of the same age) or an age-norm effect (one tries to counter-act deviation from the home-leaving <b>norm</b> by <b>speeding</b> up or delaying childbearing to align with people of the same age).   Method and Data: Event history analysis is applied using a multivariate piece-wise constant hazard model. The data comes from Swedish register data based on records of the entire Swedish population between 1 January 1953 and 31 December 2012.   Results: The results indicate that Swedish women who leave the parental home younger than the norm run {{a greater risk of}} having their first child sooner after leaving the parental home relative to women of the same age. Swedish men who leave the parental home younger than the norm, on the other hand, run a greater risk of having the first child later after leaving the parental home relative to men of the same age. Swedish men who leave the parental home later than the norm run a greater risk of having their first child sooner after leaving the parental home relative to men of the same age while the opposite is true for women. However, the effects of timing of leaving the parental home are relatively small, which {{can be explained by the}} very long and stable mean durations found. The peak durations of intensities, i. e. number of years between leaving the parental home and having the first child, for men and women can be found after 10 – 12 years. The peak durations of intensities are remarkably similar between the genders.   Conclusion: Swedish women who leave the parental home earlier than the norm are more likely to experience a speed-up effect in terms of childbearing and a slow down effect when leaving the parental home later than the norm. Thus, women stick to breaking the normative timing of the life course events once they have started. Swedish men, on the other hand, are more likely to try and catch up with age norms and instead postpone having the first child when leaving the parental home earlier than the <b>norm</b> and <b>speed</b> up having a child when leaving the parental home later than the norm. Men are thus more likely to time having children with men of the same age. Stockholm University SIMSAM Node for Demographic Researc...|$|R
40|$|To {{automate}} high-throughput phenotyping for infield biomass sorghum morphological traits characterization, {{a capable}} 3 D vision {{system that can}} overcome challenges imposed by field conditions including variable lighting, strong wind and extreme plant height is needed. Among all available 3 D sensors, traditional stereo cameras offer a viable solution to obtaining high-resolution 3 D point-cloud data {{with the use of}} high-accuracy (sub-pixel) stereo matching algorithms, which, however, are inevitably highly computational. This paper reports a GPU-based parallelized implementation of the PatchMatch Stereo algorithm which reconstructs highly slanted leaf and stalk surfaces of sorghum at high speed from high-resolution stereo image pairs. Our algorithm enhanced accuracy and smoothness by using L 2 norm for color distance calculation instead of L 1 <b>norm</b> and <b>speeded</b> up convergence by testing the plane of the lowest cost within a local window in addition to the original spatial propagation. To better handle textureless regions, after left-right consistency check, the disparity of an occluded pixel is assigned to that of a nearby non-occluded pixel with the most similar pattern. Some of these occluded pixels in textureless region would survive a following left-right consistency check. Therefore more valid pixels would exist in textureless regions for occlusion filling. Accuracy and performance were evaluated on Middlebury datasets as well as our sorghum datasets. It achieved a high ranking in Middlebury table of subpixel precision and revealed subtle details on leaf and stalk surfaces. The output disparity maps were used to estimate stalk diameters of different varieties and growth stages. The results showed high correlation to hand measurement...|$|R
40|$|Instead of {{studying}} evolutions governed by an evolutionary system starting {{at a given}} initial state on a prescribed future time interval, finite or infinite, we tackle the problem of looking both for a past interval [T-D,T] of aperture (or length, duration) D and for the viable evolutions arriving at a prescribed terminal state {{at the end of}} the temporal window (and thus telescoping if more than one such evolutions exist). Hence, given time and duration dependent evolutionary system and viability constraints, as well as time dependent departure constraints, the Cournot map associates with any terminal time T and state x the apertures D(T,x) of the intervals [T-D(T,x),T], the starting (or initial) states at the beginning of the temporal window from which at least one viable evolution will reach the given terminal state x at T. Cournot maps can be used by a pursuer to intercept an evader's evolution in dynamic game theory. After providing some properties of Cournot maps are next investigated, above all, the regulation map piloting the viables evolutions at each time and for each duration from the beginning of the temporal window up to terminal time. The next question investigated is the selection of controls or regulons in the regulation map whenever several of them exist. Selection processes are either time dependent, when the selection operates at each time, duration and state for selecting a regulon satisfying required properties (for instance, minimal <b>norm,</b> minimal <b>speed),</b> or intertemporal. In this case, viable evolutions are required to optimize some prescribed intertemporal functional, as in optimal control.

40|$|Great {{progress}} has been noted in Burkina Faso since the 1990 s in terms of access to safe drinking water. Some – but much smaller – progress {{can also be seen}} in access to adequate sanitation. When using the WHO/UNICEF JMP definitions of coverage of improved water supply, then Burkina Faso has already met the MDG targets on water. The access to sanitation is still very low; between 11 % and 20 % depending on whether one uses the national definitions or the JMP definitions. There is thus progressive realisation of the rights to water and sanitation although progress on sanitation is non-satisfactory. The obligations of the State for water and sanitation are clearly stated in Burkina Faso through international conventions and national legislation. The four human rights principles of accountability, transparency, participation and non-discrimination are to a varying extent integrated in the formal institutions, organisation and operations of the sector. However, there are serious weaknesses in how they are practically implemented. Accountability is a key problem, especially at regional and national level. Participatory mechanisms exist at local level but participation of women and other marginalised groups remain weak in many places and key decisions are made at other levels, jeopardizing the meaningfulness of participation where it occurs. While most information {{is open to the public}} it does not mean it is easily accessible. Mechanisms for non-discrimination e. g. in budgeting can be strengthened using already existing data on inequity. Burkina Faso has in several aspects met and overshot international normative criteria (minimum standards) of human rights to WSS. While more ambitious normative criteria are commendable in the long run, it is also more costly and thus the rate of realisation will be slower. A lower and more flexible <b>norm</b> could <b>speed</b> up the realisation of rights especially related to sanitation. On the whole, significant opportunities exist for realising the right to water and sanitation and the use of human rights based approaches in the water and sanitation sector in Burkina Faso.   Sida Helpdesk for Environment and Climate Change QC 20150624 </p...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Slow {{handwriting}} {{speed is}} one of the major problems encountered by school-aged children having handwriting difficulties. These children are often referred to occupational therapy for assessment and intervention. However, to date, no <b>norms</b> of handwriting <b>speed</b> have been published for the Iranian writing system for school-aged children. The purpose of this study was to document handwriting speed performance of Tehran children from Grades 2 to 5. Materials and Methods : Participants were 400 children from Grades 2 to 5 from 20 elementary schools in Tehran. Participants were asked to copy text that was printed at the top of page on the writing lines below with normal speed at 5 minutes. Then, the sheets were gathered and number of letters written, were calculated by Two raters. There for, Scores of 120 students rated as fast, normal or slow by their teachers were compared to examine the test's construct validityResults: Results showed that 50 % of children were boys and 50 % were girls.

40|$|With its new European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the European Union {{has begun}} to develop a further ring in a {{widening}} set of economic policy regimes that gravitate around it. There are now no less than six rings to this system. We observe that the EU economic regime has extended its outreach to all categories of countries but the degree of acceptance of EU economic <b>norms</b> and the <b>speed</b> of adoption of EU economic rules is diminishing in the areas further away from the EU core. In the immediate vicinity, the EFTA ring, {{a high level of}} economic standards existed prior to the countries’ full inclusion in the single market and the mechanisms of acquis enforcement have been modelled on the EU’s internal rules and procedures. In the outer rings of lower economic standards, the EU has been more successful in encouraging convergence on its economic norms in countries to which it has extended the membership perspective. The promise of full integration in the EU has legitimised the EU’s external governance through conditionality to steer the course of economic transition in the candidates and potential candidates. In the ENP ring, the EU has excluded the mega-incentive of accession as member state and this has decreased the possibilities for exerting strong leverage over the ENP partners. The evolving EU economic relationship with the Southern and Eastern neighbours is less hierarchical in nature and more based on mutual agreement and cooperation. In the outmost ring occupied by Russia, we see the EU reaching the geographical limits of its economic influence. Generally, the EU gravitational pull is getting weaker in the more distant periphery and the EU instruments are shifting from more traditional methods of hierarchical governance to softer modes of horizontal cooperation...|$|R
40|$|Normative {{influences}} on road user behaviour {{have been well}} documented and include such things as personal, group, subjective and moral norms. Commonly, normative factors are examined within one cultural context, although {{a few examples of}} exploring the issue across cultures exist. Such examples add to our understanding of differences in perceptions of the normative factors that may exert influence on road users and can assist in determining whether successful road safety interventions in one location may be successful in another. Notably, the literature is relatively silent on such influences in countries experiencing rapidly escalating rates of motorization. China is one such country where new drivers are taking to the roads in unprecedented numbers and authorities are grappling with the associated challenges. This paper presents results from qualitative and quantitative research on self-reported driving speeds of car drivers and related issues in Australia and China. Focus group interviews and questionnaires conducted in each country examined normative factors that might influence driving in each cultural context. Qualitative findings indicated perceptions of community acceptance of speeding were present in both countries but appeared more widespread in China, yet quantitative results did not support this difference. Similarly, with regard to negative social feedback from speeding, qualitative findings suggested no embarrassment associated with speeding among Chinese participants and mixed results among Australian participants, yet quantitative results indicated greater embarrassment for Chinese drivers. This issue was also examined from the perspective of self-identity and findings were generally similar across both samples and appear related to whether {{it is important to be}} perceived as a skilled/safe driver by others. An interesting and important finding emerged with regard to how Chinese drivers may respond to questions about road safety issues if the answers might influence foreigners’ perceptions of China. In attempting to assess community <b>norms</b> associated with <b>speeding,</b> participants were asked to describe what they would tell a foreign visitor about the prevalence of speeding in China. Responses indicated that if asked by a foreigner, people may answer in a manner that portrayed China as a safe country (e. g., that drivers do not speed), irrespective of the actual situation. This ‘faking good for foreigners’ phenomenon highlights the importance of considering ‘face’ when conducting research in China – a concept absent from the road safety literature. An additional noteworthy finding that has been briefly described in the road safety literature is the importance and strength of the normative influence of social networks (guanxi) in China. The use of personal networks to assist in avoiding penalties for traffic violations was described by Chinese participants and is an area that could be addressed to strengthen the deterrent effect of traffic law enforcement. Overall, the findings suggest important considerations for developing and implementing road safety countermeasures in different cultural contexts...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 32 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 8 - 11 July 2013 "Transport and Sustainable Infrastructure", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Skid resistance values found in older design manuals were typically based on studies where the worst case scenarios of bald tires, smooth pavement and wet conditions were used. The graphs depicting these values were first published in the AASHTO Policy for the Geometric Design of Rural Highways, 1954. In the AASHTO Policy for the Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 2001, skid resistance ceased to define braking distance (the second component of Stopping Sight Distance) and a standard deceleration of 3. 4 m/s 2, based on comfort, became the design <b>norm</b> at all <b>speeds.</b> These design values are of little use in the reconstruction of crashes. The skid resistance for specific scenarios must be determined. Values obtained from published sources can serve as guidance to orders of magnitude and as reference values. The stopping -performance of modern cars under ideal conditions {{can be in the}} order of 8 to 9 m/s 2. With GPS loggers and accelerometers now generally available, field tests can be done with similar vehicles under comparable conditions {{at a fraction of the}} cost of the formal testing equipment. The acceptance of these values has not been tested in court and the credibility of the results will have to be agreed by the experts acting for the Court or be tried by the court based on the facts presented. Values for road surfaces contaminated by gravel (sand to stone chips) could not be found in literature. Tests, using a Race Technology DL 1 data logger with accelerometer, were conducted on a good gravel road and on an abandoned section of sealed road with sand and crushed stone gravel on. All the tests were done in dry conditions. The gravel roads were included to establish a measure of comparison. The skid resistance of the gravel roads were found to be 0. 53 to 0. 63. The skid resistance of the sealed road with sand contamination were found to be between 0. 36 and 0. 44. The skid resistance of 13. 2 mm and 6. 7 mm stone used for seal resurfacing on the sealed road varied between 0. 37 and 0. 47. The skid resistance of dry gravel roads and surface roads contaminated with sand and gravel are still greater than the comfort-based design value of 0. 35. This does not imply that such areas are safe for all vehicles (motorcycle and bicycles being especially vulnerable). The skid resistances of surfaced contaminated roads do not meet the brake performance of 4. 4 m/s 2 (skid resistance of 0. 44) required in the National Road Traffic Act, Act 93 of 1996.

40|$|Stroke is a {{major cause}} of {{disability}} and death worldwide. Although different clinical studies and trials used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to examine patterns of change in different imaging modalities (eg: perfusion and diffusion), we still lack a clear and definite answer to the question: “How does an acute ischemic stroke lesion grow?” The inability to distinguish viable and dead tissue in abnormal MR regions in stroke patients weakens the evidence accumulated to answer this question, and relying on static snapshots of patient scans to fill in the spatio-temporal gaps by “thinking/guessing” make it even harder to tackle. Different opposing observations undermine our understanding of ischemic stroke evolution, especially at the acute stage: viable tissue transiting into dead tissue may be clear and intuitive, however, “visibly” dead tissue restoring to full recovery is still unclear. In this thesis, we search for potential answers to these raised questions from a novel dynamic modelling perspective that would fill in some of the missing gaps in the mechanisms of stroke evolution. We divided our thesis into five parts. In the first part, we give a clinical and imaging background on stroke and state the objectives of this thesis. In the second part, we summarize and review the literature in stroke and medical imaging. We specifically spot gaps in the literature mainly related to medical image analysis methods applied to acute-subacute ischemic stroke. We emphasize studies that progressed the field and point out what major problems remain. Noticeably, we have discovered that macroscopic (imaging-based) dynamic models that simulate how stroke lesion evolves in space and time were completely overlooked: an untapped potential that may alter and hone our understanding of stroke evolution. Progress in the dynamic simulation of stroke was absent –if not inexistent. In the third part, we answer this new call and apply a novel current-based dynamic model âpreviously applied to compare the evolution of facial characteristics between Chimpanzees and Bonobos [Durrleman 2010] – to ischemic stroke. This sets a robust numerical framework and provides us with mathematical tools to fill in the missing gaps between MR acquisition time points and estimate a four-dimensional evolution scenario of perfusion and diffusion lesion surfaces. We then detect two characteristics of patterns of abnormal tissue boundary change: spatial, describing the direction of change –outward as tissue boundary expands or inward as it contracts–; and kinetic, describing the intensity (<b>norm)</b> of the <b>speed</b> of contracting and expanding ischemic regions. Then, we compare intra- and inter-patients estimated patterns of change in diffusion and perfusion data. Nevertheless, topology change limits this approach: it cannot handle shapes with different parts that vary in number over time (eg: fragmented stroke lesions, especially in diffusion scans, which are common). In the fourth part, we suggest a new mathematical dynamic model to increase rigor in the imaging-based dynamic modeling field as a whole by overcoming the topology-change hurdle. Metamorphosis. It morphs one source image into a target one [Trouvé 2005]. In this manuscript, we extend it into dealing with more than two time-indexed images. We propose a novel extension of image-to-image metamorphosis into longitudinal metamorphosis for estimating an evolution scenario of both scattered and solitary ischemic lesions visible on serial MR. It is worth noting that the spatio-temporal metamorphosis we developed is a generic model {{that can be used to}} examine intensity and shape changes in time-series imaging and study different brain diseases or disorders. In the fifth part, we discuss our main findings and investigate future directions to explore to sharpen our understanding of ischemia evolution patterns...|$|R
