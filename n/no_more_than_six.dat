5|$|This {{event was}} {{played in a}} shorthanded format, <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> players per table, with <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> players occupying a table {{at any time during}} the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{language of the}} region is Mayali, a dialect of Bininj Gun-Wok traditionally associated with the region surrounding Maningrida, in Western Arnhem Land. As it is a strong language with hundreds of speakers and {{a high rate of}} child acquisition, members of the Wagiman ethnic group gradually ceased teaching the Wagiman language to their children. As a result, many Wagiman people speak Mayali, while only a handful of elders, possibly <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six,</b> speak Wagiman.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} after the Test series came against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England eleven; for this tour, Bradman insisted that <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> current Test players {{be allowed to}} represent for the hosts. The Australian skipper then fielded a full-strength team. Miller returned for this match, held at Scarborough, but did little, scoring one in his only innings and bowling eight overs without success in a match that ended in a rain-affected draw.|$|E
2500|$|.....consumers {{should not}} eat farmed fish from Scotland, Norway and eastern Canada <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{three times a}} year; farmed fish from Maine, western Canada and Washington state <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three to <b>six</b> times a year; and farmed fish from Chile <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> about <b>six</b> times a year. Wild chum salmon can be {{consumed}} safely as often as once a week, pink salmon, Sockeye and Coho about twice a month and Chinook just under once a month." ...|$|R
60|$|He told Philip that {{he should}} demand higher wages, for {{notwithstanding}} the difficult work he was now engaged in, he received <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the <b>six</b> shillings a week with which he started. But it was a ticklish matter {{to ask for a}} rise. The manager had a sardonic way of dealing with such applicants.|$|R
5000|$|Doctrine and Covenants 77:6 {{mentions}} [...] "the {{seven thousand}} years of earth's continuance, or its temporal existence", which has been interpreted by Joseph Fielding Smith, Bruce R. McConkie, and other Mormon leaders as a convincing statement that the earth is <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> about <b>six</b> thousand years old (the seventh thousand-year period being the future millennium).|$|R
25|$|For {{field goal}} and extra point {{attempts}} the defensive team can have <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> players {{on either side}} of the ball at the snap (5 yard penalty), and players cannot push teammates into blockers (15 yard penalty).|$|E
25|$|Jewett {{departed}} from the Falkland Islands in April 1821. In total he had spent <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months on the island, entirely at Port Luis. In 1822, Jewett was accused of piracy by a Portuguese court, {{but by that time}} he was in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 {{amendment}} of the Representation of the People Act 1983 {{required that}} the election must {{take place on the}} eleventh working day after the deadline for nomination papers, which in turn must be <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> working days after the next parliament was summoned.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with Washington’s orders, the spy magnified the Continental Army’s numbers, telling {{them the best}} accounts reported 16,000 troops. This surprised the British, who had expected <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> five or <b>six</b> thousand.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{the three}} {{clusters}} are close enough together that many {{consider it as}} one huge University Belt. All are found within <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> four miles (<b>six</b> kilometers), in an irregular crescent string shape, across seven of the sixteen districts of Manila.|$|R
5000|$|The Goshute {{lived in}} the most desolate {{part of what is}} now the western portion of Utah and eastern portion of Nevada. In {{aboriginal}} times they lived at a minimum subsistence level with no economic surplus on which a more elaborate social structure could be built. Organized primarily in nuclear families, the Goshutes hunted and gathered in family groups and would often cooperate with other family groups that usually made up a village. [...] Most Goshutes gathered with other families only {{two or three times a}} year, typically for pine nut harvests, communal hunts for <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two to <b>six</b> weeks, and winter lodging which was for a longer period. These gatherings often lasted <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two to <b>six</b> weeks, although winter gatherings were longer, with families organizing under a dagwani, or village headman.|$|R
25|$|Like many metalliferous miners {{in other}} parts of the British Isles in the early 1800s, Leadhills miners did not work for daily wages; in fact, Leadhills miners lived rent-free, working <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> hours in any one day and, significantly, had no fixed working hours.|$|E
25|$|In France, the January {{sales are}} {{restricted}} by legislation {{to no more}} than four weeks in Paris, and <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> weeks {{for the rest of the}} country, usually beginning on the first Wednesday in January, and are one of only two periods of the year when retailers are permitted to hold sales.|$|E
25|$|In {{most western}} countries, elderly care {{facilities}} are residential family care homes, freestanding assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). A family care {{home is a}} residential home with support and supervisory personnel by an agency, organization, or individual that provides room and board, personal care and habilitation services in a family environment {{for at least two}} and <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> persons.|$|E
50|$|Intermaritally, <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> five or <b>six</b> {{cases of}} husbands having been sold by their wives are known in English and English diasporan history, in {{comparison}} to approximately 400 reportable cases of wives having been sold by their husbands in the English custom. The known sales of husbands by wives occurred in the 19th century.|$|R
25|$|PRT {{vehicles}} are sized for individual or small group travel, typically carrying <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three to <b>six</b> passengers per vehicle. Guideways {{are arranged in}} a network topology, with all stations located on sidings, and with frequent merge/diverge points. This allows for nonstop, point-to-point travel, bypassing all intermediate stations. The point-to-point service {{has been compared to}} a taxi or a horizontal lift (elevator).|$|R
5000|$|In 1861 {{the editor}} of the Mendocino Herald visited Round Valley and {{declared}} that there were <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> five or <b>six</b> hundred Yuki Indians left, out of an original population that had been <b>more</b> <b>than</b> ten times larger only five years earlier. A company-sized deployment of federal soldiers finally stopped the violence against the Indians in 1962. [...] The law allowing the kidnapping and enslavement of Indians was revoked in 1863.|$|R
25|$|That, however, {{was almost}} as far as Bridge's {{first-class}} cricket career went. He was ill in 1962 and could play in <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> matches, and though there were occasional appearances in games {{over the next three}} seasons and a final one in 1968, he bowled fewer than 400 overs {{after the end of the}} 1961 season and took only 33 further wickets.|$|E
25|$|In {{competitive}} 11-a-side matches, {{teams are}} allowed to bring on up to three substitutes. The rules of the competition must state {{the maximum number of}} players allowed to be named as a substitute, which may be anywhere between three and twelve. In non-competitive matches, the use of substitutes must be determined before the match begins, except in friendly international matches, where <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> substitutes may be brought on.|$|E
25|$|In a {{more recent}} paper, the {{appendix}} {{was found to have}} evolved at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> times. This suggests that the cecal appendix has a selective advantage in many situations and argues strongly against its vestigial nature. This complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity in its evolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, Germany was only allowed a minimal navy of 15,000 personnel, six capital ships of <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10,000 tons, <b>six</b> cruisers, twelve destroyers, twelve torpedo boats and no {{submarines}} or aircraft carriers. Military aircraft were also banned, so Germany could have no naval aviation. Under the treaty Germany could only build new ships to replace old ones. All the ships allowed and personnel were taken over from the Kaiserliche Marine, renamed Reichsmarine.|$|R
50|$|In 1933 the nightlife route also {{included}} a lesbian club, which was located in an apartment in Tērbatas iela. Householders and foreigners attended the club because the entertainment in {{it was the most}} expensive in Riga. <b>No</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> five or <b>six</b> men could attend a single show. While sipping expensive alcohol, they watched love scenes between women. If somebody was turned on, they could wait in vain for responses from lesbians. Women also attended the club, but they watched it from different rooms.|$|R
5000|$|Nethercutt's {{campaign}} against Foley, a 30-year incumbent, included significant attention to Foley's opposition to term limits. In 1992, Washington state voters had approved a ballot measure limiting {{the terms of}} Washington officials, including federal officials such as U.S. Representatives. Foley brought suit contesting the constitutionality of this limit and won in court. Nethercutt repeatedly cited the caption of Foley's lawsuit - [...] "Foley against the People of the State of Washington." [...] He also promised to serve <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three terms (<b>six</b> years) in the House.|$|R
25|$|A {{player can}} have <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> piece designs {{at any one}} time, so new designs can only be created by {{removing}} old designs. Only pieces that are in your current set of designs can be bought, so that it takes at least two turns to get any fairy chess piece on the board. Removing an old design does not affect pieces of that design already on the board or in the reserves of that design.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 50 {{individuals}} are {{admitted to the}} order each year; the total is limited to 0.1% {{of the total number}} of employees of police services in Canada in the preceding year. <b>No</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> percent of those appointed to the order in total may be inducted as Commanders and no more than 30% may be made Officers. Inductions are also not made posthumously, though members of foreign armed forces can be admitted as honorary members in any grade.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th and early 21st century Metra {{experienced}} record ridership and expanded its services. In 1996 Metra organized its first new line, the North Central Service, running from Union Station to Antioch. By 2006 it added new intermediate stops {{to that same}} route, extended the Union Pacific / West Line from Geneva to Elburn and extended SouthWest Service from Orland Park to Manhattan. In 2012 it boasted 95.8% average on-time performance (measured only for a train's arrivals at its last station <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> minutes late). It also posted its fourth highest volume in its history despite decreases in employment opportunities in downtown Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> like <b>six</b> years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|R
5|$|Josquin's motet style {{varied from}} almost {{strictly}} homophonic settings with block chords and syllabic text declamation to highly ornate contrapuntal fantasias, to the psalm settings which combined these extremes {{with the addition}} of rhetorical figures and text-painting that foreshadowed the later development of the madrigal. He wrote many of his motets for four voices, an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, and he was also a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices. <b>No</b> motets of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> voices have been reliably attributed to Josquin.|$|R
50|$|In the end, Oakland's {{offense and}} {{pitching}} both fared terribly. For {{the second consecutive}} year, no Athletics pitcher won ten or more games; even worse, <b>no</b> starter won <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six.</b> None of the team's top four starters (Ariel Prieto, Steve Karsay, Mike Oquist, and Dave Telgheder) finished the season with an ERA of less than 5.00; the Athletics, as a team, finished with an earned run average of 5.48 (easily the MLB's worst). All told, the A's allowed a season total of 946 runs. This remains the worst such figure in Oakland history.|$|R
25|$|A talented footballer in his youth, Davies {{played as}} a right winger for the Northern Nomads F.C. and Port Vale. He was capped three times for the England {{national}} amateur football team in 1914, with tours of Austria, Hungary and Romania. Also in 1914 he was offered a professional contract with Stoke City but as war had broken out he instead decided to join the Royal Flying Corps. Just a fortnight after receiving his wings, Davies was shot down over the French town of Douai, captured, {{and placed in a}} German Prisoner of War camp. When he eventually returned to England he weighed only six stones and army doctors had given him <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months to live.|$|E
25|$|The Hofmeister of Austria, Wilhelm von Roggendorf, assumed {{charge of}} the {{defensive}} garrison, with operational command entrusted to a seventy-year-old German mercenary named Nicholas, Count of Salm, who had distinguished himself at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Salm arrived in Vienna {{as head of the}} mercenary relief force and set about fortifying the three-hundred-year-old walls surrounding St. Stephen's Cathedral, near which he established his headquarters. To ensure the city could withstand a lengthy siege, he blocked the four city gates and reinforced the walls, which in some places were <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> feet thick, and erected earthen bastions and an inner earthen rampart, levelling buildings where necessary to clear room for defences.|$|E
25|$|Neuschwanstein {{was still}} {{incomplete}} when Ludwig II died in 1886. The king {{never intended to}} make the palace accessible to the public. <b>No</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> weeks after the king's death, however, the regent Luitpold ordered the palace opened to paying visitors. The administrators of Ludwig's estate managed to balance the construction debts by 1899. From then until World War I, Neuschwanstein was a stable and lucrative source of revenue for the House of Wittelsbach, indeed Ludwig's castles were probably the single largest income source earned by the Bavarian royal family {{in the last years}} prior to 1914. To guarantee a smooth course of visits, some rooms and the court buildings were finished first. Initially the visitors were allowed to move freely in the palace, causing the furniture to wear quickly.|$|E
50|$|Josquin's motet style {{varied from}} almost {{strictly}} homophonic settings with block chords and syllabic text declamation to highly ornate contrapuntal fantasias, to the psalm settings which combined these extremes {{with the addition}} of rhetorical figures and text-painting that foreshadowed the later development of the madrigal. He wrote many of his motets for four voices, an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, and he also was a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices. <b>No</b> motets of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> voices have been reliably attributed to Josquin.|$|R
5000|$|Although dance-oriented, {{electronic}} pop and ballad-oriented rock {{dominated the}} 1980s, soft rock songs still enjoyed a mild success thanks to Sheena Easton, Amy Grant, Lionel Richie, Christopher Cross, Dan Hill, Leo Sayer, Billy Ocean, Julio Iglesias, Bertie Higgins and Tommy Page. <b>No</b> song spent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> weeks at #1 on this chart during the 1980s, with nine songs accomplishing that feat. Two {{of these were}} by Lionel Richie, [...] "You Are" [...] in 1983 and [...] "Hello" [...] in 1984, which also reached #1 on the Hot 100.|$|R
25|$|The older part of {{downtown}} has a well defined grid of broad, tree-lined avenues, {{with the center}} point of the grid at Tabernacle and Main Street {{in the heart of}} the historic district. All streets parallel to Tabernacle run east-west and streets parallel to Main run north-south. The campus of Dixie State University lies several blocks east of the historic district along University Avenue. Despite decades of rapid growth and new development in the city, the tallest buildings are still low-rise at <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> five to <b>six</b> stories tall.|$|R
