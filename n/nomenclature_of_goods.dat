40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} architecture {{and use of}} a tool introduced to track {{the history of the}} <b>nomenclature</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in trade in a certain time window. The name of system, HERMES, is adopted from the name of the Greek god of the trade. The tool is accessible through THESEUS, a web-based antifraud resource developed by the JRC to disseminate patterns and fair prices detected or estimated using international trade data. THESEUS is accessible only by authorized users in the Commission and Member States (customs and low enforcement services). On the other hand the user community of HERMES is potentially wider, pointing to international traders and other economic operators. For this reason, HERMES may be moved to the public area of THESEUS. JRC. I. 3 -Text and Data Minin...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} European Commission Support Programme Task to the IAEA, {{a survey}} of world trade data from open source has been conducted. A {{catalogue}} was produced to cover services offering data on trade on all categories of goods, both of statistical and transactional nature. Services on statistical data have a worldwide coverage and are provided, often for free, by international and governmental organizations, and statistical offices. Services on trade transactions may have a national or multi-national scope and are typically provided by private companies. The survey was motivated by the hypothesis that trade databases {{may be useful to}} support IAEA verification activities. Trade data may provide insights to support the verification of additional protocol declarations and nuclear material transfers as well as give indications of possible undeclared activities. Since trade data is indexed in data services by the Harmonized System (HS) <b>nomenclature</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> a prerequisite to use this type of data is to ¿map¿ items of interest to safeguards verification with HS categories. The paper reviews services available on world trade data with an emphasis on geographical and temporal coverage, type of data provided and accessibility. It then addresses the challenging task of correlating categories of items of interest and HS codes. The paper concludes on some possible uses of trade data for nuclear verification purposes. JRC. DG.
