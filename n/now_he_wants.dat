500|$|The third essay, called [...] "The Unhappiest One", {{discusses}} the hypothetical question: [...] "who deserves {{the distinction of}} being unhappier than everyone else?" [...] Kierkegaard has progressed from a search for the highest to the search for the lowest. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to find the unhappy person by looking once again to the past. Is it Niobe, or Job, or the father of the prodigal son, or is it Periander, Abraham, or Christ? This is, of course, about the new science of , which digs up everyone and tells the world if the people were happy or sad.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to blind}} himself with her, to blaze up all {{his past and}} future in a passion worth years of living.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} queer and distant and calm. He {{looked at the}} child. She was beside herself <b>now.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> her to stop, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it all to stop, to become natural.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> but immortality, <b>he</b> thought, to be {{the equal}} of gods, and the {{creature}} that could open so the gates of paradise must be his--soon would be his for ever! ...|$|R
500|$|Connor's {{appearance}} {{as a regular}} in After the Fall, was initially met with dismay by some fans. IDW representative Chris Ryall responded to these complaints with optimism, assuring the fans that the character would win them over, {{just the way he}} has been, by the time the series end. True to his words, After The Fall’s Connor was received positively. Brian Lynch confirmed this in an interview, stating that Connor has not only been the most pleasantly surprising character for him to write, he has been the most surprising for the fans as well, [...] "Connor was a great character on the TV show but, I don’t think he was ever a favorite. But he’s slowly but surely {{become one of the most}} popular characters in After The Fall, which is wonderful." [...] He further said that he himself like the character so much <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to do a book called 'Son of Angel' based on him.|$|E
60|$|George {{is quite}} well <b>now.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> you to smoke a {{cigarette}} with him.|$|E

6000|$|Zo {{had been}} listening; Zo saw {{her way to}} getting noticed again. Not quite sure of herself this time, she appealed to Carmina. [...] "Didn't <b>he</b> say, just <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to know?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wait a minute, and I'll {{come back}} presently, {{and have a}} round with you all in turn, if you like," [...] said Fred, who felt {{confidence}} in his power of boxing with his dearly beloved brethren. But just <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to hasten back to Caleb and the prostrate youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Bud," [...] said Dale, as {{the girls}} came up. [...] "Guess he near starved in my absence. An' <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> everythin', {{especially}} the sugar. We don't have sugar often up here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He confesses, he confesses! He deluded the piety of {{the patriarch}} into letting him go, under colour of {{converting}} her; and even <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to intrude on the sacred presence of Cyril, burning {{only with the}} carnal desire that he may meet the sorceress in her house to-morrow!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He made me go {{and live}} with him, and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to throw me over. And yet he won't {{let me go to}} anybody else. He wants me to live hidden in the country. And then he says I persecute him, that he can't get rid of me.' ...|$|E
60|$|So that <b>now,</b> though <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> dreadfully {{to forbid}} {{something}} else, {{he could not}} think of anything.|$|R
50|$|At that point, Somoza {{realized}} that he had to act quickly. He called in his IOU from the CIA. He had permitted the CIA to use Las Mercedes Airport, outside Managua, as a base for its P-47s during the Guatemalan intervention. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the planes that were parked there to help him in his feud with Figueres.|$|R
60|$|Above all <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be {{cool and}} calculating, to curb the {{excitement}} which the Latin blood in him called forth at every mention of the loved one's name. He {{tried to think of}} Percy, of his calmness, his easy banter with an enemy; he resolved to act as Percy would act under these circumstances.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing,' said Berenger, tardily and wearily; and {{for some}} minutes he {{did not attempt to}} speak, while Philip devoured his curiosity as best he might. At last he said, 'He was always beyond me. What think you? <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> me to turn French courtier and marry his daughter.' ...|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. And <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> me to cut {{you dead}} {{to keep him in}} countenance. Well, I shant: not if my whole family were there.

6000|$|... "Why not? She {{is almost}} a woman, and she is older than her years. Look at them <b>now.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> to talk seriously, and she is teasing him all the time. She has the {{instinct}} of her sex. She will conceal what she feels until the--psychological moment. But she does feel--she begins to understand. I am sure of it. Watch them!" ...|$|E
50|$|According to Spiegel Online, January 10, 2008 {{the verdict}} was: Pumuckl may marry - at least <b>he</b> could <b>now</b> if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to.|$|R
60|$|All the same, he {{felt the}} shack was dreary and his life was bleak. He had not felt this until he went to Winnipeg. On the whole, he had liked the {{struggle}} against physical obstacles. It was his proper job, but the struggle was stern and sometimes exhausting, and his reward was small. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> something different, and gave himself to vague and brooding discontent.|$|R
60|$|It was level country, {{and there}} was nothing for Shefford to see except cedar and sage, an {{outcropping}} of red rock in places, and the winding trail. Mocking-birds made melody everywhere. Shefford seemed full of a strange pleasure, and the hours flew by. Nack-yal still wanted to be everlastingly turning off the trail, and, moreover, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to go faster. He was eager, restless, dissatisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's just it, M'sieu le Comte!" [...] replied Jean Marie, obstinately {{ignoring}} Gaston {{and still}} addressing de Mortémar, [...] "he slept all the afternoon. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> some supper. He throws louis about {{as if they}} were dirt, and I can't serve him in there!" [...] he added with unanswerable logic and pointing to the stuffy room in the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he raged. [...] "He expects! Expects me--for his rotten money!... Who {{wants his}} home? Mad--not he! Don't you think. He wants his own way. He {{wanted to turn}} me into a miserable lawyer's clerk, and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to make of me a blamed tame rabbit in a cage. Of me! Of me!" [...] His subdued angry laugh frightened her now.|$|E
60|$|I couldn't. Heaven knows, I'm {{grateful}} to you for offering to marry me on this day of my bitter humiliation. I shall never forget your great kindness. But I must stand alone. I must devote myself to my father. When he's released I must have a home to bring him to, and I must tend him and care for him. Ah, <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> me more than ever.|$|E
60|$|Kennicott was as {{fixed in}} routine as an {{isolated}} old man. At {{first he had}} amorously deceived himself into liking her experiments with food--the one medium in which she could express imagination--but <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> only his round of favorite dishes: steak, roast beef, boiled pig's-feet, oatmeal, baked apples. Because at some more flexible period he had advanced from oranges to grape-fruit he considered himself an epicure.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{darkness}} {{over his}} mind. The terrible knot of consciousness that had persisted there like an obsession was broken, gone, {{his life was}} dissolved in darkness over his limbs and his body. But {{there was a point}} of anxiety in his heart <b>now.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> her to come back. He breathed lightly and regularly like an infant, that breathes innocently, beyond the touch of responsibility.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, papa, let Tom take me. Poor fellow! it pleases him; and {{you know}} it's all <b>he</b> can do <b>now,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to do something!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{answer to}} that {{question}} is painfully doubtful. On leaving Rugby he declined to go to an English university, where I would gladly have placed him, and chose what I must consider the anomalous course of studying at Heidelberg. And <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to go abroad again, without any special object, save the vague purpose of what he calls culture, preparation for he knows not what. He declines to choose a profession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I dunno 'bout that," [...] he replied, looking hard at Ingua, [...] "Ol' Swallertail gimme this bill, not {{ten minutes}} ago, an' said as his gran'darter was to buy {{whatever}} she liked, as fur as {{the money would}} go. That order was so queer that it made me suspicious. See here: {{a few days ago}} ol' Cragg bought Ingua a dress--an' paid for it, by gum!--an' <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> her t' git ten dollars' wuth o' shoes an' things! Don't that look mighty strange?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, father!" [...] she answered, [...] "can't you see, don't you understand? Then {{it is hard}} to have to tell you, but I must. In the {{beginning}} Mr. Meyer only wanted the gold. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> more, me as well as the gold. I hate him! You know that is why I ran away. But I have read a good deal about this mesmerism, and seen it once or twice, and who knows? If once I allow his mind to master my mind, although I hate him so much, I might become his slave." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tchaikovsky {{had used}} folk songs {{in his early}} days in St. Petersburg and in his student {{overture}} The Storm. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to use folk songs as valid symphonic material. Tchaikovsky's greatest debt in this regard was to Glinka's Kamarinskaya. He believed fervently that in Kamarinskaya lay {{the core of the}} entire school of Russian symphonic music, [...] "just as the whole oak is in the acorn", as he wrote in his diary in 1888.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll {{not live}} on me again," [...] {{declared}} Andy. [...] "I know him thoroughly, <b>now.</b> If <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> {{to stay here}} he'll have to work, the same as I do." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} widening, darkening with thought, and {{whenever}} {{they did so}} the steady, watchful, seeing gaze gave place to the wistful light. In the former she saw as the primitive woman without thought; in the latter she looked inward, and her gaze was the reflection of a troubled mind. For long Venters had not seen that dark change, that deepening of blue, which he thought was beautiful and sad. But <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to make her think.|$|R
