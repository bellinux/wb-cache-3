25|$|NPR {{suffered}} an almost fatal setback in 1983 when efforts to expand services created {{a deficit of}} nearly US$7 million. After a Congressional investigation and the resignation of NPR's then president, Frank Mankiewicz, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting agreed to lend the <b>network</b> <b>money</b> in order to stave off bankruptcy. In exchange, NPR agreed to a new arrangement whereby the annual CPB stipend that it had previously received directly would be divided among local stations instead; in turn, those stations would support NPR productions on a subscription basis. NPR also agreed to turn its satellite service into a cooperative venture (the Public Radio Satellite System), {{making it possible for}} non-NPR shows to get national distribution. It took NPR approximately three years to pay off the debt.|$|E

The result is mixed. Menger {{is one of the first}} to discuss the marketability and liquidity of an asset, which in German he denotes Absatzfahigkeit. This concept has a strong connection with the network aspect of a commodity.

40|$|The term digital money {{refers to}} various {{proposed}} electronic payment mechanisms {{designed to be}} used by consumers to make retail payments. These mechanisms are based either on smart cards or on <b>network</b> <b>money.</b> Smart cards could potentially replace currency as the predominant means to pay for retail purchases. Software-based digital money products (<b>network</b> <b>money)</b> bring cheap electronic funds transfers to individuals and small firms. This paper examines how digital money affects the demand for money and how this process, in turn, affects the demand for reserves, monetary control, and the monetary transmission mechanism.

30|$|In a {{world of}} sharing and <b>networks,</b> <b>money</b> and other {{resources}} might be partly redefined as possessions of the network instead of private property. Furthermore, value would not be understood only as monetary, but as e.g. ethical, aesthetic, and social value as well. The successful ones would want also others to succeed because networks and communities had enabled their success in the first place. Once one has earned enough money, {{he or she may}} donate at least some of it away to help others. Networks and communities could also provide a safety net in times of hardship, resembling social arrangements in developing countries, where a person who earns money often finances his or her community. There would be solidarity in networks that seems foreign to traditional notions of competition. Networks would function more on principles of open source than property rights. Growth would be seen as sharing and spreading of capital instead of its private accumulation. In an ideal situation resources would be allocated so that more creative human potential could be harnessed, instead of keeping them {{in the hands of a}} few.|$|R
