50|$|Interest in {{recreational}} fishing for <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> {{and in the}} Gulf of Mexico in general, has increased dramatically. From 1995-2003, the number of Louisiana fishing charter guide license holders increased eight-fold.|$|E
50|$|Juvenile <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snappers</b> {{have been}} {{released}} on artificial reef habitats {{off the coast of}} Sarasota, Florida, to conduct investigations into the use of hatchery-reared juveniles to supplement native populations in the Gulf of Mexico. Artificial reefs off the coast of Alabama have proven to be a favorite habitat of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> two years old and older. Gallaway et al. (2009) analyzed several studies and concluded, in 1992, 70 - 80% of the age two <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> in that area were living around offshore oil platforms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snappers</b> move to {{different}} types of habitats during their growth process. When they are newly spawned, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> settle over large areas of open benthic habitat(s). Below age 1, the <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> move to low-relief habitats for food and cover. If available, oyster shell beds are preferred. The second stage is when these fish outgrow low-relief habitats and move to intermediate-relief habitats as age 1 snapper leave {{to move on to}} another growth stage. Next, at about age 2, snapper seek high-relief reefs having low densities of larger snapper. Next, at platforms, smaller snapper occupy the upper water column. Then, the larger, older snapper occupy the deeper areas of the platforms and large benthic reefs and they prevent smaller snapper and other fish from using these habitats. In spite of local habitat preferences, Szedlmayer reported that of 146 L. campechanus tagged, released and recaptured within about a year, 57% were still approximately at their respective release site, and 76% were recaptured within 2 km of their release site. The greatest movement by a single fish was 32 km.|$|R

50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus campechanus) is {{a species}} of snapper native to the western Atlantic Ocean {{including}} the Gulf of Mexico, where it inhabits environments associated with reefs. This species is commercially important and is also sought-after as a game fish.|$|E
50|$|When <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> bite on a line, {{they tend}} to be nibblers and pickers, and a soft touch is needed when trying to catch them. Because the older red snapper like structure, anglers use bottom fishing over reefs, wrecks, and oil rigs, and use line and {{supplies}} in the 50-lb class. Since the anglers have to both choose the right bait and present it correctly, {{they tend to}} use multiple hooked baits. Favorite baits include squid, whole medium-sized fish, and small strips of fish such as amberjack. Although many <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> are caught on the bottom, in some situations the larger fish are caught on heavy jigs (artificial lures), often tipped with a strip of bait or by freelining baits at the proper upper level.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} red snapper's body is {{very similar}} in shape to other snappers, such as the mangrove snapper, mutton snapper, lane snapper, and dog snapper. All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. <b>Northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers.This snapper reaches maturity at a length of about 39 cm.

50|$|This species {{commonly}} inhabits waters from 30 - 200 ft, but can {{be caught}} as deep as 300 ft on occasion. They stay relatively close to the bottom, and inhabit rocky bottoms, ledges, ridges, and artificial reefs, including offshore oil rigs and shipwrecks. Like most other snappers, <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> are gregarious and form large schools around wrecks and reefs. These schools are usually made up of fish of very similar size.|$|E
50|$|Recreational {{fishing for}} <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> has been popular {{for a long}} time, {{restricted}} mostly by fishing limits intended to ensure a sustainable population. The first minimum size limit was introduced in 1984, after a 1981 report described quickly declining harvests (both commercial and recreational) From 1985 to 1990, the annual recreational catch of red snapper was about 1.5 million. From 1991 to 2005, the catch was substantially higher, varying {{from year to year}} from 2.5 to 4.0 million.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1990, {{the total}} catch limit for <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> has been divided into 49% for {{recreational}} fishermen and 51% for commercial.

Fishing for red snapper {{has been a}} major industry in the Gulf of Mexico, but permit restrictions and changes in the quota system for commercial snapper fishermen in the Gulf have made the fish less commercially available. [...] Researchers estimate the bycatch of young red snapper, especially by shrimp trawlers, is a significant concern.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} study, {{it still}} {{is not clear whether}} artificial reefs produce new fish biomass or whether they only attract various species and make them more vulnerable to fishing mortality. To further evaluate this question, the size and age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus campechanus) were sampled from April to November 2010 at artificial reefs south of Mobile Bay off the coast of Alabama and compared with the age of the artificial reef at the site of capture. Red snapper were collected with hook and line and a fish trap and visually counted during scuba-diver surveys. In the laboratory, all captured <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> were weighed and measured, and the otoliths were removed for aging. The mean age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> differed significantly across reefs of different ages, with older reefs having older fish. The mean age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> at a particular reef was not related to reef depth or distance to other reefs. The positive correlation between the mean age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> and the age of the reef where they were found supports the contention that artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico enhance production of <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> The presence of fish older than the reef indicates that <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> are also attracted to artificial reefs...|$|R

50|$|Some {{invasive}} species bring sanitary problems to human health. Species that are pathogens or parasites that cause direct harm, or {{that act as}} carriers for such species, can have serious consequences. Pathogen carriers are species like the snail Melanoides tuberculata, which has displaced native species in Nuevo León (Contreras-Arquieta y Contreras-Balderas, 1999). Due to its high reproductive potential (as a parthenogenic species), it modifies {{the conditions of the}} habitat, and it carries trematoda such as Clonorchis sinensis, a parasite that can damage the human liver. Pathogens that cause direct harm include the harmful algal bloom (HAB) and the red tides that have intensified in frequency and duration in aquatic environments across the world. The proliferation of HABs creates dead zones that use up all available oxygen. Certain species even produce toxins that damage the digestive and nervous systems of humans and many animals. For example, lionfish (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) are predators that affect species of fish and invertebrates in reefs and mangrove swamps of the Gulf of Mexico, such as the grouper and the <b>northern</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> that are of great economic importance. These species of lionfish are also venomous, making them dangerous to many species including humans.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} nature of direct and {{indirect}} species interactions is a critical pre-cursor to successful resource management. In the northern Gulf of Mexico fisheries ecosys-tem, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus campechanus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) are two commercially harvested species within a larger reef fish complex. These two species share similar habitats and diets; however, {{little is known about}} how these species partition habitat and dietary resources. In this study we examined the extent of spatial and dietary overlap between <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> and vermilion snapper, and experimen-tally compared their feeding behavior. Field data from multiple gear types demonstrates that <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> and vermilion snapper frequently cohabited reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and Pianka’s niche overlap indices suggest significantly overlapping diets. Experi-mental manipulations show that <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> are the dominant forager of the two species, as <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> foraging alone ate more shrimp per fish than vermilion snapper in both the single species (p = 0. 003) and mixed species (p = 0. 02) treatments.

Specifically, we examined the effects of fish size, commercial shrimp trawling, and habitat type on total Hg concentrations and stable nitrogen isotope ratios (d 15 N; a proxy for trophic position) in <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> Red snapper Hg concentrations and d 15 N values were positively and significantly correlated with fish size.

Our study suggests that the Hg concentrations of juvenile <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> in the <b>northern</b> GOM are elevated in areas where commercial shrimp trawling occurs, possibly due to increases in both <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> trophic position and bioavailable Hg in trawled areas.

40|$|I am steadfast {{against any}} change {{at this time}} for {{recreational}} fisherman. First and foremost {{we need to know}} how many anglers targeting <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> there really are. In my opinion there is dire need for a <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> tag or stamp to be issued with a state fishing license or available at sporting goods, bait camps, marinas, or some readily available source and most anglers {{would be willing to pay}} a reasonable fee for it. Then and only then can we get a real number of anglers targeting <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> With that you would have the information to gather your catch information as you could get addresses, phone numbers, email or other contact for the real snapper anglers. From this you could do creel surveys at the marinas, bait camps, boat ramps, or do phone email surveys. This is how we get real numbers and not some imaginary ghost numbers that are far from the facts. This would be real factual information to have a much better assessment of the fishery. This could also be the building blocks for other species as well. I myself know many people that buy a Texas fishing license and a state saltwater stamp that have never been <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> fishing and never will fish for <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> We can’t just throw some unknown number out there and assume that a large percentage of the license bearers are snapper fishing or get anywhere of the real number of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> angler.

40|$|As {{a highly}} {{targeted}} species, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> have been overfished since the 1970 ?s. Inadequate {{monitoring and reporting}} of discard rates impedes regulatory measures which are in place to allow <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> populations to reach a healthy, sustainable level. This study documented the relationship between morphometric measurements and otolith analysis of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> caught from a recreational headboat fishing exclusively in the GOM?s EEZ of the upper Texas coast. The collected data of this research show that of the 594 <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> caught within the sample group, 76 % of the fish were discarded; analysis of the lengths of these discarded fish show that 15. 5 % were of regulation size (16 inches) or larger, clear evidence that high-grading is occurring. The effort for {{the total amount of}} <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> caught by each individual angler within the sample group was measured to determine on average, approximately two <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> were caught per person, per hour. The size distribution ranged from 16 to 32 inches with a mean total length of 21. 32 inches for retained fish while discarded fish ranged from 5. 5 to 22. 5 inches with a mean of 14. 23. Weight distribution ranged from 1. 5 to 18. 5 pounds with a mean of 5. 81 pounds for retained fish and 0. 20 to 6 pounds with a mean of 1. 57 pounds for discarded fish. Age distribution ranged from 3 to 14 years of age; <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> can live over 50 years, however relatively none (2. 42 %) older than 10 years were present in the sample, demonstrating a highly truncated population. Because fecundancy increases with age in females, longevity extends reproduction potential for <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> Management of reef fishes, and <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> in particular, are difficult due to variances in growth rates and habitat use, complex population structure, and increasing reproduction levels with maturity. Recommendations for management include implementing an educational outreach program, reducing effort and discard rates, lowing rates of exploitation, and creating a marine reserve. Future research should address the entire Texas coast population of for-hire vessels (charter and headboats) to obtain data on discard rates and age distribution of <b>red</b> <b>snapper...</b>|$|R
