40|$|One of {{the central}} topics of {{the debate about the}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages of EMU is whether exchange rate variability has positive or <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade.</b> Advocates of a regime of fixed rates emphasised its advantages in terms of co-ordination and credibility of economic policies, as well as its role in promoting international trade. The supporters of flexible exchange rates highlight its greater capacity to achieve domestic policy objectives. They also say there are no <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> as financial mechanisms can assure risks derived from it. Although there is an extensive literature on this topic, there is no clear conclusion about it. In fact, most empirical studies have failed to obtain a clear significant relationship between both variables (exchange rate variability and trade – growth-). The objective of this paper is not to test the existence or not of this relationship but to make a preliminary description of the potential explanatory factors of the different results by previous authors. With this aim, data for the European Union countries for the period 1973 - 1997 relating trade and exchange rates is analysed using different econometric techniques in the framework of a gravity model...|$|E

It exploits data on several measures of trade protection including import duty, international trade taxes, and the trade-GDP ratio. The paper complements the literature on the relationship between corruption and trade reform. It deviates from the previous literature in several ways. First, unobserved heterogeneity among countries have been controlled with properly specified fixed effects exploiting the time dimension present in the dataset. Secondly, instead of using tariff and non-tariff barriers, more general measures of trade protection have been used. The issue of endogeneity of corruption with respect to trade policy has been addressed using proper instruments for corruption used in previous studies. Moreover, two separate institutional measures have been used in the same regression to estimate their comparative impacts on trade policy. In general, we find that corruption and lack of contract enforcement have strong impacts to increase trade protection and <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> openness.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{is an issue}} of high importance for Sub-Saharan African countries. With the on-going process of regional integration, the promotion of regional trade between neighbouring countries is one strategy to enhance food security. The study introduces an Analytical Framework (AF) to evaluate the potentials of regional trade to enhance food security. Three working levels are defined: (1) A desk study to identify relevant countries or regions, (2) a fact-finding mission to collect in-depth data and (3) an assessment to evaluate the potentials. The AF is implemented in a case study on crossborder trade between Tanzania and Zambia. Both countries are members of the Southern African Development Community and are intensifying co-operation and trade liberalisation. Although being generally food secure, Tanzania still faces food shortages. The Government pursues an interventionist policy by purchasing food in surplus areas to sell these at subsidised prices in deficit regions. This is combined with several barriers for crossborder trade, e. g. an export ban on food staples. Zambia's food security policies are biased towards maize as major food staple. The Government intervenes on domestic markets and provides farmers with subsidised inputs. Zambia's Northern Province is generally food secure but Zambia sometimes faces food shortages. The Mbeya and Rukwa Regions in Tanzania have favourable natural conditions. The productivity of the agricultural sector is above national level and the area produces surpluses. Import quantities to Zambia are influenced by the imposed export ban. Besides formal trade, the importance of informal cross-border trade with maize has increased. Trade is ampered by a number of non-tariff barriers, ranging from cost-intensive and time-consuming customs procedures to road blocks. Most of the non-tariff barriers are relevant for formal and informal trade. The assessment of the policy measures shows conflicts of interests between national food security on one side and agricultural trade liberalisation on the other side. Market interventions have <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> in general. Additionally, the Tanzanian export ban creates disincentives for farmers and traders. The assessment shows potentials for increasing the crossborder trade between both countries. The recommendations concentrate on the potentials to expand their involvement in trade...|$|E
40|$|The US-Australia Free Trade Agreement {{is not in}} Australia’s interests, argues John Quiggin in this {{overview}} of the debate so far THE passage of legislation implementing the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) brings to an end one of the stranger episodes in Australian economic policy debate. (There remains a remote possibility that the US government will reject the implementing legislation, and particularly the Labor amendment on patent rights, as inconsistent with the agreement). Traditionally, such debates have seen economists lined up in support of free trade, while politicians {{were more likely to}} oppose it. By contrast, economists’ attitudes to the FTA have ranged from lukewarm support to vehement opposition, with the latter view predominating. Meanwhile politicians have argued for the FTA with a mixture of geopolitical arguments - suggesting that opposition is, or will be seen as anti-American - and interest-group arguments about benefits for particular businesses. This apparent paradox may be resolved with the observation that the agreement is not really about free trade at all. This is partly because bilateral agreements have <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> with countries not included in the agreement, but more significantly because the proposed agreement involves the adoption of US policies which give monopoly rights to owners of ‘intellectual property’, and thereby restrict trade. The aim {{of this paper is to}} survey some of the main issues surrounding the FTA, including impacts on trade in goods and services, the distinction between trade agreements and economic integration agreements, and the role of intellectual property and its impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Trade in goods Australia has very few barriers to trade in goods, and even fewer that are significant in relation to our trade with the United States. Our general tariff of 5 per cent is at a level which can be justified under the revenue tariff provisions of the GATT. The main areas of higher tariff protection, the motor vehicle industry textiles, clothing and footwear industry, are areas where the United States has little capacity to export to Australia. There has been some criticism of Australia’s quarantine policies, but these policies are designed to focus on science-based analysis of disease threats rather than on protection for domestic producers. Similarly, Australia has very few policies that subsidise exports or otherwise distort international market prices. Most agricultural industries receive minimal assistance. Single-desk selling policies for some agricultural commodities have been criticised as anti-competitive, but the cost of such policies, if any, is borne by Australian producers. Thus far, most producer groups have concluded that benefits such as the pooling of risk outweigh any costs from forgoing a choice of export marketers. By contrast, the United States has a wide range of barriers and distortions, particularly in the agricultural sector. The most important set of distortions are the broad-ranging production and export subsidies contained in the Farm Bill passed in 2002. This Bill provides for $US 190 billion in subsidies over 10 years to US agricultural industries including grain, cotton, wool and dairy. Subsidised exports of these commodities depress world prices and harm all Australian producers, regardless of whether they are in direct competition with subsidised exports. Although they have received more attention, restrictions on imports to the US are of less significance. The most important barriers relate to sugar, beef and dairy products, and there are a range of less significant barriers. As in Australia, the US also provides significant protection to a small group of manufacturing industries. The pattern is largely symmetrical, with motor vehicles and TCF being notable beneficiaries. This symmetry reflects the fact that, in both Australia and the United States, these industries have declined as a result of competition from Asia. The bilateral balance of trade shows a strong surplus for the US. Conversely, Australia currently collects substantially more revenue from tariffs on imports from the US than does the US from tariffs on Australian exports. This is important in assessing the distribution of costs and benefits from the FTA. The content of the proposed FTA As has been widely publicised, the proposed FTA removes most tariffs and trade barriers, but makes no change in US restrictions on imports of sugar from Australia and only modest and gradual changes with respect to imports of beef and dairy products. More importantly, no changes are proposed to the US Farm Bill. Not only is the general system of subsidies unaffected (it would perhaps have been utopian to hope for broad-based reform) but there does not even appear to be any commitment to avoid the use of export subsidies that directly harm Australian exporters in particular markets. Indeed, it appears that the issue of the Farm Bill was not raised in the negotiations. The most important distortions of agricultural trade practised by the US are unaffected by the FTA and are, in effect, endorsed by Australia’s signature to the agreement. There have recently been indications that negotiations in the World Trade Organisation may lead to more substantial progress in reducing farm subsidies. This merely accentuates the questions surrounding the wisdom of abandoning multilateral processes in favour of unbalanced bilateral deals. Services and investment: The impact of the proposed FTA on services is relatively modest. Although there are some provisions in both Australia and the US that discriminate against noncitizens, these are relatively modest. Moreover, some of the most important policies of this kind, such as restrictions on airline services, have been excluded from the scope of the agreement. The main interest therefore relates to possible future developments, going beyond the removal of overt discrimination against noncitizens. These are discussed below, particularly in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It should be noted that the services sector was responsible for a substantial proportion of the gains from an FTA estimated by the Centre for International Economics. In view of the modest scope of the actual agreement, it seems likely that these gains have been overestimated. Similar points apply in relation to investment. It appears that the threshold for Foreign Investment Review Board review will be raised, but this will have little direct impact since hardly any proposals are rejected. The main issue is the ‘standstill’ approach central to the agreement, which allows for the creation of new rights for investors in future, but makes it almost impossible to withdraw rights that have already been granted. Of more concern is the possibility that some future agreement will create a right of foreign investors to seek ‘review’ of decisions they allege to be discriminatory against them. This provision, embodied in North American Free Trade agreement and in the aborted Multilateral Agreement on Investment is said to be justified on ‘level playing field’ grounds, but actually produces discrimination in favour of foreign investors, since domestic enterprises have no comparable rights. Trade and Economic Integration: As the main proponent of the FTA, Alan Oxley of the pro-FTA lobby group, Austa, has noted, the use of the term ‘Free Trade Agreements’ is ‘ a misnomer in a world of lower tariffs’. Oxley writes, ‘The World Bank prefers to describe them as regional integration agreements. Free Market Arrangements would be an even more appropriate term’. In general, an integration agreement involves the adoption of common, or at least compatible, economic policies on a wide range of issues, including intellectual property, public ownership of infrastructure, and competition policy. Ultimately, integration is likely to extend the provision and financing of health care and education. However, ‘integration’ is a misleading term in the context of a bilateral agreement between Australia and the United States. Given the relative size of the two countries, and the fact that the United States has adopted a general strategy of seeking bilateral agreements on trade and other issues on a ‘pattern bargaining’ model, it is clear that any agreement will involve Australia adopting American institutions and not vice versa. This does not represent a difficulty for advocates of an FTA such as Austa. Austa publications indicate a strongly held belief that the economic and social institutions of the United States are superior to those of Australia, and that we will therefore benefit from an agreement which binds us to replace our existing institutions with those of the United States. The most direct effects relate to issues concerning intellectual property Intellectual property: Under the proposed FTA, Australia is required to adopt American policies on intellectual property, policies that are economically unsound even in the US context, and entirely adverse to Australian interests. Australia currently sets the term of copyright fixed at fifty years after the author’s death and publishers interested in making public-domain works accessible to the general public are increasingly taking advantage of this. By contrast, the United States has steadily extended copyright terms. The proposed FTA sets a minimum copyright term of 70 years, but sets no maximum. Many of the relevant issues arose in the case of Eldred vs Ashcroft, decided recently by the US Supreme Court. This case was a constitutional challenge to a recent Act of Congress which extended the term of copyright protection from fifty years after the death of the author to seventy years (ninety-five for corporations). The Copyright Term Extension Act is often referred to as the ‘Mickey Mouse Act’ because of the observation that the term of copyright is extended whenever the Disney copyright on Mickey is about to lapse. The constitutional challenge failed, but the case did elicit an unusual degree of interest from American economists, seventeen of whom submitted a brief to the Supreme Court opposing the Act. The list is striking not only because of the eminence of the signatories (five Nobel Prizes and more to come) but because it represents all shades of economic opinion from free-market luminaries like Buchanan, Coase and Friedman to interventionists like Akerlof and Arrow. The central theme of the economic critique is that copyrights and patents cannot be appropriately analysed in terms of the protection of ‘intellectual property’. Copyrights and patents are monopoly rights. It is necessary to strike a balance between the incentive to inventive and creative work provided by copyrights and patents and the economic costs of monopoly rights over ideas. Current US policy is excessively favorable to monopolies. This is also an area of concern in relation to future developments in the process of economic integration with the United States. The current agreement does not require Australia to match widely criticised US policies such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. However, given the strength of the entertainment industry and related lobbies in the United States, there can be little doubt that there will be continuing pressure for measures to enhance the monopoly rights of owners of intellectual property. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme: US demands for ‘reform’ of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are closely related to the issues of intellectual property. Pharmaceutical companies want the right to maximize returns on their intellectual property by dealing directly with consumers and setting monopoly prices, rather than, as at present, by negotiating with the Australian government. In the leadup to the FTA, the US Congress passed legislation requiring the Administration to report on ‘progress toward opening Australia’s drug pricing system’ (see Drug Industry Seeks to Sway Prices Overseas). The agreement included provisions allowing US drug companies an independent review of decisions by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which recommends inclusion or rejection This is a complex issue, since it is difficult to forecast the implications of changes to procedures that are already fairly opaque. The Australian government has asserted, in effect, that the concessions offered on the PBS are meaningless, and will have no effect of prices or on the cost of the scheme. By contrast, commentary in the US, from both supporters and opponents, suggests that the concessions were not substantial. Perhaps the clearest indication comes from the pharmaceutical lobby itself. Promoting the deal, Medicines Australia chief executive, Kieran Schneemann, said the deal and changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) would act as an incentive for American firms to invest in Australia, and suggested as much as $ 1 billion might be spent on research here. The idea that a purely procedural reform, with no real implications for prices and costs, would somehow generate $ 1 billion in investment, is absurd. If Schneeman’s estimate is remotely plausible, the FTA must involve a large increase in payments to US pharmaceutical companies. Looking ahead, it seems inconceivable that Medicare will be safe from attack under the provisions of an agreement. The private insurance lobby in Australia has opposed Medicare since its exception, and would be strengthened immeasurably by the much large and stronger US industry. The single-payer and bulk-billing provisions of Medicare, already under severe strain, could be rendered unworkable by legal challenges under an FTA. Modelling the FTA In the leadup to the FTA, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade commission to the Centre for International Economics to analyse the economic impacts of a likely agreement. The CIE reported benefits of around $ 4 billion, largely because of the benefits assumed to flow from improved access to the US sugar market. When the agreement was announced, with no improvement in access for sugar, the CIE prepared a new analysis (PDF file) which, surprisingly enough, showed even larger benefits. The loss of sugar access was more than offset by the inclusion of highly speculative assumptions about a reduction in the cost of capital. (The results of the modelling are in the chart in the attachment at the bottom of this page.) The big gains in the CIE’s picture come from two main sources. The first is so-called ‘dynamic gains’ from liberalisation. I’ve pointed out many times that such gains are little more than a pious belief held by advocates of free-market reform. They have no basis in neoclassical economic theory and no real supporting evidence. The report is gracious enough to cite my objections, but goes on to ignore them. The CIE’s second gain comes from the idea that capital market liberalisation will reduce the equity risk premium and therefore increase economic welfare. The difficulty is in the assumption that capital market liberalisation will reduce the equity premium and will have no offsetting adverse effects. The proposed changes are tiny by comparison with the floating of the dollar and the associated removal of exchange controls over the 1970 s and 1980 s, not to mention the associated domestic liberalisation. Yet there is no convincing evidence that these changes had any net effect on the risk premium for equity. Australian regulators who have to use a risk premium in estimating the cost of capital have looked at this issue repeatedly, and none has yet been willing to base decisions on the assumption that the risk premium for equity has declined recently, relative to the 20 th century as a whole. Then there’s the question of offsetting effects. The most important changes relax restrictions on takeovers. The analysis here is based on the assumption that such restrictions are necessarily harmful. Yet there’s ample evidence at every level to contradict. Faced with doubts of this kind, the Senate Committee of Inquiry commissioned an alternative analysis from Philippa Dee, currently at ANU and formerly with the Productivity Commission. Her analysis yielded much smaller estimates of net benefits from liberalisation of trade in goods and services. In addition, Dee included an estimate of the cost of increasing the term of copyright, which the CIE had put in the too-hard basket. But neither Dee nor the CIE assessed impacts on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Overall, Dee’s results suggested a net annual benefit of $ 50 million per year or, as Bob Brown put it, $ 2. 50 per Australian. Political aspects In political terms, the FTA debate was one of the most striking recent examples of defeat being snatched from the jaws of victory. Labor’s acceptance of the FTA was a comprehensive political defeat. In retrospect, it would have been better politics to approve the deal immediately. Moreover, if Labor was to keep its options open, it was necessary for senior figures, such as state premiers, to keep their mouths shut. Instead, Latham found himself presented with a fait accompli as the Labor premiers lined up behind Howard. Even after all this, it would have been better to withhold support and propose to renegotiate the deal after the US and Australian elections. Labor’s capitulation represented a decision to pursue the small target strategy that failed in 1998 and, even more dismally, in 2001. Not content with humiliating Labor, however, John Howard decided to raise the stakes, by rejecting a face-saving Labor amendment cutting off a minor loophole with respect to the PBS. The result was a twofold disaster for Howard. First, he was eventually forced to accept the Labor amendments verbatim despite his earlier claims that they could not possibly be drafted. Second, and more significantly, the debate over the amendments finally brought the core issues to the attention of the broad public. It has now become clear that, if interpreted in the spirit in which it was negotiated, the FTA would imply the destruction of the PBS. Australia’s only defence now is to insist on the narrowest possible reading of the terms of the agreement, and to invite the United States to take it or leave it.

40|$|New Building Act and Compulsory Planning in 1965 Coordinated {{physical}} and economic planning was introduced and extended in Norway through The Building Act in 1965, {{put into effect}} January 1, 1966. The earlier Act of 1924 was intended only for towns, and for those rural municipalities that chose to implement it for their built-up areas (villages). There was only one type of plan, "town plan" or local plan. The legal planning was in other words a physical planning for urban form. The new law made planning compulsory for the whole country, through master plans for the municipalities and regional plans for two or more municipalities. Planning was more strongly politically directed since only elected political bodies were given authority to vote on plans. Functional land use and zoning was formalized as a planning principle. In {{the implementation of the}} act, {{physical and}} economic planning was bound together both in content and institutionally. My interest in a study of the first years of master planning in rural municipalities through the new Act had two starting-points. First, I was curious about how the early planning in rural municipalities had worked. The planning criticism, which began {{at the end of the}} 1960 s and formed many opinions afterwards, sharpened my interest. As Chapter 2 shows, the criticism was basically directed against the politics for economic growth and prosperity. In physical planning it was directed against the contents of the plans, the ideals behind them, the methods of modernistic planning, the "neutral" planner role, the idea of planning as tool for development, and the planning process as it was carried out. Master planning did not deal with or solve the kinds of problems rural municipalities were facing. Secondly, I had access to the planning material of Nic Stabell from his work as a planning consultant, which he was putting into order at the end of his career. Stabell worked at Department of Town and Regional Planning from 1956 to 1990, and had his own practice on the side for a long period, doing planning for more than 40 muni-cipalities and regions. My study contains two main parts: 1. In Part II I explain and discuss the political and professional basis for the Planning Act of 1965, and the State’s intentions with the Act and the first implementation of it. 2. Part III contains a study of the early physical and economic planning in practice, through the master plans for the municipalities Eid in Sogn og Fjordane, Saltdal in Nordland, Stranda in Møre og Romsdal, Tinn in Telemark, and Ørland in Sør-Trøndelag as examples. (See map in Chapter 4. 3 and Appendix 1) The State’s Intentions with Planning Behind the Building Act and its implementation, one can see a political and a professional dimension. Chapter 5 describes how the political dimension developed, from economic liberalism with some responsibility for common welfare around 1900, to the growth of social democratic ideology and ambitious building of the welfare state, especially after Word War II. The professional dimension developed from early town planning under the influence of the Garden City Movement and Functionalism, among other things, through the first comprehensive planning in some urban regions after World War I, forward to physical and economic planning as a tool in welfare building and regional policy. In this we can see an integration of some old traditions of architects and engineers with an economic tradition with roots in the inter-war period. As time went by other professionals also took part in the planning process. In Chapter 6 the preparation and implementation of the new Act are discussed. The ambitions for planning increased through the 11 -year long process of designing the Act. At the beginning only some minor changes in the existing Act were being considered. There were doubts about whether the Act should apply in rural municipalities. The result was a new Act, which can be seen as one of the important tools for developing the welfare society. Together with other measures and especially regional policy planning, the Act was aiming to help the growth and regulation of trade and industry, housing, public service, infrastructure etc. by means of control of land use. Physical and Economic Planning in Practice The five municipalities had both similarities and differences. Tinn is located in the inland, while the other ones are located at the coast or in fjords. Tinn had about 8. 000 inhabitants and the population was declining. The other ones had between 4. 300 and 5. 300 inhabitants, and the population was stable or increasing. The municipalities were in a period of rapid change in trade and industry and development of welfare arrangements. There was need for land and economic resources for both public and private tasks. Especially Tinn was in a difficult situation because of the reductions of Norsk Hydro’s operations in the village of Rjukan. Some Aspects of the Contents of the Plans More than building plans for urban settlements The staring point for planning was for the most part to prepare for increased welfare through growth in trade and industry, and developing public service according to the policies of the State at the time. Partly the plans stated that increasing population was not a goal in itself. The most important was to offer good living conditions to all inhabitants. The plans include the total area of the municipalities and a broad spectrum of issues. Settlement in several parts of the municipality was desired, as was preservation of agriculture and local schools. This required housing, daily service, areas for small industries etc., also in the smallest villages. Otherwise, scattered housing should be reduced. Compared with the State’s strategy for decentralization, the plans seem to go further in developing small local communities. The plans emphasize land use and building tasks, but include more than just physical issues. In the analysis of nature and landscape and in the land use plans one can see an interest in protecting natural resources. Protection of agricultural land was motivated by production of food and securing employment. The interest in nature conservation was built on the value of flora and fauna, in landscape esthetic arguments, and in the values of the tourist industry and outdoor life in general. Culture and conservation of buildings were important too. In addition to the traditional historical and cultural heritages, there was interest in old building settings, while perhaps individual houses were not so valuable. One can see an increasing interest in the past, maybe as a reaction to modernism. The interests in conservation determined to a great degree which areas were chosen for building. Thus it was seen as a better solution to use the least valuable agriculture land near and inside the villages, rather than scattering the new developments. Big building tasks required large areas Housing required the most land. With the help of an active housing policy good dwellings should be provided to all inhabitants. Providing prepared building sites was also a strategy for attracting new inhabitants. The plans discuss alternatives to the traditional one-family house. The argument was reduced use of land and lower costs. The plans show principles for good housing environment with playgrounds, outdoor areas, assembly rooms, traffic safety and short distances to schools, local service etc. Industry was the other function that requires large areas. Areas of different sizes were planned in order to have attractive offers to different industries, in total much more area than was calculated as needed. Behind this lay both optimism in relation to the State’s policies and an element of competition between municipalities in attracting industries. As part of the welfare policies the municipalities had already come far in developing school systems and building institutions, dwellings and other services for elderly and sick people. However, in the case of kindergartens, it looks like the consultants argued for stronger efforts than the politicians were willing to make. The development of prosperity would also mean more commodity trade and demand for more space for shops, but there was usually room for extensions within the existing business and center areas. Ideal of denser "villages" 1 The plans show an ideal of "denser" villages 2, based on rational arguments about technical and economic relations and protection of agricultural land. Denser building would in addition mean shorter distances between various functions. Only larger industries should be located further away from villages and housing areas, partly because it was difficult to find areas without conflicts and partly because industry could produce noise and pollution. In some cases housing areas were located some distance away from the center as a compromise between the village ideal and the motive of protecting nature. The zoning plans showed the residential areas, the industrial area, the center area, the by-pass roads, and the pedestrian and bicycle paths. But zoning was not complete, even as a planning ideal. Mixed-use was seen as desirable in two ways. Effective land use and short distances should connect the dwellings to the center, and mixing of dwellings, shops, restaurants, work places, and cultural institutions should give more life to the center. In this can be seen an architectural ideal of the dense townscape. However, industrial areas were seen as purely industrial. The plan maps showed land use, but behind this was concern about architectural form. The adjustment of buildings to the terrain and landscape and the choice of types of houses and density were important elements. Building of roads and technical infrastructure Few questioned the extensive use of private cars. By-pass roads were according to common principles, and often what the Road authorities wanted. Local people, however, were often sceptical because the by-pass roads could have <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> in the center. Nevertheless, in some places extensive plans for new main roads were introduced, sometimes beyond what was shown in The Norwegian Road Plan. At the same time problems caused by traffic, like accidents and noise, were pointed out. The road systems were based on principles of differentiation and separation, and noise barriers were suggested. The principles were modified and adapted to the local situation. Traffic safety and good environment were arguments for positioning of functions within short distances. Pedestrian and bicycle paths were important in most of the plans. They were located parallel to the roads or in parks and sports fields. Public transportation was a necessary part of the transport system, but mostly as a supplement to private cars, for instance as more effective ferry connections. Buses were necessary for people who did not own their own cars. Use of railways was of interest mostly for transportation of goods. When airfields were mentioned in the plans, there was optimistic thinking about the volume of air transport in the future. The municipalities had to build systems for water supply and sewage in order to improve the existing situation and to prepare for development in the villages. The systems for garbage collection also had to be improved, perhaps in cooperation with neighboring municipalities. Some Aspects of the Planning Tools and Planning Process The planning had synoptic-rationalistic ambitions There were synoptic ambitions in the desire to relate the plans to greater geographical areas and to see many issues and factors in relation to each other. The rationalistic ambitions lie in the goal orientation and the use of systematic methods in the planning. In addition to dealing with the total areas of the municipalities and many considerations and tasks for future development, the plans tried to look at the municipality in the perspective of expected development in the region and the county. Based on investigation and analysis comprehensive plans were presented for trade and industry, population, housing, public service etc. all over the municipality. In this way the plans had formulated goals, for the total municipality, for the zoned areas, and for different sectors or tasks. Systematic methods were used to find needs and solutions according to the goals. In the use of methods and in the structure of the plans, the "economic-base" model was essential. It coordinated possible development in trade and industry, population, economics, and the needs and tasks the plans were to deal with. In the evaluation of alternative development patterns, systematic analysis of commodity trade was used. In addition the choice of pattern was based on judgement and political conside-rations. As a basis for the land use plans, systematic analysis of existing land use and qualities was done. Identifying conflicts of interest, especially in relation to agriculture, was important for the choice of building sites. The general approach and use of methods are in accordance with the Anglo-Saxon planning tradition, based on physical planning and dealing with themes and considerations that are relevant to land use plans. Public organizations were active in the planning It is understandable that planning was criticized for using ”scientific” and complicated methods, especially for the analysis of trade and industry and population. On the other hand it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other or easier way to create a solid basis for the goals and long term plans. The view that the municipalities bought a more or less complete plan proposal from the consultant is not correct. Political and administrative boards were important participants in the planning. In the most cases the planning committee was active, and some places the municipal council discussed important issues during the process. The planning committee often had important politicians as members. The municipal engineer had an important role, and was in some cases responsible for parts of the planning. The agriculture authorities' contribution to the analysis of land use was decisive for the design of the plan. Other authorities in the municipality and on a higher level gave contributions. The contacts with the County governors planning department, the road authorities, and the region planning office, were especially important. Private actors were to a lesser degree involved in the planning, apart from some contact with business leaders in discussions about future development, and with land-owners in discussions about land use plans. Ordinary people were more concerned about specific concrete projects and site plans. In the descriptions of the planning pro-cess, the public inspection of the plan proposal on its way to final decision is emphasized. Few initiatives were taken to broader participation in the planning; so the criticism of lack of democracy may be correct. The planning took a long time Up till about eight years elapsed from the planning started until a plan proposal could be presented. One common cause was the lack of maps. In some cases the work halted because planners had to wait for clarification of various issues. However, it seems like the municipalities were interested in getting the planning done. The exception may be Tinn, where economic development work had priority and finalizing of the master plan was delayed. Especially in Saltdal there was disagreement about how comprehensive the planning should be. In this one can see a suggestion that the synoptic ambitions were per-haps too high and that the planning did not concentrate enough on the most important problems in the municipality. At the same it should be remembered that all necessary data had to be developed from scratch. When the Ministry eventually advised limiting the scope of the plans, this was not so simple, as they were supposed to be consistent and serve as good tools for the municipality at the same time. The plans show signs of strategic thinking The view that the plans were static and standardized is not correct. The point of the analyses of relations between employment, population, need for building sites, and need for services, was to show what was necessary to steer the development in a desired direction, and to prepare for the development that was expected. The land use plans were to prepare for and guide building when and if it might take place. There was a strategic thought behind the large allocations of land, greater than calculated need, especially for industry. This gave municipalities flexibility and reserves of land for the future. The plans emphasized the need for up dating of the plans according to changes in needs and conditions. The municipalities were to do the future planning themselves. The criticism of the plans as static and standardized stands in contrast to the view of the same plans as schematic and divided in zones, without thought for form. In this view can be seen a wish for the plans to go even further in determining concrete design than the zoning plans did. The plans show will to realism I have examined the realism of the plans in relation to the information one could have at the time the planning was taking place and based on the methods used. The extensive registration and analysis shows will to found the plans on as solid a base of information and facts as possible. The goals for population growth at 1 - 2 % each year in the five municipalities can be seen as unrealistic. At the time, many municipalities had overly optimistic prognoses for growth. However, many rural municipalities believed in ”vitamin injections” from an active regional policy, and based their prognoses in addition on rates of birth that had been common up until then. The will to realism is obvious in the coordination between prognosis, calculations of needs, and analysis of the municipality’s economics, action plan and long term budget. Here is also a connection between physical and economic planning. When the plans account for the limitations in the municipality's possibilities in directing authorities on a higher level, or private trade and industries, this is an expression of a realistic attitude. Politicians had a tendency to decide more optimistic goals than the consultant recommended. This reflected political will and optimistic belief in the future and in regional policy. Planning better than its reputation In the years after, it can be seen that the plans were in use for a long time, even beyond the plan period. Of course, all municipalities except for Eid had lower population growth than expected, for many reasons. Industries did not develop in the way the plans suggested, more women took jobs, and birth rates declined. In agriculture there was stability for a few years, but then the number of farmers declined in the municipalities that had a difficult organization of farm area. In the public sector the number of employees increased because of an increase in required municipal administration. In the private service there has also been growth due to increased prosperity. The land use plans have been mostly followed with rather minor changes and additions, even in the smaller villages. Despite lower population increase, the small villages contain a reasonable part of the population, and building has mostly been carried out according to the plans. However, there has been less building, generally because of the population trend, and the planned areas in most cases have been sufficient up until now. Roads are only partly built; in some cases new plans have been made or earlier plans have been changed. Many industrial sites and some center and business areas have not been developed. In summary, my conclusions are that the master planning was useful for the municipalities I have studied, and probably in many rural Norwegian municipalities. A great deal of the criticism is not pertinent to the planning that was carried out, nor to the State’s intentions in planning. The requirement in the Planning Act of 1985 that the master plan should include social and cultural issues, and from 1997 also the esthetic development, is in reality nothing new in the light of the plans I have studied. However, the formalization of these requirements is a sign of expanding ambitions in the direction of the American tradition; comprehensive planning as a way of "planning social life. " It is thought provoking that the Planning and Building Act extended the ambitions for planning at the same time as dominant policies turned away from publicly decided development and toward free market liberalism and deregulation...|$|E

The underlying presumption is that production has to exceed a certain threshold in order for an economy to produce competitively on international markets. Therefore, the number of potentially competitive industries in an economy, which lowers the need to import these products, should increase with population size. Foreign demand, on the other hand, should have a positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> openness. The market for domestic products should increase with rising foreign demand.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{a bilateral}} trade problem with asymmetric information and ambiguity aversion. There is a buyer and a seller who bargain over {{the exchange of}} an indivisible good. The seller is privately informed {{about the quality of}} the good, which determines both his valuation and the buyer’s valuation. In the absence of ambiguity, the contract that maximizes the buyer’s payoff is a posted price. In this paper, the buyer holds ambiguous beliefs {{about the quality of the}} good and therefore faces ambiguity over both the seller’s willingness to accept an offer and her valuation of the good. The first type of ambiguity is exacerbated when the offered price is low, while the second type of ambiguity is exacerbated when the offered price is high. An ambiguity-averse buyer solves this conflict by proposing a screening menu rather than a posted price, thereby hedging against both types of ambiguity. Ambiguity aversion in this setting has opposing <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the level of trade: the buyer’s pessimism about the seller’s valuation has a positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade,</b> while the buyer’s pessimism about her own valuation has a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade.</b> The paper separates the two effects and shows under which conditions an increase in ambiguity leads to an increase or decrease in trade...|$|R
