40|$|Abstract Introduction Fractures <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the femoral {{component}} {{have been}} reported in uncemented total hip replacements, however, to our knowledge, no fractures <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cementless forged titanium alloy femoral stem coated in the proximal third with hydroxy-apatite {{have been reported}} in the medical literature. Case presentation This case report describes <b>a</b> fracture <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cementless forged titanium alloy stem coated in the proximal third with hydroxy-apatite. Conclusion The <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the femoral stem failed from fatigue probably because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> factors described analytically below. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to estimate the effect of using bur extractors in cotton stripping on foreign material in harvested cotton, on both quality attributes and lint turnout, and to determine the minimum harvested acres a producer must have for <b>a</b> <b>bur</b> extractor to be cost effective. Results indicate that the bur extractor has significant effect in reducing bur percent, stick percent, and in increasing seed cotton percent and lint turnout, while is showed no statistically significant effect on any of the quality attributes. Results also suggest that investment in bur extractors is profitable for both irrigated and dryland cotton production situations with <b>an</b> operation <b>of</b> at least 750 acres. This study provides a simple method that can be employed by producers of stripper-harvested cotton to determine the cost effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bur</b> extractor given individualized production scenarios.
