5|$|The ISO 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-1 when necessary. A {{country is}} usually {{assigned}} new ISO 3166-1 codes if it changes its name or its territorial boundaries. In general, new alphabetic codes are assigned if a country changes {{a significant part}} of its name, while a new <b>numeric</b> <b>code</b> is assigned if a country changes its territorial boundaries. Codes for formerly used country names that were deleted from ISO 3166-1 are published in ISO 3166-3.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the postal}} code systems are numeric; {{only a few}} are {{alphanumeric}} (i.e., use both letters and digits). Alphanumeric systems can, given {{the same number of}} characters, encode many more locations. For example, while a 2 digit <b>numeric</b> <b>code</b> can represent 100 locations, a 2 character alphanumeric code using ten numbers and twenty letters can represent 900 locations.|$|E

25|$|Each {{medallion}} {{carries a}} <b>numeric</b> <b>code,</b> {{which is also}} displayed prominently at several locations on (and in) the taxicab. The medallion must be purchased from the city or from another medallion owner. The supply of medallions is strictly controlled to prevent a surplus of cabs, which means that medallions trade at a high price. Unlike other cities, Chicago taxis can be of any color and drivers {{are not required to}} wear uniforms.|$|E
25|$|In France the <b>numeric</b> <b>code</b> for the {{departments}} {{is used as}} the first two digits of the postal code, except for the two departments in Corsica that have codes 2A and 2B and use 20 as postal code. Furthermore, the codes are only the codes for the department in charge of delivery of the post, {{so it can be}} that a location in one department has a postal code starting with the number of a neighbouring department.|$|E
25|$|Braille is in {{its origin}} a <b>numeric</b> <b>code.</b> Louis Braille applied the {{characters}} in numerical order to the French alphabet in alphabetical order. As braille spread to other languages, the numeric order was retained and applied to the local script. Therefore, where the alphabetical order differed from that of French, the new braille alphabet would be incompatible with French Braille. For example, French {{was based on a}} 25-letter alphabet without a w. When braille was adopted for English in the United States, the letters were applied directly to the English alphabet, so that braille letter of French x became English w, French y became English x, French z English y, and French ç English z. In the United Kingdom, however, French Braille was adopted without such reordering. Therefore, any English book published in braille needed to be typeset separately for the United States and the United Kingdom. Similarly, the letters Egyptian Arabic Braille were assigned their forms based on their nearest French equivalents, so that for example Arabic d had the same braille letters as French d. For Algerian Arabic Braille, however, the braille characters were assigned to the Arabic alphabet according to the Arabic alphabetical order, so that Algerian d was the same character as Egyptian h. Thus an Arabic book published in Algeria was utterly unintelligible to blind Egyptians and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|In the UN M.49 {{standard}} {{developed by}} the United Nations Statistics Division, additional <b>numeric</b> <b>codes</b> are used to represent geographical regions and groupings of countries and areas for statistical processing purposes, but these codes {{are not included in}} ISO 3166-1.

500|$|The only {{published}} {{reference to}} the glyphs which is even close to comprehensive remains Barthel (1958). Barthel assigned a three-digit <b>numeric</b> <b>code</b> to each glyph or to each group of similar-looking glyphs that he believed to be allographs (variants). In the case of allography, the bare <b>numeric</b> <b>code</b> was assigned to what Barthel {{believed to be the}} basic form (Grundtypus), while variants were specified by alphabetic suffixes. Altogether he assigned 600 numeric codes. The hundreds place is a digit from 0 to 7, and categorizes the head, or overall form if there is no head: 0 and 1 for geometric shapes and inanimate objects; 2 for figures with [...] "ears"; 3 and 4 for figures with open mouths (they are differentiated by their legs/tails); 5 for figures with miscellaneous heads; 6 for figures with beaks; and 7 for fish, arthropods, etc. The digits in tens and units places were allocated similarly, so that, for example, glyphs 206, 306, 406, 506, and 606 all have a downward-pointing wing or arm on the left, and a raised four-fingered hand on the right: ...|$|E

2500|$|The DSM-IV is a {{categorical}} classification system. The {{categories are}} prototypes, and {{a patient with}} a close approximation to the prototype {{is said to have}} that disorder. DSM-IV states, [...] "there is no assumption each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries" [...] but isolated, low-grade and non-criterion (unlisted for a given disorder) symptoms are not given importance. Qualifiers are sometimes used, for example mild, moderate or severe forms of a disorder. For nearly half the disorders, symptoms must be sufficient to cause [...] "clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning", although DSM-IV-TR removed the distress criterion from tic disorders and several of the paraphilias due to their egosyntonic nature. Each category of disorder has a <b>numeric</b> <b>code</b> taken from the ICD coding system, used for health service (including insurance) administrative purposes.|$|E

50|$|An {{advantage}} of <b>numeric</b> <b>codes</b> over alphabetic codes is script (writing system) independence. The ISO 3166-1 alphabetic codes (alpha-2 and alpha-3) use {{letters from the}} 26-letter English alphabet and are suitable for languages based on the Latin alphabet. For people and systems using non-Latin scripts (such as Arabic or Japanese), the English alphabet may be unavailable or difficult to use, understand, or correctly interpret. While <b>numeric</b> <b>codes</b> overcome the problems of script dependence, this independence comes {{at the cost of}} loss of mnemonic convenience.|$|R
