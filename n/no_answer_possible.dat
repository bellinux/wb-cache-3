60|$|The {{instance}} most {{quoted in}} our day is the thing called the humility of the man of science; and certainly {{it is a good}} instance as well as a modern one. Men find it extremely difficult to believe that a man who is obviously uprooting mountains and dividing seas, tearing down temples and stretching out hands to the stars, is really a quiet old gentleman who only asks to be allowed to indulge his harmless old hobby and follow his harmless old nose. When a man splits a grain of sand and the universe is turned upside down in consequence, it is difficult to realize that to the man who did it, the splitting of the grain is the great affair, and the capsizing of the cosmos quite a small one. It is hard to enter into the feelings of a man who regards a new heaven and a new earth in the light of a by-product. But undoubtedly it was to this almost eerie innocence of the intellect that the great men of the great scientific period, which now appears to be closing, owed their enormous power and triumph. If they had brought the heavens down like a house of cards their plea was not even that they had done it on principle; their quite unanswerable plea was that they had done it by accident. Whenever there was in them the least touch of pride in what they had done, there was a good ground for attacking them; but so long as they were wholly humble, they were wholly victorious. There were possible answers to Huxley; there was <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> <b>possible</b> to Darwin. He was convincing because of his unconsciousness; one might almost say because of his dulness. This childlike and prosaic mind is beginning to wane in the world of science. Men of science are beginning to see themselves, as the fine phrase is, in the part; they are beginning to be proud of their humility. They are beginning to be aesthetic, {{like the rest of the}} world, beginning to spell truth with a capital T, beginning to talk of the creeds they imagine themselves to have destroyed, of the discoveries that their forbears made. Like the modern English, they are beginning to be soft about their own hardness. They are becoming conscious of their own strength--that is, they are growing weaker. But one purely modern man has emerged in the strictly modern decades who does carry into our world the clear personal simplicity of the old world of science. One man of genius we have who is an artist, but who was a man of science, and who seems to be marked above all things with this great scientific humility. I mean Mr. H. G. Wells. And in his case, as in the others above spoken of, there must be a great preliminary difficulty in convincing the ordinary person that such a virtue is predicable of such a man. Mr. Wells began his literary work with violent visions--visions of the last pangs of this planet; can it be that a man who begins with violent visions is humble? He went on to wilder and wilder stories about carving beasts into men and shooting angels like birds. Is the man who shoots angels and carves beasts into men humble? Since then he has done something bolder than either of these blasphemies; he has prophesied the political future of all men; prophesied it with aggressive authority and a ringing decision of detail. Is the prophet of the future of all men humble? It will indeed be difficult, in the present condition of current thought about such things as pride and humility, to answer the query of how a man can be humble who does such big things and such bold things. For the only answer is the answer which I gave at the beginning of this essay. It is the humble man who does the big things. It is the humble man who does the bold things. It is the humble man who has the sensational sights vouchsafed to him, and this for three obvious reasons: first, that he strains his eyes more than any other men to see them; second, that he is more overwhelmed and uplifted with them when they come; third, that he records them more exactly and sincerely and with less adulteration from his more commonplace and more conceited everyday self. Adventures are to those to whom they are most unexpected--that is, most romantic. Adventures are to the shy: in this sense adventures are to the unadventurous.|$|E

6000|$|The {{above is}} a {{universal}} method: that is, it is absolutely certain either to produce the answer, or to prove that <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> is <b>possible.</b> The question may also be solved by combining the quantities whose values are given, so as to form those whose values are required. This is {{merely a matter of}} ingenuity and good luck: and as it may fail, even when the thing is possible, and is of no use in proving it impossible, I cannot rank this method as equal in value with the other. Even when it succeeds, it may prove a very tedious process. Suppose the 26 competitors, who have sent in what I may call accidental solutions, had had a question to deal with where every number contained 8 or 10 digits!

Mrs Pipkin was perhaps a little jealous at the interest which her lodger took in her niece, thinking perhaps that all Mrs Hurtle's sympathies were due to herself.|$|R

40|$|The asteroids and Kuiper Belt {{objects are}} left overs of {{building}} material for our {{earth and the}} other planets in our solar systems from 4. 567 billion years ago. Those typically 100 km large objects are called planetesimals, built up from icy and dusty grains. In our current paradigm of planet formation it was turbulent flows and metastable flow patterns like zonal flows and vortices that concentrated mm to cm sized grains in sufficient numbers that a streaming instability and gravitational collapse of these particle clumps was triggered. The entire picture is known as gravoturbulent formation of planetesimals. What was missing until recently was a physically motivated prediction on the typical sizes at which planetesimals should form via this process. Our old simulations on JUGENE in Jülich had only shown a correlation between numerical resolution and planetesimal size and thus <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> was <b>possible.</b> But with the latest series of simulations on JUQUEEN covering all the length scales down to the physical size of actual planetesimals {{we were able to}} obtain values for the turbulent particle diffusion {{as a function of the}} particle load in the gas. Thus we have all necessary data at hand to feed our back of the envelope calculation that predicts the size of planetesimals as result of a competition between gravitational concentration and turbulent diffusion. Using the diffusion values obtained in the numerical simulations on JUQUEEN predicts planetesimal sizes on the order of 100 km, which luckily coincides with the measured data from both asteroids as well from Kuiper Belt objects...|$|R

40|$|Morality is a contested phenomenon. Deeply {{committed}} partisans {{have fought}} over its meaning for millennia. Nevertheless, no enduring consensus has been reached. Some thinkers, including social scientists, have sought {{a way out}} of this predicament by positing that <b>no</b> <b>answer</b> is <b>possible.</b> Those here designated “moral nihilists ” argue that morality is either unnecessary or impossible. Arrayed into three groups that may be distinguished as either “good, ” “bad, ” or “skeptical, ” they present a variety of reasons for purging morality from our thought categories. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, John Dewey, and Michele Foucault may all be counted as within their ranks. And yet, if morality is understood as a tripartite process in which people participate, their objections prove misleading. Morality is real and continues to be a vital part of the human experience. To contend otherwise is to embrace the prospect of anarchy. An Enduring Problem Almost everyone has an opinion about morality. Laypersons and specialists alike are prepared to tell us what is right or wrong. The problem is that they regularly disagree with one another. This has been the case not just for decades, but millennia. More than this, there is no agreement about the nature of morality. Theologians, philosophers, politicians, and scientists have all weighed in with different answers. As often as not, these partisans have been confident that their own solution is correct. Nevertheless, those who differ tend to be equally adamant. More remarkably, over the long history during which morality has been intellectually scrutinized, our understanding of the enterprise has made few advances. Rather than producing an array of cumulative insights, we today know little more about how morality operates than did Aristotle (1941). Remarkably, although many thousands of intelligent people have set their minds to the matter, we have little to show for their concerted efforts. Despite their good will and penetrating analyses, no enduring consensus has emerged...|$|R
