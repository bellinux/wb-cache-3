40|$|Background: From 2002 to 2014, the {{orthopedic}} surgery residency applicant pool increased by 25 % while the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> per applicant rose by 69 %, {{resulting in an}} increase of 109 % {{in the number of}} applications received per program. Objective: This study aimed to identify applicant factors associated with an increased number of applications to {{orthopedic surgery}} residency programs. Design: An anonymous survey was sent to all applicants applying to the orthopedic surgery residency program at Loyola University. Questions were designed to define the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> per respondent as well as the strength of their application. Of 733 surveys sent, 140 (19. 1 %) responses were received. Setting: An academic institution in Maywood, IL. Participants: Fourth-year medical students applying to the orthopedic surgery residency program at Loyola University. Results: An applicant's perception of how competitive he or she was (applicants who rated themselves as ‘average’ submitted more applications than those who rated themselves as either ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’, p= 0. 001) and the number of away rotations (those who completed > 2 away rotations submitted more applications, p= 0. 03) were significantly associated with an increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> <b>submitted.</b> No other responses were found to be associated with an increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> <b>submitted.</b> Conclusion: Less qualified candidates are not applying to significantly more programs than their more qualified counterparts. The increasing number of applications represents a financial strain on the applicant, given the costs required to apply to more programs, and a time burden on individual programs to screen increasing numbers of applicants. In order to stabilize or reverse this alarming trend, orthopedic surgery residency programs should openly disclose admission criteria to prospective candidates, and medical schools should provide additional guidance for candidates in this process...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveOur {{objective}} was determine {{the status of}} National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for cardiothoracic surgery research. Summary Background Data(1) Funding from the NIH is critical if new procedures and devices are to be developed. (2) The success rate for NIH applications coming from cardiothoracic surgery faculty {{is thought to be}} inferior. (3) Per capita numbers of surgical NIH application and awards and application success rate have recently been found to be below the average for the NIH. MethodsApplication and award data for full-time academic cardiothoracic surgeons were obtained by matching records in the NIH IMPAC II database with membership rosters of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Manpower data were obtained from 1999, 2003, and 2005 reports of the STS/AATS Workforce committee. Society membership was used as a surrogate for investigator experience. ResultsThe number of NIH applications has increased steeply in the past 7 years; however, the number of awards has remained constant. This pattern was observed for surgery and cardiothoracic surgery as well. Until 2003, the cardiothoracic surgery application success rate was actually higher than that of surgery and the NIH as a whole (between 25 % and 40 %). Since then, however, the cardiothoracic surgery application success rate has declined steeply and is now only 14 %. NIH applications and awards per 100 cardiothoracic surgeons, although similar to those of surgery, are very much less than the NIH as a whole. ConclusionPer capita NIH funding of cardiothoracic surgeons is very much less than that of the NIH as a whole. The primary cause is the low per capita <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> by cardiothoracic surgeons. Junior cardiothoracic faculty should be encouraged to apply for career development awards. However, since the ability to shift cost from clinical to academic faculty is declining, affirmative action from the NIH may be necessary...|$|E

40|$|Background: In 1998 {{a formal}} process using the {{criteria}} of safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (evidence based medicine) on the introduction and use of new medical procedures was implemented in Australia. As {{part of this process}} an expert panel, the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) was set up. This paper examines the effectiveness of this process based on the original criteria, that is, evidence based medicine. Method: The data for this analysis was sourced primarily from that made available in the public domain. The MSAC web site provided Minutes from MSAC meetings; Annual Reports; Assessment and Review reports; Progress status; and Archived material. Results: The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> to the MSAC has been relatively low averaging approximately only fourteen per year. Additionally, the source of applications has quickly shifted to the medical devices, equipment and diagnostic industry as being the major source of applications. An overall average time for the processing of an application is eighteen months. Negative recommendations were in most cases based on insufficient clinical evidence rather than clinical evidence that clearly demonstrated a lack of clinical effectiveness. It was rare for a recommendation, either positive or negative, to be based on cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: New medical procedures are often the result of a process of experimentation rather than formally conducted research. Affordability and the question of who should pay for the generation, collection and analysis of the clinical evidence is perhaps the most difficult to answer. This is especially the case where the new procedure {{is the result of a}} process of experimentation with an old procedure. A cost-effective way needs to be found to collect accep levels of evidence proving the clinical effectiveness of these new procedures, otherwise the formal processes of evaluation such as that used by the Australian MSAC since 1998 will continue to run the risk of committing Type II errors, that is, denying access to medical procedures that are beneficial and efficient. 23 page(s...|$|E

This paper presents a comparative analysis of screening performance before and following the 2006 EIA Regulations {{in order to determine the}} improvement of screening effectiveness (and hence the EIA process) since the interventions introduced in the 2006 EIA Regulations. Changes in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> EIA <b>applications</b> as well as the types of activities requiring EIA are analysed. The results show that the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> EIA <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> per month reduced by 27 % nationally from 1997 to 2006.

The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> submitted loans to the REDF has dramatically increased from 13146 to 30687, whereas the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> granted loans by the REDF has decreased from 8121 to 7237 over the period 1990 - 2000. It is very apparent that demand for housing loans has extremely exceeded the available supply of such loans provided by the REDF. Therefore, a need exists to encourage private financial institutions to seek and exploit profitable investment opportunities available in the residential construction market. However, one major obstacle that prevents private investors from exploiting such opportunities is insufficient knowledge of the housing market conditions. Up-to-date information on construction industry trends, investment opportunities, future patterns of housing demand and supply, research results, is not widely and easily available.

They grant a time-limited exclusivity on the use of an invention allowing the recuperation of research costs. The use of patents is fiercely debated for medical innovation and especially controversial for publicly funded research, where the patent holder is an institution accountable to public interest. Despite this controversy, for the situation in Germany almost no empirical information exists. The purpose of this study is to examine the amount, types and trends <b>of</b> patent <b>applications</b> for health products submitted by German public research organisations. Methods/Principal Findings: We conducted a systematic search for patent documents using the publicly accessible database search interface of the German Patent and Trademark Office. We defined keywords and search criteria and developed search patterns for the database request. We retrieved documents with application date between 1988 and 2006 and processed the collected data stepwise to compile the most relevant documents in patent families for further analysis. We developed a rationale and present individual steps of a systematic method to request and process patent data from a publicly accessible database. We retrieved and processed 10194 patent documents. Out of these, we identified 1772 relevant patent families, applied for by 193 different universities and non-university public research organisations. 827 (47 %) of these patent families contained granted patents.

[...] After Members of the U.S. Congress pressed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to release declassified versions of its secret ruling, the court dismissed those requests arguing that the decisions can't be declassified because they contain classified information.

5000|$|There {{has been}} growing {{criticism}} of the court since the September 11, 2001 attacks. This is partly because the court sits ex parte - in other words, {{in the absence of}} anyone but the judge and the government present at the hearings. This, combined with the minimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> requests that are rejected by the court has led experts to characterize it as a rubber stamp (former National Security Agency analyst Russ Tice called it a [...] "kangaroo court with a rubber stamp"). The accusation of being a [...] "rubber stamp" [...] was rejected by FISA Court president Reggie B. Walton who {{wrote in a letter to}} Senator Patrick J. Leahy: [...] "The annual statistics provided to Congress by the Attorney General … - frequently cited to in press reports as a suggestion that the Court's approval rate <b>of</b> <b>application</b> is over 99% - reflect only the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> final <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> to and acted on by the Court. These statistics do not reflect the fact that many applications are altered to prior or final submission or even withheld from final submission entirely, often after an indication that a judge would not approve them." [...] He added: [...] "There is a rigorous review process <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> <b>submitted</b> by the executive branch, spearheaded initially by five judicial branch lawyers who are national security experts and then by the judges, to ensure that the court’s authorizations comport with what the applicable statutes authorize." [...] In a following letter Walton stated that the government had revamped 24.4% of its requests in the face of court questions and demands in time from July 1, 2013 to September 30, 2013. This figure became available after Walton decided in the summer of 2013 that the FISC would begin keeping its own tally of how Justice Department warrant applications for electronic surveillance fared - and would track for the first time when the government withdrew or resubmitted those applications with changes. Some requests are modified by the court but ultimately granted, while the percentage of denied requests is statistically negligible (11 denied requests out of around 34,000 granted in 35 years - equivalent to 0.03%). The accusation that the FISC is a [...] "rubber stamp" [...] court was also rejected by Robert S. Litt (General Counsel of Office of the Director of National Intelligence): [...] "When Government prepares an application for section 215 order, it first submits to the FISC what's called a [...] "read copy", which the court staff will review and comment on. And they will almost invariably come back with questions, concerns, problems that they see. And there is an iterative process back and forth between the Government and the FISC to take care of those concerns so that at the end of the day, we're confident that we're presenting something that the FISC will approve. That is hardly a rubber stamp. It's rather extensive and serious judicial oversight of this process." ...|$|R
