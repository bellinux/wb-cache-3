The genetic structure of the Daubenton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>bat</b> in western Europe was investigated by analysing variability at eight microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity {{was found to be}} high at all sites (HE = 0. 73 - 0. 84), with little differentiation between bats sampled in the UK and continental Europe. Mantel tests indicated a significant correlation between geographic distance and pair-wise FST (P = 0. 000), between colonies sampled in Scotland and northern England. However, this was not continuous throughout the sampled range, with evidence of panmixia within the area sampled in continental Europe. Assignment tests show no evidence that the (potential) EBLV- 2 sero-positive and virus positive bats {{were more likely to have}} originated from the continental rather than UK populations. There is no sufficient significant genetic differentiation amongst most UK and continental colonies to conclude that EBLV- 2 is maintained in the UK by immigration. Results show that it is likely to be maintained at a low endemic level within the UK. The relative genetic uniformity of UK and continental populations implies that there is no migration barrier to EBLV- 2, between these regions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In 1998, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{took steps}} to develop a {{scientific}} test methodology to measure and to control baseball bat performance. The resulting standard uses a hitting machine that pitches a ball at a moving bat to measure the BESR (Ball Exit Speed Ratio). Concurrently, the governing body for amateur baseball in Japan developed a test protocol for controlling bat performance. In contrast to the NCAA test methodology, the Japanese protocol uses a series of static tests. This paper compares the two protocol philosophies and presents experimental data highlighting the respective criteria of each approach and discusses how successful each approach has been in controlling nonwood baseball bat performance. Comparison data and analysis showed that some Japanese bats marginally outperformed U. <b>S.</b> <b>bats</b> with respect to batted-ball speed. Despite the lack of direct restriction on batted-ball performance using a dynamic test method, the Japanese regulation is controlling the performance of aluminum bats fairly well...|$|R

However, increasing concerns for human safety {{have led to}} accelerated programs for mine closure. In efforts to protect roosting sites in mines showing significant bat activity, 2 ̆ 2 bat compatible 2 ̆ 2 gates are installed, thus allowing continued access to mine workings. Aside from ensuring public safety, these structures afford protection from disturbance to roosting bats. To date few posting-gating {{studies have been conducted}} to obtain information on the effects of these structures on bat behavior and roost suitability. I evaluated the effects of gating on bat flight patterns at maternity colonies in two previously gated (reference) and two ungated mines, the latter (treatment) being gated with roundbar Manganal steel gates in the second year of the study. I also monitored four gated and three treatment mines to determine the potential effects of reclamation on internal microclimate.

Indices of crowding and frequency of bat-gate collisions were significantly higher in previously gated and increased substantially in treatment mines following reclamation.

40|$|Bats are ecologically and {{economically}} important mammals. The life histories of bats (particularly their low reproductive {{rates and the}} need for some species to gather in large aggregations at limited numbers of roosting sites) make their populations vulnerable to declines. Many of the species of bats in the United States (U. S.) and territories are categorized as endangered or threatened, have been candidates for such categories, or are considered species of concern. The importance and vulnerability of bat populations makes monitoring trends in their populations a goal for their future management. However, scientifically rigorous monitoring of bat populations requires well-planned, statistically defensible efforts. This volume reports findings of an expert workshop held to examine the topic of monitoring populations of bats. The workshop participants included leading experts in sampling and analysis of wildlife populations, as well as experts in the biology and conservation of bats. Findings are reported in this volume under two sections. Part I of the report presents contributed papers that provide overviews of past and current efforts at monitoring trends in populations of bats in the U. S. and territories. These papers consider current techniques and problems, and summarize what is known about the status and trends in populations of selected groups of bats.

40|$|Abstract Background As bats have {{recently}} been described to harbor many different viruses, several studies have investigated the genetic co-variation between viruses and different bat species. However, {{little is known about}} the genetic co-variation of viruses and different populations of the same bat species, although such information is needed for an understanding of virus transmission dynamics within a given host species. We hypothesized that if virus transmission between host populations depends on events linked to gene flow in the bats, genetic co-variation should exist between host populations and astroviruses. Results We used 19 nuclear and one mitochondrial microsatellite loci to analyze the genetic population structure of the Natterer 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis nattereri) within and among populations at different geographical scales in Germany. Further, we correlated the observed bat population structure to that of partial astrovirus sequences (3232 ̆ 0133940 nt fragments of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) obtained from the same bat populations. Our analyses revealed that the studied bat colonies can be grouped into three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to the three geographic regions sampled. Furthermore, we observed an overall isolation-by-distance pattern, while no significant pattern was observed within a geographic region. Moreover, we found no correlation between the genetic distances among the bat populations and the astrovirus sequences they harbored. Even though high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions was detected, identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions. Conclusions The genetic population structure of the bat host suggests that mating sites where several local breeding colonies meet act as stepping-stones for gene flow. Identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions suggesting that astroviruses are mostly transmitted among host colonies at the local scale. Nevertheless, high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions implies that occasional transmission across regions with subsequent mutations of the virus haplotypes does occur...|$|R
