50|$|The use of GNSS in {{aircraft}} {{is becoming}} increasingly common. GNSS provides very precise aircraft position, altitude, heading and ground speed information. GNSS makes navigation precision once reserved to large RNAV-equipped aircraft available to the GA pilot. Recently, more and more airports include GNSS instrument approaches.

50|$|Missed {{approach}} point (MAP or MAPt) is {{the point}} prescribed in each instrument approach at which a missed approach procedure shall be executed if the required visual reference does not exist. It defines the point for both precision and <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> wherein the missed approach segment of an approach procedure begins. A pilot must execute a missed approach if a required visual reference (normally the runway or its environment) is not in sight upon reaching the MAP or the pilot decides it is unsafe {{to continue with the}} approach and landing to the runway. The missed approach point is published in the approach plates and contains instructions for missed approach procedures to be executed at this point.|$|E
50|$|A {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} system, {{commonly referred to}} by the acronym TACAN, is a navigation system used by military aircraft. It provides the user with bearing and distance (slant-range or hypotenuse) to a ground or ship-borne station. It is a more accurate version of the VOR/DME system that provides bearing and range information for civil aviation. The DME portion of the TACAN system is available for civil use; at VORTAC facilities where a VOR is combined with a TACAN, civil aircraft can receive VOR/DME readings. Aircraft equipped with TACAN avionics can use this system for en route navigation as well as <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> to landing fields. The space shuttle is one such vehicle {{that was designed to}} use TACAN navigation but later upgraded with GPS as a replacement.|$|E

50|$|The Captain was Jannie Moala from Papua New Guinea. She had {{accumulated}} a total flying hours of 2.177 hours in which 1.836 {{of them were}} on the Twin Otter.

However, training records that were provided by the operator showed that items identified within the operator’s training syllabus that included the introduction to, and use of the GPS for en route navigation had been ‘ticked’ by the training captain as complete. No evidence as to the extent of that training, or level of understanding attained by Captain Jannie was provided by the operator.
