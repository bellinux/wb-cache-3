5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late inspection of the thermal protection system of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon <b>nose</b> <b>cap,</b> and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) was the United States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> was separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E
5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened <b>nose</b> <b>cap.</b> The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E

40|$|A leading-edge-shaped {{heat pipe}} was {{successfully}} fabricated and tested. The heat pipe had a "D-shaped" cross section and was fabricated from arc cast molybdenumrhenium. An artery {{was included in}} the wick. Several issues were resolved during the fabrication of the heat-pipe container and wick with a sharp-leading-edge radius. The heat pipe was tested in a vacuum chamber using induction heating and was started up from the frozen state several times. The heat pipe did operate as a heat pipe over a portion of its length. However, design temperatures and heat fluxes were not obtained due to premature failure of the heat pipe resulting from electrical discharge between the induction heating apparatus and the heat pipe.

25|$|Long {{before the}} No. 4 Mk I, Britain had {{obviously}} {{settled on the}} rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the wire loop {{in place of the}} sling swivel at the front of magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was wrapped over and attached {{to the rear of the}} <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> screw was slotted for the width of a coin for easy removal, a safety lever on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. No. 1 Mk V rifles were manufactured solely by R.S.A.F. Enfield from 1922–1924, with a total production of roughly 20,000 rifles, all of which marked with a “V”.|$|E
25|$|To {{withstand}} {{the heat of}} re-entry, the cone-shaped SRE-1 has a heat shield composed of silica tiles {{over much of the}} surface, and an ablative <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> of carbon-phenolic composite. ISRO is also working on technology to manufacture carbon-carbon composite heat shields, which, along with the silica tiles tested with the SRE-1, could find use in future reusable spacecraft such as ISRO's planned Reusable Launch Vehicle.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, {{the need for}} new rifles grew and the Rifle, No. 4 Mk I was officially adopted in 1941. The No. 4 action was similar to the Mk VI, but {{stronger}} and most importantly, easier to mass-produce. Unlike the SMLE, that had a <b>nose</b> <b>cap,</b> the No 4 Lee–Enfield barrel protruded {{from the end of the}} forestock. The charger bridge was no longer rounded for easier machining.|$|E
50|$|Silicone-impregnated {{reusable}} ceramic ablator (SIRCA) {{was also}} developed at NASA Ames Research Center {{and was used}} on the Backshell Interface Plate (BIP) of the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) aeroshells. The BIP was at the attachment points between the aeroshell's backshell (also called the afterbody or aft cover) and the cruise ring (also called the cruise stage). SIRCA was also the primary TPS material for the unsuccessful Deep Space 2 (DS/2) Mars impactor probes with their 0.35 m base diameter aeroshells. SIRCA is a monolithic, insulating material that can provide thermal protection through ablation. It is the only TPS material that can be machined to custom shapes and then applied directly to the spacecraft. There is no post-processing, heat treating, or additional coatings required (unlike Space Shuttle tiles). Since SIRCA can be machined to precise shapes, it can be applied as tiles, leading edge sections, full <b>nose</b> <b>caps,</b> or {{in any number of}} custom shapes or sizes. , SIRCA had been demonstrated in backshell interface applications, but not yet as a forebody TPS material.|$|R
5000|$|M/27: The Model 27 was the Finnish Army's first almost {{complete}} reworking of the Model 1891, it was nicknamed Pystykorva (literally [...] "spitz") {{due to the}} foresight guards. The receiver and magazine of the 1891 were retained, but a new shorter-length heavy-weight barrel was fitted. The sights were modified. The receivers and bolts were modified with [...] "wings" [...] being fitted to the bolt connecting bars that fit into slots machined into the receivers. The stocks were initially produced by cutting down 1891 stocks and opening up the barrel channels to accommodate the heavier barrel. New barrel bands and <b>nose</b> <b>caps</b> were fitted and a new bayonet was issued. The modified stocks proved to be weak, breaking when soldiers practiced bayonet fighting or firing with the bayonet fitted. These and other problems resulted in a slow-down of production in the mid-1930s while solutions to problems were engineered and existing stocks of rifles were modified. Produced from mid-1927 to 1940, the Model 27 was the Finnish Army's main battle rifle in the Winter War.|$|R
40|$|At DLR, CMC {{materials}} and structures {{based on the}} LSI process have been developed since the late 1980 `s. In {{the first step of}} the LSI process, a CFRP preform is made using common technologies like resin transfer moulding (RTM), autoclave technique or warm pressing. Subsequently, the CFRP preform is pyrolysed and infiltrated by molten silicon. Thereby, the silicon reacts with carbon, forming a SiC matrix, leading to the final C/C-SiC material. Up to now, carbon fibre 2 D woven fabrics have been used for the manufacture of thin walled, C/C-SiC structures like <b>nose</b> <b>caps</b> for thermal protection systems of spacecraft. However, for highly loaded, lightweight structures like nozzles or combustion chambers, the use of 2 D woven fabrics is critical, due to the inadequate drapability and the resulting, limited strength. Therefore, CFRP-preforms based on filament winding, a well known process for the industrial production of tubular structures, have been adapted to the LSI process. Thereby, the winding angle of the fibre was varied systematically. In the resulting C/C-SiC material a strong influence of the fibre orientation to the mechanical properties was observed. In this presentation the manufacturing of tubular C/C-SiC structures via filament winding is described in detail and first results regarding microstructure and mechanical behaviour are given. ...|$|R
25|$|Standard late {{inspections}} of the Thermal Protection System took place later on Flight Day 10. About 12:15 UTC, Wilmore and Melvin began grappling and unberthing the OBSS for {{the survey of}} the shuttle’s heat shield. With help from Bresnik, they inspected the reinforced carbon-carbon of the right wing leading edge, then the <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> and the left wing leading edge. The inspection tasks took more than five hours.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the day was}} to inspect Atlantiss thermal protection system, using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to look for any signs of launch damage. To do so, Commander Ferguson, Pilot Hurley and Mission Specialist Magnus used the shuttle's robotic arm and the OBSS to get a close up look at reinforced carbon–carbon wing leading edges and the <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> of the shuttle. The robotic arm grappled the OBSS at 6:58a.m. EDT. After raising out the arm-boom assembly, the crew activated the camera and laser sensor package on the boom to first scan the starboard wing. The <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> was surveyed next followed by the port wing. The gathered visual and electronic data were downlinked during numerous Ku band communication opportunities to the ground. With imagery on their hand, experts began to review the data. The heat shield survey started around 11:00 UTC, was wrapped about five hours later. In his NASA TV commentary, NASA Public Affairs Officer, Rob Navias, said that most of the time, the crew worked ahead of schedule opting to take meals while working. The crew received high praise for their efficient work from the Mission Control Houston including CAPCOM astronaut Stephen Robinson who communicated with them during the survey.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew members}} aboard space shuttle Atlantis began their first full day in space at 09:28 UTC. The day was {{primarily}} devoted to inspect Atlantis’s thermal protection system {{to look for}} any signs of launch damage. Using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew performed a six-hour inspection of the reinforced carbon <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> and wing leading edge panels of the shuttle. After releasing its grasp on the inspection boom, the robotic arm grappled the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier 1 (ELC1) as a preparatory step for installation on Flight Day 3.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{protection}} {{materials and}} systems (IRS) {{are used to}} protect spacecraft during reentry into Earth's atmosphere or entry into planetary atmospheres. As such, these materials are subject to severe environments with high heat fluxes and rapid heating. Catalytic effects can increase the temperatures substantially. These materials are also subject to impact damage from micrometeorites or other debris during ascent, orbit, and descent, and thus {{must be able to}} withstand damage and to function following damage. Thermal protection materials and coatings used in reusable launch vehicles will be reviewed, including the needs and directions for new materials to enable new missions that require faster turnaround and much greater reusability. The role of ablative materials for use in high heat flux environments, especially for non-reusable applications and upcoming planetary missions, will be discussed. New thermal protection system materials may enable the use of sharp <b>nose</b> <b>caps</b> and leading edges on future reusable space transportation vehicles. Vehicles employing this new technology would have significant increases in maneuverability and out-of-orbit cross range compared to current vehicles, leading to increased mission safety in the event of the need to abort during ascent or from orbit. Ultrahigh temperature ceramics, a family of materials based on HfB 2 and ZrB 2 with SiC, will be discussed.

40|$|Characterization of {{accurate}} flight vehicle unsteady aerodynamics {{is critical}} for component and secondary structure vibroacoustic design. The Aerosciences Branch at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space Flight Center has conducted a test at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Unitary Plan Wind Tunnels (UPWT) to determine such ascent aeroacoustic environments for the Space Launch System (SLS). Surface static pressure measurements were also collected to aid in determination of local environments for venting, CFD substantiation, and calibration of the flush air data system located on the launch abort system. Additionally, this test supported a NASA Engineering and Safety Center study of alternate booster <b>nose</b> <b>caps.</b> Testing occurred during two test campaigns: August - September 2013 and December 2013 - January 2014. Four primary model configurations were tested for ascent aeroacoustic environment definition. The SLS Block 1 vehicle was represented by a 2. 5 % full stack model and a 4 % truncated model. Preliminary Block 1 B payload and manned configurations were also tested, using 2. 5 % full stack and 4 % truncated models respectively. This test utilized the 11 x 11 foot transonic and 9 x 7 foot supersonic tunnel sections at the ARC UPWT to collect data from Mach 0. 7 through 2. 5 at various total angles of attack. SLS Block 1 design environments were developed primarily using these data. SLS Block 1 B preliminary environments have also been prepared using these data.

25|$|Flight Day 2 saw {{the crew}} of Discovery begin their {{preparations}} to dock with the International Space Station (ISS). The day started with a firing of the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engine, called the NC2 burn, to help Discovery catch up to the ISS. Commander Steve Lindsey, Pilot Eric Boe and Mission Specialist Al Drew began the day performing an inspection of the Re-enforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels with the Orbital Boom Sensor System (OBSS). Lindsey and Boe started the inspection on the starboard wing and <b>nose</b> <b>cap,</b> and continued on with the port wing; the whole survey took about six hours to complete. Drew joined up with Michael Barratt and Steve Bowen to checkout and get their two Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) ready for the two spacewalks that would be conducted during the mission.

25|$|EVA 1 {{started with}} astronauts Dave Wolf and Tim Kopra {{switching}} their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16:19 UTC. Despite a communication {{problem with the}} spacewalkers, the Japanese Exposed Facility was successfully installed on the Japanese Experiment Module {{by means of a}} complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle. The JEF was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm, after which the shuttle arm took the load. The station arm was then moved to the worksite on Node-2 (Harmony), wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back. The facility was then successfully latched on to the Experiment Module. As part of the EVA, the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS), which could not be deployed during STS-119. During the prior mission, the deployment failed due to a jamming caused by a stuck detent pin. Engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release, which was used to deploy the mechanism. Meanwhile, the shuttle managers announced {{that there would be no}} need for a focused inspection of the heat shield. The <b>nose</b> <b>cap</b> and wing leading-edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were, but a reentry clearance was not given. Beyond one impact site having a gouge, the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating. The other activity scheduled for EVA 1, the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier, was postponed for want of time. A fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed, though the cell continued to function as expected with no impact to the mission.|$|E
500|$|In April 1946, Convair {{received}} a 1.9 million dollar {{contract from the}} US Government to build and test ten MX-774 rocket.
