40|$|<b>Net</b> <b>paper</b> {{readers have}} been shown to read deeper into {{articles}} than newspaper readers. It has also been claimed that newspaper readers rather scan than read newspapers. Do these findings mean that <b>net</b> <b>paper</b> readers read proportionally more than newspaper readers? This paper presents results showing that in fact <b>net</b> <b>paper</b> readers scan more and read less than newspaper readers. We furthermore investigate whether this result {{can be explained by the}} differences in layout, navigation structure and purpose of reading between the two media...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consumed}} products in the world. The most important raw material source used for <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> is the cellulose obtained from trees. There are significant impacts of paper industry on the environment and economy during its traditional production process. In this study, calcium carbonate is proposed as an alternative raw material for the traditional paper made from cellulose, and two alternative <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> systems namely mineral <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> and traditional <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> are compared from the points of environment, energy, and economy. It is concluded that the mineral <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> is economically and environmentally more advantageous than the traditional <b>paper</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>production</b> with {{elemental}} chlorine has historically led to significant PCDD/F pollution [9, 138, 195]. PCDD/F releases were mainly via wastewater and sludge.

In one case in Germany, {{the application of}} sludge from <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> resulted in PCDD/F levels in the soil up to 150  ng I-TEQ/kg dm, and up to 5165  ng I-TEQ/kg dm in the applied paper sludge material [195].|$|R

40|$|How do readers {{interact}} with <b>net</b> <b>papers?</b> Does the new medium influence {{our way of}} searching for news? Does net-paper reading differ from newspaper reading? 12 users were asked to read 2 net-papers at their own pace. The aim {{of the study was}} partly to analyse reading behaviour on the Internet, partly to understand some of the underlying rationale and motivation of the behaviour. To achieve this aim, we used a combination of three methods: (i) eye tracking, (ii) retrospective verbal protocols supported by the replay of the interaction and (iii) interview data. In our analysis, we focus both on the readers' actual interaction with <b>net</b> <b>papers</b> (their reading paths, entry points, scanning and reading activities, orienting and navigating) and on their reflections, experiences, comments and attitudes towards the new medium...|$|R
40|$|During 1994 278 {{million tons}} of paper were {{produced}} worldwide, while around 330 million tons were produced in 2002. The forecast for <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> in 2010 is 420 million tons. From these data, it may be concluded that the <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> industry, which exists for around 2000 years, {{is still a very}} attractive industrial branch. This work represents the conditions in the production of the major and auxiliary raw materials for <b>paper</b> <b>production,</b> as well as <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> in the World and production forecasts until 2010. It was indicated that the fraction of secondary fibers obtained from recycled paper increases every year in regard primary fibers. In 2010 secondary fibers will be the major source of primary raw materials for <b>paper</b> <b>production</b> in the World. It was pointed out that in the last fifteen years the quantity of paper produced during one season grew rapidly. This growth was achieved by advance stock preparation of paper and increased velocity of the paper machine and the width web of the produced paper.

40|$|Modelling {{technical}} systems nowadays is a {{great challenge}} of automation technology. Particular complex manufacturing processes, like the industrial <b>paper</b> <b>production,</b> consists of discrete and continuous signals and dynamic response times. Inspired by Petri <b>nets,</b> this <b>paper</b> proposes a new modelling approach is presented to describe those technical systems on different abstraction layer. The hybrid process net simulator (HPNS) framework allows to specify complex models, typically represented as a system of differential equations mixed with continuous and discrete-event subsystems, based on a bipartite graph structure. In addition, the HPNS execute model specifications with dynamic delays. This paper focuses on the concept and the modelling approach. We give a short review of this new unified representation model for hybrid technical systems, {{the presentation of the}} model formalism is out of scope of this paper. A short summary about capabilities and restrictions of HPNS is presented. Moreover, examples of hybrid systems are presented. ...|$|R
