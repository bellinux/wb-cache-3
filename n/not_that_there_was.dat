2500|$|Though the Supreme Court did not {{explicitly}} decide whether Benitez met the proper standard, its opinion nonetheless proceeded with an unfavorable analysis of his case. [...] The Court believed that his {{statements in the}} record showed {{that he may have}} been confused about the substantive law of the safety valve provision, but <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "causal link" [...] between his confusion and the Rule 11 violation. [...] The strength of the government's case was also a factor, and the Court did not think that the proper Rule 11 warning would have changed his [...] "assessment of his strategic position." [...] This was especially true because the written plea agreement included the warning that it would be irrevocable, and it had been read to him in Spanish. [...] The Court accordingly reversed the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case.|$|E

60|$|I {{picked up}} the paper for fear of axdents, and brot it to my lord. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any necessaty; for he'd kep a copy, and made me and another witniss (my Lady Griffin's solissator) read them both, before he sent either away.|$|E
6000|$|... [A] I mean by {{contiguous}} particles {{those which}} are next to each other, [...] <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no space between them. See (1616.).|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{are lots}} and lots,' said Dolores. 'They are ever {{so much worse}} than the stepmothers! <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any fear of that!' she added quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am tired, but it isn't that. It seems <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> so much {{to think}} about. I'll tell you {{everything}} to-morrow, when I get quiet again. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> much to tell." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} afternoon {{witnessed the}} greatest crowd Timothy's {{had known for}} many a year. On national occasions, such as this, it was, indeed, almost impossible to avoid going there. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any danger or rather only just {{enough to make it}} necessary to assure each other that there was none.|$|E
60|$|It appeared, while Miss Triscoe {{was shaking}} hands with March, that it was last night, and her father was {{finishing}} his breakfast, {{and it was one}} of the hotels on the hill. On the way back to her father it appeared that he wished to consult March's doctor; <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bravo, lad!" [...] Captain Dave said. [...] "I knew <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{an estate}} in the case, though I did hear {{that you were the}} son of a Royalist. It is a worthy ambition, boy, though if it is a large one 'tis scarce like that you will get enough to buy it back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not Maura? Naughty little girl, I did {{not think}} she knew {{anything}}. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anything to tell,' said Kalliope, much distressed; 'but it <b>is</b> dreadful <b>that</b> <b>there</b> should <b>be</b> such talk.' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{must now}} request our reader to {{accompany}} {{us to the}} little town of Mohill; <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anything attractive in the place to repay him for the trouble of going there.|$|R

6000|$|Mr Auberly became {{suddenly}} {{much interested}} in the fairy, for just as [...] "love begets love," [...] so does interest beget interest. His feelings having been roused, his tongue was loosed, and forthwith he enjoyed a delightful conversation with the intelligent child; <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any remarkable change as to the matter of what was spoken, {{but there was a}} vast change in the manner of speaking it.|$|E
60|$|<b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{any chance}} of meeting Vera. Mr. and Mrs. White {{had spent the last}} summer at Baden; and Vera, who had many pretty little drawing-room talents, and was always obliging, had been very {{acceptable}} there. This winter an attack of rheumatism had made them decide on trying Algiers, with a view to the Atlas marbles, and then German baths again might claim them for the summer.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a retired}} and {{pleasant}} route, without houses or travellers, except some {{young men who}} were lounging upon a bridge in Chelmsford, who leaned impudently over the rails to pry into our concerns, but we {{caught the eye of}} the most forward, and looked at him till he was visibly discomfited. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any peculiar efficacy in our look, but rather a sense of shame left in him which disarmed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{much chance}} of such a thing," [...] Van Voorden said; [...] "I was but {{mentioning}} the complication that might arise if Ghent is able to prolong the struggle." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We saw {{no sign of}} them. We {{came through}} the Addoo Bush, {{which is the most}} {{dangerous}} point, at a trot. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much chance of their attacking us. The natives seldom attack unless {{there is something to be}} got by it; but we shall have to be careful as we go back. We shall be a fairly strong party, but others as strong have been attacked; and the fact of our having ammunition--the thing of all others they want--is, of course, against us." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{called to}} Hans {{and leaving the}} rest in the {{graveyard}} where we {{knew that they were}} safe, we went down {{to the edge of the}} water to study the situation, being careful to keep ourselves hidden behind the reeds and bushes of the mangrove tribe with which it was fringed. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much fear of our being seen, for the day, which had been very hot, was closing in and a great storm, heralded by black and bellying clouds, was gathering fast, conditions which must render us practically invisible at a distance.|$|E
60|$|Now, I knew <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{anything}} in my own appearance calculated to disarm ridicule; and indeed, to have looked at all heroic, under the circumstances, would have been rather difficult. Still, I could not but feel exceedingly annoyed {{at the prospect of}} being screamed at, in turn, by this mischievous young witch, even though she were but an islander. And, to tell a secret, her beauty {{had something to do with}} this sort of feeling; and, pinioned as I was to a log, and clad most unbecomingly, I began to grow sentimental.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no doubt}} about it. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a fight going on seven or eight miles away. We should hear the sound more plainly <b>were</b> it <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{headland}} between us and the vessels engaged." ...|$|R
50|$|These {{recommendations}} were accepted in principle by the UK Government. <b>Noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> “no obvious focus for an informed public debate {{of the type}} suggested by the Task Force”, the UK government's response was to accept the recommendations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{that she}} might <b>be</b> more {{comfortable}} <b>there.</b> But read what she says. You need not read the first part. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any secret; but it is about him and his last moments, and it would only pain you." ...|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{had grown}} up a quiet and {{somewhat}} serious girl; she had blossomed out into prettiness in the old mill, and folks in the village were divided as to whether she or Lucy Carey, the smith's daughter, was the prettiest girl in Carnesford. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any other matter in comparison between them, for Lucy was somewhat gay and flirty, and had a dozen avowed admirers; while Ruth had from her childhood {{made no secret of}} her preference for George Forester, the son of the little farmer whose land came down to the Dare just where Hiram Powlett's mill stood.|$|E
60|$|Complications did not cease {{with this}} resolve. Indeed, they became more acute. It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any {{difficulty}} about finding an instructor. The papers {{were full of}} their advertisements. He selected a Mme Gavarni because {{she lived in a}} convenient spot. Her house was in a side street, with a station within easy reach. The real problem was when to find time for the lessons. His life was run on such a regular schedule that he could hardly alter so important a moment in it as the hour of his arrival home without exciting comment. Only deceit could provide a solution.|$|E
6000|$|I know I have {{something}} else to say to you, but unfortunately I awoke this morning with collywobbles, and {{had to take a}} small dose of laudanum with the usual consequences of dry throat, intoxicated legs, partial madness and total imbecility; and {{for the life of me}} I cannot remember what it is. I have likewise mislaid your letter amongst the accumulations on my table, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything in it. [...] Altogether I am in a poor state. I forgot to tell Baxter that the dummy had turned up and is a fine, personable- looking volume and very good reading. Please communicate this to him.|$|E
30|$|The {{expectation}} of generalized reciprocity also underlines {{much of the}} nature of open-source participation. The expectation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a mapping between contributor and beneficiary, but that at some point the contributor will benefit from the work of someone else in the community [16, 22].|$|R
6000|$|By and by he {{came out}} of the forest {{altogether}} and unto a considerable village where were many houses thatched with straw. And Percival said to himself: [...] "Ha! how great is the world; I knew <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> so many people in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never knew}} it till the choral festival. I {{used to be}} very fond of her, but-- I'm sure it is jealousy; I don't {{like to see her}} more eagerly {{attended}} to than myself. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anything to complain of. He never neglected me in his life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{talked of}} young Mr Percy's [...] "goings-on," [...] of the august Mr Marvell, {{of life at}} No. 2. [...] "That Miss Bowater, now, she's a bit of all right, she's toffee, she is." [...] But, his hat! {{there had been a}} row. And the captain, too. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{anything}} in that; [...] "just a bit of silly jealousy; like the women!" [...] He could make a better guess than that. He didn't know what [...] "the old lady" [...] would do without that Miss Bowater--the old lady whose carriage would in a few days be rolling in between these very gates. And then--he began whistling a Highland Reel.|$|E
60|$|His head hung so low {{between his}} heavy {{shoulders}} that {{it reminded me}} of a flower stooping for want of water. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything limp or fragile or gentle in his looks. He was, far rather, clumsy and ugly in appearance, yet with a grace in his look like that of an old, haggled thorn-tree when the wind moves its branches. And anyhow, he was come to be my friend--out of the unknown. And when I looked around at the serene wild loveliness of the garden, it seemed to be no less happy a place because it was no longer quite a solitude.|$|E
60|$|The family {{appeared}} {{all well}} {{pleased with the}} unexpected appearance of an old friend. Simon Glover shook his hand again and again, Dorothy made her compliments, and Catharine herself offered freely her hand, which Henry held in his massive grasp, as if he designed to carry it to his lips, but, after a moment's hesitation, desisted, from fear lest the freedom might be ill taken. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any resistance {{on the part of}} the little hand which lay passive in his grasp; but there was a smile mingled with the blush on her cheek, which seemed to increase the confusion of the gallant.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{controversial}} claim {{in the book is}} that natural resources are infinite. Simon argues <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an infinite physical amount of, say, copper, but for human purposes that amount should be treated as infinite because it is not [...] or limited in any economic sense, because: ...|$|R

'Know you <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> friendship between the court {{party and the}} Huguenots, and that the peace is to be sealed by the marriage of the King's sister with the King of Navarre? This is the most suitable time at which he could go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Bessie," [...] {{he broke}} in, [...] "why {{do you suppose}} such things?
