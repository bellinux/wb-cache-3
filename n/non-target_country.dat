40|$|Central banks {{adopt an}} {{inflation}} targeting policy {{with a goal}} to anchor inflation expectations. We argue that the expectations anchoring test developed {{in the context of}} the Krugman (1991) exchange rate targeting model is well-suited for inflation targeting applications. The test quantifies nonlinearity between realized and expected inflation for very high and very low inflation levels. It does not require comparison with the control group of <b>non-targeting</b> <b>countries,</b> avoiding critique of the benchmark approach. We test inflation targetin...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{estimates}} the treatment effect of inflation targeting adoption on inflation, inflation variability, output, and output variability for 25 explicit inflation targeting countries. I implement the propensity score matching methodology {{that takes into}} account the problems of non-experimental nature, such as selection bias or selection on observable, and allows me to effectively mimic properties of randomized experiment and compute unbiased treatment effect estimates. I introduce a variety of propensity score matching methods that were recently developed in the treatment effect literature, including Nearest Neighbor, Radius matching, Kernel matching, and Inverse Probability Weighting. The results indicate that both industrial and developing inflation targeting countries exhibit lower inflation levels {{and at the same time}} higher output growth than <b>non-targeting</b> <b>countries.</b> The estimates are however in most cases statistically insignificant. Moreover, it appears that both industrial and developing countries achieve combination of lower inflation variability and output variability compared to <b>non-targeting</b> <b>countries.</b> Nonetheless, majority of the estimates are again statistically insignificant. The results are to a small extent sensitive to the choice of propensity score matching method. Radius matching with tight calipers (r= 0. 005, r= 0. 001) tends to provide the most reliable estimates. Balancing properties of the models are reasonable and compared to the previous research the standardised biases are quantitatively better...|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{inflation}} is important. The 2008 - 2009 global financial crisis created new {{concerns about the}} macroeconomic effects of inflation targeting. A key issue for many central banks {{in recent years has}} been that {{inflation is}} uncomfortably too low rather than too high. This thesis examines the impact of inflation targeting on the behaviour of inflation, output growth and real exchange rates for eight Asian countries using time-series and panel data from 1987 to 2013. The econometric methodologies employed include panel GARCH, quantile unit root and Markov regime-switching testing. Panel GARCH results indicate that inflation targeting is more credible in lowering the inflation level rather than its volatility. The quantile unit root testing results indicate that the credibility of inflation targeting and alternative monetary policy frameworks in Asia are imperfect, except for Malaysia and South Korea. Results also suggest that targeting countries have been building up their monetary policy credibility more than <b>non-targeting</b> <b>countries,</b> based on a faster rate of decline in inflation rate changes. Results generally indicate the presence of mean-reversion at the lower quantiles only. Where stationarity is present, results indicate varied speed of adjustment process across quantiles. The regime-switching results indicate that inflation and output growth are generally characterized by partial stationarity, while there is mostly varied stationarity in real exchange rates. Results also indicate that inflation targeting significantly affects the inferred probabilities of remaining in the stationary regime, mainly for output growth and real exchange rates and for inflation in some cases. Results further indicate that the variance of inflation and output growth is lower during the inflation targeting period. Furthermore, results indicate that there is a significant difference between targeting and <b>non-targeting</b> <b>countries</b> in terms of the speed of adjustment of macroeconomic variables towards the equilibrium level and the behaviour of inferred probabilities of remaining in the stationary regime...|$|R
40|$|We utilize a {{stochastic}} volatility {{model to}} analyse the possible effects of inflation targeting on the trade-off between output gap variability and inflation variability. We {{find that the}} adoption of inflation targets (in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the UK, Sweden and Finland) might result in a more favourable monetary policy trade-off (except in Australia and Finland). This conclusion is reached by comparing, first, the economic performance of targeting countries in the 1980 s and the 1990 s; and second, the economic performance in the 1990 s of targeting and <b>non-targeting</b> <b>countries</b> (the USA, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands). We focus on two possible explanations {{for the performance of}} the inflation-targeting regime: the relatively high degree of monetary policy transparency, and the presence of a flexible institutional framework...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the inflation targeting experience {{of developing countries}} as an effective monetary policy framework to promote changes in the currency composition of their international debt. Using matching with difference-in-differences to address the self-selection bias, we find that in inflation targeting {{has led to a}} 3 - 6 percentage point reduction in the foreign currency share of international debt in targeting countries when compared to <b>non-targeting</b> <b>countries.</b> Furthermore, from the analysis of the individual currency shares, we find that inflation targeting has contributed to a 10 percentage points lower US dollar share in international debt in targeting <b>countries</b> compared to <b>non-targeting</b> countries; while the effects on the euro and other foreign currencies shares are negligible. This not only provides evidence that the structural features of international financial markets matter, but also that monetary policy can help developing countries reduce their reliance on foreign currency debt...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} modeling framework – IMPACT – which integrates partial equilibrium economic model, hydrology model, crop {{simulation model}} and climate model {{was used to}} examine the ex-ante economic impact of developing and disseminating a drought tolerant sorghum cultivar in target countries of Africa and Asia. The impact of drought tolerant sorghum technology on production, consumption, trade flow and prices of sorghum in target and <b>non-target</b> <b>countries</b> were analyzed. And also we estimated the returns to research investment for developing the promising new drought tolerant cultivars and dissemination in the target countries. The analysis indicates that development and release of drought tolerant sorghum in the target countries of Asia and Africa would provide a net economic benefit of about 1476. 8 million US for the entire world under no climate change condition. Under climate change scenarios the net benefits derived from adoption of new drought tolerant sorghum cultivar is higher than the no climate change condition. This is due to higher production realized by sorghum under climate change scenarios. The results imply that substantial economic benefits can be achieved from the development of a drought tolerant sorghum cultivar. And also this technology will perform better than the existing cultivars in future climate change condition...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{anti-dumping}} (AD) duties levied by the European Commission against products from ASEAN {{countries in the}} period 1991 - 2001 have been considered. The ASEAN countries were among the countries most targeted by AD measures imposed by the EU in the 1990 s. A panel regression {{has been applied to}} estimate the impact of AD duties on trade in some 12 products that have been subject to AD duties targeting ASEAN countries in the period considered. A significant negative impact of AD duties is found, on both the value and the quantity of imports from ASEAN countries. Our estimation provides some (although not overwhelming) indications of trade diversion in favor of EU countries, but no evidence of trade diversion in favor of <b>non-targeted</b> non-EU <b>countries.</b> Copyright 2005 East Asian Economic Association. ...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary Draft: {{please do}} not quote or cite This paper {{examines}} the international externalities associated with US use of antidumping (AD) measures, matching up US AD duties with Japanese exports to the US and EU over the 1992 - 2001 period. We first examine the trade destruction and trade diversion associated with Japanese exports to the US market resulting from US AD duties. We then investigate whether US ADDs impose externalities on <b>non-targeted</b> third <b>countries</b> by examining {{the effect of these}} US policies on Japanese exports to the EU. We document sizable trade deflection and trade depression in the EU market resulting from US ADDs. Finally, we present evidence that US ADDs impose terms-of-trade externalities on non-targeted markets. We find that US duties on Japanese exports are associated with substantially lower Japanese export prices in the EU market. JEL No. F 1...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years of}} {{inflation}} targeting worldwide provide valuable lessons. Inflation targeters (ITers) {{have been very}} successful in meeting their inflation targets (ITs). Industrial output sacrifice during inflation stabilization and industrial output volatility has frequently been lowered after IT adoption. ITers have consistently reduced inflation forecast errors after IT adoption. The influence of price and output shocks {{on the behavior of}} inflation and output gaps has changed much more strongly among ITers than in <b>non-targeting</b> industrial <b>countries</b> {{in the course of the}} 1990 s. IT has played a role in strengthening the effect of forward-looking expectations on inflation, hence weakening the weight of past inflation inertia. Central bankersÂ’ aversion to inflation is on average not different among ITers in comparison to NITers but has risen in emerging-country ITers. ITers have gradually reaped a credibility gain, allowing them to achieve their targets with smaller changes in interest rates in the late 1990 s than the changes that were required in the early 1990 s. ...|$|R

40|$|Aggregate shocks {{that move}} output and {{inflation}} {{in opposite directions}} create a tradeoff between output and inflation variability, forcing central bankers to make a choice. Differences {{in the degree of}} accommodation of shocks lead to disparate variability outcomes, revealing national central banker's relative weight on output and inflation variability in their preferences. We use estimates of the structure of 23 industrialized and developing economies, including 9 that target inflation explicitly, together with the realized output and inflation patterns in those countries, to infer the degree of policymakers' inflation variability aversion. Our results suggest that both countries that introduced inflation targeting, and <b>non-targeting</b> European Union <b>countries</b> approaching monetary union, increased their revealed aversion to inflation variability, and likely suffered most increases in output volatility as a result. ...|$|R
