25|$|WOWO (1190 kHz) is an {{independent}} news/talk radio station owned by Pathfinder Communications Corporation. Its studios are located along Maples Road in Fort Wayne, Indiana, while its transmitter and its three towers are located along U.S. Highway 24 in Roanoke, midway between Fort Wayne and Huntington. It transmits with 50,000 watts during daytime using a <b>non-directional</b> <b>antenna,</b> and with 9,800 watts during nighttime using a three-tower directional antenna.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unique}} from most AM radio {{stations}} in the US as it broadcast with a directional antenna daytime, <b>non-directional</b> <b>antenna</b> night time.|$|E
50|$|The station transmits at 5,000 watts daytime, {{and is thus}} listenable {{throughout}} much of the Phoenix metro area. It has a single-tower, <b>non-directional</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} research was to quantify the effects of fuel fire and the follow-on fire extinguishing actions on wireless shipboard communications in the 2. 4 GHz ISM band. Directional and <b>non-directional</b> <b>antennas</b> with horizontal and vertical polarization, and a PC-controlled scalar network analyzer, were used onboard ex-USS SHADEWELL to measure the attenuation of 2. 4 - 2. 485 GHz signals transmitted through diesel and heptane fire, water mist created by the fire extinguishing system, and subsequently developed steam. A MATLAB code has been used to analyze the data statistically. The attenuation for directional antennas exhibits relatively small variations wit time and frequency, but fire and the follow-on fire-extinguishing phases create sever non-stationary frequency selective fading for <b>non-directional</b> <b>antennas.</b> Therefor standard communication techniques effective against frequency selective fading (non stationary but slowly varying with time) are recommended for use with communication systems intended for shipboard indoors use. Even in normal conditions, without fire, water mist, or steam, we have determined that frequency selective fading would be problem for <b>non-directional</b> <b>antennas</b> used in shipboard compartments and thus a system with anti-fading ca ability should be considered for ship board use[URL] Hellenic Nav...|$|R
50|$|The station {{signed on}} in 1946 as KTYL on 1490 kHz, {{owned by the}} Harkins Theater group. It was the second station in Mesa, signing on 3 days after KARV (1400 AM). Both {{stations}} ran 250 watts full-time with <b>non-directional</b> <b>antennas</b> — the maximum power allowed for Class IV (now Class C) stations at the time. Two years later, KTYL bought and shut down KARV; its frequency was reactivated in Phoenix in 1950 as KONI (now KSUN).|$|R

5000|$|For most {{microwave}} systems, {{a completely}} <b>non-directional</b> isotropic <b>antenna</b> (one which radiates equally and perfectly well {{in every direction}} [...] - [...] a physical impossibility) {{is used as a}} reference antenna, and then one speaks of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power) rather than ERP.

50|$|ADF {{equipment}} {{determines the}} direction or bearing to the NDB station {{relative to the}} aircraft by {{using a combination of}} directional and <b>non-directional</b> <b>antennae</b> to sense the direction in which the combined signal is strongest. This bearing may be displayed on a relative bearing indicator (RBI). This display looks like a compass card with a needle superimposed, except that the card is fixed with the 0 degree position corresponding to the centreline of the aircraft. In order to track toward an NDB (with no wind) the aircraft is flown so that the needle points to the 0 degree position, the aircraft will then fly directly to the NDB. Similarly, the aircraft will track directly away from the NDB if the needle is maintained on the 180 degree mark. With a crosswind, the needle must be maintained to the left or right of the 0 or 180 position by an amount corresponding to the drift due to the crosswind. (Aircraft Heading +/- ADF needle degrees off nose or tail = Bearing to or from NDB station).|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} the Transformational Communications System depends on {{providing}} high quality communications to the mobile user in any environment. A hurdle to this success is the urban Land Mobile Satellite Channel which experiences frequent and extended deep signal fades due to shadowing by man-made structures. The problem is exacerbated for the Communications-on-the-Move channel due to use of a directional antenna. This dissertation evaluates available empirical test data, develops an improved channel model and investigates mitigation strategies focused on improving channel throughput and latency. The improved channel model is developed using continuous transmission mixed-Gaussian hidden Markov models and Expectation-Maximization parameter estimation. The improved model provides a better match to empirical data than previous efforts. Two fade mitigation strategies are examined. The first strategy involves modification of packet routing protocols. A detailed, time-based network simulation is developed for performance assessment. Results show substantial reductions in packet latency under {{a broad range of}} conditions. The second mitigation strategy is based on fade prediction using real-time adaptive linear filters. Signal inputs from directional and <b>non-directional</b> <b>antennas</b> are investigated. Initial results indicate a requirement for a high temporal resolution input signal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A novel multitarget {{tracking}} {{scheme for}} passive radar, using a particle filter implementation of Ronald Mahler’s Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD), is presented. Using range and velocity measurements {{from a simple}} <b>non-directional</b> receive <b>antenna</b> and low frequency transmitter pair, a target can be located along an ellipse. To pinpoint a target, multiple such antenna pairs are needed to locate the target {{at the intersection of}} the corresponding ellipses. Determining the intersection of these bistatic range ellipses, and resolving the resultant ghost targets, is generally a complex task. However, the PHD is found to provide a convenient and simple means of fusing together the multiple range and velocity measurements into coherent target tracks. I...|$|R
5000|$|WJOH is a {{non-commercial}} Contemporary Christian FM {{radio station}} {{which is part}} of the Smile FM radio network. In July 2006, it began broadcasting from Raco just west of Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan. WJOH operates from a 328' tower with 5.5 kW with a <b>non-directional</b> 4 bay <b>antenna</b> made by Ed Czelada, founder of Smile FM, from 1½" [...] copper pipe.

50|$|During daytime hours, KGOW transmits {{from near}} Rosharon, TX, SSW of Houston, with 46,000 watts. At night, KGOW transmits from near Cypress-Katy, TX, NW of Houston, with 15,000 watts. The highly {{directive}} nature {{of both the}} daytime antenna array (six towers, with high efficiency) and the nighttime antenna array (nine towers, with standard efficiency) means that the apparent power towards Houston is greatly {{in excess of the}} licensed power, about the equivalent of 857,000 watts days and 197,000 watts nights (when compared to the 1,000 watt <b>non-directional</b> reference <b>antenna</b> for this class of station, Class B). This effect is shared by a number of other Class B stations in the Houston market. Houston has no allocated Class A stations (the only Class A stations in Texas are allocated to Dallas, KRLD, 1080 kHz; Fort Worth, WBAP, 820 kHz; and San Antonio, WOAI, 1200 kHz).|$|R
