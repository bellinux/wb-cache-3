5|$|Importation or {{classical}} {{biological control}} involves {{the introduction of}} a pest's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally.

The scientific consensus of biologists determines what is considered acceptable science, not popular opinion or fairness, and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among experts in the field.|$|E

5|$|The {{degree to}} which the {{character}} of Alice can be identified as Alice Liddell is controversial. Some critics identify the character as Liddell, or write that she inspired the character. Others argue that Carroll considered his protagonist and Liddell to be separate. According to Carroll, his character was <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> any real child, but was entirely fictional.|$|E

5|$|A common {{subdivision}} system of E. coli, but <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, {{which is based}} on major surface antigens (O antigen: part of lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7). It is, however, common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known. The common laboratory strain has a mutation that prevents the formation of an O-antigen and is thus not typeable.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and emotional attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders. These beliefs are also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as attachment therapy (<b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> attachment theory), which purport to bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E

5|$|Cathedral {{officials}} also described {{the use of}} guns in a city which has a gun crime problem as irresponsible. The Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend Nigel McCulloch, stated that it was well known that Manchester had a gun crime problem, {{and that it was}} beyond belief that a global manufacturer would re-create one of their Cathedrals with photo-realistic quality. Insomniac, the game's developer, declined to comment, referring all inquires to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe issued a statement, stating that they were aware of the concerns expressed by the Bishop of Manchester and the Cathedral authorities, and take them seriously. However, they added that Resistance: Fall of Man is a fantasy science fiction game and <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> reality and that they believed they had sought and received all permissions necessary. Sony also stated that it would be contacting the Cathedral on 11 June 2007 to understand their concerns in more detail. David Wilson, a Sony spokesman, told The Times that it was game-created footage, and not video or photography. Further, he compared it to science fiction shows such as Doctor Who, claiming that it was <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> reality at all.|$|E
5|$|Ganesha was {{depicted}} as a householder married to Riddhi and Siddhi {{and the father of}} Santoshi Ma (Devanagari: संतोषी माँ), a new goddess of satisfaction, in the 1975 Hindi film Jai Santoshi Maa. The movie script is <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> scriptural sources. The fact that a cult has developed around the figure of Santoshi Ma has been cited by Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen as evidence of Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.|$|E
5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated that the game was <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary. They later added that the game was purely entertainment and fictional, comparing it to the television programme Doctor Who. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair commented that though companies should have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns {{were found to be}} without merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating that they did not intend to cause offence.|$|E
5|$|Investigation of shipwrecks in {{vicinity}} of Pedra Branca. Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator, {{and under the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à titre de souverain. The circumstances of the particular investigations also meant that Singapore's ability to carry them out was <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> its sovereignty over the island.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} propaganda of the Goan priests and the alliance of the Christians with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara. The main political reason for this decision was Tipu's belief that if he banished the Christians, he could keep the British at bay. However, Alan Machado Prabhu dismisses the idea of large-scale Christian support for the British during the Second Mangalore War as a myth which is <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> any concrete evidence.|$|E

5|$|The {{cost of the}} Senedd {{increased}} from £12M in 1997 to £69.6M in 2006, an increase of 580%. In a report published in March 2008 by the Wales Audit Office, {{the reason for the}} difference between the two costs were that the original estimate of £12M was <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> any detailed design of the final requirements of the building. Extra costs of the building were due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks in the United States.|$|E

More sequels to The Medico of Painted Springs were planned for production, but were never greenlit after the dismal box office performance of the two released sequels.
