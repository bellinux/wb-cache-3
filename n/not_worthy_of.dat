5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 Norway {{entered into a}} personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited, but <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson and directed by Milan Cheylov. It featured the first appearance of de Ravin, who was cast as Belle in November 2011 after being approached by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Espenson created a love-themed episode; initially its main theme was to focus on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love, but {{during the writing process}} Espenson decided to make him instead believe that he was <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> love at all.|$|E

5|$|The third error {{enumerated}} by Peter the Venerable {{was that}} the Petrobrusians “command the sacred crosses to be broken in pieces and burned, because that form or instrument by which Christ was so dreadfully tortured, so cruelly slain, is <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> any adoration, or veneration or supplication, but for the avenging of his torments and death it should be treated with unseemly dishonor, cut in pieces with swords, burnt in fire.” This {{was seen as an}} iconoclastic heresy and as acts of sacrilege by the medieval Church, as well as by Catholics to this day.|$|E
5|$|At the NFL Combine, Cody {{weighed in}} at , {{making him the}} {{heaviest}} combine participant since Aaron Gibson in 1999. He had managed to shed some weight since the Senior Bowl, but according to Mike Mayock he was still <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> a first-round pick. Cody ran a 5.62 sec 40-yard dash, the slowest by an eventually drafted defensive tackle since Corey Swinson, a seventh round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft. Cody was selected in the 2nd round (57th overall) by the Baltimore Ravens. He was the highest picked Alabama Crimson Tide defensive tackle since Cornelius Griffin was drafted 42nd overall by the New York Giants in the 2000 NFL Draft.|$|E

25|$|The souls {{on account}} of {{accumulation}} of meritorious karmas reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit karmas are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or hells depending on their karmas. As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> worship.|$|E
25|$|While UFOs {{have been}} the subject of {{extensive}} investigation by various governments and although a few scientists have supported the extraterrestrial hypothesis, almost no scientific papers about UFOs have been published in peer-reviewed journals. There was, in the past, some debate in the scientific community about whether any scientific investigation into UFO sightings is warranted with the general conclusion being that the phenomenon was <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> serious investigation except as a cultural artifact.|$|E
25|$|All glory {{is due to}} God alone since {{salvation}} {{is accomplished}} solely through his will and action—not only {{the gift of the}} all-sufficient atonement of Jesus on the cross but also the gift of faith in that atonement, created {{in the heart of the}} believer by the Holy Spirit. The reformers believed that human beings—even saints canonized by the Catholic Church, the popes, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy—are <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> the glory.|$|E

50|$|Moreover, the {{judgement}} {{raises the}} question which result a trade-off between Google’s freedom of expression and commercial freedom and another person’s right of personality would have in other scenarios. Depending on the specific circumstances, it could be more complicated to assess if a prediction is false or (even) true, but <b>not</b> <b>worthier</b> <b>of</b> protection than the right of personality (e.g. in {{a case in which}} an investigation for a crime - like fraud - already started or in which a person is actually the victim of a crime).|$|R
25|$|A {{large part}} of Ghalib's poetry focuses on the praise and veneration of Prophet Muhammad, which shows that Ghalib was a devout Muslim. Ghalib wrote his Abr-i gauharbar (The Jewel-carrying Cloud) in honor of Prophet Muhammad. Ghalib also wrote a qasida of 101 verses in {{dedication}} to the Prophet. Ghalib {{described himself as a}} sinner who should be silent before the Prophet as he was <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> addressing the Prophet, who was praised by God.|$|E
25|$|The Buddha then elaborates {{that if any}} of the caste {{does the}} {{following}} deeds: killing, taking anything that is not given, take part in sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, speaking rough words or nonsense, greedy, cruel, and practise wrong beliefs (miccha ditthi); people would still see that they do negative deeds and therefore are <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> respect.

25|$|Although {{the rumor}} has long persisted that {{the bodies were}} taken to Dachau and burned there, they were {{actually}} incinerated in a crematorium in Munich, and the ashes scattered over the river Isar. The French judges suggested that the military condemned (Göring, Keitel and Jodl) be shot by a firing squad, as is standard for military courts-martial, but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges, who argued that the military officers had violated their military ethos and were <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> death by being shot, which {{was considered to be}} more dignified. The prisoners sentenced to incarceration were transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947.|$|E

25|$|Good Samaritan {{provisions}} are not universal in application. The legal principle of imminent peril may also apply. In {{the absence of}} imminent peril, {{the actions of a}} rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless and <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> protection. To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, but there is no fire, no immediate life threat from injuries and no danger of a second collision. If someone, with good intentions, causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage, a court may rule that good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} the forces ranged against L.Ron Hubbard, {{in this war}} he never started, {{it is necessary to}} gain a cursory glimpse of the old and venerable science of psychiatry-which was actually none of the aforementioned. As an institution, it dates back to shortly {{before the turn of the}} century; it is certainly <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> respect by reason of age or dignity; and it does not meet any known definition of a science, what with its hodgepodge of unproven theories that have never produced any result-except an ability to make the unmanageable and mutinous more docile and quiet, and turn the troubled into apathetic souls beyond the point of caring. That it promotes itself as a healing profession is a misrepresentation. Its mission is to control.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the Trotskyists were {{expelled}} from the Socialist Party, an action {{which led to the}} formation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) at the end of the year. Inside the SWP, Burnham allied with Max Shachtman in a faction fight over the position of the SWP's majority faction, led by James P. Cannon and backed by Leon Trotsky, defending the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers state against the incursions of imperialism. Shachtman and Burnham, especially after witnessing the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939 and the invasions of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia by Joseph Stalin's regime, as well as the Soviet invasion of Finland in November 1939, came to contend that the USSR was a new form of imperialistic class society and was thus <b>not</b> <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> even critical support from the socialist movement.|$|E
