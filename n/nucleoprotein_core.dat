50|$|Coccolithoviruses {{are part}} of the family of Phycodnaviridae, one of the five {{families}} that belong to a large and phylogenetically diverse group of viruses known as nucleocytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses (NCLDVs). These viruses either replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of the host cell or start their life cycle in the host nucleus but complete it in the cytoplasm. In the case of EhV-86 the infection strategy is not fully understood but Mackinder et al. (2009) have proposed the following model: The virus enters the host cell via endocytosis, followed by fusion of its lipid membrane with the host vacuole membrane and the release of its <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> into the cytoplasm. Alternatively the virus membrane could fuse directly with the host plasma membrane. The virus genome is then released from the capsid into the nucleus, where it is replicated by the viral DNA polymerase. The replicated genome is packed into assembled capsids in the cytoplasm and the newly formed (up to 400-1000) virions are thought to be transported to the plasma membrane and released by a controlled budding mechanism, which leads to the cellular breakdown of the host cell.|$|E
50|$|The virus encodes enzymes {{required}} for replication and transcription of its genome, including {{elements of a}} base excision repair system, structural proteins, and many proteins that are not essential for replication in cells, but instead have roles in virus survival and transmission in its hosts. Virus replication takes place in perinuclear factory areas. It is a highly orchestrated process with at least four stages of transcription—immediate-early, early, intermediate, and late. The majority of replication and assembly occurs in discrete, perinuclear regions of the cell called virus factories, and finally progeny virions are transported to the plasma membrane along microtubules where they bud out or are propelled away along actin projections to infect new cells. As the virus progresses through its lifecycle, {{most if not all}} of the host cell's organelles are modified, adapted, or in some cases destroyed. Assembly of the icosahedral capsid occurs on modified membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum. Products from proteolytically processed polyproteins form the core shell between the internal membrane and the <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core.</b> An additional outer membrane is gained as particles bud from the plasma membrane. The virus encodes proteins that inhibit signalling pathways in infected macrophages and thus modulate transcriptional activation of immune response genes. In addition, the virus encodes proteins which inhibit apoptosis of infected cells to facilitate production of progeny virions. Viral membrane proteins with similarity to cellular adhesion proteins modulate interaction of virus-infected cells and extracellular virions with host components.|$|E

GPHV is serologically {{related to the}} guinea pig herpes-like virus isolated by Hsiung and Kaplow. The virions of GPHV consist of an icosahedral capsid containing a dense <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> enclosed in a double-layered membrane. The average diameters of GPHV virion and capsid were 166 and 101 nm, respectively. Studies on the morphogenesis of GPHV revealed that, as in other herpesvirus infections, only the naked capsids {{with or without the}} <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> were found in the infected cell nuclei; it was also learned that the virion acquired its envelope by budding from the nuclear membrane of the infected cells. However, GPHV-infected cell nuclei also contained dense fibrous rods, resembling nucleo-protein core outside the capsids, and tubules resembling viral core protein. The capsids were often embedded in dense granular antigen. GPHV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has a density of 1. 716 g/ml in cesium chloride compared to herpes simplex virus DNA (ρ = 1. 728 g/ml) and cellular DNA (ρ = 1. 700 g/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{method for}} the {{isolation}} of intracytoplasmic A particles, the putative intracellular <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>cores</b> of mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV), is presented. Spontaneous C 3 H/He mouse mammary tumors and transplantable mouse Leydig cell tumor were used as source material. Large aggregations of intracytoplasmic A particles were separated from cellular contaminants on discontinuous sucrose gradients and subsequently further purified by isopycnic banding in linear sucrose gradients. The purified particles were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the structural proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified mouse mammary tumor virions were solubilized, and their proteins were analyzed in the same way. Comparison of co-electrophoretic gels indicated a lack of correlation in the molecular size of the major structural proteins in intracytoplasmic A particles and MTV. The three major proteins of the A particles were calculated to be 80, 000; 35, 000; and 20, 000 daltons. Five major polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bands were obtained with purified MTV; these were 90, 000; 69, 000; 55, 000; 37, 000; and 27, 500 daltons. These figures showed good correlation with those published for MTV by Nowinski et al.

40|$|Irradiation of {{purified}} {{influenza virus}} and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with long-wavelength UV {{light in the}} presence of 4 '-substituted psoralens inactivated the virion-associated RNA polymerase activity. Inactivation was apparently due to psoralen modification of the viral genome RNAs, since cations that decrease psoralen binding to nucleic acids had a protective effect, and reconstitution of VSV RNA polymerase activity was inhibited by photoreaction of <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>cores</b> but not by pretreatment of soluble fraction from dissociated virions. Partially inactivated viral particles synthesized reduced amounts of full-length RNA products in vitro without an increase in prematurely terminated transcripts. VSV leader RNA formation was relatively resistant to psoralen photoinactivation, and sequential transcription was maintained by photoreacted VSV. The all-or-none psoralen effect on virion-associated RNA polymerase activities may be due to a differential photosensitivity of promoter sites or to structural changes in modified viral genome RNAs that prevent formation of new mRNA chains...|$|R

The DNA fragments associated with the <b>core</b> <b>nucleoprotein</b> species were more than 250 to 90 bp long. Nucleoproteins containing 150, 120, or 90 bp of DNA were the most stable. Polypeptide VII was associated {{with each of the}} nucleoprotein species liberated from Ad 2 cores.

40|$|Infection of L {{cells with}} {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus {{results in the}} release, into the cell-free fluid, of four antigenic components separable by rate zonal centrifugation on sucrose gradients. The largest antigens are the infectious (B) particle and a shorter noninfectious, autointerfering (T) particle. The two small antigens are characterized by sedimentation coefficients of approximately 20 S and 6 S. Treatment of purified B or T particles with sodium deoxycholate results in the release from the particle of a <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> which can be purified on sucrose gradient and which has a sedimentation coefficient characteristic of the virus from which it arose. Utilizing purified antigens labeled with 14 C-amino acids during growth, we examined the protein constituents of each antigen by acrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The proteins of B and T particles are identical, each containing one minor (virus protein 1) and three major (virus proteins 2, 3, and 4) proteins, numbered in order of increasing mobility. Virus protein 3 originates from the <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core,</b> whereas proteins 2 and 4 come from the coat. The origin of virus protein 1 is not known.

40|$|Adenovirus protein VII is {{the major}} {{component}} of the viral <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core.</b> It is a highly basic nonspecific DNA-binding protein that condenses viral DNA inside the capsid. We have investigated the fate and function of protein VII during infection. “Input ” protein VII persisted in the nucleus throughout early phase {{and the beginning of}} DNA replication. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that input protein VII remained associated with viral DNA during this period. Two cellular proteins, SET and pp 32, also associated with viral DNA during early phase. They are components of two multiprotein complexes, the SET and INHAT complexes, implicated in chromatin-related activities. Protein VII associated with SET and pp 32 in vitro and distinct domains of protein VII were responsible for binding to the two proteins. Interestingly, protein VII was found in novel nuclear dot structures as visualized by immunofluorescence. The dots likely represent individual infectious genomes in association with protein VII. They appeared within 30 min after infection and localized in the nucleus with a peak of intensity between 4 and 10 h postinfection. After this, their intensity decreased and they disappeared between 16 and 24 h postinfection. Interestingly, disappearance of the dots required ongoing RNA synthesis but not DNA synthesis. Taken together these data indicate that protein VII has an ongoing role during early phase and the beginning of DNA replication.

Sedimentation coefficients are lowered as cleavages are introduced into the histones, showing that an unfolding of the core particle occurs. This unfolding is further characterised by a lower melting temperature together with a premelting phase, higher molar ellipticity in the circular dichroism spectra at 280 nm and increased kinetics of digestion by both micrococcal nuclease and DNase I. Differences are also observed in the products of nuclease digestion.

40|$|Micrococcal {{nuclease}} digestion of intact chicken erythrocyte nuclei {{is shown}} to result {{in the formation of}} <b>core</b> <b>nucleoprotein</b> particles containing about 140 base pairs of DNA. These core particles, which are almost entirely devoid of histones f 1 and f 2 c, are derived from transient nucleoprotein particles containing an average of approximately 180 base pairs of DNA. Oligomers of these latter particles may be isolated after brief nuclease digestion. The time course of digestion of these oligomers demonstrates the existence of "spacer" regions of more accessible DNA between core particles. Redigestion of purified monomer <b>core</b> <b>nucleoprotein</b> particles gives rise to both single-strand and double-strand DNA fragment patterns similar to those resulting from digestions of chromatin in situ. This observation indicates that the core particles we isolate are representative of nucleoprotein structures existing within the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|The {{vif gene}} of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 is absolutely required for productive infection of primary cells derived from human blood and certain immortalized T lymphoid cells, for example, H 9. Cells with this restrictive phenotype are termed nonpermissive, whereas cell lines in which vif-deficient virus can replicate efficiently are known as permissive. In this paper, we describe experiments in which virus stocks derived from single-cycle infections of strictly nonpermissive H 9 cells {{were used to determine}} the fate of vif-deficient infections. By PCR-based approaches, it was found that Vif has no significant impact on the biosynthetic capability of the virion reverse transcriptase in infected C 8166 T cells. Specifically, the initial appearance of all DNA species up to and including initiated second (plus) strands as well as the early accumulation of these replicative intermediates is equivalent for wild-type and vif-deficient infections. However, whereas these viral DNAs are stably maintained in wild-type infections and can proceed to establish proviruses, they are largely degraded by the later time points of vif-deficient infections and, as a result, are prevented from forming proviruses. Subcellular fractionation analyses indicated that the majority of viral DNA is localized to the nucleus within 2 h of infection and that the turnover of reverse transcripts that occurs in these vif-deficient infections presumably takes place in the nucleus. Given that the ultimate infection phenotype of the virions is determined during virus production, we propose that Vif is required for an aspect of virus assembly and/or maturation that endows penetrating viral <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>cores</b> with the ability to mature into functional preintegration complexes that can proceed to provirus establishment. In contrast, viruses that are produced in the absence of Vif give rise to nucleoprotein complexes that disassemble prematurely in challenged cells and fail to protect their RNA/DNA contents from nucleolytic destruction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nucleoprotein</b> {{complexes}} (<b>core</b> particles) {{released from}} simian virus 40 (SV 40) virions {{were compared with}} similar complexes (SV 40 chromatin) extracted from nuclei of infected cells. Core particles were sensitive to cleavage by DNase I {{at about the same}} enzyme concentration required to cleave SV 40 chromatin. DNase I preferentially cleaved SV 40 chromatin adjacent to the viral origin of replication; however, cleavage of core particles occurred with much less selectivity. The difference between these nucleoproteins was not due to a structural alteration induced by the virion disruption procedure, since SV 40 chromatin retained its pattern of DNase I-sensitive sites when subjected top this treatment. On the other hand, core particles did not acquire the nuclease-sensitive feature typical of SV 40 chromatin when they were exposed to infected cell nuclei and the Triton X- 100 -EDTA extraction procedure. Hence, the nuclease-sensitive feature was lost or altered during the normal process of virion assembly and maturation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Protein {{conformational}} motions play {{a critical}} role in biochemical catalysis. Through anharmonic conformational deformations during the course of its function a protein can change the chemical environment of its reactive site in order to bind substrates and catalyze reactions. An illustrative example of these changes is the opening and closing of the binding site of HIV- 1 protease (HIV Pr) that results from conformational changes in the flaps region covering the reactive site. HIV Pr is a protease which plays a vital role in the maturation of the HIV- 1 virus by targeting amino acid sequences in the gag and gag-pol polyproteins. Cleavage of these polyproteins produces proteins that contribute to the structure of the virion, RNA packaging, and condensation of the <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core.</b> Due to its large medical importance this protein has been studied extensively by experimental as well as computational methods and has been a successful target for rational drug design.

40|$|AbstractAdenovirus protein VII is {{the major}} protein {{component}} of the viral <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core.</b> It is a nonspecific DNA-binding protein that condenses viral DNA inside the capsid. Protein VII remains associated with viral chromatin throughout early phase, indicating its continuing role during infection. Here we characterize the release of protein VII from infectious genomes during a time period that corresponds to the late phase of infection. Interestingly, the early viral transactivator E 1 A, but not other early gene products, is responsible for releasing protein VII by a mechanism that requires ongoing transcription but not viral DNA replication. Moreover transcription per se, {{in the absence of}} E 1 A, is also sufficient to trigger release. Accordingly, a recombinant genome containing only non-coding “stuffer” DNA is unable to support release of protein VII.

40|$|Simian virus 40 (SV 40) virions were dissociated {{in vitro}} by {{treatment}} with ethylene glycol-bis-N-N′-tetraacetic acid and dithiothreitol. The compact nucleo-protein core released {{as a result}} of the dissociation had a sedimentation value of 110 to 115 S compared with a value of 240 S for intact virions. The viral cores contained a fraction of the viral proteins VP 1 and VP 2 in addition to the proteins found associated with the viral minichromosome, i. e., VP 3 and histones H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3, and H 4. Our results suggest that the association of VP 1, VP 2, or both with the viral minichromosome, in addition to maintaining a highly compact structure, modifies the transcriptional properties of the nucleoprotein complex. In the presence of saturating amounts of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, 95 to 100 % of the SV 40 <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>cores</b> were able to form transcriptional complexes. Sedimentation analysis of the core transcriptional complex indicated that the initiation and elongation of nascent RNA chains occurred on the compact SV 40 core. Cesium chloride density gradient analysis of the SV 40 virion core before and after transcription indicated that no substantial loss of protein occurred during the process of transcription. RNA synthesized from SV 40 cores was a fairly homogeneous 16 to 18 S species with an average chain length of approximately 2, 300 nucleotides. Hybridization analysis of this RNA indicated that specific recognition of RNA polymerase promoter sites was preserved, since transcription was asymmetric, occurring preferentially on the “early” SV 40 DNA strand. The rate of incorporation of ribonucleoside triphosphates into acid-insoluble RNA with SV 40 cores as the template was 70 to 95 % of that obtained with supercoiled SV 40 form I DNA. SV 40 minichromosomes, under identical transcription assay conditions, had an incorporation rate which was 20 % of that obtained with SV 40 form I DNA.

Lower NaCl concentrations removed ∼ 46 % of virion protein, but did not release transcriptase activity from the pellet fraction, nor could incorporation of 3 H-uridine- 5 ′-triphosphate by complete virions be increased by adding soluble transcriptase. Evidence that the virion nucleocapsid is the transcription template was provided by finding that the pellet contained predominantly virion <b>core</b> <b>nucleoprotein,</b> ribonucleic acid, and homogeneous nucleocapsid coils when viewed by electron microscopy. Removal of envelope G and M proteins by Triton and low-salt buffer without decreasing nucleocapsid polymerase activity indicates that neither G nor M protein is necessary for transcription. Additional data are required to determine whether the minor nucleocapsid proteins L or NSl, or both, which are at least partially solubilized in high-salt buffer, are the transcriptase. Preliminary data suggest that the major N nucleoprotein, which was not solubilized by high-salt buffer, is also required for transcription. Defective T virions contained at least as much transcriptase per weight as did B virions, as determined by restoration with T supernatant fluids of transcription function to B nucleocapsid template. However, the T nucleocapsid would not serve as template for B or T transcriptase, a finding which is interpreted as evidence of T template defectiveness.

Polypeptides V- 2 and V- 3 are glycopeptides associated with the virion envelope as demonstrated by the preferential incorporation of labeled glucosamine into the polypeptides and by release of the polypeptides from the intact virion by the nonionic detergent NP- 40. Polypeptide V- 1 is the protein component of the <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> of Oriboca virus as evidenced by the specific incorporation of uridine into the nucleoprotein, its release from the intact virion by NP- 40 treatment, and its separation by both rate-zonal and isopycnic density gradient centrifugation from both the intact virion and envelope components. Molecular weights have been tentatively assigned to the polypeptides by extrapolation from the structural polypeptides of Sindbis virus when both are run in the same gel. Polypeptide V- 1 has an apparent molecular weight of 20, 000 to 23, 000; V- 2, 30, 000 to 32, 000; and V- 3, 83, 000 to 85, 000...|$|E
40|$|For a {{retrovirus}} such as HIV to be infectious, {{a properly}} formed capsid is needed; however, unusually among viruses, retrovirus capsids are highly variable in structure. According to the fullerene conjecture, they {{are composed of}} hexamers and pentamers of CA protein, with a capsid’s shape varying according to how the twelve pentamers are distributed and its size depending {{on the number of}} hexamers. Hexamers have been studied in planar and tubular arrays but the predicted pentamers have not been observed. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic analyses of two in vitro-assembled capsids of Rous sarcoma virus. Both are icosahedrally symmetric: one is composed of 12 pentamers; the other, of 12 pentamers and 20 hexamers. Fitting of atomic models of the two CA domains into the reconstructions shows three distinct inter-subunit interactions. These observations substantiate the fullerene conjecture, show how pentamers are accommodated at vertices, support the inference that nucleation is a crucial morphologic determinant, and imply that electrostatic interactions govern the differential assembly of pentamers and hexamers. A retrovirus has a lipoprotein envelope lined with a layer of matrix (MA) protein, surrounding a <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> 1. In the core, the diploid RNA genome complexed wit...|$|E
40|$|We used {{a genetic}} {{strategy}} {{to isolate the}} chicken gene believed to encode the receptor for subgroup A avian leukosis and sarcoma viruses (ALSV-A). Chicken genomic DNA was transfected into monkey COS- 7 cells, and two independent primary transfectants susceptible to ALSV-A infection were identified by using ALSV-A vectors containing a hygromycin B resistance gene. A second round of transfection and selection in mouse BALB/ 3 T 3 fibroblasts again led to isolation of a transfectant susceptible to infection by ALSV-A. Plasmid DNA sequences linked to chicken DNA during the primary transfection segregated with chicken DNA in the secondary transfectant {{and served as a}} molecular tag to clone the gene conferring susceptibility. Expression of the cloned gene in mouse BALB/ 3 T 3 cells conferred susceptibility to infection by ALSV-A but not by ALSV-B. Therefore the cloned gene most probably represents the tv-a locus, the genetically defined receptor gene for ALSV-A. Retroviruses recognize and infect target cells that produce virus-specific cell surface receptors (31). The interactions between viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins and host cell surface receptors lead to fusion of virus and cell membranes, so that viral <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> particles are introduced into the host cell cytoplasm. However, these early events in th...|$|E
40|$|Virus ARV 1, {{the first}} {{member of the}} family Rudiviridae infecting hyperthermophilic archaea of the genus Acidianus, was {{isolated}} from a hot spring in Pozzuoli, Italy. The rod-shaped virions, 610 +/- 50 nm long and 22 +/- 3 nm wide, are non-enveloped and carry a helical <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core,</b> with three tail fibers protruding at each end which appear to be involved in adsorption onto the host cell surface. The virions contain two protein components, a major one of 14. 4 kDa, which is glycosylated and a minor of about 124 kDa. The linear double-stranded DNA genome yielded 24, 655 bp of sequence, including 1365 bp inverted terminal repeats. Coding is on both strands and about 40 % of the predicted genes are homologous to those of other hyperthermophilic crenarchaeal viruses, mainly rudiviruses. They include genes encoding the coat protein, two glycosyl transferases and a Holliday junction resolvase. Other assigned functions include a thymidylate synthase and three DNA-binding proteins. The genome sequence and composition differ strongly from those of the Sulfolobus rudiviruses SIRV 1 and SIRV 2, and the genome stability is very high, with no sequence variants being detected. Although the sequences of the inverted terminal repeats of the three rudiviruses are different, they all carry the motif AATTTAGGAATTTAGGAATTT near the genome ends which may constitute a signal for the Holliday junction resolvase and DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{structure}} of the <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> of adenovirus has been investigated. Using a combination of biophysical techniques and nuclease digestion I have determined that the adenovirus core, as isolated with pyridine, shares several physical properties with cellular chromatin. The most notable difference {{is the lack of}} a nucleosome repeat in the staph nuclease digestion intermediates from adenovirus cores. I have exploited this difference to study the fate of the nucleoprotein {{structure of}} adenovirus DNA early during productive infection. When nuclei from cells infected with ³²P-labeled adenovirus are digested with staph nuclease the pattern of labeled digestion intermediates more closely resembles the pattern of cellular intermediates. This result indicates that virus core proteins are replaced, early during infection, with cellular histones. The newly assembled adenovirus nucleosomes differ from the bulk of the cellular chromatin by having a shorter repeat (160 vs. 185 base pairs) and more labile linker and core regions. Experiments with inhibitors of cellular DNA synthesis indicate that adenovirus nucleosomes are assembled independently of cellular. DNA synthesis. Using the Southern blotting technique it is shown that newly synthesized adenovirus DNA is not in a nucleosome repeat late in infection. At this time of infection, however, the input adenovirus genomes persist in a nucleosome structure. The results of these experiments are discussed in terms of the template requirements for eucaryotic transcription and replication...|$|E
40|$|Viral matrix (M) {{proteins}} {{bind the}} <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> (nucleocapsid) to host membranes {{during the process}} of virus assembly by budding. Previous studies using truncated M proteins had implicated the N-terminal 50 amino acids of the vesicular stomatitis virus M protein in binding both membranes and nucleocapsids and a sequence from amino acids 75 - 106 as an additional membrane binding region. Structure-based mutations were introduced into these two regions, and their effects on membrane association and incorporation into nucleocapsid-M protein complexes were determined using quantitative assays. The results confirmed that the N terminus of M protein is involved in association with plasma membranes as well as nucleocapsids, although these two activities were differentially affected by individual mutations. Mutations in the 75 - 106 region affected incorporation into nucleocapsid-M complexes but had only minor effects on association with membranes. The ability of site-specific mutant M proteins to complement growth of temperature-sensitive M mutant virus did not correlate well with the ability to associate with membranes or nucleocapsids, suggesting that complementation involves an additional activity of M protein. Mutants with similar abilities to associate with membranes and nucleocapsids but differing in complementation activity were incorporated into infectious cDNA clones. Infectious virus was repeatedly recovered containing mutant M proteins capable of complementation but was never recovered with mutant M proteins that lacked complementation activity, providing further evidence for a separate activity of M protein that is essential for virus replication...|$|E
40|$|Adenovirus protein VII is {{the major}} protein {{component}} of the viral <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core.</b> It is highly basic, and an estimated 1070 copies associate with each viral genome, forming a tightly condensed DNA-protein complex. We have investigated DNA condensation, transcriptional repression, and specific protein binding by protein VII. Xenopus oocytes were microinjected with mRNA encoding HA-tagged protein VII and prepared for visualization of lampbrush chromosomes. Immunostaining revealed that protein VII associated {{in a uniform manner}} across entire chromosomes. Furthermore, the chromosomes were significantly condensed and transcriptionally silenced, as judged by the dramatic disappearance of transcription loops characteristic of lampbrush chromosomes. During infection, the protein VII-DNA complex may be the initial substrate for transcriptional activation by cellular factors and the viral E 1 A protein. To investigate this possibility, mRNAs encoding E 1 A and protein VII were comicroinjected into Xenopus oocytes. Interestingly, whereas E 1 A did not associate with chromosomes in the absence of protein VII, expression of both proteins together resulted in significant association of E 1 A with lampbrush chromosomes. Binding studies with proteins produced in bacteria or human cells or by in vitro translation showed that E 1 A and protein VII can interact in vitro. Structure-function analysis revealed that an N-terminal region of E 1 A is responsible for binding to protein VII. These studies define the in vivo functions of protein VII in DNA binding, condensation, and transcriptional repression and indicate a role in E 1 A-mediated transcriptional activation of viral genes...|$|E
40|$|Baculoviruses are {{invertebrate}} viruses of {{the family}} Baculoviridae. They have been isolated from more than 600 orders of arthropods with Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera {{to be the most}} well-characterized hosts. Baculoviruses are a group of large, circular dsDNA viruses with genomes of 80 to 180 Kbp. They have rod-shaped and enveloped nucleocapsids, replicate in the nucleus of infected host cells and have interesting biological and molecular properties ranging from their practical application as insecticides to their use as expression vectors. Baculovirus life cycle is characterized by a high degree of complexity, which is reflected by the two types of virion phenotypes, which are produced during Baculovirus infection: the Occlusion-Derived-Virions (ODVs) and the Budded Virions (BVs). Although ODVs and BVs are genetically identical, they are characterized by a totally different infectivity profile, which is the reflection of the differences in protein composition, distribution and localization between the ODV and the BV nucleocapsid and envelope. In this thesis, the basic biology of Baculoviruses has been overviewed and the structure and assembly of the BV has been thoroughly examined. On the basis of the available morphological, biological, genomic and phylogenetic data, we provide a more comprehensive picture of the detailed architecture and the elaborate mechanisms of morphogenesis of the nucleocapsid shell, the <b>nucleoprotein</b> <b>core</b> and the envelope of the BV and discuss the structural differences between Baculoviruses and the other large double-stranded DNA viruses of invertebrates...|$|E
