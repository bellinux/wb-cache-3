The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1990s, {{and similar}} {{to other parts of}} Houston inside the 610 Loop, the Heights has {{experienced}} gentrification, a process ongoing to this day, as young highly paid professionals (many of whom work in Downtown Houston) have flocked to the area, purchasing and renovating some of the historic homes (and demolishing some of them to build newer, upscale housing). Upscale boutiques and restaurants have opened in the area, giving the streetscape an appearance <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> unlike Bellaire, Lower Westheimer or Upper Kirby.|$|E

25|$|This was <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of {{a problem}} while the station {{was at the end}} of the line, but on 30 May 1846 the South Devon Railway (SDR) opened a line westwards towards Plymouth. A {{carriage}} shed was built for the SDR at the south end of the B platform but the goods sheds and locomotive sheds for both companies were to the west, between the station and the River Exe. The SDR was designed to be worked by atmospheric power and an engine house was built on the banks of the river near the locomotive shed. This was only used for its original purpose for about a year but was not demolished until many years later.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, it is <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to say that, {{from the end}} of 1759 to the end of 1761, the unshakable {{firmness}} of the Russian Empress was the one constraining political force which held together the heterogeneous, incessantly jarring elements of the anti-Prussian combination. From the Russian point of view Elizabeth's greatness as a stateswoman consists in her steady appreciation of Russian interests, and her determination to promote them at all hazards. She insisted throughout that the King of Prussia must be rendered harmless to his neighbors for the future, and {{that the only way to}} bring this about was to reduce him to the rank of a Prince-Elector.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 to 1926, William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberal {{government}} {{pursued a}} conservative domestic policy with {{the object of}} lowering wartime taxes and, especially, cooling wartime ethnic tensions, as well as defusing postwar labour conflicts. The Progressives refused to join the government, but did help the Liberals defeat non-confidence motions. King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, but <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, which needed tariffs to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader Arthur Meighen sparred constantly and bitterly in Commons debates. The Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader, Thomas Crerar, resigned {{to return to his}} grain business, and was replaced by the more placid Robert Forke. The socialist reformer J.S. Woodsworth gradually gained influence and power among the Progressives, and he reached an accommodation with King on policy matters.|$|E
25|$|An {{obvious way}} to {{generate}} permutations of n is to generate {{values for the}} Lehmer code (possibly using the factorial number system representation of integers up to n!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires n operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an array or a linked list, both require (for different reasons) about n2/4 operations to perform the conversion. With n likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a problem, {{but it turns out}} that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in O(n log n) time.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{arable land}} in Greece was yet under {{cultivation}} in the Archaic period. Farms {{appear to have}} been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements. They were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a disaster. Crop rotation was practiced, alternating between legumes and cereals (barley and durum), and the land was left fallow every other year. Alongside these, farmers cultivated vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables as cash crops for sale in local centres and abroad. Livestock were of secondary importance. Sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth. A team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly, but were expensive to maintain. Horses and large herds of cattle were the preserve of the mega-rich.|$|E
25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E
25|$|Back in 2001 the ICC {{decided to}} create a plan {{designed}} to make all ICC full member countries play each other for Test cricket {{over a period of}} ten years (known as the ICC Ten Year Plan). This was approved in February 2001 by the ICC member countries. Starting from 2002 and running until 2011, it ensured that each Test country played the other nine home and away over a period of ten years, in addition to any matches the individual cricket boards organised on their own. Thus, India and Pakistan played 12 ODIs and 6 Tests against each other in their respective countries (not including neutral ground ODI tournaments such as the Asia Cup) from 2004 to April 2005, and played a further series of 3 Tests and 5 ODIs in the winter of 2006. However, because of the rigorous schedule of the Ten Year Plan, there was hardly any time left over to schedule other series, and there were voices criticising the amount of international cricket that is played, with the risk of injury and player burnout as reasons for why this amount should be reduced. The ICC defended their policy, citing the number of international players in English county cricket as a sign that there was <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> cricket for the players.|$|E

500|$|Cupid at the Circus is a 1910 American silent short [...] drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a romance with a storyline focused around a country boy who follows a circus parade to the circus grounds and becomes intent on sneaking into the show. He is discovered, but before he can be ejected, a girl asks her father to buy him a ticket of admission. Thankful, the boy gives her his pocket knife. Years later the two meet again and when he sees her using his pocket knife.

The circus scenes were done with special arrangement by Barnum & Bailey. The film was released on May 20, 1910 to favorable reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

500|$|Erika Berlin of Rolling Stone {{said that}} the song proves that Robyn [...] "can crank out catchy jams as fast as pop's biggest hitmakers."

[...] He concluded by saying that [...] "it would take lesser pop artists an entire album to explore the wide spectrum of emotions that she can express {{in less than four}} minutes." [...] Robert Ballantyne of music website Popjournalism described it as [...] "both a peppy pop track and a ballad", and called it Robyn's best single yet, stating, [...] "Producer and long-time Robyn collaborator Klas Åhlund adds {{just the right amount of}} au courant electro-pop into the mix, but <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to doom the track to the dance-club ghetto." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, and wrote that [...] "What began life as a subdued-but-beautiful strings 'n' piano ballad is now a strident electropop tune that percolates as enviably as your next door neighbour's brand new coffee maker." ...|$|E
500|$|Joplin's {{usage of}} Italian tempo {{indications}} in [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] {{has been interpreted}} as his intention to give the piece a serious aspect {{in a similar manner}} to Treemonisha and [...] "Scott Joplin's New Rag". [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] begins with the instruction [...] "Allegretto ma non troppo" [...] (moderately fast, but <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much)</b> and continues in the D strain with [...] "Tempo l'istesso" [...] (tempo remains the same), a warning against slowing down for the minor-mode section. As well, Joplin employed in [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] the classic [...] "common time" [...] 4/4 time signature instead of the more usual 2/4 time of rag tunes. Simultaneously, Joplin doubled all the note values, effectively making the unusual 4/4 time signature have no practical effect on the way the piece sounded or the way it was performed. His publishing it in 4/4 was simply a way to connect the rag with classical and popular piano works of prior fame. Since Joplin published [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] himself, {{it has been suggested that}} the composition fully reflected his wishes and contained no compromises.|$|E
500|$|Series {{of various}} genres, {{featuring}} recurrent, title-worthy characters or name actors in familiar roles, were particularly popular {{during the first}} decade of sound film. Fox's many B series, for instance, included Charlie Chan mysteries, Ritz Brothers comedies, and musicals with child star Jane Withers. These series films are {{not to be confused with}} the short, cliffhanger-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, many series were intended to attract young people—a theater that twin-billed part-time might run a [...] "balanced" [...] or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the words of one industry report, afternoon moviegoers, [...] "composed largely of housewives and children, want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want 'something good and <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of it.'" [...] Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category, but even here there is ambiguity: at MGM, for example, popular series like the Andy Hardy chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A-level at some of the lesser majors. For many series, even a lesser major's standard B budget was far out of reach: Poverty Row's Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan, the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features.|$|E
