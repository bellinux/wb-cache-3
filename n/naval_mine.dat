5|$|The British {{information}} gathering vessel St Georges, {{which holds}} the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), the system {{used by the}} Ministry of Defence to communicate with and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines, is sunk after accidentally trawling an old <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> in the Ionian Sea. MI6 agent James Bond is ordered by the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray and MI6 Chief of Staff, Bill Tanner, to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter could order attacks by the submarines' Polaris ballistic missiles.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, Berk-i Satvet was {{employed}} in patrols in the Black Sea. These included attacks on Russian ports with the ex-German warships Yavuz Sultan Selim and Midilli. In January 1915, Berk-i Satvet struck a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> while escorting a convoy to Zonguldak; the explosion severely damaged {{the ship and}} kept her out of service until April 1918. For {{the remainder of the}} war, she patrolled the Black Sea. The ship was renamed Berk in 1923 and modernized twice, in the mid-1920s and in the late-1930s. She remained in service until 1944, when she was stricken from the naval register. Berk was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1953–55.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Croatian War of Independence DBM-241 was {{relocated}} to Montenegro where it later entered service with the SR Yugoslav Navy. DBM-242, now redesignated as DBM-81 was launched as Cetina and entered service with the Croatian Navy 19 February 1992 with Ivo Raffanelli in command. For the remainder of the war, Cetina was engaged in transporting troops and equipment along the coast, including supply runs for Croatian forces during Operation Maslenica in 1993. The same year the ship participated in testing of the new MNS-M90 <b>naval</b> <b>mine.</b> DBM-82, the third and final ship of the class, was commissioned with the Croatian Navy on 9 March 1995 with Jerko Bošnjak in command.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Beiyang Fleet. Jingyuen was part of a flotilla which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Jingyuan first saw action during the First Sino-Japanese War. At the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894, {{she was one of the}} surviving Chinese cruisers, although suffered fire damage. She was sunk the following February during the Battle of Weihaiwei from a shot fired from a captured Chinese fort. She sank upright in shallow water, and Admiral Ding Ruchang gave orders for her to be destroyed by a <b>naval</b> <b>mine.</b> She was raised the follow year for scrap.|$|E
5|$|From late 1918, {{the ships}} {{were used to}} escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, Minnesota struck a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> laid by the German U-boat U-117, causing serious damage that kept her out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut short by the German {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France. This work was completed by mid-1919. The ships briefly operated as training ships in the early 1920s, though {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, they were all sold for scrap by 1924 and broken up.|$|E

5|$|HMS Curacoa was a C-class light cruiser {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the First World War. She {{was one of the}} five ships of the Ceres sub-class and spent much of her career as a flagship. The ship was {{assigned}} to the Harwich Force during the war, but saw little action as she was completed less than a year before the war ended. Briefly assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in early 1919, Curacoa was deployed to the Baltic in May to support anti-Bolshevik forces during the British campaign in the Baltic during the Russian Civil War. Shortly thereafter the ship struck a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> and had to return home for repairs.|$|E
5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 <b>naval</b> <b>mine,</b> an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E
5|$|On 14 December 1944, Aldenham was sunk by a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> in the Adriatic Sea off Pag Island {{after she}} led a Royal Navy force in a {{bombardment}} mission against targets {{on the island}} of Pag and near the town of Karlobag in support of the Yugoslav Partisans. Although the rest of the force came to pick up survivors, cold weather and severe damage to Aldenham permitted the rescue of only 63 of her crew. Her wreck, broken in two by the explosion, was discovered in 19992000. It is a war grave, where 126 crew members and two Yugoslav Partisans aboard Aldenham {{at the time of the}} mining died. She was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E

5|$|During their peacetime careers, {{the vessels}} {{served in a}} variety of roles, {{including}} as survey vessels, training ships, fishery protection ships, and guard ships. Several of them were sent abroad, usually to the Mediterranean Sea on training cruises; during conflicts in Spain and the Ottoman Empire, these vessels were used to protect German nationals in those countries. Starting in 1872, the members of the class began to be withdrawn from service as their hulls began to deteriorate. Several of the ships were converted into storage hulks, while others were simply broken up {{or in the case of}} Meteor and Drache, sunk as target ships. Basilisk was the last surviving member of the class, remaining in use as a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> storage hulk until at least 1900; her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|España, Alfonso XIII, and Jaime I {{served in}} the 1st Squadron of the Spanish Fleet, which became the Training Squadron in the 1920s. They all saw action during the Rif War in the early 1920s {{supporting}} Spanish ground forces in North Africa. España ran aground in August 1923 and the Navy could not salvage her; she instead broke up under tidal forces. Alfonso XIII was renamed España in 1931 after her namesake, King Alfonso XIII was forced into exile. The two surviving ships served {{on opposite sides of}} the Spanish Civil War, and both were destroyed during the conflict. España struck a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> laid by her own side in on 30 April 1937 and sank, and Jaime I was destroyed by an internal explosion in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern <b>naval</b> <b>mine)</b> in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the fleet}} was repaired, they sailed out on 20 October to Weihaiwei. While in the harbour, they found {{themselves}} under attack by the Imperial Japanese Army in January 1895 as the Battle of Weihaiwei commenced. As Japanese forces {{took control of the}} sea forts {{on either side of the}} harbour, the fleet found itself under bombardment during the day and torpedo boat attack during the night. One such attack during the night of 5 February saw Laiyuan sunk by a torpedo and capsized. Jingyuen was undamaged, but underwent a near-miss by a torpedo. On 9 February, while Jingyuen was operating in the eastern part of the harbour, was struck below the waterline and sank upright in shallow water. The shot was fired from one of the captured Chinese forts. To avoid eventual capture by the Japanese, Ruchang ordered for a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> to be placed below decks on Jingyuen and detonated later that day, destroying her. She was raised and scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|The encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587–1666) {{documented}} a {{wide array}} of technologies, metallurgic and industrial processes in his Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia of 1637. This includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation, nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers, the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom, metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching, manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a still-head that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> ignited by use of a rip-cord and steel flint wheel.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{returned}} to active service after the United States {{declared war on}} Germany on 6 April 1917, entering World War I. She was assigned to Division 4 of the Battleship Force, based at Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. She spent the war as a training ship for gunners and engine room personnel. During this time, Vice Admiral Albert W. Grant, the commander of Battleship Force 1, instituted a program to reinforce the bulkheads of the ships under his command. This improved their ability to absorb underwater damage and remain afloat. On 29 September 1918, while cruising off Fenwick Island with the destroyer , she struck a <b>naval</b> <b>mine</b> that had been laid by the U-boat U-117, which inflicted serious damage but caused no casualties. The explosion tore a gaping hole in the hull from frame 5 to frame 16, and from the keel to the bottom edge of the armor belt. The bow flooded, but the repaired bulkheads prevented the flooding from spreading. Reduced to a speed of , Minnesota {{made it back to}} the Philadelphia Navy Yard where repairs were effected. The work lasted for five months, by which time Germany had signed the Armistice that ended the war.|$|E
