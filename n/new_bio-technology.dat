50|$|It is {{from the}} early part of the Younger Dryas that the first {{indirect}} evidence of agriculture was detected in the excavations at Abu Hureyra, although the cereals themselves were still of the wild variety. It was during the intentional sowing of cereals in more favourable refuges like Mureybet that these first farmers developed domesticated strains during the centuries of drought and cold of the Younger Dryas. When the climate abated about 9500 BCE they spread all over the Middle East with this <b>new</b> <b>bio-technology,</b> and Abu Hureyra grew to a large village eventually with several thousand people. The second occupation grew domesticated varieties of rye, wheat and barley, and kept sheep as livestock. The hunting of gazelle decreased sharply, probably due to overexploitation that eventually left them extinct in the Middle East. At Abu Hureyra they were replaced by meat from domesticated animals. The second occupation lasted for about 2,000 years.|$|E

Together with <b>new</b> <b>bio-technologies,</b> nanotechnology offers a formidable science of medical discovery. Atkinson ascribes nanotechnology to a nanocosm; a foreign world unlike anything the human mind can imagine, a finely structured cosmos or organised universe; a subworld with its own principles of organisation, ambiguous and wondrous.

40|$|Abstract. <b>New</b> <b>bio-technologies</b> {{are being}} {{developed}} that allow highthroughput imaging of gene expressions, where each image captures the spatial gene expression pattern of a single gene in the tissue of interest. This paper addresses the problem of automatically inferring a gene interaction network from such images. We propose a novel kernel-based graphical model learning algorithm, that is both convex and consistent. The algorithm uses multi-instance kernels to compute similarity between the expression patterns of different genes, and then minimizes the L 1 regularized Bregman divergence to estimate a sparse gene interaction network. We apply our algorithm on a large, publicly available data set of gene expression images of Drosophila embryos, where our algorithm makes novel and interesting predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{category}} of the post-human is, in much contemporary cultural theory, celebrated for marking a liberatory break from {{the limits of the}} human body. The post-human is seen, through the grafting of <b>new</b> <b>bio-technologies,</b> as enunciating a range of enhanced corporeal experiences and emancipatory possibilities. In this essay, I complicate the {{category of}} the post-human by locating {{it in the context of}} Australia's Refugee Detention Centres. In this context, in which refugees and asylum seekers are unjustly imprisoned and disenfranchised of fundamental human rights, the underside of Eurocentric conceptualisations of the post-human emerges. I proceed to identify and name the violent production of this subaltern subject as the event-trauma of the carceral post-human. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on Canadian stem cell {{researchers}} working on therapeutic appli- cations of autologous stem cells for heart disease. Building {{on the concept of}} ‘multiverse’ – coined by William James and then further developed by Ernst Bloch – we are interested in the simultaneity of the certain and uncertain, sometimes contradictory arguments articulated by these scientists. In {{the first part of the}} article we illustrate some of the factors that provide certainty for researchers and clinicians. The second part analyzes the ways in which uncertain elements become integrated into a discourse of certainty. What we would like to show, using the concept of multiverse, is that a rela- tively <b>new</b> <b>bio-technology</b> such as stem cell treatments generally relies on both certain and uncertain reasoning. However, uncertainty has to give way to a platform of partial certainty, if crucial action is to be taken on issues as diverse as treatments and grant applications. The principle mechanisms we found that can make this kind of transformation possible target future developments (what we call ‘if only arguments’), including past encouraging results in need of further research...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Iran is {{the only}} Islamic country in the Middle East which {{undertakes}} gamete donation, an assisted reproductive technology which has developed in the past 30 years. This study addresses the current situation and future potential of gamete donation in Iran {{in the context of}} the various cultural, legal and religious dilemmas which accompany it. This project utilizes a mixed methods approach, including in-formal group discussion and participant observation. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners (N= 12) in three fertility centres as well as with the members of the Planning Committee of the Medical Ethics Centre of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) (N= 7). General information about the centres was also collected using a questionnaire (N= 3). The results of the study suggest that the practice of gamete donation can result in bioethical issues in the legal, socio-cultural, political and religious contexts in Iran. The identity of a child resulting from gamete donation is an important legal issue that overrides other issues such as inheritance. In addition, gamete donation creates new categories of relatedness involving genetic and social factors that generate socio-cultural complexity and ambiguity. The socio-cultural context in Iran may create specific stigmas and social pressures for the child, donor and recipient. Other issues that might occur include the exploitation of the donor, harassment and blackmail of the recipient, commercialisation of the whole procedure, and incest. In addition, the varieties of fatwas that have been raised in relation to gamete donation generate an unclear and ambiguous religious situation for patients, donors and physicians. Moreover, the results show a gap between permitting gamete donation by fatwas and its practice. The lack of specific laws, guidelines, unique codes of practice, and health policies related to gamete donation not only causes problems related to the practice of gamete donation, but also has considerable socio-cultural repercussions in Iran. This thesis also considers how the medical ethics curriculum of Tehran University of Medical Sciences can be adapted and further developed to address the issues raised by the use of this <b>new</b> <b>bio-technology</b> in the Iranian context. Analysis of the current medical ethics curriculum at TUMS, demonstrates that it offers physicians an ethical framework and also provides training related to some of the bioethical issues which are involved in gamete donation practices, although gamete donation has not been specifically included in this curriculum. In the absence of this type of medical ethics curriculum, gamete donation practices continue to be considered in a haphazard and informal way during teaching rounds in the clinical years. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Religious outlooks {{on the use}} of <b>new</b> <b>bio-technologies</b> for {{the purpose}} of {{cognitive}} enhancement of humans are generally not favorably disposed to interventions in what is regarded as ordained by God or shaped by nature. I will present a number of perspectives that are derived from these outlooks and contrast them to the liberal standpoint. Subsequently, I will discuss two views that are compatible with religious outlooks, but that do not exclude cognitive enhancement altogether. They only pose significant moral limitations to it. These two views are: 1) cognitive enhancement of the human ought to be preceded by moral enhancement; 2) cognitive enhancement is morally permissible only as a means to moral enhancement. I will argue in favor of the superiority of the second view and assert that this view might be a sound platform for defining the relationship between religion(s) and bioethics in the decades and centuries to come.

40|$|Ever since Dolly {{the sheep}} was cloned, {{there has been}} much debate in the media and public spheres about the ethics and {{morality}} of genetic research. This paper, based on a Public Lecture given at the Australian National University in Canberra in September 2006, considers some of the social and cultural issues that arise from scientific advances in the selection, modification and engineering of human and other species, and their implications for improving health and extending life. It suggests that while visionary talk abounds, the new genetics has not yet begun to fulfil its promises in these areas. Examples, based on the author's own research, range from the mapping of the human genome, and the development of proteomics, to the application of stem cell technologies in South Korea, India and the United Kingdom. In particular, the paper highlights the importance of the robust regulation of informed consent procedures to under pin good governance in these <b>new</b> <b>bio-technologies.</b> It concludes that this account is a cautionary tale of a ‘promissory science’, where experience suggests that hype may once more triumph over hope...|$|R
40|$|The work {{covers the}} homoacetogenic {{bacteria}} of the extremophilic inhabitation places. The {{aim is to}} study the special features of the physiology and metabolism, regularities of their existence in the thermophilic and halophilic associations, to study the possibilities of their application in the bio-technology as acetate producers. It has been determined that the special physiological-biochemical features of the homoacetogenic bacteria determine their {{key role in the}} extremophilic microbic associations. The factors regulating the growth and activity of the key matabolism enzymes have been revealed. It has been specified that the catalytic properties of the hydrogenases determine their ability to the hygrogen metabolism. The role of the natrium energetics as a procedure of providing energy among extreme-halophilic bacteria has been specified. The biocatalytic system of creating acetate at the expense of conversing gas substrates on base of the immobilized cells of the thermophilic acetogenes has been developed that is a supposition for creation of the <b>new</b> <b>bio-technologies.</b> Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{explosion}} {{in the amount of}} biological data being generated worldwide is outpacing efforts to manage the analysis of the data. Bioinformatics researchers wishing to perform analysis on molecular data have a plethora of local and Internet-based tools available to perform different data analysis, but as researchers often wish to analyze and re-analyze data in a manageable, intuitive way, the problem arises of how to integrate these tools and the different data formats they encode. In addition, there are now new information technologies like XML and CORBA for representing and distributing biological data. The major questions that arise are: i) is it possible to develop a web-based information system for downstream, multiple pass analysis with the emphasis on analysis rather than storage? ii) can this information system facilitate and manage hypothesis driven analysis? iii) can this information system be adaptable to changing information technologies as well as data and information from <b>new</b> <b>bio-technologies?</b> iv) can this information system be able to ensure the analyzed data remains up-to-date in light of new data as well as reporting new information as it becomes available? In an attempt to answer some of these questions, we have designed a web based system Information System for whole Genome Data (ISGD). We discuss relevant issues for conducting sophisticated Bioinformatics analysis, and in addition, we review and discuss the latest technologies, like XML and CORBA, that impact the ongoing development of ISGD...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistics}} of the Food and Agriculture World Organization (FAO) estimates {{an explosion in}} the urban population increase, in the near future, almost twice between 1995 - 2020. The increase will mainly be 98 %, in the developing countries. From this point of view there will be a real challange for the agroalimentary systems that are to produce and bring on the market more and more food at such quality standards that it must satisfy all walks of life. The agriculture development, the distribution system improvement, the <b>new</b> technologies, the <b>bio-technologies</b> etc., represent opportunities for increasing the food reserves for e ever greater population. But in the same time, some technologies put some specific problems; therefore it must be an attentive control on them in order to ensure the consumers’ protection. Are the present-day consumers able to state firmly what their food contains? Do the food producers inform us honestly about the ingredients used for the goods delivered on the market? Here are only two questions that make both the consumers and the specialists anxious. Globalization; Distribution; Agroalimentary market; Alimentary additives; Alimentary safety; Sustainable consumption. ...|$|R
