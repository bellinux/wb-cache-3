5|$|Although well received, the series' {{ratings were}} <b>not</b> <b>high</b> {{enough to warrant}} a third series. After its {{cancellation}} in September 1997, Davies had an existential crisis after almost dying from an accidental overdose; the experience persuaded him to detoxify and {{make a name for}} himself by producing a series that celebrated his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Diane Francis was {{the only}} woman to compete in an {{individual}} event, the 400 m. She finished the first heat with a time of 52.48, and placed fifth in the heat. With this time, she advanced to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals her time improved to 52.24, which was <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough to advance to the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Irene Prescott was {{the sole}} swimmer in the {{delegation}} of Tonga. She competed in two events, the 50– and 100m backstrokes. Prescott took a time of 33.52 to complete her preliminary heat of the 50m backstroke and finished in 18th place, <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough to ensure a berth in the final. She was also eliminated in the preliminary heat of 100m backstroke after ranking 13th {{with a time of}} 1:13.42.|$|E

After the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT Station in 2001, the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters, especially those carrying bulky items.|$|E
5|$|The {{first such}} effort, Cosgrove Hall's {{animation}} of The Invasion episodes 1 and 4, was released to DVD alongside the surviving episodes in November 2006. The animation {{had been paid}} for by an earlier surplus in the Doctor Who website budget, allowing it {{to be used in}} the DVD release as a test for the concept, at no extra cost. Despite the DVD's success, the sales were <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough to offset the animation cost for any future collaboration.|$|E

5|$|Casualties of the {{operation}} were <b>not</b> <b>high</b> on either side. British losses in the landing party amounted to 15 killed and 58 wounded, with an additional three missing. The naval squadron suffered no known casualties in the engagement, principally {{because they did not}} come under heavy fire. French losses have not been calculated, but apart from General DesBruslys were probably a similar figure to the British. In contrast, the damage to the morale of the French defenders of Île Bonaparte was severe: the death of DesBruslys and the failure to properly defend the town undermined their efforts {{to such a degree that}} the eventual invasion of the island in 1810 was carried out without significant fighting or loss. This invasion force was similar in size to the raiding party and was once again led by Rowley and Keating.|$|E
5|$|Gugelmin {{signed with}} Dick Simon Racing {{to take part}} in the North American Champ Car racing series for the last three races of 1993. Although races at Mid Ohio and Nazareth {{resulted}} in non-finishes, Gugelmin finished 13th at Laguna Seca although this was <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough to receive any points. Despite this, Gugelmin demonstrated promise. In 1994, Gugelmin signed with Chip Ganassi Racing to partner Michael Andretti who returned to the series after a season in Formula One. Andretti was more successful than Gugelmin, and took two wins, including Reynard's first win in Champ Car at Surfers Paradise. Gugelmin was hindered by a lack of cooperation between his and Andretti's crews, and his first full-time year in the Champ Car World Series resulted in seven points finishes and 16th in the points standings.|$|E
5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than conventional rail but are <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough to be called high-speed rail services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand the high-speed rail networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, pre-1927 Route 18S was to {{run from}} Penns Grove to Atlantic City along much of present-day US 40 in New Jersey. US 40 was signed along Route 18S in 1926, running from a ferry in Penns Grove that crossed the Delaware River to Wilmington, Delaware. In 1927, Route 18S was renumbered to Route 48. The portion of US 40 in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938, {{around the same time}} the route was moved to a ferry across the Delaware River between Pennsville and New Castle, Delaware. After the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike were both {{completed}} in 1951, US 40 was moved to its current alignment in the area. In 1953, the Route 48 and Route 55 designations along US 40 were removed. A toll freeway was once planned along the US 40 corridor in the 1980s to alleviate traffic, but it was never built after it was deemed the traffic volume was <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough for it to be constructed.|$|E

The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century notable {{photographic}} work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882–1966), whose produced illustrations for the work of Robert Louis Stevenson and Paul Strand (1890–1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was <b>not</b> <b>high</b> in {{the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{consists}} of a mostly flat low-lying area in the midlands, ringed by mountain ranges such as (beginning in County Kerry and working counter-clockwise) the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, Comeragh Mountains, Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, the Mournes, Glens of Antrim, Sperrin Mountains, Bluestack Mountains, Derryveagh Mountains, Ox Mountains, Nephinbeg Mountains and the Twelve Bens/Maumturks group. Some mountain ranges are further inland {{in the south of}} Ireland, such as the Galtee Mountains (the highest inland range), Silvermine and Slieve Bloom Mountains. The highest peak Carrauntoohil, 1,038m (3,405ft) high, is in the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, a range of glacier-carved sandstone mountains. Ireland's mountains are <b>not</b> <b>high</b> – only three peaks are over 1,000m (3,281ft) and another 457 exceed 500m (1,640ft).|$|E

5|$|Sonia Akter and Anik Islam {{were the}} two Bangladeshi swimmers. Akter entered three events, the 50m butterfly, 50m {{backstroke}} and 50m breaststroke.

5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} {{well in a}} head sea. Stormy weather in the Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to complain that the ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded out and that the ship generated enormous sheets of spray when water came over the bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced tumblehome. Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E
5|$|When Alfred the Great became King of Wessex in 871, {{learning}} in southern England {{was at a}} low level, {{and there were no}} Latin scholars. He embarked on a programme of revival, bringing in scholars from Continental Europe, Wales and Mercia, and himself translated works he considered important from Latin to the vernacular. His grandson, Æthelstan, carried on the work, inviting foreign scholars such as Israel to England, and appointing a number of continental clerics as bishops. In the 930s the level of learning was still <b>not</b> <b>high</b> enough to supply enough literate English priests to fill the bishoprics. The generation educated in Æthelstan's reign, such as the future Bishop of Winchester, Æthelwold, who was educated at court, and Dunstan, who became Archbishop of Canterbury, went on to raise English learning to a high level.|$|E
