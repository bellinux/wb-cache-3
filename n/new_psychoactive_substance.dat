40|$|A {{literature}} search reveals no studies concerning simultaneous identification of commonly abused drugs, benzodiazepines, and <b>new</b> <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> in urine by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). We developed and validated an LC–MS/MS method for simultaneous identification of multiple abused drugs, benzodiazepines, and <b>new</b> <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> in urine from suspected drug abusers. The instrument was operated in multiple-reaction monitoring using an electrospray ionization mode. Chromatograms were separated using an ACE 5 C 18 column on a gradient of acetonitrile. After liquid–liquid extraction, samples were {{passed through a}} 0. 22 -μm polyvinylidene difluoride filter before injection into the LC–MS/MS. The limits of quantitation ranged from 0. 5  ng/mL to 31. 3  ng/mL. The linearity ranged from 0. 5  ng/mL to 200  ng/mL. The precision results were below 15. 4 % (intraday) and 18. 7 % (interday). The intraday accuracy ranged from 85. 9 % to 121. 0 %; interday accuracy ranged from 66. 1 % to 128. 7 %. The proposed method was applied to 769 urine samples. The most common three drugs identified were ketamine, amphetamine, and opiates. The drug positive rate for one or more drugs was 79. 6 %.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of <b>new</b> <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> made available for recreational drug use has created a challenge for clinical toxicology and drug testing laboratories. As a consequence, the routine immunoassay drug testing may become less effective due to an increased occurrence of false negative and false positive screening results. This work aimed to extend the knowledge about analytical cross-reactivity of new substances in selected CEDIA, EMIT, and KIMS immunoassays for drugs-of-abuse screening. Urine standards were prepared by spiking blank urine with 45 new substances. Authentic urine samples from intoxication cases identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were also studied. Several <b>new</b> <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> were demonstrated to display cross-reactivity in the immunoassays. CEDIA Amphetamine/Ecstasy and EMIT d. a. u. Amphetamine Class tests showed the highest reactivity towards the new drugs, which was expected since many have amphetamine-like structure and activity.
