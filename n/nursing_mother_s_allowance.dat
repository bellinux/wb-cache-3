40|$|The Affordable Care Act of 2010 {{was a major}} reformation of the American {{healthcare}} system, and {{it included}} several laws aimed at helping different groups of Americans. One such law, the Reasonable Break Time for <b>Nursing</b> <b>Mothers</b> law, was written {{with the intention of}} affording breastfeeding mothers the opportunity to pump breast milk at work. The purpose of this essay is to critique the Break time for <b>Nursing</b> <b>Mothers</b> Law, to discuss its shortcomings, and to present logical policy alternatives. Although noble in its intentions, this law does not do enough to protect <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers.</b> It is limited to the workplace and only applies to employers with 50 or more employees. This paper will recommend an extension of the Break Time for <b>Nursing</b> <b>Mothers</b> Law to all employees, protection of <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> {{for a longer period of}} time, and accommodations for pumping and breastfeeding in public places. Increased breastfeeding of infants would have a profound positive impact on childhood illness, rates of obesity, and mental health for American children and families.

40|$|Background: For {{over two}} decades, the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) has {{promoted}} breastfeeding practices supported by adequate government legislation in Nigeria through decree 41 of 1990. The {{objective of this}} study was therefore to assess the breastfeeding pattern among <b>mothers</b> <b>nursing</b> infants aged 3 - 6 months in Abraka, Delta State, Nigeria. Method: This is a health facility based cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from June 2010 to March 2011 among two hundred and twenty <b>mothers</b> <b>nursing</b> infants aged 3 - 6 months who presented at the immunization clinic in government hospital, Abraka. The <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> were selected by a systematic sampling technique (1 in 3). The study instrument was a pre-tested semi-structured interviewer administered questionnaire. Result: Two hundred and twenty <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> with mean age of 27. 9 ± 5. 6 years were studied. Over a third of the <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> had acquired secondary (41. 8 %) and tertiary (36. 8 %) education respectively; while 6. 4 % and 15. 0 % had nil formal education and primary education respectively. Over half (60. 5 %) of the <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> practiced mixing feeding (breastfeeding with concurrent complementary feeding), while 20. 9 % and 18. 6 % of them practiced predominant breastfeeding (breastfeeding with concurrent water) and exclusive breastfeeding respectively. Conclusion: This study has shown that the concept of exclusive breastfeeding has continued to meet shift resistance from all social class of <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> in Abraka...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Exclusive {{breast-feeding}} {{is recommended}} for infant nutrition during the first 6 months after birth. Worst still, this behaviour practices have not yet improved in Africa despite this recommendation. This study therefore, examines breast-feeding behaviour and practices among <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> in two African countries: Nigeria and Ghana. A sample of 300 <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> attending ante-natal clinic was randomly drawn from 4 hospitals, two in Nigeria and two in Ghana. The {{demographic characteristics of the}} respondents show that their age range between 19 - 51 years with a mean of 35 years and standard deviation of 22. 6 years. A modified self-report questionnaire assessing breast-feeding attitudes, intentions and support was used for the collection of data. The reliability co-efficient yielded r = 0. 82 after modification. Four research questions were raised to guide the study. The results indicate that <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> do not breast-feed based on personal frustration and painful experience, fear of loosing weight, nature of job, lack of confidence in breast-feeding, long period of recommended exclusive breast-feeding and the fact that infant may become addicted to the behaviour. The result also reveal that <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> may continue exclusive breast-feeding when decided to do so through the provision of social support, modeling, public enlightenment and appointment of care <b>nursing</b> <b>mother.</b> While at the same time, it was shown that there is significant difference in breast-feeding behaviour of mothers based on their occupations and of course no difference exists in the breast-feeding behaviour of Nigeria and Ghana <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers.</b> Recommendations based on the findings of the study were highlighted...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the general trend of timing of breastfeeding initiation among <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> in Nigeria. The time of initiating the first breast milk to an infant by his/her mother is measured as {{whether it is}} immediate (before the first hour of birth) or delayed (after the first hour of birth), and the impacts of some socioeconomic and maternal factors on this are determined. Results from {{this study showed that}} mother’s age at birth, her enhanced educational status, mothers’ domiciling in urban areas, singleton birth, and mother’s frequent antenatal visits among others contributed positively to early initiation of breastfeeding by Nigerian <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> (P< 0. 05). In the contrary, delivery through caesarean operation, <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> that delivers at homes instead of hospitals, and the current birth being the first from a mother are all found to militate against early initiation of breastfeeding (P< 0. 05) among others. General results showed that early breastfeeding initiation experience among <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> in Nigeria significantly improves over time between 1990 and 2008 (P< 0. 05), although following a sinusoidal pattern.

The objective of this communitybased {{study was to examine}} the pattern of growth of infants whose mothers claimed were being exclusively breastfed within the first 6 months of life. Data were obtained from purposely selected 400 <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> with the use of focus group discussions (FGDs) and observational methods, using a combination of exclusive breastfeeding indicators developed from the “Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding” guidelines and tips from “Helping Mothers to Breastfeed” guide. Findings revealed that majority of <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> were not exposed to the basic practical steps in breastfeeding during the antenatal period. It was also observed that <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> usually transferred the baby from one breast to another arbitrarily without allowing the baby to exhaust the milk in each breast, thereby depriving the baby of the hind milk necessary for energy. This resulted in a technical deficiency in the practice of exclusive breastfeeding. These findings suggest that health care providers and <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> need to know more about nutrition education on exclusive breastfeeding...|$|R

On the basis of serum progesterone levels, evidence of corpus luteum activity was obtained in 61 % of non-lactating women; but only 20 % of non-amenorrhoeic lactating mothers. This suggests an increased incidence of anovulatory cycles and/or cycles with short luteal phases among <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers.</b> The incidence of corpus luteum activity was 8 % in amenorrhoeic lactating mothers. In this 8 % recurrence of ovulation preceded return of menstruation. Mean serum progesterone was significantly higher and serum prolactin significantly lower in the non-lactating women than in the <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers.</b> This suggests that although ovulation occurs, corpus luteum activity is inadequate in hyperprolactinaemic <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jFLWNAinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
