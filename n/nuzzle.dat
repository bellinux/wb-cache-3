5|$|On 27 September, {{the brigade}} {{was once again}} moved to the front line and given {{responsibility}} for patrolling the area between the Desert Mounted Corps and the XXI Corps, taking under command the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment on 20 October. At the time the brigade was the only mounted formation not under the direct command of the Desert Mounted Corps, remaining Army Troops. The next British attack was the capture of Gaza in November 1917; the plan was for the infantry to capture their initial objectives, then the brigade would be released to advance along the Mediterranean coastline, turn right and attack the Turkish rear and their headquarters at <b>Nuzzle.</b> When the battle started, the British infantry captured {{all but one of}} their objectives, but as the brigade started to move out, a Turkish counter-attack regained their previous positions, so the brigade's advance was called off. However, by the night of 6/7 November, continued British attacks forced the Turkish to withdraw from Gaza and the brigade was ordered forward to pursue them. By 13:00 the brigade was north of Gaza when the Mysore Lancers' leading squadron located the Turkish rearguard, which included a heavy machine-gun position. At 15:00 the Hyderabad Lancers and the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment attacked Beit Hanun, {{while the rest of the}} brigade attacked Beit Lahi. As the Hyderabad Lancers approached their objective, they came under a heavy artillery bombardment. Leaving one squadron and their machine-guns behind to provide fire support, the rest of the Lancers attacked, capturing the Wadi Safieh line. The Lancers, still under artillery fire, held out until 16:30, when they were ordered to withdraw and rejoin the rest of the brigade now concentrated at Beit Lahi.|$|E
25|$|Caprids (dwarf antelope, {{such as the}} sheep, goats, muskox, serows, gorals, {{and several}} similar species) use their preorbital glands to {{establish}} social rank. For example, when competition arises between two grazing sheep (Ovis aries), they have been observed to <b>nuzzle</b> each other's preorbital glands. By sending and receiving olfactory cues, this behavior {{appears to be a}} means of establishing dominance and of avoiding a fight, which would otherwise involve potentially injurious butting or clashing with the forehead.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{scenes in}} the film have been widely cited as among Hitchcock's best: in one, Hitchcock starts wide and high on a second floor balcony {{overlooking}} the great hall of a grand mansion. Slowly he tracks down and in on Ingrid Bergman, finally ending with a tight close-up of a key tucked in her hand. Hitchcock also devised a scene that circumvented the Production Code's ban on kisses longer than three seconds by having his actors disengage every three seconds, murmur and <b>nuzzle</b> each other, then start again. The two-and-a-half-minute kiss was described by biographer Paul Duncan as [...] "perhaps his most intimate and erotic kiss".|$|E
2500|$|Weaning {{is thought}} to start or be {{completed}} even before the young emerge. [...] Once above ground, young are seen foraging for food independently. [...] During the weaning period, the mother feeds alone and ignores any attempt of the young trying to <b>nuzzle</b> or nurse from her. [...] A mother will sometimes {{spend the night in}} a different den if necessary. [...] By early to mid-May the young squirrels have had their juvenile pelage for some time and begin to show the changes into adult pelage. By summer, the adult pelage is present. [...] Once an individual has reached adulthood it is difficult to tell differences in age. [...] Nelson's antelope squirrel is a short-lived species that often does not survive to a year. [...] However, several individuals have been observed to live more than four years in the wild.|$|E

2500|$|Groups of {{kangaroos}} {{are called}} mobs. Mobs usually have 10 or more kangaroos in them. Living in mobs provides protection {{for some of}} the weaker members of the group. The size and stability of the mobs vary between geographic regions, with eastern Australia having larger and more stable aggregations than in arid areas farther west. Larger aggregations display high amounts of interactions and complex social structures, comparable to that of ungulates. One common behaviour is nose touching and sniffing, which mostly occurs when an individual joins a group. The kangaroos performing the sniffing gain much information from smell cues. This behaviour enforces social cohesion without consequent aggression. During mutual sniffing, if one kangaroo is smaller, it will hold its body closer to the ground and its head will quiver; this is possibly a form of submission. Greetings between males and females are common, with larger males being the most involved in meeting females. Most other non-antagonistic behaviour occurs between mothers and their young. Mother and young reinforce their bond though grooming. A mother will groom her young during or after it is suckling. [...] A joey will <b>nuzzle</b> its mother’s pouch if it wants access to it.|$|E
2500|$|In the Journal of American Folklore, the {{sociologist}} Gary Alan Fine {{published a}} review of Magliocco's work in which he described it as [...] "a richly textured ethnography, as fine a participant-observation account of an American scene as folklore has been gifted with since Leslie Prosterman's Ordinary Life, Festival Days". Believing that Magliocco's analysis had revealed Paganism {{to be the most}} [...] "politically progressive and postmodern" [...] religion in existence [...] "despite [...] considerable borrowings of traditional themes", Fine felt that Witching Culture was [...] "an effective and affectionate guide in mapping the development of Neo-Paganism in America and the multiple [...] and occasionally conflicting [...] strains from which it draws". He did however note that in his opinion the author had failed to [...] "stand sufficiently back from the movement to gain the analytic purchase that comes from skepticism. Granted, all religions appear gawky in their adolescence, but sometimes disciplinary agnosticism permits us to discount desired but undeserved self-presentations. While no researcher should scorn the belief system of a group that she encounters, neither is it necessary to <b>nuzzle.</b> This attachment may cause Magliocco to downplay sexuality, drug use, and posturing in the community. These seekers often appear in her telling to be, frankly, rather puritanical." [...] He went on to remark that a [...] "more distanced view would emphasize the struggles over political correctness that challenge the movement as it staggers toward a consensual theology", in particular its controversial cultural borrowings from Native American cultures. Ultimately however, he felt that as an [...] "account of the folkloric practices of a burgeoning social scene", Witching Culture warrants [...] "high praise".|$|E
2500|$|Jesse Washington of The Associated Press commended Jackson's {{output to}} remain [...] "consistently good" [...] and [...] "eclipsing Michael's"; praising Jackson as equal to peer Madonna's: [...] "For {{creating}} pop confections {{that you can}} grind to {{on the dance floor}} [...] Jackson remains up there with Madonna {{as one of the best}} ever. She’s still relevant and compelling 22 years after her first album, and will probably remain so long after her right breast is forgotten." [...] Spence D. of IGN declared; [...] "There's no question that Jackson has the personality, the sensuality, and the voice to keep her at the top of the pop diva hierarchy." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic likened the album to a [...] "low-key make-out record" [...] in the tradition of The Velvet Rope, praising its [...] "strong rhythmic or melodic hooks." [...] LA Weekly declared it [...] "better than most reviews and word-of-mouth would have you believe," [...] and [...] "at least a minor-chord [...] "F-you" [...] victory to the wolves nipping at Janet’s tits." [...] Bob Smithouser of Plugged In considered the album's [...] "bouncy rhythms, playful vocals and slick production values" [...] to ultimately [...] "draw countless teens into her tacky web of nymphomania." [...] Tom Moon of The Inquirer stated, [...] "Damita Jo will undoubtedly blaze new trails for artists seeking fame via salacious outlandishness." [...] Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times stated: [...] "Ms. Jackson long ago established herself as one of the greatest and most consistent performers [...] -- she hasn't released a dud album in 20 years," [...] adding Damita Jo [...] "continues that streak." [...] Sanneh concluded [...] "Jackson has spent the better part of two decades using that whispery voice and that shy smile to keep some small part of herself hidden, even when she seems to be exposing herself. Maybe that's why she can still cause such a fuss. And maybe that's also how she's managed to last so long." [...] Neil Strauss of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "all things to all pop fans," [...] ranging from [...] "whiffs of classic Eighties Janet, teeny-bopper pop, a Nelly impression, old-school funk, push-button rock & roll, even a little country & western." [...] Mikael Wood of The City Paper declared it Jackson's [...] "most sonically sumptuous album" [...] and an [...] "explosion of finely finessed sound." [...] Los Angeles Times praised its balance between [...] "assembly-line product" [...] and innovation in [...] "more inspired commercial pop." [...] Its production was said to span [...] "decades of pop-music romance" [...] by Blender, ranging from the [...] "Motown sound" [...] to [...] "hip-hop’s latest throwback beats." [...] Wood defended Jackson's lyrical content: [...] "the album's songs aren't any more moralistic than those by the frequently philandering male stars who get away with exposing their nipples all the time." [...] However, Wood deciphered the album to be [...] "more about love than lust", likened to [...] "a <b>nuzzle</b> on the ear" [...] and familiar comfort. Cromelin observed Jackson's vocal inflections to convincingly deliver [...] "serviceable personas"; ranging from [...] "haughty stripper to a wide-eyed kid who loves long walks on the beach." ...|$|E

The Boss knows they aren't any good so is reluctant to send them, but there is usually some misunderstanding over the phone and they end up getting the job. <b>Nuzzle</b> and Scratch mess up and the person rings the Boss to complain. She convinces them to 'give them another chance' and <b>Nuzzle</b> and Scratch normally turn things around and really impress the person who hired them.

5|$|Premastication and mouth-to-mouth feeding {{in humans}} is {{postulated}} to have {{evolved from the}} regurgitation of food from parent to offspring or male to female (courtship feeding) and has been observed in numerous mammals and animals of other species.
