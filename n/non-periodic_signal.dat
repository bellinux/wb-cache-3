40|$|Many animal vocalizations are non-periodic, frequency-modulated signals. Because {{this type}} of signal varies {{simultaneously}} in two dimensions, time and frequency, spectrographic measurement is constrained by the "uncertainty principle": to increase accuracy of measurement in one dimension we must sacrifice accuracy of measurement in the other dimension. Although this trade-off is unavoidable, inherent in the measurement of frequency, for any particular frequency-modulated, <b>non-periodic</b> <b>signal,</b> there is an intermediate, optimal setting of spectrographic bandwidth, equal to the square root of the average rate of change of the measured signal. This optimal bandwidth minimizes the time· frequency smear, and thus permits the most accurate measurement of the instantaneous frequency.

40|$|The Shannon {{upper bound}} places {{a limit on}} the {{error-free}} information transmission rate (capacity) of a noisy channel. It has stood for over sixty years, and underlies both theoretical and practical work in the telecommunications industry. This upper bound arises from the Shannon-Hartley law, which has two parameters: the available bandwidth and the signal-to-noise power ratio. However, aside from these explicit parameters, the Shannon-Hartley law also rests on certain assumptions. One of these is that the channel is linear: recent work has shown that nonlinear channels are not limited by the Shannon upper bound. A second assumption, arising from the mathematical tools used in its proof, is that signals are periodic. Surprisingly, the capacity limit associated with <b>non-periodic</b> <b>signals</b> has not previously been examined.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new neural {{oscillator}} model to attain rhythmic movements of robotic arms that features enhanced entrainment property. It {{is known that}} neural oscillator networks could produce rhythmic commands efficiently and robustly under the changing task environment. However, when a quasi-periodic or <b>non-periodic</b> <b>signal</b> is inputted into the neural oscillator, even {{the most widely used}} Matsuoka’s neural oscillator (MNO) may not be entrained to the signal. Therefore, most existing neural oscillator models are only applicable to a particular situation, and if they are coupled to the joints of robotic arms, they may not be capable of achieving human-like rhythmic movement. In this paper, we perform simulations of rotating a crank by a two-link planar arm whose joints are coupled to the proposed entrainment-enhanced neural oscillator (EENO). Specifically, we demonstrate the excellence of EENO and compare it with that of MNO by optimizing their parameters based on simulated annealing (SA). In addition, we show an impressive capability of self-adaptation of EENO that enables the planar arm to make adaptive changes from a circular motion into an elliptical motion. To the authors’ knowledge, this study seems to be the first attempt to enable the oscillator-coupled robotic arm to track a desired trajectory interacting with the environment...|$|E

We have performed an extensive search for weak periodic signals in the frequency range 400 Hz to 2500 Hz using the burst records for 2203 GRBs and 152 SGR flares. The study employs the Rayleigh power as a test statistic to evaluate the evidence for periodic emissions. We find no evidence of periodic emissions from these events at these frequencies. In all but a very few cases the maximum power values obtained are consistent with what would be expected by chance from a <b>non-periodic</b> <b>signal.</b> In those few instances where there is marginal evidence for periodicity {{there are problems with}} the data that cast doubt on the reality of the signal. For classical GRBs, the largest Rayleigh power occurs in bursts whose TTE data appear to be corrupted. For SGRs, our largest Rayleigh power, with a significance of 1 %, occurs in one record for SGR 1900 + 14 (at 2497 Hz), and in no other outbursts associated with this source; we thus consider it unlikely to represent detection of a real periodicity. From simulations, we deduce that the Rayleigh test would have detected significant oscillations with relative amplitude ~ 10 % about half the time. Thus, we conclude that high frequency oscillations, if present, must have small relative amplitudes. Comment: 22 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|E

Our starting point is the generalization of the model of Gaussian, time-periodic, 1 /f noise, discussed in our recent Letter [T. Antal et al., PRL, vol. 87, 240601 (2001) ], to arbitrary power law. We investigate three main scaling regions, distinguished by the scaling of the cumulants {{in terms of the}} microscopic scale and the total length of the period.

This topic is a long-standing scientific program {{in mathematics and}} physics (Abarbanel et al. 1996; Amit 1992; Freeman 1994; Guckenheimer and Holmes 1983). In general, the synchronization of two systems means that their time evolution is periodic, with the same period and, perhaps, the same phase (Malagarriga et al. 2015). This notion of synchronization is not sufficient in a context where the systems are excited by <b>non-periodic</b> <b>signals,</b> representing their complex environment. Synchronization of chaotic systems has been discovered (Afraimovich et al. 1986; Fujisaka and Yamada 1983; Pikovsky 1984) and since then {{it has become an}} important research topic in mathematics (Ashwin et al. 1994), physics (Ott and Sommerer 1994) and engineering (Chen 1999). In interconnected cell assemblies embedded in a recurrent neural network, some ordered sequences of intervals within spike trains of individual neurons, and across spike trains recorded from different neurons, will recur whenever an identical stimulus is presented. Such recurring, ordered, and precise interspike interval relationships are referred to as “preferred firing sequences”. One such example can be represented by brain circuits shaped by developmental and learning processes (Edelman 1993). The application of tools from algebraic topology to the study of these systems and networks will be of great use for determining deterministic chaotic behavior in experimental data and develop biologically relevant neural network models that do not wipe out temporal information (Babloyantz et al. 1985; Celletti and Villa 1996; Celletti et al. 1997; Mpitsos et al. 1988; Rapp et al. 1986).|$|R

40|$|Context. Solar {{magnetic}} activity shows both smooth secular changes, {{such as the}} modern Grand Maximum, and quite abrupt drops that are denoted as grand minima, such as the Maunder Minimum. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of convection-driven dynamos offer one way of examining the mechanisms behind these events. Aims. In this work, we analyze a solution of a solar-like DNS that was evolved for roughly 80 magnetic cycles of 4. 9 years and where epochs of irregular behavior are detected. The emphasis of our analysis is to find physical causes for such behavior. Methods. The DNS employed is a semi-global (wedge-shaped) magnetoconvection model. For the data analysis tasks we use Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and phase dispersion methods, as they are well suited for analyzing cyclic (<b>non-periodic)</b> <b>signals.</b> Results. A special property of the DNS is the existence of multiple dynamo modes at different depths and latitudes. The dominant mode is solar-like (equatorward migration at low latitudes and poleward at high latitudes). This mode {{is accompanied by a}} higher frequency mode near the surface and at low latitudes, showing poleward migration, and a low-frequency mode {{at the bottom of the}} convection zone. The low-frequency mode is almost purely antisymmetric with respect to the equator, while the dominant mode has strongly fluctuating mixed parity. The overall behavior of the dynamo solution is extremely complex, exhibiting variable cycle lengths, epochs of disturbed and even ceased surface activity, and strong short-term hemispherical asymmetries. Surprisingly, the most prominent suppressed surface activity epoch is actually a global magnetic energy maximum; during this epoch the bottom toroidal magnetic field obtains a maximum, demonstrating that the interpretation of grand minima-type events is non-trivial. The hemispherical asymmetries are seen only in the magnetic field, while the velocity field exhibits considerably weaker asymmetry. Conclusions. We interpret the overall irregular behavior as being due to the interplay of the different dynamo modes showing different equatorial symmetries, especially the smoother part of the irregular variations being related to the variations of the mode strengths, evolving with different and variable cycle lengths. The abrupt low-activity epoch in the dominant dynamo mode near the surface is related to a strong maximum of the bottom toroidal field strength, which causes abrupt disturbances especially in the differential rotation profile via the suppression of the Reynolds stresses...|$|R
40|$|Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are devices used {{to extract}} {{energy from the}} waves. The {{particular}} WEC considered in this thesis is a three-body hinge-barge WEC, which is an articulated floating structure composed of 3 rectangular bodies interconnected by hinges, and it operates longitudinally to the direction to the incoming wave. The relative motion between each pair of bodies drives a Power Take-Off (PTO) system, which extracts the energy from the waves. The objective of this thesis is to increase the energy that can be extracted by a three-body hinge-barge WEC using an optimal control strategy, which computes the optimal loads applied by the PTOs driven by the relative motion between the bodies. The optimal control is formulated in the time domain, and computes the PTO loads in a coordinated way, so that the total energy extracted by the device is maximized. The optimal control strategy is formulated for a three-body hinge-barge WEC that is equipped with either passive or active PTOs. In this thesis, an optimal control strategy, for the maximization of the energy extracted by a three-body hinge-barge WEC, is derived with Pseudo-Spectral (PS) methods, which are a subset of the class of techniques used for the discretisation of integral and partial differential equations known as mean weighted residuals. In particular, PS methods based on Fourier basis functions, are used to derive an optimal control strategy, for a finite time horizon. Therefore, an optimal control strategy, with PS methods based on Fourier basis functions, cannot be applied for realtime control of the WEC, as Fourier basis functions can only represent the steady-state response of the WEC. However, PS methods based on Fourier basis functions provide a useful framework for the evaluation of the achievable power absorption performance of the WEC, with both active and passive PTOs. The Receding Horizon (RH) real-time optimal control of a three-body hingebarge WEC is derived with PS methods based on Half-Range Chebyshev-Fourier (HRCF) basis functions. The RH optimal real-time controller, with PS methods based on HRCF basis functions, maximizes the energy extracted by the WEC at each time step over a moving control horizon. In contrast to Fourier basis functions, HRCF basis functions are well suited for the approximation of <b>non-periodic</b> <b>signals,</b> allowing the representation of both the transient and steady-state response of the WEC. The optimal control strategy, with PS methods based on either Fourier or HRCF basis functions, is based on a dynamic model of the device, which is derived with two different modeling methodologies, that can be also applied to other types of multiple body WECs. The modeling methodologies are validated against wave-tank tests carried out on a 1 / 7 th scale two-body hingebarge device, and a 1 / 25 th and 1 / 20 th scale three-body hinge-barge device...|$|R

Namely, {{it turns out that the}} proper framework for the DFT requires modulo operations of polynomials, which means working with so-called polynomial algebras [6]. Associated with polynomial algebras is the Chinese remainder theorem, which describes the DFT algebraically and can be used as a tool to concisely derive various FFTs as well as convolution algorithms [9], [21], [22], [1] (see also Winograd's Short DFT Algorithms 1). The polynomial algebra framework was fully developed for signal processing as part of the algebraic signal processing theory (ASP). ASP identifies the structure underlying many transforms used in signal processing, provides deep insight into their properties, and enables the derivation of their fast algorithms [15], [13], [11], [14]. Here we focus on the algebraic description of the DFT and on the algebraic derivation of the general-radix Cooley-Tukey FFT from Factoring the Signal Processing Operators 2. The derivation will make use of and extend the Polynomial Description of Signals 3. We start with motivating the appearance of modulo operations. The z-transform associates with infinite discrete signals X = (· · ·, x (− 1), x (0), x (1), · · ·) a Laurent series...|$|R
40|$|Chaos {{communication}} system can improve a system security due to characteristics of <b>non-periodic,</b> non-predictability, broadband <b>signal</b> and easy implementation. Also, chaos signal {{is sensitive to}} initial conditions of chaos map. By these reasons, security of chaos {{communication system}} is superior to digital communication system. BER performance of COOK modulation system is better than other chaos modulation systems, even if COOK modulation system uses an asynchronous receiver. However, security and safety of COOK modulated signal are worse than other chaos modulation systems, because information bits can be easily predicted from COOK modulated signal. In this paper, for security improvement of COOK modulated signal, we propose a novel Scrambling COOK modulation system by applying the scrambling method. Conventional COOK modulated signal can be predicted, because chaos signal is generated when data is only 1. However, proposed system cannot be predicted, because chaos signal is generated when data is 0 or 1. Therefore, security and safety o...|$|R
40|$|This book {{introduces}} {{readers to}} a new and exciting cross-disciplinary field of digital communications with chaos. This field was born around 15 years ago, {{when it was first}} demonstrated that nonlinear systems which produce complex <b>non-periodic</b> noise-like chaotic <b>signals,</b> can be synchronized and modulated to carry useful information. Thus, chaotic signals can be used instead of pseudo-random digital sequences for spread-spectrum and private communication applications. This deceptively simple idea spun hundreds of research papers, and many novel communication schemes based on chaotic signals have been proposed. However, only very recently researchers have begun to make a transition from academic studies toward practical implementation issues, and many "promising" schemes had to be discarded or re-formulated. This book describes {{the state of the art}} (both theoretical and experimental) of this novel field. The book is written by leading experts in the fields of Nonlinear Dynamics and Electrical Engineering who participated in US Army sponsored Multi-University Research Initiative on Digital Communication using Nonlinear Dynamics. It will be useful for active researchers and advanced graduate students interested in this exciting new field...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Chaos {{communication}} system has characteristics of <b>non-periodic,</b> non-predictability, broadband <b>signal</b> and easy implementation. Also, the characteristic of chaos {{communication system}} is decided by initial values. And {{it has the}} sensitive characteristic according to initial values. Due to these characteristics, security of chaos communication system is generally better than other digital communication system. But BER(Bit Error Rate) performance is worse than digital communication system. Looking at the existing studies, chaos communication system is being studied diversity method {{in order to improve}} the BER performance in Rayleigh channel. In this paper, we apply the Alamouti STBC(Alamouti Space Time Block Coding) in order to improve the BER performance, and we evaluate BER performance of CDSK system that applied the Alamouti STBC. If we apply the Alamouti STBC to the CDSK system, we are possible to evaluate the BER performance improvement in Rayleigh channel. Therefore, if the Alamouti STBC of MIMO(Multi Input Multi Output) system applies to chaos communication system in fading channel, the deterioration of BER performance is possible to compensate. And, if you adjust number of transmitter and receiver according to kinds of channels, effective communication is possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of an exomoon would provide deep insights into planet formation and the habitability of planetary systems, with transiting examples being particularly sought after. Of {{the hundreds of}} Kepler planets now discovered, the seven-planet system Kepler- 90 is unusual for exhibiting an unidentified transit-like signal {{in close proximity to}} one of the transits of the long-period gas-giant Kepler- 90 g, as noted by Cabrera et. al. (2014). As part of the 'Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler' (HEK) project, we investigate this possible exomoon signal and find it passes all conventional photometric, dynamical and centroid diagnostic tests. However, pixel-level light curves indicate that the moon-like signal occurs on nearly all of the target's pixels, which we confirm using a novel way of examining pixel-level data which we dub the 'transit centroid'. This test reveals that the possible exomoon to Kepler- 90 g is likely a false positive, perhaps due to a cosmic ray induced Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Dropout (SPSD). This work highlights the extreme care required for seeking <b>non-periodic</b> low-amplitude transit <b>signals,</b> such as exomoons. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures.
