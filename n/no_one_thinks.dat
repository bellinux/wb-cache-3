On {{the question of}} the authenticity of the text, Dee Dee said in an interview: [...] "I hope <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> we really sniff glue. I stopped when I was eight [...]" [...] Dee Dee also explained that its concept came from adolescent trauma. After several songs by the Ramones whose titles began with [...] "I Don't Want to... Tommy said that [...] "Now I Want to Sniff Some Glue" [...] is the first positive piece on the album. The song served as an inspiration for one of the first punk fanzines, Mark Perry's Sniffin' Glue. [...] "I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement" [...] is also a minimalist piece, and was inspired by horror movies. The entire text is composed of three lines, and the composition was based on three major chords. With a playing time of 2:35, it is the longest piece on the album.|$|E
2500|$|It {{begins with}} a series of small acts of {{mischief}} conducted by someone on school premises. At first, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of connecting these seemingly isolated incidents. But gradually, as the incidents become increasingly serious, it becomes clear that someone with inside knowledge is intent on causing real damage. Only Mr Straitley may have the key to the identity of the mysterious saboteur - but can he expose the enemy in time to prevent a murder? ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have here}} {{about two hundred}} Christian refugees, poor worn persecuted ones whom I am feeding on food taken from the rich {{families}} near by. They ought to suffer in view of all the misery they have created....Our poor people come in with their tales of woe which would break a heart of stone. Many {{have been killed and}} I shall act as avenger if I can meet the brutes in human form. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> that mercy should be shown them." ...|$|E

50|$|Life in the {{shrunken}} city continued, {{though at}} a slower rate {{than the rest of}} the universe. Despite her young age and inexperience in actual combat, Thara was made chief of security for Kandor. She was adamant that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>think</b> she did not earn her position.|$|R

[...] "I am young, active, used to exercise, and could easily out-walk my dear uncle. Let <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>think</b> me a hindrance. I cannot bear that all your lives should be exposed on my account." ...|$|R
2500|$|President Miguel Juárez Celman, who was {{in office}} from 1886 to 1890, came to the {{presidency}} {{as a result of}} electoral fraud. Through a policy known as [...] "Unicato," [...] Juárez Celman, who opposed universal suffrage and considered it to be always an error [...] "to consult the people," [...] assumed total power in Argentina, bringing together the forces of business and politics in ways that enabled both to profit {{at the expense of the}} state treasury. An English newspaper of the time is quoted as describing Argentine corruption as follows: [...] "Today there are dozens of men in government who are publicly accused of malpractice, who in any civilized country would be quickly punished with imprisonment, and yet none of them have been brought to justice. Meanwhile Celman is at liberty to enjoy the comfort of his farm and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> to punish him." [...] Juárez Celman was, however, eventually removed from office in the Revolution of 1890, amid allegations of corruption.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Eliza Dushku {{describes}} Faith as the [...] "working class" [...] Slayer, {{a reason}} she feels {{so many people}} identify with her. She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun {{if you look at it}} from their point of view." ...|$|E

6000|$|Let <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>think</b> that I do {{not love}} the old ministers. They were, probably, the best men of their generation, and they deserve that their biographies should fill {{the pages of}} the town histories. If I could but hear the [...] "glad tidings" [...] of which they tell, and which, perchance, they heard, I might write in a worthier strain than this.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I know,' said John, 'no {{one could}} expect it of you. Arthur told me {{at once that}} you were free from any shadow of blame, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> of imputing any.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} it, Edgar? In Italy the nobles are traders, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>thinks</b> it a dishonour. Why should not a {{peaceful}} trade {{be held in}} as high esteem as fighting?" ...|$|E

500|$|Scott Beattie {{wrote in}} his 2009 book, Community, Space and Online Censorship, that the {{question}} [...] "Will <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>think</b> of the children?" [...] was often raised by individuals advocating censorship out of a concern that youth might view material deemed inappropriate. According to Beattie, youngsters were cast as potential casualties of online sexual predators to increase regulation of the Internet; characterizing children as infantile evoked a concept of innocence which {{was a form of}} obsession over the concept of purity.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} of some dreadful thing, it's liable to happen, but if you don't think of it, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>thinks</b> of it, it just can't happen. Do you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just the thing! Why didn't I {{think of}} it? So bright and {{delicate}} and becoming? It will last better than flowers; and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> can <b>think</b> I'm extravagant, since it costs nothing." ...|$|R
