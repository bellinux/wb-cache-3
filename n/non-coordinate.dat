40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a description and structural account of multi‐verb constructions in Twi, focusing on differentiating coordinate from <b>non‐coordinate</b> structures, a task {{which has been}} neglected {{in the literature on}} Twi. Extraction in the form of predicate clefting shows that Twi contains both coordinate and <b>non‐coordinate</b> multi‐verb constructions; a coordinate structure does not permit predicate clefting of either verb whereas a <b>non‐coordinate</b> structure permits predicate clefting of V 1. Predicate clefting facts also elucidate the structure of non‐coordinating multi‐verb constructions in Twi; that V 1 but not V 2 can be predicate clefted suggests an asymmetry within the clause. I conclude that multi‐verb constructions such as (2) and (3) are serializing as explained by Aboh’s (2009) account of serialization—-though verbs appearing as V 1 in these constructions seem to be fully lexical when they appear in mono‐clausal structure (i. e. they assign thematic roles to internal and external arguments), V 1 is functional and V 2 is lexical. Apparent 'object sharing’ is thus {{explained by the fact that}} only the functional V 2 introduces the object, after which movement derives the V 1 + OBJ + V 2 surface word order. Furthermore, departing from traditional characterizations of SVCs, I argue that observed tense and aspect marking patterns necessitate that V 2 ’s extended projection reach the TP level. Finally, I show that though an overt pronoun follows V 2 in constructions like (2), this overt pronoun can be accounted for by the necessity that the edge of a Spell‐Out domain be pronounced in Twi (Kandybowicz 2010); thus (2) and (3) are structurally similar...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} channel noise {{on the performance of}} coordinated and <b>non-coordinated</b> MAC protocols. Comparative evaluations of these protocols under a perfect channel assumption have shown that coordinated MAC protocols, which regulate channel access locally, outperform noncoordinated channel access schemes in terms of energy efficiency and throughput. However, coordinated MAC protocols are more vulnerable than <b>non-coordinated</b> MAC protocols to channel noise due to their dependence on the robustness of the control traffic. In order to observe the degradation in performance of a coordinated MAC protocol (MH-TRACE), {{we investigate}} the impact of losing control packets. Furthermore, the performance in terms of throughput, delay, and energy efficiency of both coordinated (MH-TRACE) and <b>non-coordinated</b> (IEEE 802. 11) MAC protocols is explored using a general error model that takes into account the length of the packets. Our results show that despite its higher level of vulnerability, the coordinated MAC protocol’s performance is superior to the performance of the <b>non-coordinated</b> MAC protocol even when error rates are high.

40|$|Channel {{assignment}} in wireless mesh network (WMN) aims at improving the network throughput by utilizing multiple orthogonal frequency channels {{to minimize the}} interference. Interference can be categorized as coordinated and <b>non-coordinated,</b> depending upon the relative location of the interfering links. Compared to coordinated interference, <b>non-coordinated</b> interference has a severe adverse impact on throughput. This thesis {{is based on the}} hypothesis that the network throughput can be improved significantly, if channel assignment minimizes <b>non-coordinated</b> interference with priority. We propose a static and centralized channel assignment scheme CCAS to show the effectiveness of the hypothesis. The cluster-based approach of CCAS minimizes <b>non-coordinated</b> interference with reduced complexity. CCAS improves the network throughput by up to 80 %, compared to the existing schemes. We propose topology control scheme MATS that constructs low interference multipath network topology using a subset of links from physical topology. We report an additional improvement of up to 10 % in the network throughput, when CCAS assigns channels to the links selected by MATS. In the final part of the thesis, we formulate generalized channel assignment as an optimization problem, accounting for real network traffic. The objective of the problem is to select the channels for links such that maximum incident traffic can be transmitted over the links, while ensuring a fair distribution of throughput amongst links and elimination of <b>non-coordinated</b> interference. For a given network and incident traffic, the solution to this problem generates the channel assignment resulting in optimal network throughput. We propose dynamic and distributed scheme LYCAS as an approximate solution to the problem. LYCAS employs MATS to construct network topology and cluster-based approach of CCAS to minimize <b>non-coordinated</b> interference. In addition, it periodically updates the assignment of channels to adapt to the changing traffic load.

30|$|According to the authors, two links {{are said}} to be coordinated interfering links if the {{transmitters}} of links are within carrier sensing range of each other. These coordinated transmitters prevent each other from concurrent transmissions, resulting in negligible packet collisions. On the other hand, if transmitters of the two interfering links are not within carrier sensing range of each other, three additional categories of interference - near hidden, far hidden, and information asymmetric - are possible. We collectively refer to the interference caused by these categories as <b>non-coordinated</b> (non-CO) interference. In case of <b>non-coordinated</b> interfering links, the two transmitters cannot sense the transmissions of each other. This results in increased probability of collisions. Particularly, among <b>non-coordinated</b> interference, information asymmetric interference is the most detrimental in terms of unfair channel sharing and end-to-end throughput performance [32]. The asymmetry of the channel view of the two information asymmetric interfering links allows one link to achieve its maximum throughput while the other link starves. Consequently, bottleneck links are introduced in the network, leading to reduced end-to-end throughput. Therefore, an efficient routing scheme is required, which considers coordinated as well as asymmetric <b>non-coordinated</b> interactions of transmitters and receivers during path construction procedure to avoid such bottleneck links.|$|R
