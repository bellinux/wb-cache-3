5|$|Most ZnO has <b>n-type</b> character, even in {{the absence}} of {{intentional}} doping. Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of <b>n-type</b> character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable <b>n-type</b> doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the year}} 2000, {{there was a}} wave of {{attempts}} to dope synthetic CVD diamond films by sulfur aiming at <b>n-type</b> conductivity with low activation energy. Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the conductivity was rendered p-type instead of <b>n-type</b> and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient p-type dopant in diamond.|$|E
5|$|In the {{semiconductor}} industry, POCl3 {{is used as}} a safe liquid phosphorus source in diffusion processes. The phosphorus acts as a dopant used to create <b>n-type</b> layers on a silicon wafer.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a semiconductor, {{which can}} be doped <b>n-type</b> by {{nitrogen}} or phosphorus and p-type by beryllium, boron, aluminium, or gallium. Metallic conductivity has been achieved by heavy doping with boron, aluminium or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride can be doped p-type with {{beryllium}} and <b>n-type</b> with boron, sulfur, silicon or if co-doped {{with carbon}} and nitrogen. Both hexagonal and cubic BN are wide-gap semiconductors with a band-gap energy {{corresponding to the}} UV region. If voltage is applied to h-BN or c-BN, then it emits UV light in the range 215–250nm and therefore can potentially be used as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers.|$|E
5|$|Current {{limitations}} to p-doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of <b>n-type</b> and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; {{as well as}} copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p-type conduction at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|ZnO highly <b>n-type</b> doped with Al, Ga, or In is {{transparent}} and conductive (transparency ~90%, lowest resistivity ~10−4 Ω·cm). ZnO:Al coatings {{are used for}} energy-saving or heat-protecting windows. The coating lets the visible part of the spectrum in but either reflects the infrared (IR) radiation {{back into the room}} (energy saving) or does not let the IR radiation into the room (heat protection), depending on which side of the window has the coating.|$|E
5|$|ZnO is {{a wide-bandgap}} {{semiconductor}} of the II-VI semiconductor group. The native doping of the semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is <b>n-type.</b> This semiconductor has several favorable properties, including good transparency, high electron mobility, wide bandgap, and strong room-temperature luminescence. Those properties are valuable in emerging applications for: transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, energy-saving or heat-protecting windows, and electronics as thin-film transistors and light-emitting diodes.|$|E
5|$|Five metalloids—boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic and antimony—can {{be found}} in cell phones (along with at least 39 other metals and nonmetals). Tellurium is {{expected}} to find such use. Of the less often recognised metalloids, phosphorus, gallium (in particular) and selenium have semiconductor applications. Phosphorus is used in trace amounts as a dopant for <b>n-type</b> semiconductors. The commercial use of gallium compounds is dominated by semiconductor applications—in integrated circuits; cell phones; laser diodes; light-emitting diodes; photodetectors; and solar cells. Selenium {{is used in the}} production of solar cells and in high-energy surge protectors.|$|E
5|$|Samarium {{carbides}} {{are prepared}} by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with the bandgap of 1.10eV, {{the same as}} in silicon, and high electrical conductivity of <b>n-type.</b> It can be prepared by annealing at 1100°C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1°C/min. Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800°C.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or <b>n-type</b> semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin <b>N-type</b> struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
25|$|Electron-donating (<b>n-type)</b> dopants {{can also}} be used to create {{conductive}} polyacetylene. <b>n-Type</b> dopants for polyacetylene include lithium, sodium, and potassium. As with p-type dopants, charge-transfer complexes are created, where the polymer backbone is anionic and the donor is cationic. The increase in conductivity upon treatment with an <b>n-type</b> dopant is not as significant as those achieved upon treatment with a p-type dopant. Polyacetylene chains doped with <b>n-type</b> dopants are extremely sensitive to air and moisture.|$|E
25|$|This {{structure}} with p-type body {{is the basis}} of the <b>n-type</b> MOSFET, which requires the addition of <b>n-type</b> source and drain regions.|$|E
25|$|In trace amounts, {{phosphorus}} {{is used as}} a dopant for <b>n-type</b> semiconductors.|$|E
25|$|The WABCO <b>N-type</b> is {{sometimes}} referred to as the pin and cup coupler or spear coupler.|$|E
25|$|So, {{the word}} type in general refers to any <b>n-type,</b> partial or complete, over any chosen set of {{parameters}} (possibly the empty set).|$|E
25|$|A p–n {{junction}} diode {{is made of}} a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an <b>n-type</b> semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the <b>n-type</b> and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the <b>n-type</b> and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the <b>N-type</b> side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E
25|$|The first {{heterojunction}} diode lasers were single-heterojunction lasers. These lasers utilized aluminum {{gallium arsenide}} p-type injectors situated over <b>n-type</b> gallium arsenide layers grown on the substrate by LPE. An admixture of aluminum replaced gallium in the semiconductor crystal {{and raised the}} bandgap of the p-type injector over that of the <b>n-type</b> layers beneath. It worked; the 300 K threshold currents went down by 10× to 10,000 amperes per square centimeter. Unfortunately, this was still not in the needed range and these single-heterostructure diode lasers did not function in continuous wave operation at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, it was {{reported}} that heterojunction solar cells grown epitaxially on <b>n-type</b> monocrystalline silicon wafers had reached an efficiency of 22.5% over a total cell area of 243.4cm.|$|E
25|$|<b>N-type</b> calcium {{channels}} {{are found in}} neurons and {{are involved in the}} release of neurotransmitter at synapses. Ziconotide is a selective blocker of these calcium channels and acts as an analgesic.|$|E
25|$|Lehovec tested {{his idea}} using the {{technologies}} of making transistors {{that were available}} at Sprague. His device was a linear structure 2.2×0.5×0.1mm in size, which was divided into isolated <b>n-type</b> cells (bases of the future transistors) by p-n junctions. Layers and transitions were formed by growth from the melt. The conductivity type {{was determined by the}} pulling speed of the crystal: an indium-rich p-type layer was formed at a slow speed, whereas an arsenic-rich <b>n-type</b> layer was produced at a high speed. The collectors and emitters of the transistors were created by welding indium beads. All electrical connections were made by hand, using gold wires.|$|E
25|$|Ziconotide, a peptide {{compound}} {{derived from}} the omega-conotoxin, is a selective <b>N-type</b> calcium channel blocker that has potent analgesic properties that are equivalent to approximate 1,000 times that of morphine. It must be delivered via the intrathecal (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid) route via an intrathecal infusion pump.|$|E
25|$|Polycrystalline silicon wafers {{are made}} by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 {{micrometer}} wafers. The wafers are usually lightly p-type-doped. A surface diffusion of <b>n-type</b> dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p–n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.|$|E
25|$|A bipolar {{junction}} transistor (bipolar transistor or BJT) {{is a type of}} transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers. In contrast, unipolar transistors, such as field-effect transistors, only use one kind of charge carrier. For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two semiconductor types, <b>n-type</b> and p-type.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{designer}} and aviation pioneer Alfred Verville working with Lawrence Sperry, conceived the aircraft {{to perform a}} similar role as the Curtiss HS series of flying boats, with the added ability to operate from land bases. The machine was an equal span two bay triplane with <b>N-type</b> interplane struts of all wood construction.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{histamine}} receptors, the H3 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor. The H3 receptor is {{coupled to}} the Gi G-protein, so {{it leads to}} inhibition {{of the formation of}} cAMP. Also, the β and γ subunits interact with <b>N-type</b> voltage gated calcium channels, to reduce action potential mediated influx of calcium and hence reduce neurotransmitter release.|$|E
25|$|For {{soldering}} semiconductor materials, e.g. {{die attachment}} of silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide, {{it is important}} that the solder contains no impurities that could cause doping in the wrong direction. For soldering <b>n-type</b> semiconductors, solder may be doped with antimony; indium may be added for soldering p-type semiconductors. Pure tin and pure gold can be used.|$|E
25|$|A {{point-contact}} diode works {{the same as}} the junction diodes described below, but its construction is simpler. A pointed metal wire is placed in contact with an <b>n-type</b> semiconductor. Some metal migrates into the semiconductor to make a small p-type region around the contact. The 1N34 germanium version is still used in radio receivers as a detector and occasionally in specialized analog electronics.|$|E
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an <b>n-type</b> semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining <b>n-type</b> silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two <b>n-type</b> regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E
25|$|The Tomlinson coupler was {{developed}} by the Ohio Brass Company for mass transit applications, but eventually found use in some mainline railroad vehicles as well. It consists of two squared metal hooks that engage with each other in a larger rectangular frame with air line connections above and below. Since the coupler's development the manufacturing arm of Ohio Brass was purchased by WABCO which now manufacturers the line along with the <b>N-type.</b> The Tomlinson coupler is the most widely used fully automatic heavy rail coupling in North America having been adopted by the DC Metro, MBTA, PATCO Speedline, SEPTA Broad Street Subway, LA Metro, Baltimore Metro, Miami Metro, MARTA Rail and the New York City Subway for its R44/R46 fleet and all modern classes starting with the R142. For applications outside of rapid transit the coupler had to be significantly enlarged to meet the increased strength requirements first appearing in this capacity on the Budd Metroliner and later on the Illinois Central Highliner fleet. Its relative lack of strength is one reason the <b>N-Type</b> has been more successful in the mainline railroad arena.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{metallic}} arsenic is in alloys of lead (for example, in car batteries and ammunition). Arsenic {{is a common}} <b>n-type</b> dopant in semiconductor electronic devices, and the optoelectronic compound gallium arsenide {{is the second most}} commonly used semiconductor after doped silicon. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of pesticides, treated wood products, herbicides, and insecticides. These applications are declining, however.|$|E
25|$|Crosslinking anti-Thy-1 Ab {{can promote}} neurite {{outgrowth}} which {{is dependent on}} G{alpha}i and L- and <b>N-type</b> calcium channel activation. The ligand for promotion of neurite outgrowth on astrocytes is not yet identified, but the inhibitory ligand has been suggested to be integrins. Thy1 {{is one of the}} known ligands of beta 3 integrins. Interaction of thy1 expressed on maturing axons with beta 3 integrins expressed on mature astrocytes may be the cause of halting of axon growth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an <b>n-type</b> switch, the body is {{connected}} to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate–Vtn. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.|$|E
25|$|A {{thyristor}} is a solid-state {{semiconductor device}} with four layers of alternating P and <b>N-type</b> materials. It acts exclusively as a bistable switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, {{and continuing to}} conduct while the voltage across the device is not reversed (forward-biased). A three-lead thyristor is designed to control the larger current of its two leads by combining that current with the smaller current of its other lead, known as its control lead. In contrast, a two-lead thyristor is designed to switch on if the potential difference between its leads is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).|$|E
25|$|Balanced charge {{injection}} {{and transfer}} {{are required to}} get high internal efficiency, pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers, and high stability. A common way to balance charge is optimizing {{the thickness of the}} charge transporting layers but is hard to control. Another way is using the exciplex. Exciplex formed between hole-transporting (p-type) and electron-transporting (<b>n-type)</b> side chains to localize electron-hole pairs. Energy is then transferred to luminophore and provide high efficiency. An example of using exciplex is grafting Oxadiazole and carbazole side units in red diketopyrrolopyrrole-doped Copolymer main chain shows improved external quantum efficiency and color purity in no optimized OLED.|$|E
