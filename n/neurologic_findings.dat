50|$|Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome “PANS” is a {{clinically}} defined disorder {{characterized by}} the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms “OCD” or eating restrictions, concomitant with acute behavioral deterioration and/or motor/sensory changes {{in at least two}} of eight domains. Additional psychiatric symptoms include anxiety (typically separation anxiety), attention deficit, hyperkinesis, emotional lability and/or depression, irritability, aggressiveness or oppositional behavior, and academic as well as cognitive decline. Associated <b>neurologic</b> <b>findings</b> include thought disorders, mental impairments, motor or vocal tics, increased sensory sensitivities, choreiform finger movements, deteriorating penmanship, and urinary frequency and/or enuresis.

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of brain abscess {{are caused by}} a combination of increased intracranial pressure due to a space-occupying lesion (headache, vomiting, confusion, coma), infection (fever, fatigue etc.) and focal neurologic brain tissue damage (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.). The most frequent presenting symptoms are headache, drowsiness, confusion, seizures, hemiparesis or speech difficulties together with fever with a rapidly progressive course. The symptoms and findings depend largely on the specific location of the abscess in the brain. An abscess in the cerebellum, for instance, may cause additional complaints as a result of brain stem compression and hydrocephalus. Neurological examination may reveal a stiff neck in occasional cases (erroneously suggesting meningitis). The famous triad of fever, headache and focal <b>neurologic</b> <b>findings</b> are highly suggestive of brain abscess.|$|E
40|$|Trigeminal {{neuropathy}} usually presents with sensory disturbance. 1 - 4 The predominant <b>neurologic</b> <b>finding</b> is hypesthesia in {{the territory}} {{of one or more}} divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Combined motor and sensory involvement can occasionally be seen in a mandibular branch (V 3) lesion since combined sensory and motor fibers form the fascicular portion prior to exiting at the lower pontine level. Combined sensory and motor V 3 lesions have been reported with extradural tumors, trauma, 5 and viral infection. 4 However, pure trigeminal motor neuropathy is rarely reported. 6 - 11 We present a patient with unilateral trigeminal motor weakness and muscle atrophy which were not accompanied by trige-minal sensory involvement.

40|$|Congenital {{vertebral}} malformations {{are common}} in brachycephalic "screw-tailed" dog breeds such as French bulldogs, English bulldogs, Boston terriers, and pugs. The aim of this retrospective {{study was to determine}} whether a radiographic classification scheme developed for use in humans would be feasible for use in these dog breeds. Inclusion criteria were hospital admission between September 2009 and April 2013, <b>neurologic</b> examination <b>findings</b> available, diagnostic quality lateral and ventro-dorsal digital radiographs of the thoracic vertebral column, and at least one congenital vertebral malformation. Radiographs were retrieved and interpreted by two observers who were unaware of neurologic status. Vertebral malformations were classified based on a classification scheme modified from a previous human study and a consensus of both observers. Twenty-eight dogs met inclusion criteria (12 with neurologic deficits, 16 with no neurologic deficits). Congenital vertebral malformations affected 85 / 362 (23. 5 %) of thoracic vertebrae. Vertebral body formation defects were the most common (butterfly vertebrae 6. 6 %, ventral wedge-shaped vertebrae 5. 5 %, dorsal hemivertebrae 0. 8 %, and dorso-lateral hemivertebrae 0. 5 %). No lateral hemivertebrae or lateral wedge-shaped vertebrae were identified. The T 7 vertebra was the most commonly affected (11 / 28 dogs), followed by T 8 (8 / 28 dogs) and T 12 (8 / 28 dogs). The number and type of vertebral malformations differed between groups (P = 0. 01). Based on MRI, dorsal, and dorso-lateral hemivertebrae were the cause of spinal cord compression in 5 / 12 (41. 6 %) of dogs with <b>neurologic</b> deficits. <b>Findings</b> indicated that a modified human radiographic classification system of vertebral malformations is feasible for use in future studies of brachycephalic "screw-tailed" dogs...|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{clinical}} disease caused by Angiostrongylus invasion {{into the central}} nervous system is commonly referred to as [...] "eosinophilic meningitis", the actual pathophysiology is of a meningoencephalitis with invasion not just of the meninges, or superficial lining of the brain, but also deeper brain tissue. Initial invasion through the lining of the brain, the meninges, may cause a typical inflammation of the meninges and a classic meningitis picture of headache, stiff neck and often fever. The parasites subsequently invade deeper into the brain tissue, causing specific localizing neurologic symptoms depending on where in the brain parenchyma they migrate. <b>Neurologic</b> <b>findings</b> and symptoms wax and wane as initial damage is done by the physical in-migration of the worms and secondary damage is done by the inflammatory response to the presence of dead and dying worms.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} the auditory brainstem response as a reliable test for the neurologic prognosis of infants with neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia, auditory brainstem response studies were performed in 22 infants. The patients were followed up until 12 months of age. Two patients demonstrated pathologic auditory brainstem response consistent with auditory neuropathy but had no <b>neurologic</b> <b>finding</b> except a lack of speech at 12 months of age. Two other patients had neurologic sequelae, one showing severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy, the other mild hypotonia and motor retardation, but their auditory brainstem response results were nor-mal. These results suggested that auditory brainstem response examination might not provide reliable information for the neu-rologic prognosis. Neurologic disturbances resulting from biliru-bin neurotoxicity can be seen in patients with a normal auditory brainstem response, but patients with an abnormal auditory brain-stem response may not have any neurologic dysfunction apart from speech retardation. (J Child NeuroL 2001; 16 : 772 - 775). Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia is still an important medical problem because of the risk of neurotoxicity. 1, 2 The diagnosis of neurologic dysfunction related to kernicterus is still based on the clinical findings. 1, 3, 1 Various degrees of hearing impairment with or without other neurologic sequelae can be seen in infants with postkernicteric encephalopathy. 11 The auditory brainstem response is a noninvasive and reliable method for evaluating the electrophysiologic functions of the sub-cortical auditory structures. 8 - 1 O Although {{the value of the}} auditory brainstem response in early diagnosis of auditory neuropathy in cases with neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia has been reported during the last 20 years, its predictive value to assess the neuro-logic prognosis is not yet clear. 1, 6, 8 - 11 1 This study was performed to {{investigate the}} prognostic value of the auditory brainstem response in the otherwise healthy term newborn with indirect hyperbilirubinemia The relationship between auditory brainstem response results and neurologic outcome was assessed...|$|R

40|$|Four {{children}} with biotinidase deficiency were identified {{during the first}} year of a neonatal screening program for this disease in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Two unrelated probands were identified among the 81, 243 newborn infants who were screened. In addition, two siblings of one of these infants were found to be affected. Both probands had mild neurologic symptoms at two and four months, respectively, and the two older children had more severe <b>neurologic</b> abnormalities, cutaneous <b>findings,</b> and developmental delay at two and three years of age. However, none of the affected children had acute metabolic decompensation.
