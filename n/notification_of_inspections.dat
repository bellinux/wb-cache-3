40|$|The on-site {{inspection}} provisions in many current and proposed arms control agreements require extensive preparation and {{training on the}} part of both the Inspected Party and the Inspection Team. Current training techniques include table-top inspections and practice inspections. The Augmented Computer Exercise for Inspection Training (ACE-IT), an interactive computer training tool, increases the utility <b>of</b> table-top <b>inspections.</b> ACE-IT has been designed to provide training for a hypothetical challenge inspection under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC); however, this training tool can be modified for other inspection regimes. Although ACE-IT provides training from <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> an <b>inspection</b> through post-inspection activities, the primary emphasis of ACE-IT is in the inspection itself [...] particularly with the concept of managed access. ACE-IT also demonstrates how inspection provisions impact compliance determination and the protection of sensitive information. The Exercise Manual supplements the ACE-IT software by providing general information on {{on-site inspection}}s and detailed information for the CWC challenge inspection exercise. The detailed information includes the pre-inspection briefing, maps, list of sensitive items, medical records, and shipping records...|$|R
40|$|The on-site {{inspection}} provisions in many current and proposed arms control agreements require extensive preparation and {{training on the}} part <b>of</b> both the <b>Inspection</b> Teams (inspectors) and Inspected Parties (hosts). Traditional training techniques include lectures, table-top inspections, and practice inspections. The Augmented Computer Exercise for Inspection Training (ACE-IT), an interactive computer training tool, increases the utility <b>of</b> table-top <b>inspections.</b> ACE-IT is used for training both inspectors and hosts to conduct a hypothetical challenge inspection under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The training covers the entire sequence {{of events in the}} challenge inspection regime, from initial <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> an <b>inspection</b> through post-inspection activities. The primary emphasis of the training tool is on conducting the inspection itself, and in particular, implementing the concept of managed access. (Managed access is a technique used to assure the inspectors that the facility is in compliance with the CWC, {{while at the same time}} protecting sensitive information unrelated to the CWC.) Information for all of the activities is located in the electronic {open_quotes}Exercise Manual. {close_quotes} In addition, interactive menus are used to negotiate access to each room and to alternate information during the simulated inspection.

The Augmented Computer Exercise for Inspection Training (ACE-IT), an interactive computer training tool, increases the utility <b>of</b> table-top <b>inspections.</b> Under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) challenge inspections are short-notice inspections that may occur anywhere, anytime, and with no right of refusal. The time interval between notice of intent to inspect a facility {{and the arrival of}} inspectors at the facility may be as short as 72 hours. Therefore, advance training is important. ACE-IT is used for training both the Inspection Team (inspector) and the Inspected Party (host) to conduct a hypothetical challenge inspection under the CWC. An exercise moderator controls the exercise. The training covers all of the events in the challenge inspection regime, from initial <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> an <b>inspection</b> through post-inspection activities.

40|$|Parents {{choosing}} homeschooling as {{an educational}} choice for their children has been increasing in the global community. Countries have chosen various methods of adapting to this trend, ranging from outright bans on homeschooling to allowing the practice with no oversight. In the United States this option has resulted in many students who are removed from formal educational structures and states have failed to monitor the progress of these children. To ensure that states are able to meet their interest in an educated citizenry, this Note proposes a statutory scheme that would provide for consistent homeschooling regulation across the United States. Modeled in parts after No Child Left Behind, Common Core, and the New York home education statue, the scheme would allow states to adopt regulation policies including <b>notification,</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> curricula, and testing requirements...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
