40|$|In a {{draining}} rotating {{fluid flow}} background, surface perturbations behave as a scalar field on a rotating effective black hole spacetime. We propose {{a new model}} for the background flow which {{takes into account the}} varying depth of the water. Numerical integration of the associated Klein-Gordon equation using accessible experimental parameters shows that gravity waves in an appropriate frequency range are amplified through the mechanism of superradiance. Our numerical results suggest that the observation of this phenomenon in a common fluid mechanical system is within experimental reach. Unlike the case of wave scattering around Kerr black holes, which depends only on one dimensionless background parameter (the ratio $a/M$ between the specific angular momentum and the mass of the black hole), our system depends on two dimensionless background parameters, namely the <b>normalized</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> and surface gravity at the effective black hole horizon.

Conversely, whenever two patterns show no difference in perceived <b>angular</b> <b>velocity,</b> even if in fact rotating at different <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> we find no difference in the time to undergo motion fading.
