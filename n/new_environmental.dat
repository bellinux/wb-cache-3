5|$|After {{not being}} {{selected}} to become Labour's {{candidate in the}} 2000 London mayoral election, Livingstone successfully contested the election as an independent candidate. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the congestion charge, Oyster card, and articulated buses, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of London Underground. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the Iraq War, Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was re-elected in 2004, expanding his transport policies, introducing <b>new</b> <b>environmental</b> regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's East End, his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of 2008 and 2012, losing both to the Conservative candidate Boris Johnson. In 2016, accused of bringing the party into disrepute, he was suspended from Labour.|$|E
5|$|<b>New</b> <b>environmental</b> {{technologies}} in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court {{ruled that}} NYSDOT had {{to provide a}} <b>new</b> <b>environmental</b> report by May12, 1989 or face having the {{reconstruction}} shut down. The order by the court reversed {{a decision by the}} New York State Supreme Court that determined that a revised report was unnecessary. Residents of Westbury claimed that the project would bring noise concerns to the village, along with a spillover of diverted traffic to local roads. Concerns were also stated by then-mayor Ernest Strada about Westbury's water supply and potential impacts from the project. NYSDOT claimed that no disruption would be caused by the project, but Strada insisted there were still concerns. Strada also stated that the village had no interest in shutting down the project; rather, they wanted to ensure that their community would be protected from any disruptions caused by the reconstruction. On April24, NYSDOT announced they had appealed the stoppage of work on the interchange, which had been suspended pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state.|$|E

25|$|On July 9, 1970, Nixon {{proposed}} an executive reorganization that consolidated many environmental {{responsibilities of the}} federal government under one agency, a <b>new</b> <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency.

25|$|On 23 March, MEXT {{released}} <b>new</b> <b>environmental</b> data. Radioactivity readings for {{soil and}} pond samples were highest at one location 40km {{northwest of the}} plant.

Cs-137 of 163kBq/kg is equal to 3,260kBq/m2.|$|E

25|$|As a result, the Deputy Prime Minister said in January 2003 {{that the}} project would not receive {{approval}} and that Network Rail (which had replaced Railtrack by this time) must submit improved proposals and a <b>new</b> <b>Environmental</b> Statement. The delay also led to the 'Thameslink 2000 Agreement', the contract that obliged Network Rail/Railtrack to maintain responsibility for funding the project, being terminated in April 2003. Responsibility for project funding was subsequently transferred to the Strategic Rail Authority.|$|E
25|$|Floods Along the Amazon River {{there is}} a complex mosaic of fluvial forms, {{including}} channels, active sandbars, islands, levees, scroll-dominated plains, and abandoned belts highly prone to floods in the summer months. Hydrological variability and rapidly growing urban areas have caused <b>new</b> <b>environmental</b> problems in Brazilian cities, such as inundations in non-planned river basins.

The capsule system from previous games also returned, allowing players to customize their characters.|$|E
25|$|The already {{existing}} Pomeranian culture expanded further when the Lusatian culture entered the crisis stage. In the 5th century BC major acquisitions {{took place in}} the western and southern directions, when northern Silesia and Lesser Poland were taken over. The older Lusatian populations were pushed out or assimilated. The Pomeranians themselves were changing in the process, either as a result of encountering <b>new</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions, or because of being influenced by the Lusatian people (face-urns for example disappeared here). In the 3rd century the Pomeranian culture in its original form mostly vanished, with regional enclaves only surviving till the middle of the 2nd century BC.|$|E
