5|$|The <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> (also {{known as}} Artsakh among Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized. Today, the Republic of Armenia and <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> are de facto {{functioning}} as one entity, although the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> territory is internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is more monoethnic than the Republic of Armenia, with 99.7% {{of its population}} being Armenian. The Azerbaijani minority {{was forced to leave}} during the war. The areas outside the original NKAO borders taken over by the Armenian forces during the war are mostly uninhabited or very sparsely inhabited, with the city of Lachin being exception. Between 2000 and 2011, 25,000 to 30,000 people settled in NKR.|$|E
5|$|Vazgen Sargsyan {{was awarded}} the Hero of Artsakh title, the highest award of the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic,</b> in 1998. On 27 December 1999, {{two months after the}} {{parliament}} shooting, Sargsyan was posthumously given the National Hero of Armenia title. He widely is recognized as the founder of the Armenian army.|$|E
5|$|Armenia {{has participated}} in the Eurovision Song Contest, a pan-European music competition, since 2006, while Azerbaijan has participated since 2008. The {{continuing}} conflict {{between the two countries}} over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which {{is considered to be a}} de jure part of Azerbaijan by the United Nations, but has been under control of the Armenia-backed de facto <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> since 1993, has affected the Eurovision Song Contest on several occasions.|$|E
2500|$|Following the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic's</b> {{declaration}} of independence, the Azerbaijani government abolished the NKAO and created Azerbaijani districts in its place. As a result, {{some of the}} Republic of Artsakh's divisions correspond with the Azerbaijani districts, while others have different borders. A comparative table of the current divisions of Artsakh and the corresponding districts of Azerbaijan follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Nagorno Karabakh and {{adjacent}} territories belonging to historical Artsakh (some of which {{fell under the}} <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic's</b> control in 1992-1994) has been called an open-sky treasure-house of various forms of Armenian architecture. Overall, Nagorno-Karabakh hosts several thousand architectural artifacts and historical monuments in a larger sense. In addition to ecclesiastical structures, this number includes samples of civil architecture, ancient castles and fortresses as well as numerous khachkars.|$|R

The Decree on Establishment of Nagorno-Karabakh Oblast of Azerbaijan Central Executive Committee date July 7, 1923 and the Law on Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of Azerbaijan SSR dated June 16, 1981 were considered stale.|$|R
5|$|The {{event has}} been {{described}} by historians as a decapitation strike, which was intended to deprive the Armenian population of leadership and a chance for resistance. To commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide, 24 April is observed as Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day. First observed in 1919 on the four-year anniversary of the events in Constantinople, the date is generally considered the date on which the genocide began. The Armenian Genocide has since been commemorated annually on the same day, which has become a national holiday in Armenia and the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> and is observed by the Armenian diaspora around the world.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{estimate}} {{that with the}} accession of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> would not {{be integrated into the}} Eurasian Union. Armenia is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia will build no customs border including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E
5000|$|Government {{documents}} from Transnistria {{state that the}} republic has [...] "established and maintained friendly relations with countries seeking recognition." [...] To this end, it said that relations would continue to develop in a friendly manner with the three states/political entities it has relations with: the Republic of Abkhazia, the <b>Republic</b> of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh,</b> and the <b>Republic</b> of South Ossetia.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, V.M.Sysoyev {{registered}} stone {{sculptures of}} horses and sheep in following points of Absheron peninsula, on Muslim cemetery in Zikh village, in Kuturlu village of Kurdistan uyezd, in Muslim cemetery of Qarağac village of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Autonomous <b>Republic,</b> in Aznaburt, Azi (lower part), Vanand, Danagird (in Armenian cemetery) of Nakhchivan’s border, in Nakhchivan (city), Ananab village, in Armenian church in Erzincan, in Abidere, Balaburm Garidy, Lerik, Tangarud, Eychara villages of Lankaran uyezd, during the working process on archeological map of Azerbaijan. Sysoyev also noted that, local residents of Ordubad, Danagirt and Abrakunis find out these figures in ancient cemeteries, in mountains and other places, {{attach importance to}} them, frequently bring them from there and put on graves of their dears. An exemplar of stone sheep was also in park “in the square”, in Borjomi, which was brought from outskirts. In 1925, this sheep was vanished and taken away by the Kura River, during flood of the river. Artistically created figure of sheep was in Barda village near Yevlakh. Fate of that sheep, a photo of which is kept in archive of the Azerbaijan State Museum of History, is unknown at present.|$|R
50|$|The frozen {{conflict}} over currently largely Armenian-populated region of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> within the <b>Republic</b> of Azerbaijan began when in 1988 the Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh demanded autonomy with demonstrations and persecutions against ethnic Azeris following in Armenia. This led to anti-Armenian rioting in Azerbaijan, with Azerbaijani militias beginning {{their effort to}} expel Armenians from the enclave. In 1992 a war broke out and pogroms of Armenians and Azeris forced both groups to flee their homes. In 1994, a Russian-brokered ceasefire ended the war but more than 1 million ethnic Armenians and Azeris are still not able to return home. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved despite negotiations, that are ongoing since 1992 {{under the aegis of}} the Minsk Group of the OSCE, to resolve the conflict peacefully.|$|R
5|$|In early April 1993, the Armenian forces {{captured}} Kelbajar, a city {{outside the}} originally contested areas, causing international {{attention to the}} conflict. Turkey closed its border with Armenia, while the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the act. In the summer of 1993, Armenian forces gained more territories and, by August controlled Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan. By early 1994, both countries were devastated by the war. On 5 May, the Bishkek Protocol was signed by {{the heads of the}} parliaments of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic,</b> backed by Armenia, established de facto control of these lands. Nagorno-Karabakh (also known as Artsakh to Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized and a de jure part of Azerbaijan. However, it is in de facto unified with Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Kelbajar lay {{outside the}} contested enclave {{of the former}} Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, but within Nagorno-Karabakh {{geographic}} region of Azerbaijan, that Armenian and Azerbaijani forces had been fighting over for five years. The offensive {{was the first time}} Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh had advanced beyond the boundaries of the enclave. Kelbajar rayon, located between Armenia and the western border of former NKAO, was composed of several dozen villages and its provincial capital, also named Kelbajar. According to Russian sources mountain troops from the 128th Regiment (7th Russian Army) stationed in Armenia participated in the seizure of Kelbajar in a blitzkrieg operation. After initial heavy resistance, the Azerbaijani defenses quickly collapsed and the provincial capital fell on April 3, 1993. Kelbajar is currently {{under the control of the}} <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pro-independence {{members were}} elected in the {{majority}} to the Armenian parliament in the 1990 election. On 23 August 1990, the Armenian parliament passed a resolution on sovereignty. The tensions grew even larger after the Soviet and Azeri forces deported thousands of Armenian from Shahumyan during Operation Ring in April and May 1991. After the unsuccessful August Putsch, more Soviet republics declared independence. On 2 September 1991, the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> proclaimed independence. On 21 September 1991, the Armenian independence referendum was held with the overwhelming majority voting for the independence of Armenia from the Soviet Union. On 26 November 1991, the Azerbaijani parliament abolished the autonomy of Nagorno-Karabakh. On 10 December 1991, an independence referendum was held in Nagorno-Karabakh, boycotted by the Azeri minority, and gained a vote of 99% in favor of independence.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{historical}} Artsakh presently overlaps {{with the region}} of Nagorno-Karabakh, and is controlled by Artsakh Republic, known as <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> until early 2017.|$|E

25|$|Turkey {{does not}} {{recognize}} the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> that has emerged from the May 16, 1994 Russian mediated cease-fire to the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and has set Armenian withdrawal from the disputed oblast and seven surrounding districts as a precondition for establishing diplomatic relations and reopening their joint border.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Armenian {{military}} servicemen were awarded by orders and medals of Armenia and <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic.</b> Junior sergeant Robert Abajyan was posthumously awarded with Hero of Artsakh {{which is the}} highest honorary title of NKR. He became the youngest person ever to hold the title at 19 years old.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Nagorno-Karabakh War between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Azerbaijan refuses entry to passport-holders of Ukraine and any other country if they are of Armenian descent. It also {{strictly}} refuses entry to foreigners in general whose passport shows evidence of entry into the self-proclaimed <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic,</b> immediately declaring them permanent personae non gratae.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the Supreme Assembly issued a {{non-binding}} declaration recognising {{the sovereignty of}} the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) and calling upon Azerbaijan to do so. While sympathetic to the TRNC, Azerbaijan has not followed suit because doing so could prompt the Republic of Cyprus to recognise the self-proclaimed <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic.</b> Close relations between Nakhchivan and Turkey probably initiated this recognition.|$|E
25|$|Esayi's {{succession}} {{took place}} in ca. 841 and he remained in power for 13 years. Most of his domains included the cantons of Artsakh, which previously had offered a strong resistance against Babak Khorramdin. Esayi's seat was Ktish (Dogh), another important stronghold was Goroz. The ruins of this castles today lie near the villages Toumi and Togh in the province Hadrut of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
25|$|September 10, 2012, Sherinian {{was special}} guest to the Armenian band Dorians {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Yerevan and the first rock concert ever in Artsakh. On September 13, 2012 Glenn Hughes and Sherinian met Bako Sahakyan, the president of de facto independent <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> and organized a concert there. After his visit to Artsakh, Sherinian {{was placed on the}} Azerbaijan black list due to conflict between the two countries.|$|E
25|$|Nagorno-Karabakh’s {{environment}} {{vary from}} steppe on the Kura lowland through dense forests of oak, hornbeam, and beech {{on the lower}} mountain slopes to birchwood and alpine meadows higher up. The region possesses numerous mineral springs and deposits of zinc, coal, lead, gold, marble, and limestone. The major cities of the region are Stepanakert, which serves as {{the capital of the}} <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic,</b> and Shusha, which lies partially in ruins. Vineyards, orchards, and mulberry groves for silkworms are developed in the valleys.|$|E
25|$|Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed territory, internationally {{recognized}} {{as part of}} Azerbaijan, {{but most of the}} region is governed by the Republic of Artsakh (formerly named <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic),</b> a de facto independent state with Armenian ethnic majority established {{on the basis of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Azerbaijan has not exercised political authority over the region since the advent of the Karabakh movement in 1988. Since the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994, representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have been holding peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group on the region's disputed status.|$|E
25|$|Anxious {{that others}} should profit by his discovery, and {{encouraged}} by the patriarch and the king, Mesrop founded numerous schools {{in different parts of}} the country, in which the youth were taught the new alphabet. It is historically proven, that Saint Mesrop himself taught in Amaras monastery of Artskah region of Armenia (located in contemporary Martuni region of unrecognized <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic).</b> But his activity was not confined to Eastern Armenia. Provided with letters from Isaac he went to Constantinople and obtained from the Emperor Theodosius the Younger permission to preach and teach in his Armenian possessions. Having returned to Eastern Armenia to report on his missions to the patriarch, his first thought was to provide a religious literature for his countrymen. Having gathered around him numerous disciples, he sent some to Edessa, Constantinople, Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, and other centres of learning, to study the Greek language and bring back the masterpieces of Greek literature. The most famous of his pupils were John of Egheghiatz, Joseph of Baghin, Yeznik, Koryun, Moses of Chorene, and John Mandakuni.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} escalated into {{a full-scale}} {{war with the}} captured Shusha by Armenian forces on 9 May 1992. By 1993, the Armenian forces took control over not only the originally disputed Nagorno-Karabakh, but also several districts surrounding the region. A ceasefire agreement was eventually signed on 5 May 1994 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. According to Thomas de Waal, three factors contributed to {{the victory of the}} Armenian side: [...] "Azerbaijan's political and military chaos, greater Russian support for the Armenians, and the Armenians' superior fighting skills." [...] Since the 1994 ceasefire, the Armenian <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> has de facto control of the territories taken over in the war.|$|E
500|$|Conflicts {{between the}} two {{countries}} began to develop again during the lead-up to the 2015 contest, where allegations emerged that the Armenian entry, [...] "Don't Deny", was a call for recognition of the Armenian Genocide (whose 100th anniversary was commemorated prior to the 2015 contest). As Azerbaijan denies the genocide, officials from the country issued a statement threatening Armenia for attempting to use Eurovision as an outlet for its [...] "political ambitions". The song was subsequently renamed [...] "Face the Shadow" [...] to address concerns over its alleged political themes. The following year, Armenian representative Iveta Mukuchyan was reprimanded by organizers for displaying the flag of the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> during the first semi-final.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic,</b> supported by the Republic of Armenia, took control over the territory of some 11,500km2, including several districts outside of the originally claimed borders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of the Azerbaijani SSR, creating a [...] "buffer zone". Kelbajar and Lachin districts guarantee solid land corridor between Armenia proper and Nagorno-Karabakh. Between 500,000 and 600,000 Azerbaijanis were displaced from the area. In the meantime, almost all Armenians from Azerbaijan (between 300,000 and 400,000) and Azerbaijanis from Armenia (over 150,000) were forced to move to their respective countries as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible since tensions between the two groups have grown worse {{since the start of the}} conflict in 1988.|$|E
500|$|Vazgen Sargsyan ( [...] , 5 March 1959– 27 October 1999) was an Armenian {{military}} commander and politician. He {{was the first}} Defence Minister of Armenia from 1991 to 1992 and then from 1995 to 1999. He served as Armenia's Prime Minister from 11 June 1999 until his assassination on 27 October of that year. He rose to prominence during the mass movement for the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia in the late 1980s and led Armenian volunteer groups during the early clashes with Azerbaijani forces. Appointed Defence Minister by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan soon after Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union in late 1991, Sargsyan became the most prominent commander of Armenian forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In different positions, he regulated the military operations in the war area until 1994, when a ceasefire was reached ending the war with the de facto unification of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> with Armenia.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, Sargsyan {{pledged that}} he would spare no effort {{to make sure the}} {{elections}} were free and fair. Sargsyan and Demirchyan put the emphasis of their campaign on the economy and the improvement of the life of ordinary Armenians. Talking about Yerkrapah—now politically transformed into the Republican Party—Sargsyan said he was confident [...] "that the people that gained victory on the battlefield will also gain victory in economy." [...] He expressed his optimism saying that they were sure that they [...] "will jointly change something and find the right course." [...] The Unity bloc [...] "called broadly for a democratic society, rule of law, economic reforms and a market economy, with the state also creating conditions for the normal functioning of state enterprises and ensuring decent living standards for all." [...] Throughout the campaign, the Unity bloc was widely considered the favorite of the election. Opposition newspaper Hayots ashkhar suggested that most other political parties in Armenia were gravitating towards the opposite pole, around Kocharyan, National Security & Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and the leadership of the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although the {{platform}} {{of the national}} liberal Heritage party makes no explicit reference to territorial claims, its leader and some its members have expressed their support for them. Heritage supports the formal recognition of the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> by Armenia and has introduced bills for {{the recognition of the}} NKR to the Armenian National Assembly in 2007, 2010, and 2012. Although all three attempts were voted down by the ruling Republican Party. Its leader, Raffi Hovannisian (post-Soviet Armenia's first foreign minister), has hinted at Western Armenia, Javakhk and Nakhichevan with [...] "vague formulations." [...] For instance, during a 2013 speech about his future plans Hovannisian stated that [...] "only with [...] government belonging to the people will we have awareness of our national interest—with Artsakh, Javakhk, Western Armenia—and future for our children." [...] In 2011, a leading party member, Zaruhi Postanjyan, stated in an open letter to presidents of Armenia and NKR that by organizing a repatriation of diaspora Armenians to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, [...] "we will [...] base for the liberation of our entire homeland." ...|$|E
500|$|The <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> <b>Republic</b> leadership, the Armenian intelligentsia and the diaspora, the {{opposition}} also expressed {{their opposition to}} the president’'s support for the proposed settlement plan. Vazgen Sargsyan, who quickly denounced the proposal, became the de facto leader of the opposing group within the government. He was joined by the two Karabakh Armenians in the government: Prime Minister Kocharyan and Interior and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan. These three politicians were referred to as [...] "hardliners" [...] in the Western media for their perceived nationalistic stance. They argued that [...] "Armenia should try to improve its economic performance," [...] while Ter-Petrosyan insisted that Armenia [...] "could only achieve marginal improvements insufficient to address the fear of relative decline and economic exclusion." [...] The Kocharyan cabinet, where Vazgen Sargsyan was a leading figure, called for a [...] "package" [...] deal, [...] "involving a single framework accord on all contentious issues." [...] On 21 October 1997, ten members of the Republic bloc in the parliament left the faction and shifted their support to Vazgen Sargsyan. Ter-Petrosyan's bloc in the parliament was left with a majority of two seats. Despite the great public and political opposition, the Pan-Armenian National Movement voted in favor of Ter-Petrosyan's foreign policy.|$|E
