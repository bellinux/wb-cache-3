5|$|Devers was an {{articulate}} {{proponent of}} the Army's now-emerging tactical doctrine of combined arms: infantry-artillery-armor-close air support. He carried a translation of a German manual on {{the components of the}} panzer division. Devers was neither the first nor the only general to embrace combined arms as the doctrinal {{solution to the problem of}} how best to employ tanks, but he was well-placed to act upon it. At his direction an updated, comprehensive (460 pages) Armed Force Field Manual: Tactics and Technique FM 17–10 was written, published and distributed in March 1942. A German manual on tank platoon tactics, with a foreword by Heinz Guderian, was translated into English and issued as an Armored Force publication. March 1942 saw a reorganization of the armored divisions in the wake of the 1941 maneuvers. Devers added an artillery headquarters to the armored division, and reorganized the artillery component into three battalions, each of three batteries of six M7 Priest self-propelled guns. A division trains headquarters was added to coordinate logistical activities. In a first, at Devers' insistence, a flight of light aircraft to be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance were included in the <b>new</b> <b>Table</b> of Organization and Equipment (TO) for each division. He was a strong and early supporter of the development of the DUKW, an amphibious truck. Vannevar Bush later recalled that in the early stages of its development, Devers was the only man in the Army who fully appreciated its possibilities. Its value would be demonstrated during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Numbers {{does not}} have an {{underlying}} spreadsheet in the traditional sense, but uses multiple individual tables for this purpose. Tables are an X and Y collection of cells, like a sheet, but extend only to the limits of the data they hold. Each section of data, or output from formulas, can be combined into an existing table, or placed into a <b>new</b> <b>table.</b> Tables can be collected by the user onto single or multiple canvases. Whereas a typical Excel sheet has data strewn across it, a Numbers canvas could build the same output through smaller individual tables encompassing the same data.|$|E
500|$|If the {{insertion}} {{would cause the}} load factor of the table (its fraction of occupied cells) to grow above some preset threshold, the whole table may {{be replaced by a}} <b>new</b> <b>table,</b> larger by a constant factor, with a new hash function, as in a dynamic array. Setting this threshold close to zero and using a high growth rate for the table size leads to faster hash table operations but greater memory usage than threshold values close to one and [...] low growth rates. A common choice would be to double the table size when the load factor would exceed 1/2, causing the load factor to stay between 1/4 and 1/2.|$|E

500|$|In {{the chaotic}} climate of {{religious}} upheaval during {{and following the}} Reformation of the 16th century many of England's churches fell into disrepair, including St.Mary's; the great door of St.Mary's was damaged during the Civil War and bullet holes from the conflict remain visible today. In 1606 {{it was decided to}} renovate St.Mary's. Two of the bells were re-cast, the pews were replaced, and [...] "a fair new gallery" [...] was built along the south aisle. In the 18th century two further galleries were added to the church; a north gallery reserved for the exclusive use of [...] "maids and maidservants", and a west gallery for the use of St.Mary's band of musicians and choristers, later used to house the church's organ. The wooden communion table was sold for 3s and a <b>new</b> <b>table</b> added at a cost of 10s6d (about £ as of [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Traditional Chinese {{characters}} {{were used in}} Singapore until 1969, when the Ministry of Education promulgated the Table of Simplified Characters (...) , which while similar to the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme of the People's Republic of China had 40 differences. In 1974 a <b>new</b> <b>Table</b> was published, and this second table was revised in 1976 to remove all differences between simplified Chinese characters in Singapore and China. Although simplified characters are currently used in official documents, {{the government does not}} ban the use of traditional characters. Hence, traditional characters are still used in signs, advertisements and Chinese calligraphy, while books in both character sets are available in Singapore.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} how Dionysius {{established}} the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was [...] "about thirty years old" [...] shortly after [...] "the fifteenth year {{of the reign of}} Tiberius Caesar", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his <b>new</b> <b>table.</b> It is convenient to initiate a calendar not from the very day of an event but from the beginning of a cycle which occurs in close proximity. For example, the Islamic calendar begins not from the date of the Hegira, but rather weeks later, on the first subsequent occurrence of the month of Muharram (corresponding to 16 July 622).|$|E

2500|$|Dionysius is {{best known}} as the {{inventor}} of the Anno Domini era, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar. He used it to identify the several Easters in his Easter table, but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year; he himself stated that the [...] "present year" [...] was [...] "the consulship of Probus Junior", which he also stated was 525 years [...] "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the Diocletian years that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his <b>new</b> <b>table</b> would begin one [...] "Victorian cycle" [...] (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch. The Anno Domini era became dominant in western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable Bede to date the events in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed in 731.|$|E

60|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--... Well, papa {{came back}} from Cornwall just as I came back to my own room, and he was as pleased with his quarry as I {{was to have the}} sight again of his face. During his absence, Henrietta had a little polka (which did not bring the house down on its knees), and I had a {{transparent}} blind put up in my open window. There is a castle in the blind, and a castle gate-way, and two walks, and several peasants, and groves of trees which rise in excellent harmony with the fall of my green damask curtains--new, since you saw me last. Papa insults me with the analogy of a back window in a confectioner's shop, but is obviously moved when the sunshine lights up the castle, notwithstanding. And Mr. Kenyon and everybody in the house grow ecstatic rather than otherwise, as they stand in contemplation before it, and tell me (what is obvious without their evidence) that the effect is beautiful, and that the whole room catches a light from it. Well, and then Mr. Kenyon has given me a <b>new</b> <b>table,</b> with a rail round it to consecrate it from Flush's paws, and large enough to hold all my varieties of vanities.|$|E
60|$|So {{all went}} well with this well-mated pair. Time never dragged. There were always new {{wonderful}} mornings and still cool twilights {{at the end}} of day; and ever a thousand interests claimed him, and his interests were shared by her. More thoroughly than he knew, had he come to a comprehension of the relativity of things. In this new game he played he found in little things all the intensities of gratification and desire that he had found in the frenzied big things when he was a power and rocked half a continent with the fury of the blows he struck. With head and hand, at risk of life and limb, to bit and break a wild colt and win it to the service of man, was to him no less great an achievement. And this <b>new</b> <b>table</b> on which he played the game was clean. Neither lying, nor cheating, nor hypocrisy was here. The other game had made for decay and death, while this new one made for clean strength and life. And so he was content, with Dede at his side, to watch the procession of the days and seasons from the farm-house perched on the canon-lip; to ride through crisp frosty mornings or under burning summer suns; and to shelter in the big room where blazed the logs in the fireplace he had built, while outside the world shuddered and struggled in the storm-clasp of a southeaster.|$|E

Amidst images of war and woe, amidst scenes of carnage and horror of devastation and dismay, it may afford the mind a temporary relief to wander to the magic haunts of the Muses, to bowers and fountains which the despoiling powers of war have never visited, and where the lover pours forth his complaint, or receives the recompense of his constancy. The whole of the subsequent Love Chant is in a warm and impassioned strain. The fifth and last stanzas are, we think, the best.' ...|$|E
