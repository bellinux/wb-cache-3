Tomlinson claimed that MI6 had considered assassinating Slobodan Milošević, the president of Serbia, by staging a car crash using a powerful strobe light to blind the driver. He suggested that Diana and Dodi may {{have been killed by}} MI6 in the same way, although that claim was dismissed at their inquest in 2007. MI6 admitted that plans of that <b>nature</b> <b>had</b> been drafted regarding a different Eastern European official, but that the proposal had been swiftly rejected by management.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, William Parker Foulke {{discovered}} {{the first known}} American dinosaur, in marl pits {{in the small town}} of Haddonfield, New Jersey. (Although fossils had been found before, their <b>nature</b> <b>had</b> not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii. It was an extremely important find: Hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found (the first was in 1834, in Maidstone, England), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Justinian saw the orthodoxy of {{his empire}} {{threatened}} by diverging religious currents, especially Monophysitism, which had many adherents {{in the eastern}} provinces of Syria and Egypt. Monophysite doctrine, which maintains that Jesus Christ had one divine nature or a synthesis of a divine and human <b>nature,</b> <b>had</b> been condemned as a heresy by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of Zeno and Anastasius I had {{been a source of}} tension in the relationship with the bishops of Rome. Justin reversed this trend and confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites. Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them.|$|E

25|$|Although {{mathematics}} {{became more}} and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend.

25|$|Criticality {{in nature}} is uncommon. At three ore {{deposits}} at Oklo in Gabon, sixteen sites (the so-called Oklo Fossil Reactors) {{have been discovered}} at which self-sustaining nuclear fission took place approximately 2billion years ago. Unknown until 1972 (but postulated by Paul Kuroda in 1956), when French physicist Francis Perrin discovered the Oklo Fossil Reactors, it was realized that <b>nature</b> <b>had</b> beaten humans to the punch. Large-scale natural uranium fission chain reactions, moderated by normal water, had occurred far {{in the past and}} would not be possible now. This ancient process was able to use normal water as a moderator only because 2billion years before the present, natural uranium was richer in the shorter-lived fissile isotope 235U (about 3%), than natural uranium available today (which is only 0.7%, and must be enriched to 3% to be usable in light-water reactors).|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of this century, Dutch <b>nature</b> conservationists <b>have</b> discussed the questions how <b>nature</b> <b>has</b> to be protected and what counts as important nature.

25|$|According to Catholic {{theology}} man has {{not lost}} his natural faculties: by {{the sin of}} Adam he has been deprived only of the Divine gifts to which his <b>nature</b> <b>had</b> no strict right: the complete mastery of his passions, exemption from death, sanctifying grace, and the vision of God in the next life. The Creator, whose gifts were not due to the human race, {{had the right to}} bestow them on such conditions as he wished and to make their conservation depend on the fidelity of the head of the family. A prince can confer a hereditary dignity on condition that the recipient remains loyal, and that, in case of his rebelling, this dignity shall be taken from him and in consequence from his descendants. It is not, however, intelligible that the prince, on account of a fault committed by a father, should order the hands and feet of all the descendants of the guilty man to be cut off immediately after their birth.|$|E

500|$|In 1789 French {{finances}} were in {{a perilous}} state, several years of poor harvests had resulted in hunger among the peasants and reforms were thwarted by vested interests. On 5 May 1789 Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General {{which has been in}} abeyance since 1614, triggering a series of events that were to culminate in the French Revolution. On 20 June 1789 the newly formed Assemblée nationale (National Assembly) took an oath not to disband until a constitution had been drafted, resulting in the setting up, on 27 June 1789, of the Assemblée nationale constituante (Constituent Assembly).

500|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Virgil began appearing in plays, {{such as one}} particular Christmas work wherein the poet is the last [...] "prophet" [...] called on to give testimony concerning Christ. According to Bourne, the play was particularly popular, and philologist Du Cange gives mention of similar play performed at Rouen. Virgil and his purported prophecy even found itself in the Wakefield Mystery Plays. Around this time, Eclogue 4 and Virgil's supposed prophetic <b>nature</b> <b>had</b> saturated the Christian world; references to the poem are made by Abelard, the Bohemian historian Cosmos, and Pope Innocent III in a sermon. The Gesta Romanorum, a Latin collection of anecdotes and tales that was probably compiled {{about the end of}} the 13th century or the beginning of the 14th, confirms that the eclogue was pervasively associated with Christianity.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the terms}} of the pact, Syria would be split into three Bedouin-run states, with the Kilab under Salih {{governing}} Aleppo and northern Syria, the Tayy under its princely Jarrahid household ruling [...] Palestine from al-Ramla, and the Kalb ruling central Syria from Damascus. The combined strength of the three largest tribes in Syria made them a formidable challenge to the Fatimids. A Bedouin alliance of this magnitude and <b>nature</b> <b>had</b> not occurred since the 7th century and was made without consideration to the traditional Qays–Yaman rivalry between the tribes; the Tayy and Kalb were both Yamani while the Kilab were Qaysi. Moreover, its formation surprised Syria's population at the time, who were unaccustomed to the spectacle of Bedouin chiefs seeking kingship in the cities rather than nomadic life in the desert fringe. According to Zakkar, [...] "Salih was the outstanding figure among the allies, particularly from a military standpoint", though Hassan ibn Mufarrij apparently managed the allies' communications with the Fatimids.|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{relationship}} with the two sisters closest to the Queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous <b>nature,</b> <b>had</b> grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity {{on account of the}} Queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual {{relationship with}} her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: [...] "he [...] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, miss him more than I can say". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him.|$|E

500|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, the Australians lost 10 killed and 25 wounded, while 34 Japanese bodies were found on the position, with several more lying in irretrievable {{positions}} down the steep slopes. In addition one Japanese soldier was taken prisoner. According to the Australian official historian, Gavin Long, the attack on Pearl Ridge was a significant gain for the Australians, not only strategically but morally. Having been put in against a force of roughly equal size, [...] consisting of troops who were significantly more experienced than the Australians, whose only previous combat experience had been two years earlier during the Battle of Milne Bay, Long argues that the battle highlighted the effectiveness of the training the 25th Infantry Battalion had undertaken prior to deploying to Bougainville. James also supports this view, stating that McKinna's skilled leadership and aggressive <b>nature</b> <b>had</b> also been a strong factor. Meanwhile, for the Japanese, the loss of Pearl Ridge damaged the prestige of the 38th Mixed Independent Brigade, with Japanese commanders ascribing the loss to poor support from their artillery and mortars. James attributes this to the limited infrastructure in the area, and the lack of defensive construction or development undertaken following the Japanese capture of the island in 1942.|$|E
500|$|On August 18, the Los Angeles Police Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit began a {{criminal}} investigation on Jackson. The same day, Jordan Chandler's mother told police {{that she did not}} believe Jackson had molested her son. On August 21, a search warrant was issued, allowing police to search Jackson's Neverland Ranch. Police questioned 30 children who were friends of Jackson, with all stating that Jackson was not a child molester. A police officer involved in the investigation told The Los Angeles Times that no evidence (medical, photographic or video) could be found that would support {{a criminal}} filing. The same day the allegations were made public, Jackson began the third leg of his Dangerous World Tour in Bangkok. On August 24, Jackson's investigator held a press conference accusing Chandler of trying to extort $20 million from the singer, although the investigator failed to mention that Jackson had given several counter-offers. On August 25, Jackson's young friends, Brett Barnes and Wade Robson, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in the same bed as Jackson, but nothing sexual in <b>nature</b> <b>had</b> occurred. Jackson's family soon held a press conference of their own to show support, saying it was their [...] "unequivocal belief" [...] that Michael had been made a victim of a cruel and obvious attempt to take advantage of his fame and wealth. The police then began an investigation into Evan Chandler's prior actions and found that he was $68,400 behind in his child support payments, even though he was well-paid as a dentist. On November 8, police searched the Jackson family home, Hayvenhurst, but found nothing of importance to add to their investigation. According to internal reports from the LA County DCFS at the time, Chandler's story remained largely consistent but dates, places, times and some details were inconsistent. According to reports, the DCFS had investigated Jackson beginning in August 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
