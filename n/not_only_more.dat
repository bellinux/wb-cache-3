5|$|The Conservatives {{began the}} {{campaign}} period with a policy-per-day strategy, {{contrary to the}} Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began to rise. In response, the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close {{what had been a}} ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.|$|E
5|$|The daily {{rail and}} water Red Ball Express from Yokohama to Sasebo to Pusan began on July 23. By August it was {{operating}} with increased efficiency, demonstrating {{that it could}} promptly deliver any supplies available in Japan to Korea. On August 5, for example, it delivered 308tonnes; on August 9, 403tonnes; on August 22, 574tonnes; and on August 25, 949tonnes. The success of the Red Ball Express cut down the amount of airlift tonnage. This fell from 85tonnes on July 31 to 49tonnes on August 6. The express eliminated the need for nearly all airlift of supplies to Korea from Japan. It delivered supplies to Korea in an average time of 60–70 hours, while the airlift delivery varied from 12 hours to 5 days. The Red Ball delivery was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> cost effective, it was more consistent and reliable.|$|E

25|$|Current {{research}} shows that when music therapy is {{used in conjunction with}} traditional therapy, it improves rates of recovery and emotional and social deficits resulting from stroke. A study by Jeong & Kim examined the impact of music therapy when combined with traditional stroke therapy in a community-based rehabilitation program. Thirty-three stroke survivors were randomized into one of two groups: the experimental group, which combined rhythmic music and specialized rehabilitation movement for eight weeks; and a control group that sought and received traditional therapy. The results of this study showed that participants in the experimental group gained <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> flexibility and wider range of motion, but an increased frequency and quality of social interactions and positive mood.|$|E
25|$|The social {{structures}} {{of many of}} these places perpetuate the marginalization and oppression of women in the form of cultural norms and legal codes. As a result of this unequal social order, women are usually relegated into positions where they are <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to suffering from health problems, but also less able to have access and control over healthcare resources than men. For example, women living in areas with a patriarchal system are often less likely to receive tertiary education or to be employed in the paid labor market due to gender discrimination. As a result, female life expectancy at birth and nutritional well-being, and immunity against communicable and non-communicable diseases, are often lower than those of men.|$|E
25|$|Figure-work {{seems to}} have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult}} but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the grain of the wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.|$|E

25|$|Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) {{encounters}} Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, {{is content}} and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> reserved but {{unhappy with the}} Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly {{due to the fact}} that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled. Tyler discovers that Mike is a wolf hunter, killing for pelts to sell to make a living. Tyler demonstrates a trick he has learned: by playing certain notes on his bassoon, he can imitate a wolf howl, calling other wolves in.|$|E
25|$|In January 1783 {{a conference}} {{was held in}} St. Augustine between {{the representatives of the}} British crown—Governor Patrick Tonyn, Brigadier General Archibald McArthur, and Thomas Brown, the {{superintendent}} of Indian affairs—and the head men and principal warriors of the towns of the Upper and the Lower Creeks, who complained of the long distance they must travel to the stores from which they obtained their supplies. The Indians offered protection to merchants who would move their stores to locations closer to their territory, and pointed out the Apalachicola River as a suitable place for a trading house. The Creeks said it was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> convenient for themselves, but also much nearer to the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee Indians, and requested that the house of Panton, Leslie, & Co., who had been supplying them with goods, should be solicited to settle there for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|Aquifers {{may occur}} at various depths. Those {{closer to the}} surface are <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to be used}} for water supply and irrigation, but {{are also more likely to}} be topped up by the local rainfall. Many desert areas have {{limestone}} hills or mountains within them or close to them that can be exploited as groundwater resources. Part of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa, the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges between Syria and Lebanon, the Jebel Akhdar in Oman, parts of the Sierra Nevada and neighboring ranges in the United States' Southwest, have shallow aquifers that are exploited for their water. Overexploitation can lead to the exceeding of the practical sustained yield; i.e., more water is taken out than can be replenished. Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as Libya and Israel, increased water usage associated with population growth has caused a lowering of the water table and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater with saltwater from the sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{same basic}} design {{is seen in}} other painted Chinese frescoes, one from 520–524 AD (with shafts {{projecting}} beyond the horses chest for sternal traction), and another circa 600 AD (Sui Dynasty). This Sui Dynasty depiction (in cave 302) is of particular interest, since its depiction of the horse collar is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> accurate (the same seen even in north and northwest China today), but it is used for a camel, not a horse. The Chinese had used camels often from the 2nd century BC onwards during the Han Dynasty, and {{there was even a}} Camel Corps serving the military on the frontier of the Tarim Basin. However, the adapted horse collar for camels would not have been common until the 6th century. In cave 156, there is a panorama painting of the Tang Dynasty Chinese general and provincial governor Zhang Yichao riding triumphantly after the recapture and conquest of the Dunhuang region from the Tibetan Empire in 834 AD. According to evidence provided by Dr. Chang Shuhong, the date of the painting is precisely 851 AD, yet Needham points out that there is universal consensus amongst historians that it was painted anytime between roughly 840 to 860 AD. This latter painting accurately depicts the horse collar, with a well-padded collar coming low on the chest and rising behind the cross-bar.|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis huxleyi was a small, bipedal {{theropod}} dinosaur with {{a triangular}} skull bearing several details {{in common with}} dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and primitive avialans. Like other early paravians, Anchiornis was small, {{about the size of}} a crow. It had long, wing-bearing arms, long legs, and a long tail. Like all paravians, it was covered in feathers, though it also had scales on certain parts of the body. The wings, legs, and tail supported long but relatively narrow vaned feathers. Two types of simpler, downy (plumaceous) feathers covered the rest of the body, as in Sinornithosaurus: down feathers made up of filaments attached at their bases, and more complex down feathers with barbs attached along a central quill. Long, simple feathers covered almost the entire head and neck, torso, upper legs, and the first half of the tail. The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers (rectrices). Long feathers on the head (crown) may have formed a crest. While the first specimen of Anchiornis preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body, many more well-preserved fossils have since been found. Studies of Anchiornis specimens using laser fluorescence have revealed <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> details of the feathers, but also of the skin and muscle tissue. Taken together, this evidence has given scientists a nearly complete picture of Anchiornis anatomy.|$|E

500|$|Historian and Hansell biographer Dr. Charles Griffith {{concluded}} that Hansell sacrificed his {{command of the}} B-29 force and his later career on principle, adhering {{to the idea that}} precision rather than area bombing was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> moral, but more effective as a strategy.

500|$|In 1987, {{astronomer}} David Jewitt, then at MIT, {{became increasingly}} puzzled by [...] "the apparent emptiness {{of the outer}} Solar System". He encouraged then-graduate student Jane Luu to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object beyond Pluto's orbit, because, as he told her, [...] "If we don't, nobody will." [...] Using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Jewitt and Luu conducted their search {{in much the same}} way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had, with a blink comparator. Initially, examination of each pair of plates took about eight hours, but the process was sped up with the arrival of electronic charge-coupled devices or CCDs, which, though their field of view was narrower, were <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>more</b> efficient at collecting light (they retained 90% of the light that hit them, rather than the 10% achieved by photographs) but allowed the blinking process to be done virtually, on a computer screen. Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical detectors. In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Luu later joined him to work at the University of Hawaii's 2.24m telescope at Mauna Kea. Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly. Finally, after five years of searching, Jewitt and Luu announced on August 30, 1992 the [...] "Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object" [...] Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, (181708) 1993 FW.|$|E
