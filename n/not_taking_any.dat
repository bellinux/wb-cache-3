5|$|The {{player is}} often {{encouraged}} {{to take advantage of}} environmental light sources and placing, and to use other light-based weapons and accessories, such as flare guns, hand-held flares and flashbangs. Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken. Streetlights and other light stands can provide a safe haven, which the Taken cannot enter, and will regenerate the character's health faster. Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> damage. In certain sections of the game, it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls. When in a car, the player can run down Taken on the road, or boost the vehicle's headlights to destroy them.|$|E
25|$|During West Pakistan's {{conflict}} with India, East Pakistan's military government remained silent {{and did not}} send any troops to exert pressure on Eastern India. West Pakistan accused East Pakistan of <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> action, and their inaction caused West Pakistani resentment against East Pakistan's government. In fact, the Indian Air Force Eastern Air Command attacked East Pakistan's Air Force. However, East Pakistan was defended only by the under-strength 14th Infantry Division and sixteen fighter jets; no tanks and no navy were established in East Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|After {{he learned}} that the Army and Navy flying schools were <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> {{candidates}} the year he graduated from high school, he decided to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. Cooper left for MCRD Parris Island as soon as he graduated. However, World War II had ended before he could get into combat. He was assigned then to the Naval Academy Preparatory School and was an alternate for an appointment to Annapolis, Maryland. The man who was the primary appointee made the grade so Cooper was reassigned in the Marines on guard duty in Washington, D.C. He was serving with the Presidential Honor Guard in Washington when he was released from duty along with other Marine reservists.|$|E
25|$|After the {{transfer}} of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, Wong {{was one of the}} two colonial unofficial members who remained in the new Executive Council under the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Nevertheless, when the Housing Authority Short-piling Scandal broke out in 1999, Wong, as the chairperson of the Housing Authority, was heavily blamed by the general public of <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> responsibility. Under public pressure, she subsequently decided to resign from the Housing Authority four days before the Legislative Council passing the motion of no confidence on her and the Director of Housing, Tony Miller in June 2000. However, her resignation did not prevent her and some other government officials from receiving censure in the short-piling scandal investigation report released by the Legislative Council later in January 2003. Following the scandal, Wong ceased to be an unofficial member of the Executive Council in 2002 but was appointed chairperson of the Education Commission from 2001 to 2007. Since 2003, she has also been a Hong Kong member of the CPPCC National Committee of the People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|In 1897 Patterson captained {{his next}} tour of England. The tour {{undertaken}} by the Philadelphian cricketers was very ambitious. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few {{of those on the}} American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though {{only a few of the}} counties thought it worth while to put their best elevens onto the field. Starting on June 7 at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Patterson and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on June 17. The team fared very well and soundly beat the English side. Patterson, though, had a relatively poor performance scoring only eight runs and <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> wickets. The star of the match was undoubtedly John Barton King.|$|E

Alonso, Massa, Hamilton and Räikkönen all pitted for the final time over laps36 to 38. Coming out of {{the second round of}} pit stops, Hamilton led Räikkönen by 13seconds, Räikkönen more than 2.5seconds ahead of Massa. The gap between the Ferraris began to close, and Massa eased past Räikkönen on the back straight on lap49, to take second place on the track. Meanwhile, Kovalainen parked his car in the McLaren garage and retired from the race, his team <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> chances with a problem which had developed with the engine's hydraulics.|$|E
500|$|As the 1937 season began, Feller {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} the April 19, 1937 issue of Time magazine. In his first appearance of the season on April 24, Feller suffered an injury to his elbow while throwing a curveball. He spent April and May healing the arm, and in May graduated from high school; the ceremony aired nationally on NBC Radio. In mid-May, the Indians considered ending Feller's season early. [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> chances on that arm and we're not going to allow him to pitch again until the last trace of soreness has disappeared", said Slapnicka. On May 18 Feller appeared in his first game since April 24 but did not record an out. He did not pitch again until June 22, when he recorded two innings, then returned to normal pitching duties on July 4.|$|E

500|$|Abductive logic {{has three}} parts. First, {{there is the}} {{surprising}} fact—also called the result—that both Mulder and Scully are hallucinating, despite <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> drugs. Second, there is Scully's hypothesis—the rule—that, {{if it were true}} the hallucination [...] "would be a matter of course". Third, there is the conclusion—the case—that [...] "there is a reason to suspect [...] as true." [...] This abduction, Abrams and Cooke point out, is an example of creative abduction, because Scully manages to pull three, separate ideas [...] "creatively" [...] together. Mulder, however, next makes an abductive conclusion. While discussing the events with Skinner, he states that he is not convinced, because drugs do not wear off only when one notices their effects. This abduction also has three parts. The result is the surprising fact that Mulder and Scully's escape seems problematic. The rule is that Mulder and Scully only think that they have escaped, but they really are still underground and being digested. Finally, the case states that [...] "there is reason to suspect that" [...] Mulder and Scully have not escaped from the mushroom. This type of logic is an example of undercoded abduction, because it is the most plausible rule among many.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Indian Constitution {{does not}} provide any time limit within which the President is to declare his assent or refusal, the President could {{exercise}} a [...] "pocket veto" [...] by <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> action for an indefinite time. The veto was used in 1986 by the then President Zail Singh over the Postal Bill. The President did not give assent to the bill, arguing that its scope was too sweeping and would give the government arbitrary powers to intercept postal communications indiscriminately.|$|E

2500|$|An England team toured South Africa in 1927–28 and Coen, despite {{failure in}} the Orange Free State match against the touring side, was called up for Test duty. Before the first Test, however, he played one match for the touring team: MCC was one player short for the {{first-class}} two-day match against a South African XI and Coen filled the vacancy, scoring just three in his only innings. The first Test was not a success for South Africa, which lost the match by 10 wickets, but although he sustained an ankle injury in the game, Coen's reputation was not much damaged. In the first innings, batting at No 7, he made only seven, {{and he was able}} to bowl only two overs, <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> wickets.
