There are also giant K-type stars, which range from hypergiants like RW Cephei, to giants and supergiants, such as Arcturus, whereas orange dwarfs, like Alpha Centauri B, are main-sequence stars.|$|E

Cost reduction is influenced by factors including reduction in inappropriate and unnecessary care by evaluating evidence-based practices as well as {{reducing the amount of}} unnecessary, duplicative, and inappropriate care. Cost reduction may also be effected by reducing medical errors, investment in healthcare information technology, improving transparency of cost and quality data, increasing administrative efficiency, and by developing both clinical and non-clinical guidelines and quality standards.|$|E

Fast Food Nation also states that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies to some extent based on the culture of the host country.|$|E

As of 1988, it was estimated that 76 million Americans, about 43% of the U.S. adult population, have been exposed to alcoholism or problem drinking in the family, either having grown up with an alcoholic, having an alcoholic blood relative, or marrying an alcoholic. While growing up, <b>nearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> five adult Americans (18%) lived with an alcoholic.

2500|$|As {{part of its}} {{campaign}} to end mandatory overtime, the union has repeatedly polled Pennsylvania nurses about their hours, the acuity (level of illness) of their patients, and patient load. [...] In 2001, the union's independently-conducted poll of 6,000 registered nurses in the state found that 56 percent of nurses would enter the profession today due to mandatory overtime and poor nurse-to-patient staffing ratios. At the time, the poll was the largest survey of RNs ever conducted in Pennsylvania. In 2004, a second poll of more than 2,500 registered nurses in the southeastern Pennsylvania region found that <b>nearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> three nurses planned to quit nursing {{within the next five}} years due to long working hours.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> ten {{members of}} the church hold a priesthood office. These are {{primarily}} unpaid bi-vocational ministers. The church does maintain a relatively small group of professional ministers who typically serve as administrators, financial officers or missionaries. Priesthood members are called to teach and preach the gospel or [...] "good news" [...] of Jesus Christ. The ministry of the church at the congregational level is led by lay priesthood members and is carried out by all {{members of the}} priesthood and the laity. In most congregations the pastors and other elected and appointed leadership positions are unpaid positions. The right of women to hold the priesthood was recognized by a church conference in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{according}} to sociologists Christopher Uggen and Jeff Manza, the 2000 election {{might have gone}} to Al Gore if the disenfranchised population of Florida had voted. Florida law disenfranchises convicted felons, requiring individual applications to regain suffrage. In their 2002 American Sociological Review article, Uggen and Manza found that the released felon vote could have altered the outcome of seven senatorial races between 1978 and 2000, and the 2000 presidential election. Matt Ford noted their study concluded [...] "if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted {{at the same rate}} as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida—and the presidency—by more than 80,000 votes."
