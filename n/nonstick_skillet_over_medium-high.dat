50|$|Home {{roasting}} is {{the process}} of roasting coffee from green coffee beans on a small scale for personal consumption. Home roasting of coffee has been practiced for centuries, using simple methods such as roasting in cast iron <b>skillets</b> <b>over</b> a wood fire and hand-turning small steel drums on a kitchen stovetop.|$|R
50|$|Pralines have {{a creamy}} consistency, similar to fudge. They are usually made by {{combining}} sugar (often brown), butter, cream or buttermilk, and pecans {{in a pot}} <b>over</b> <b>medium-high</b> heat, and stirring constantly until most of the water has evaporated and it has reached a thick texture with a brown color. This is then usually dropped by spoonfuls onto wax paper or a sheet of aluminum foil greased with butter, and left to cool.|$|R
50|$|Drinking Ethiopian coffee, {{especially}} {{in the place of}} coffee's origin, is a cultural experience. The process for making the coffee, known as Bunna, takes over an hour. First the beans are washed in water, and then placed into a <b>skillet</b> <b>over</b> a fire. Once the beans have burst from their skins, they are ground with a metal stick. The grounds are placed into a jebena, an Ethiopian pot, with hot water and served in a cini cup.|$|R

5000|$|As the porous basalt is {{impossible}} to fully clean and sanitize, molcajetes are known to [...] "season" [...] (much like cast iron <b>skillets),</b> carrying <b>over</b> flavors from one preparation to another. Salsas and guacamole prepared in molcajetes {{are known to have}} a distinctive texture, and some also carry a subtle difference in flavor, from those prepared in blenders. Molcajetes can also be used as a cooking tool, where it is heated to a high temperature using an open fire or hot coals, and then used to heat its food contents. Although true molcajetes are made of basalt, imitations are sometimes made of a mixture of pressed concrete and volcanic rock particles.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Plateau Rosa Alpine station (Italy) has {{collected}} atmospheric concentrations {{of carbon dioxide}} since 1989. If the complete set of hourly data is observed, two distinct and exceptional very high concentration events are evident for February 2004. Similar and almost contemporary peaks were registered at the European high–altitude stations of Zugspitze–Schneefernerhaus and Sonnblick in the Alps, and at Mt. Cimone in the Northern Apennines. A regional meteorological model (the Weather Research and Forecast) was applied <b>over</b> a <b>medium–high</b> resolution grid to study {{the evolution of the}} meteorological fields and to identify the trajectories of the polluted air masses during the CO 2 observed peaks. The results show that, during both episodes, atmospheric circulation conveyed highly polluted air from the European plains to the Alpine stations. This conclusion has been also confirmed through concentration measurements of the atmospheric trace gases in the same area...|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th century, various patents {{were awarded}} in the U.S. and Europe for {{commercial}} roasters, {{to allow for}} large batches of coffee. Nevertheless, home roasting continued to be popular. A man working at a commercial roasting plant beginning in the 1850s in St. Louis, Missouri, said that [...] "selling roasted coffee was up-hill work, as everyone roasted coffee in the kitchen oven." [...] Appliances catering to the home roaster were developed; in 1849 a spherical coffee roaster was invented in Cincinnati, Ohio, for use {{on the top of}} a wood-fired kitchen stove, fitted into a burner opening. Green beans were available at the local general store, or even through mail order. For roasting, many people used such simple methods as a layer of beans on a metal sheet in the oven, or beans stirred in a cast iron <b>skillet</b> <b>over</b> a fire. Despite the wide popularity of home roasting, Burns felt that it would soon disappear because of the great strides made in commercial roasting in the 1860s and 1870s, including the benefits of the economies of scale. The commercial roaster inventions patented by Burns revolutionized the U.S. roasting industry, much like the innovations of inventors in Emmerich am Rhein greatly advanced commercial coffee roasting in Germany. As well, the 1864 marketing breakthrough of the Arbuckle Brothers in Philadelphia, introducing the convenient one-pound (0.45 kg) paper bag of roasted coffee, brought success and imitators. From that time commercially roasted coffee grew in popularity until it gradually overtook home roasting during the 1900s in America. In 1903 and 1906 the first electric roasters were patented in the U.S. and Germany, respectively; these commercial devices eliminated the problem of smoke or fuel vapor imparting a bad taste to the coffee. In France, the home roaster did not yield to the commercial roaster until after the 1920s, especially in rural areas. Coffee was roasted to a dark color in small batches at home and by shopkeepers, using a variety of appliances including ones with a rotating cylinder of glass, sheet iron or wire mesh, and ones driven by hand, clockwork or electric motor. Because of the smoke and blowing chaff, country dwellers generally roasted outdoors.|$|R

It is also often used in baking in the Nordic countries, in particular in Sweden and Finland, where it is used in traditional treats such as the Scandinavian Jule bread Julekake, the Swedish kardemummabullar sweet bun, and Finnish sweet bread pulla. In the Middle East, green cardamom powder {{is used as a}} spice for sweet dishes, as well as traditional flavouring in coffee and tea. Cardamom is used to a wide extent in savoury dishes. In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar, a mihbaj, and cooked together in a <b>skillet,</b> a mehmas, <b>over</b> wood or gas, to produce mixtures as much as 40% cardamom.|$|R

5000|$|The {{species has}} been used in antiquity for the {{production}} of potash, hence: its Arabic name, ušnān. The 10th-century Arab physician, al-Tamimi, described the plant in his day as being imported into Palestine, Egypt and other countries from the riverine gulches around the vicinity of Amman, in Transjordan, and used in the production of an alkali soap (Arabic: غاسول = ġāsūl) and of cleaning agents. According to al-Tamimi, the plants were gathered in their fresh, green-state in large bundles, transferred to furnaces made with plastered floors and stone spouts, where they were cast inside, beneath which were laid large timbers that were set aflame, causing the melting alkali-substance to drip down by the spouts into a threshing-floor directly below. The liquid would there be collected and eventually become hardened when it cooled-off, the finished product resembling a hard black-colored stone. The stone-like mineral could be broken-up into smaller fragments and used as a laundry detergent. Some of the salt bushes produced a type of potassium alum (Arabic: shab) that was brownish in color, having a strong alkalinity and burning effect when tasted. Al-Tamimi adds that one of the chemical elements had by burning Seidlitzia's succulent green leaves is al-qalī, which, besides being a natural cleansing agent, its [...] "plant ashes" [...] (potash) could be converted into potassium by placing the ashes into a pot, adding water thereto, and heating it until one is left with an evaporated solution. When this solution was mixed with coarsely ground yellow-orpiment (...) and with oil extracted from unripe olives, heated in a ceramic <b>skillet</b> placed <b>over</b> a fire, and turned constantly with an iron spoon until it congeals (having the fire actually touch it until it turns reddish in color), it too, according to al-Tamimi, is said to have certain medicinal properties, said to prevent tooth decay, as well as in assuaging blood loss from the gums. It is also said to be useful in removing halitosis. When the substance congeals, stirring ceases, and the substance is then allowed to burn completely while remaining in the ceramic skillet. It is then taken-up while still hot and is pounded by mortar and pestle, until one is left with a fine powder. It is then sifted in a sieve and stored until ready for use. A quantity of one dirham-weight (ca. 3.31 g during Ottoman times) was traditionally applied with one's finger to the effected part of the gums in the mouth, and allowed to remain there for one hour. Its application, however, {{is said to have been}} quite unpleasant because of its severe burning effect and strong alkalinity. After which, the mouth was rinsed with cold water, followed by gargling with Persian rose oil to aid in the mouth's cooling.|$|R
