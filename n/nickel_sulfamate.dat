Ni-zircon composite coatings are electrodeposited from a <b>nickel</b> <b>sulfamate</b> bath. Ball-milled zircon mineral powder with an average particle size of 0. 13 µm {{has been used as}} the new distributive phase. The optimized particle loading and current density are 50 g/L and 0. 77 Adm- 2 respectively. The influence of additives like coumarin and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on the properties of electrodeposited Ni-zircon coatings is reported. Ni-zircon coating containing coumarin exhibits highest microhardness (~ 650 HK at 50 gF load) and poor corrosion resistance. The poor corrosion resistance is attributed to the presence of cracks. Experimental results show that CTAB addition is very effective in increasing the amount of zircon particles in the Ni matrix. CTAB acts as an effective surfactant and decreases the agglomeration of particles in the Ni matrix. This results in a more uniform distribution of zircon particles in the nickel matrix.

40|$|This is {{a report}} about the {{development}} and the characterization of the electrochemical deposition of Permalloy in LIGA-microstructures, and about studies of the magnetic and mechanical properties of the layers obtained in this way. A sulfate electrolyte with a high metal content was prepared {{in cooperation with the}} group of Professor Liebscher at the Ilmenau Technical University and then used to characterize alloy deposition in experiments under controlled mass transfer conditions at the rotating disk electrode; the composition of the layers obtained was studied. In principle, two different ranges of current density were found for alloy deposition. At higher current densities, the composition of the alloy depends on the conditions of the mass transfer to the cathode (i. e. diffusion control of iron deposition). At lower current densities, it appears to be impossible to influence the composition of the alloy by mass transfer. In this case, control by the charge transfer reactions of iron and nickel and their mutual influences can be assumed to prevail. As the thickness of the diffusion layer increases, the change to diffusion control begins at increasingly lower current densities. A flow cell was used to electroform iron-nickel microstructures. Limiting current densities were measured in order to compare the conditions of mass transfer at the rotating disk electrode and at the microstructure used, respectively. The magnetic properties of the Permalloy deposited, and of the <b>nickel</b> deposited from <b>sulfamate</b> electrolyte, were determined. In addition, two models for the codeposition from iron-nickel taken fron the literature were incorporated into an FEM simulation program also existing in the literature. The model by Hessami and Tobias provide a good simulation of the author's measurements at the rotating disk electrode. It was also possible to simulate, by modification of the simulation of the mass transfer, the height profiles measured in microstructures.
