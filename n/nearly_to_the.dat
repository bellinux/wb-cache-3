5|$|After {{years of}} declining health, Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 and was quickly succeeded in his post as General Secretary by Yuri Andropov. Andropov only held {{the office of}} General Secretary for {{less than two years}} until his 1984 death. Brezhnev had fostered a cult of personality, {{although}} not <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same degree as Stalin. Mikhail Gorbachev, who would lead the USSR from 1985 to 1991, denounced his legacy and drove the process of liberalisation of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|October 3, 2001: At {{approximately}} 4:15a.m. local time, a passenger, Damir Igric, assaulted {{the driver}} of his bus, attempting to slit his throat, and causing the bus to crash near Manchester, Tennessee, killing Igric himself and five other passengers and injuring 32 others. Since the incident occurred {{three weeks after the}} September 11 terrorist attacks, Greyhound temporarily suspended all schedules as soon as the company learned of the incident for fear that it may have been part of a larger co-ordinated attack. After investigation by the company and the FBI, it was confirmed that Igric had acted alone and service resumed later that afternoon. After the incident, Greyhound bus stations increased security, though not <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same level as airports or train stations.|$|E
5|$|Rifting {{started to}} create the Gulf of California far to the south 6 to 10million years ago. Around the same time, {{the western edge of}} the Colorado Plateau may have sagged slightly. Both events changed the {{direction}} of many streams toward the sagging region and the increased gradient caused them to downcut much faster. From 5.5million to 5million years ago, headward erosion to the north and east consolidated these streams into one major river and associated tributary channels. This river, the ancestral Lower Colorado River, started to fill the northern arm of the gulf, which extended <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site of Hoover Dam, with estuary deposits.|$|E

5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} rectangular, the width {{at the front}} is still smaller than the width at the back. There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width at the front is virtually equal to the width at the back, so that the tooth is about rectangular. The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one at the back.|$|E
5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E

5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The pinna (external ear) is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first phalange of the second and that of the fifth toe extends <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base of the second phalange of the fourth. The tail is at least about as long as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, but there may not be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E
5|$|The Steynings {{family owned}} Holnicote until the direct male line became extinct {{with the death}} of Charles Staynings (1622–1700). His wife, Susanna (died 1685), was a {{daughter}} of Sir Nicholas Martyn of Oxton and Steynings's heir was their nephew, William Martyn. According to records of the Heralds' Visitations of Devon and research by the Victorian historian J. L. Vivian, this William Martyn lived in Oxton in the parish of Kenton, Devon; he was Susanna Martyn's great-nephew and died in 1710, aged 30. He sold the estate to William Blackford, a Master in Chancery. Blackford then bought the manors of Bossington and Avill, the latter from Anthony Stocker and his wife, Sarah; this estate extended from the ridge of Grabbist <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea-shore and also included land in the parishes of Dunster, Carhampton, Crowcombe, Stogumber, Timberscombe and St. Decumans. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of John Dyke of Pixton, and died in 1728. His son, William, succeeded him and married Henrietta Collet (died 1727), a daughter and co-heiress of Joseph Collet of Hertford Castle in Hertfordshire. However, he died only three years after his father. Their only daughter and heiress, Henrietta Blackford, inherited the estate as an infant, but died aged 7 in 1733. The estates were divisible upon a great-aunt, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737), and a second cousin, Elizabeth, a daughter of Thomas Dyke of Tetton and Mary, a daughter of Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737). Later in 1733, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737) conveyed her share in the estate to her only surviving son, Edward Dyke (died 1746) who in turn conveyed his portion to his niece in 1744, making her the sole owner of the entire estate.|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} development of I/O psychology was paralleled in the US, the UK, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and eastern European {{countries such as}} Romania.

25|$|In England, {{some of the}} Cambridge Platonists {{approached}} hylozoism as well. Both Henry More and Ralph Cudworth (the Younger, 1617–1688), {{through their}} reconciliation of Platonic idealism with Christian doctrines of deific generation, {{came to see the}} divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life to all things that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheism. i.e. materialism and hylozoism.|$|E

25|$|The {{terminal}} or lateral inflorescences are spike-like, {{made up of}} joint-like segments {{with tiny}} paired cymes emerging from the joints. Each cyme consists of three (rarely five) flowers completely embedded between the bract and immersed in the fleshy tissue of the axis. The flowers of a cyme are arranged in a transverse row, the central flower separating the lateral flowers, with tissue of the axis between them. The hermaphrodite or unisexual flowers {{are more or less}} radially symmetric, with a perianth of three or four fleshy tepals connate <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> apex, one or two stamens, and an ovary with two or three stigmas.|$|E
25|$|At about 10.30 Mr. Alderman Gilpin, {{chairman}} of the company, and several other directors made their appearance, {{and a few minutes}} later the car, drawn by a couple of powerful horses, went sliding along Carrington-street to the Midland and <b>nearly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great Northern Railway Stations.
