5000|$|In 2013, the Bank {{embarked}} on the Centers Hubbing and Relocation Exercise which involved 373 Managerial, Executive, Officer, Clerical and Non Clerical employees. By February 2013, all employees {{affected by the}} exercise were informed about their relocation and a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> was issued in June 2013 with an initial transfer date of 18 September 2013. This date of transfer was subsequently deferred until 18 November 2013 to provide affected employees with more {{time to make the}} necessary preparations. Prior to the date of transfer, a reminder was issued to all affected staff on 6 November 2013 on the date of transfer effective 18 November 2013. On 18 November 2013, staff who did not report to their new centres were issued a notice of reminder to report for duty accordingly. By 19 November 2013, the Bank and the union were called for a reconciliation meeting by the Director General of Industrial Relations (DGIR) of which the Bank, upon request by the authorities to review the Centers Hubbing and Relocation, reverted to the authorities on 27 November 2013. This was followed by another notice of reminder on the same date to all affected staff to report to their new centres immediately. After the notice provided, staff who continued not to report for duty were issued show cause letters for their explanation on 2 December 2013 for refusing to comply with the Bank’s transfer order. A second reconciliation meeting between the Bank and the union was held by the DGIR on 4 December 2013. As there was no amicable settlement of the trade dispute, the matter was reported to the Human Resource Minister who referred the dispute to the Industrial Court on 6 December 2013.On 13 December 27 employees were issued final show cause letters and were given until 17 December 2013 to provide valid explanations for their absence. On 18 December 2013, employees who were still not able to provide a valid explanation had their employment with HLBB terminated.Since November 2013, several pickets organised by NUBE have been held across the nation in protest and a trade dispute against HLBB over the bank’s rationalisation exercise was lodged by the union to the Industrial Relations Department for conciliation. The union continued to picket until January 2014 despite the trade dispute being referred by the Minister to the Industrial Court at the same period.|$|E

I also gratefully acknowledge the package which you sent me for Christmas. Somehow or other it got delayed, {{through no fault}} of yours as the address was correct. It {{was just one of those}} unexplainable foulings that we run into now-a-days. Outside of one or two pieces being squashed, they were in first class order and quite a few of the other boys enjoyed them as well as myself. Thanks again. Since entering the service in January 1941, I cannot say that I have seen any action as I have been always stationed in New England. From January to October, 1941, while in the Army, I was stationed at Camp Devens, Fort Adams, and Camp Edwards. Then a short civilian respite between the enactment of the “over 28 Act affecting Selective Service” and the Declaration of War; after which I joined the Navy, being a member of both the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps and the U. S. Navy for thirteen days due to overlapping joining the Navy in January 1942, I have fought the Battle of Boston Harbor for eighteen months, serving at the Charlestown Navy Yard and at present at the U. S. S. Fargo (9 decks and a cement bottom at 495 Summer Street). I {{have received}} <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> twice but each time it has been cancelled. Enlisting as a Storekeeper 3 rd Class, I have progressed through 2 nd Class and am now Storekeeper 1 st Class. Having been recommended for Lieutenant (j. g.) but which Washington turned down for some unknown reason. Last February I married a young lady (Miss Barbara Kelley of North Quincy) whom I met in Boston since entering the Navy so that my service on shore has not been without its advantages. I will close by saying I have hopes of not being a dry land sailor through all of this, as I would like to see some sea duty. Thanks again for everything and please keep me posted.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis [...] which arose in great measure from millions of bundled mortgage loans which randomly commingled arrays of toxic subprime mortgages with soundly underwritten “normal” loans and marketed securities derived from these bundles—led {{directly to the}} foreclosure epidemic we continue to face. The bursting of the derivatives bubble which spawned this epidemic has now revealed a major legal pitfall in mortgage foreclosure laws. A traditional legal rule forces the foreclosing lender to produce the original signed mortgage note {{to prove that it}} holds the legal right to foreclose or otherwise enforce remedies on the defaulted debt. This is the so-called “payment rule” of negotiable instruments law. But because of the bundling, securitization, and global remarketing of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) the normal chain of current ownership of any particular mortgage debt is now often unable to be traced. However, if the modern mortgage industry is to survive—and many believe that its survival is an essential goal of society—while protecting the rights of all involved in mortgage enforcement cases, {{there needs to be a}} solution to this problem. This timely article demonstrates how the nation’s courts have struggled to put a bandage on the problem. In the course of that struggle our courts have given disparate, even self-contradictory treatment to the “payment rule. ” The Court of Appeals of North Carolina is one of many such courts, handing down two schizophrenic holdings regarding the “payment rule” within weeks of one another. This article examines these inconsistent holdings, their implications for mortgage enforcement law, and presents various proposed solutions. The article offers a new fair and balanced solution the problem, which meets the three essential goals: (1) public transparency in harmony with policy underlying nearly two centuries of states’ recording acts; (2) fairness to individual mortgage debtors; (3) promoting the certainty and efficiency of the financial industry’s ability to enforce borrowers’ obligations by foreclosure. Regarding the solutions available, some are fatally complex or politically impossible, but some are more readily at hand. This article spotlights how the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code’s revised Section 3 - 602 could alleviate the problem but state legislatures may continue to balk at this step. In the years since 2002 only 10 state legislatures have adopted this sensible solution, illustrating the political problem. This otherwise sensible solution would likely be blocked by intense lobbying from the lending industry as it seeks to avoid notice and filing delays in bundling and transferring of MBS. Some national commentators propose removing mortgages from the realm of negotiable instruments law altogether, the two laws being mutually irrelevant. Although removing mortgages from the realm of negotiability has some minor impact on Holder in Due Course rules, it does not render them untransferrable. Such a change merely requires reasonable notice to the note debtor of each such transfer. This article concludes that instead of trying to motivate the Legislature to eliminate negotiability from all mortgage notes, the optimal solution is to encourage legislators to enact the revised U. C. C. Section 3 - 602, which would eliminate the double payment threat embodied in the payment rule Regardless of the political outcome—pro or con—of a UCC reform, state legislatures should take the minimal step of mandating that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> of mortgage notes must be accomplished by mail to the borrower and recording of that notice in the land records of the county where the mortgage itself is recorded. In accord with the best national thinking on the matter, this will give the mortgage ownership status much needed transparency. Moreover, recording all such transfers would provide notice of the transfer and give much needed transparency to mortgage note ownership, thereby preventing the “lost in the MBS bundling” that has created our present crisis...|$|E

50|$|Before the {{enactment}} of IRC 5891, which became effective on July 1, 2002, some states regulated the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> structured settlement payment rights, while others did not. Most states that regulated transfers at this time followed a general pattern, substantially similar {{to the present day}} process which is mandated in IRC 5891 (see below for more details of the post-2002 process). However, the majority <b>of</b> the <b>transfers</b> processed from 1988 to 2002 were not court ordered. After negotiating the terms of the transaction (including the payments to be sold and the price to be paid for those payments), a formal purchase contract was executed, effecting an assignment of the subject payments upon closing. Part of this assignment process also included the grant of a security interest in the structured settlement payments, to secure performance of the seller’s obligations. Filing a public lien based on that security agreement created <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> this assignment and interest. The insurance company issuing the structured settlement annuity checks was typically not given actual <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transfer,</b> due to antagonism by the insurance industry against factoring and transfer companies. Many annuity issuers were concerned that factoring transactions, which were not contemplated when Congress enacted section 130, might upset the tax treatment of qualified assignments. House of Representatives Bill 2884 (discussed below) resolved this question for annuity issuers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work proposes an {{effective}} method of fighting spam by developing Inexpensive Email Addresses (IEA), a stateless system of Disposable Email Addresses (DEAs). IEA can cryptographically generate exclusive email addresses for each sender, {{with the ability}} to re-establish a new email address once the old one is compromised. IEA accomplishes proof-of-work by integrating a challenge-response mechanism to be completed before an email is accepted in the recipient’s mail system. The system rejects all incoming emails and instead embeds the challenge inside the rejection <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> Standard Mail <b>Transfer</b> Protocol (SMTP) error messages. The system does not create an out-of-band email for the challenge, thus eliminating email backscatter in comparison to other challenge-response email systems. The system is also effective in identifying spammers by exposing the exact channel, i. e. the unique email address that was compromised, so misuse could {{be traced back to the}} compromising party. Usability is of utmost concern in building such a system by making it friendly to the end-user and easy to setup and maintain by the system administrator.

40|$|Bulk sales {{legislation}} arose out of {{an attempt}} to protect the creditors of merchants who would sell their stock in trade and either squander or secrete the proceeds. Under the normal rules relating to fraudulent conveyances, the creditor could pursue the property transfixed if he could show that the transfer was made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, and that the transferee had knowledge of the transferor 2 ̆ 7 s design. However, since a creditor would not be entitled to relief if the transferee was an innocent purchaser for an adequate consideration, and it generally would be difficult to prove that the transferee was aware of any fraudulent intent which the transferor might have had, the protection afforded by the ordinary doctrines concerning fraudulent conveyances or transfers was inadequate. Under bulk sales legislation, the creditor is normally allowed to treat certain transfers in bulk as void if the parties do not comply with the statutory requirements regardless of their intent or the fairness of the transaction. The statutory requirements, though varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, ordinarily include the preparation of an inventory of the assets to be <b>transferred,</b> the preparation <b>of</b> a list of creditors, and a requirement that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the intended <b>transfer</b> be sent to the creditors of the transferor prior to the completion of the transaction.

40|$|Systems of {{land law}} must balance {{competing}} goals of securing title for existing interests in land with facilitating their transfer. Title registration systems operate to facilitate <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> interests in land. They reflect {{a choice to}} enhance the security <b>of</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> interests, providing what has been characterized as dynamic security {{at the expense of}} the static security of existing interests. One of the cardinal principles of title registration is the abolition of the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>notice.</b> In equity, if purchasers of a legal interest have <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> a prior equitable interest, then they take their interest subject to that prior interest. To do otherwise is to perpetrate a fraud. Most title registration systems abolish notice; prior unregistered interests do not affect purchasers who register their interests, whether or not they have <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the prior interest, except, so many title registration statutes provide, in the case of fraud.
