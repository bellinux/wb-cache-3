Energy consumption {{was the most important}} factor for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission and decided by economic development and rising living standard. This paper analyzes the situation of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission and the primary factors in China through empirical method. Energy consumption and economic development are chosen to be the crucial factors for the analysis on <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission because these two factors will affect the quantity and structure of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission. To control <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission, in China, advanced energy technology play key role. At the same time, some economic factors, for instance, adjustment of economic structure, investment for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> control and policy for energy technology improvement, are necessary to control <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emission...|$|R

Some CHP plants utilize <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> as the fuel for electricity and heat generation. <b>Waste</b> <b>gases</b> can be <b>gas</b> from animal <b>waste,</b> landfill <b>gas,</b> gas from coal mines, sewage gas, and combustible industrial <b>waste</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|R
30|$|There are {{two types}} of {{undesirable}} environmental outputs: <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> and wastewater. At the national level, the productive potential rate of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is 0.507, whereas the productive potential rate of wastewater is 0.377. Therefore, over the entire country, <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> can be reduced by 50.7  % without slowing economic growth, and similarly, wastewater can be reduced by 37.7  %. This result demonstrates that at the aggregate level, a greater potential for progress exists for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> reduction than for wastewater treatment. Therefore, the government should invest more resources into <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> reduction than wastewater treatment.|$|R

This paper addresses the methodology {{to calculate the}} effect that <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> energy recovery has on lowering the impact of climate change.

The problem described in the thesis is connected with a real industrial case – problem of operated <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> incineration plant. <b>Waste</b> <b>gas</b> going to thermal incineration to flame of natural gas combustion contains solid and liquid particles. Presence of particles causes fouling of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> preheater.

5000|$|The {{reciprocating}} chemical muscle {{was developed}} as a drive mechanism for the flapping wings of the entomopter. The RCM reuses energy many times before releasing it into its surroundings. [...] First, it converts mainly heat energy into flapping-wing motion in the entomopter. Then, heat is scavenged for thermoelectric generation in support of ancillary systems. <b>Waste</b> <b>gas</b> from the chemical decomposition of the fuel is then {{used to create a}} frequency modulated continuous wave acoustic ranging signal that is Doppler insensitive (used for obstacle avoidance). <b>Waste</b> <b>gas</b> is then passed through an ejector to entrain external atmospheric gases to increase mass flow and decrease <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> temperature so that lower-temperature components can be used downstream. Some <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is diverted into gas bearings for rotational and linear moving components. Finally, remaining <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is vectored into the wings where it is used for circulation-controlled lift augmentation (Coanda effect). Any remaining gas can be used for vectored thrust, but if the gas budgets are correctly designed, there should be no extra gas beyond the circulation control points. The features of the RCM are tailored to the entomopter to conserve energy.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the lead}} ISASMELT pilot plant, the lead ISASMELT {{demonstration}} plant suffered from constraints {{imposed by the}} <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> handling system. In {{the case of the}} demonstration plant, the problem was caused by sticky fume that formed an insulating layer on the convection tube bundles of the waste heat boilers, significantly reducing the heat transfer rates and thus the ability of the boilers to reduce the <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> temperature. As the plant used baghouses to filter lead fume from the <b>waste</b> <b>gas,</b> it was necessary to reduce the temperature of the gas below {{the point at which the}} bags would be damaged by high temperatures. The problem was solved by allowing cool air to mix with the hot <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> to lower the temperature to a level at which the baghouse could operate. This reduced the ISASMELT plant’s capacity because it was again limited by the volume of gas that could be filtered by the baghouse.|$|R
40|$|In 1996, the BASF Corporation's Geismar, Louisiana site {{determined}} that the increased steam demands of their aggressive investment program would require them to expand their steam generation capacity. The site had operated a gas turbine based cogeneration system since 1985 so they naturally reviewed the economics of another such installation. At the same time, a new Acetylene plant was being planned, which generated a large process <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> stream. Conceptual studies indicated that integrating the two projects would provide significant economic advantages. The new gas turbine {{is similar to the}} first unit with a capacity of approximately 37. 5 MW. However, there are several factors that make this a unique installation. For one, the new unit has a unique dual fuel capability -natural gas as well as the process <b>waste</b> <b>gas.</b> The <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is hydrogen and carbon monoxide rich, and has a much lower heating value per cubic foot than does natural gas. The use of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is a great advantage since it avoids flaring this valuable "fuel" with the associated increased emissions. The innovative fuel system was designed to accommodate a wide range of gas mixes to maximize the amount of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> that can be utilized in the unit. The unit is equipped with a state of the art Selective Catalytic Reduction system in the exhaust stack to greatly reduce the amount of NOx emissions produced by the installation. The emissions are a maximum of 8 -PPM NOx with natural gas and 25 PPM with 100 % <b>waste</b> <b>gas...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the Operating Room the Anaesthetic Gas Scavenging System {{collects}} {{and removes}} <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> {{from the patient}} breathing circuit and the patient ventilation circuit. There is a legal requirement to scavenge <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> to maintain the level of <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> in the Operating Room below the legally acceptable limit. For example, in the UK the limits are typically 100ppm for nitrous oxide and 50ppm for halogenated volatile anaesthetic agents (except halothane which is 10ppm). Other jurisdictions have different requirements for local environmental contamination, for example, nitrous oxide maximum 25ppm and halogenated volatile gases maximum 2ppm. In addition to the legal requirement there is an Occupational Health requirement to maintain a safe workplace and limit exposure to potentially harmful gases.|$|R

40|$|The gas flare {{process is}} the most common process used to dispose of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> {{generated}} in oil and <b>gas</b> operations. However, <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> incineration has been suggested as a better alternative to gas flaring.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide methods to find the {{emission}} source and estimate the amount of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emissions in the electricity coal supply chain, establish the model of the environmental impact (burden) in the electricity coal supply chain, detect the critical factor which causes significant environmental impact, and then identify the key control direction and reduce amount of environmental pollution in the electricity coal supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: In this context, life cycle inventory and life cycle assessment of China’s electricity coal were established in three difference stages: coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning. Then the outcomes were analyzed with the aim to reduce <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> emissions’ environmental impact in the electricity coal supply chain from the perspective of sensitivity analysis. Findings: The results and conclusion are as follow: (1) In terms of total <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emissions in electricity coal supply chain, CO 2 is emitted in the greatest quantity, accounting for 98 - 99 wt% of the total <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emissions. The vast majority of the CO 2, greater than 93 %, is emitted from the power plant when the coal is combusted. (2) Other than CO 2, the main <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is CH 4, SO 2 and so on. CH 4 is mainly emitted from Coal Bed Methane (CBM), so the option is to consider capturing some of the CH 4 from underground mines for an alternative use. SO 2 is mainly emitted from power plant when the coal is combusted. (3) The environmental burden of coal burning subsystem is greatest, followed by the coal mining subsystem, and finally the coal transportation subsystem. Improving the coal-burning efficiency of coal-fired power plant in electricity coal supply chain is the most effective way to reduce the environmental impact of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emissions. (4) Of the three subsystems examined (coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning), transportation requires the fewest resources and has the lowest <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emissions. However, the energy consumption for this subsystem is significant (excluding the mine mouth case), and transportation distance is found to have a substantial effect on the oil consumption and non-coal energy consumption. (5) In electricity coal supply chain, the biggest environmental impact of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emissions is GWP, followed by EP, AP, POCP and ODP, and regional impact is greater than the global impact. Practical implications: The model and methodology established in this paper could be used for environmental impact assessment of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emissions in electricity coal supply chain and sensitivity analysis in China, and it could supply reference and example for similar researches. The data information on life cycle inventory, impact assessment and sensitivity analysis could supply theory and data reference for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> emissions control in electricity coal supply chain. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to study the environmental influence of electricity coal supply chain by employing a LCA approach from life cycle of electricity coa...|$|R
