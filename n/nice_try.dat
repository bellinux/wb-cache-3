5000|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{gave the}} film modest praise, writing,"Like 'Zelig,' 'Shadows and Fog' is a {{pastiche}} {{of references to}} the works of others, but it's a brazen, irrepressible original {{in the way it}} uses those references." [...] He added, [...] "A note of caution: 'Shadows and Fog' operates on its own wavelength. It is different. It should not be anticipated in the manner of other Allen films. It's unpredictable, with its own tone and rhythm, even though, like all of the director's work, it's a mixture of the sincere, the sardonic and the classically sappy." [...] Variety similarly wrote, [...] "Exquisitely shot in black & white, Woody Allen's Shadows and Fog is a sweet homage to German expressionist filmmaking and a nod to the content of socially responsible tales since narrative film began. Allen's fans will regard this as a <b>nice</b> <b>try</b> that falls short." ...|$|E

Much of Shanghai Surprise might have worked if they at least were permitted to play themselves — a punk rocker and punk actor at large in an alien movie world." [...] The Chicago Sun-Times, awarding the movie half a star, complained of its [...] "warped attitudes toward women," [...] adding, [...] "It's hard to know for whom this wretch of a film was made. Idiotic dialogue should turn off the adults, teens will be disappointed by their rock heroine and kids shouldn't even be watching." [...] Film professor Michal Conford, of Ryerson University, reviewed the film for the San Jose Mercury News with another half-star rating, saying sardonically, [...] "Shanghai Surprise stars Madonna and Sean Penn {{together for the first time}} and has songs by George Harrison. That is the most positive sentence that can be written about the film, now playing locally. MGM must have suspected -- the company tried to open the film in places like Iowa to avoid getting slaughtered. <b>Nice</b> <b>try...</b> The film is supposed to be a shaggy dog adventure... Shaggy, no. Dog, yes." ...|$|E
