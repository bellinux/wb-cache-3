25|$|Large shrubs such as red-osier dogwood, beaked willow, saskatoon, chokecherry and pincherry, {{along with}} the smaller shrubs {{including}} prickly rose, snowberry, beaked hazelnut and high bush cranberry, form a dense entangled understory. Dense shrubbery is a typical feature in aspen-dominated forests. Common herbs found in the woodlands include: Lindley’s aster (Aster ciliolatus), <b>northern</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium boreale), pea vine, Western Canada violet (Viola canadensis), dewberry and bunchberry. Mosses appear {{at the base of}} trees and on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Galium boreale or <b>northern</b> <b>bedstraw</b> is a {{plant species}} of the Rubiaceae. It is {{widespread}} over the temperate and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America including most of Canada and the northern United States.|$|E
50|$|This grass {{occurs in}} moist habitat types such as riverbanks, sand bars, and woodlands, often {{alongside}} willow species (Salix spp.). It is {{also associated with}} prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), western river alder (Alnus incana), highbush cranberry (Viburnum edule), raspberry (Rubus idaeus), <b>northern</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium boreale), alpine bluegrass (Poa alpina), common fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), Tilesius wormwood (Artemisia tilesii), and rough bentgrass (Agrostis scabra).|$|E
50|$|Galium labradoricum (Labrador <b>bedstraw</b> or <b>northern</b> bog <b>bedstraw)</b> is a {{plant species}} in the Rubiaceae. It is {{widespread}} across Canada, found in all provinces and territories except Yukon. It also occurs in St. Pierre & Miquelon and in the northern United States, primarily in New England and the Great Lakes region, from Maine to the Dakotas.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the area}} {{has a variety of}} habitats, it is the montane {{vegetation}} that is particularly notable. The summit of Cross Fell is dominated by a heath in which the moss Racromitium lanuginosum is dominant and is the most extensive area of such heath in England. Other notable montane and sub-montane species include hair sedge, Carex capillaris, <b>northern</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> Galium boreale, mountain everlasting, Antennaria dioica, and alpine forget-me-not, Myosotis alpestris.|$|E
50|$|Boreal {{species at}} Ice Mountain include bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), Appalachian wood fern (Gymnocarpium appalachianum), Canada {{mayflower}} (Maianthemum canadense), minniebush (Menziesia pilosa), mountain maple (Acer spicatum), nannyberry (Viburnum lentago), <b>northern</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium boreale), prickly gooseberry (Ribes cynosbati), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), purple virgin's bower (Clematis occidentalis), shale barren primrose (Oenothera argillicola), skunk currant (Ribes glandulosum), starflower (Trientalis borealis), and twinflower (Linnaea borealis). Eastern Hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) provide shade to and cool the mountain's ice vents.|$|E

50|$|This grass {{grows in}} several habitat types, {{including}} grasslands, meadows, and pine forests. It {{can be found}} on moraines, plains, and mountain slopes. It is a dominant or codominant grass species in some areas, such as the western Canadian grasslands and the climax plant communities of Glacier National Park. Plants associated with it include Canada bluegrass (Poa compressa), prairie Junegrass (Koeleria cristata), rough fescue (Festuca altaica), Idaho fescue (F. idahoensis), bearded wheatgrass (Elymus caninus), western needlegrass (Achnatherum occidentalis), timber danthonia (Danthonia intermedia), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa), sedges (Carex spp.), shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa), bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), timothy (Phleum pratense), common yarrow (Achillea millefolium), prairiesmoke avens (Geum triflorum), <b>northern</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium boreale), Hood's phlox (Phlox hoodii), and bluebell (Campanula rotundifolia).|$|E
30|$|We used a {{completely}} randomized design with seven vegetation treatments, three soil types, two fertilizer treatments, and six replicates {{for a total}} of 252 pots in our greenhouse experiment. The three plant species used in this experiment were G. boreale (<b>northern</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> native forb), V. americana (American vetch, native forb), and M. perforata (scentless chamomile, non-native forb). The seven vegetation treatments were pure pots, i.e. monocultures of each plant species, mixed pots of each species pair (three species pair combinations), and control pots with no plants. Seedlings were planted at a density of four plants per pot in either pure or mixed (2 : 2) combinations.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of cow age on botanical composition of diets in mountain riparian areas. Treatments consisted of 30 first-calf heifers, and 30 mature cows randomly assigned to four pastures (2 pastures/treatment, average 21. 5 ha) in a 2 -year study with a cross-over design. Botanical composition of diets was determined in fecal samples obtained from 10 animals in each treatment (5 per pasture) on the fourth week of 35 to 42 -days grazing periods using the microhistological technique. Crude protein (CP) content and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were determined, and correction factors were calculated for 22 major plant species. In digested samples, grasses were overestimated, whereas, all forbs but <b>northern</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium boreale L.), were underestimated, and all shrub species were overestimated except common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus L.). Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) was highly overestimated after digestion. There was no difference between cattle age class in the total number of plant species found in the diets (p > 0. 10) averaging in 41 species. Most individual grass and grasslike species made up more than 5 % of the diets, while all individual forb, shrub, and tree species were minor components, not exceeding 5 %, except ponderosa pine. Western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii Rybd.) and tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) Beauv.) accounted for over 10 % of the diets. Heifers consumed more (p p Juncus balticus Willd.), and pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens Buckl.) (p Poa pratensis L.) (p p < 0. 10), than in the diet of first calf heifers. In summary, mature cows appeared to have selected a diet that contained less grasses and more shrubs and trees compared to younger cows. </p...|$|E
