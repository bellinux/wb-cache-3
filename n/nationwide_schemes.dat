40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the public control of motorised passenger-carrying vehicles and the effect of control on the development of this sector of the transport industry. The thesis consists of three main sections. In the first part, the origins and implementation of the Road Traffic Act, 1930 are examined. This Act marked the beginning of public control on the bus and coach industry which was then a relatively young and rapidly growing sector of the total transport industry. The implications for road passenger transport following the nationalisation proposals introduced by the Transport Act, 1947, are examined {{in the second part of}} the thesis. The 1947 Act did not specifically provide for radical changes in the public control. However, in making provisions for <b>nationwide</b> <b>Schemes</b> for road passenger transport it lay the foundations for substantial change. This section considers the progress of these Schemes and, in particular, documents the slow progress of the first of these for North Eastern England. The final chapter brings together information from the two earlier sections and highlights the more important differences and similarities in approach of the two pieces of legislation. The main objectives of the thesis are to analyse the background and implementation of these two Acts and to place this analysis into an economic framework. The examination of each of the two Acts commences with a review of pertinent economic theory before considering the historical evidence and reaching conclusions about the relevance of economic theory in contributing to our understanding of these events. The analysis benefits from access to new source material: these include Government and Cabinet papers and information from personal interviews conducted with people working in the industry when the Acts were passed. Reference to these new primary sources, in conjunction with a more formal economic framework, has led to a new interpretation of the origins of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, and a substantially more complete knowledge of the problems involved in developing a unified system for road passenger transport under nationalisation. In addition, the provision of an economic framework permits greater analysis not only of the individual Acts but of their similarities and differences and leads to a greater understanding of the legislative process in the transport sector...|$|E

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Equine grass sickness (EGS) remains a frequently fatal disease of equids in Great Britain (GB). The first <b>nationwide</b> surveillance <b>scheme</b> for EGS {{was developed to}} obtain information on the occurrence of EGS and to help facilitate future proposed intervention studies, such as vaccine trials. Objectives: To collect both retrospective and prospective data on cases of EGS occurring in GB since 2000 and to assess potential risk factors for categories of EGS and survival after chronic EGS. Methods: Prospective data were collected using a <b>nationwide</b> surveillance <b>scheme</b> for EGS that was developed and initiated in 2007. Data were collected by means of postal and online questionnaires documenting both retrospective premises-level and prospective case-level information. Data on outcomes of EGS category and survival after chronic grass sickness (CGS) were analysed using univariable logistic regression. Results: Descriptive data for 1410 EGS cases occurring in GB in the decade between the beginning of 2000 {{and the end of}} 2009 are presented. Univariable logistic regression analyses identified that CGS cases in Scotland {{were significantly more likely to}} survive than those occurring elsewhere in GB. There was no relationship between case details and the category of EGS or the outcome among CGS cases. Conclusions: EGS affected equids throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Although an overall average of 141 cases were reported to the <b>nationwide</b> surveillance <b>scheme</b> annually, this number of cases was not consistent between years. Around 50 % of CGS cases survived, although regional differences in survival rates existed, probably due to variation in expertise of care and/or disease severity. Potential relevance: This study provides information on the spatiotemporal occurrence of EGS in GB during the last decade. Data from the <b>nationwide</b> surveillance <b>scheme</b> can be used in developing protocols for future intervention studies such as Clostridium botulinum vaccine trials. © 2011 EVJ Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comprehensive}} inventory of the non-native vascular flora of Italy, which was produced within the project "A survey of the Italian non-native flora", funded by the Italian Ministry for the Environment. Previously published floristic accounts were {{the main source of}} information. Historical records were critically revised and integrated with recent literature, data from herbaria and some unpublished information, so as to obtain a complete, up-to-date catalogue of the non-native vascular plant species that occur spontaneously in Italy. The inventory lists 1023 non-native species and subspecies, which account for 13. 4 % of all the Italian flora. The Italian non-native flora was divided, according to its residence time, into 103 archaeophytes and 920 neophytes. According to its current invasion status, it was classified into 437 casual (42. 7 % of all non-native) and 524 established taxa, the latter being divided into 361 naturalized non-invasive (35. 3 %) and 163 invasive taxa (15. 9 %). The inventory includes a group of 62 species (6. 1 %) that lack recent records (i. e. since 1950). By combining local expertise into a unified, <b>nationwide</b> <b>scheme</b> using a standardized method and terminology, the inventory provides the essential scientific basis for the development of plant invasion research and management in the country...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{legislation}} to provide income security to workers in Indonesia covers only {{those in the}} formal sector, initially. Workers in the informal sector are at an even greater risk of income loss and are more vulnerable to shocks due to lower average incomes. The author addresses {{the question of whether}} there is a rationale for income security schemes for Indonesia's informal sector. Research suggests that, through a range of existing public programs, Indonesia's government already provides important security mechanisms for informal sector workers, and must continue to do so. The author finds no compelling evidence of the need for a <b>nationwide</b> income security <b>scheme</b> for such workers. The author's argument against a new income security scheme is based on three main conclusions. First, only about 12 percent of the informal sector workforce and even less of the formal sector is underemployed. Second, this level of underemployment does not represent compelling empirical evidence of income insecurity. The connection between underemployment and income insecurity is problematic in theory and remains unsubstantiated by national survey data. Third, many mechanisms already exist in Indonesia to mitigate the disruption caused by income insecurity. Households and communities use private strategies to smooth consumption and investment and the government is already active in providing additional income security. Not only does empirical evidence fail to justify a major new policy response, but most evidence suggests that such a response is not presently necessary. The author suggests that any new initiative directed at income insecurity should be limited in scope and should focus on Eastern Indonesia and on remote or isolated areas of Java, areas with below average incomes. If concerns about income insecurity persist, money should be spend finding out where it actually is before implementing a <b>nationwide</b> <b>scheme</b> to deal with it.
