5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a <b>natural</b> <b>fire</b> regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to <b>natural</b> <b>fire</b> cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Fire suppression, in {{combination}} with other human-caused environmental changes, may have resulted in unforeseen consequences for natural ecosystems. Some large wildfires in the United States have been blamed on years of fire suppression and the continuing expansion of people into fire-adapted ecosystems, but climate change is more likely responsible. Land managers are faced with tough questions regarding how to restore a <b>natural</b> <b>fire</b> regime, but allowing wildfires to burn is the least expensive and likely most effective method.|$|E

5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, <b>natural</b> <b>fires,</b> rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 <b>natural</b> <b>fires</b> have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, <b>natural</b> <b>fires</b> are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|R

Josephus says that Eleazar ordered his men to destroy everything except the foodstuffs to show that the defenders retained the ability to live, and so had chosen death over slavery. However, archaeological excavations have shown that storerooms which contained their provisions were also burnt, though whether this was by Romans, by Jews, or <b>natural</b> <b>fire</b> spreading is unclear.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, forests cover about 10% of {{the land}} area and yet harbor 70% of the country’s bird and {{terrestrial}} mammal species. <b>Natural</b> <b>fire</b> regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of vertebrate species in up to twelve different forest types in British Columbia. Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the initial fire, such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are {{able to use the}} burned areas.|$|E
25|$|Prior to European {{settlement}} in the 19th century, the vegetation consisted of tallgrass prairie and bur oak savanna on ridgetops and dry upper slopes, sugar maple-basswood-oak forest on moister slopes, sugar maple-basswood forests in protected valleys and on north-facing slopes, wet prairies along the rivers and some mesic prairie on the floodplain farther back from the river. There were probably also oak forests that contained no sugar maple. Marsh and floodplain forests were also common on river flood plains. Prairie was restricted primarily to the broader ridge tops, which were unfavorable sites for trees due to thin soils and shallow bedrock, rapid drainage, and desiccating winds; all these conditions were also good for carrying fires across the landscape. Prairies also occurred on steep slopes with south or southwest aspect (see goat prairie). <b>Natural</b> <b>fire,</b> which has long been vigorously suppressed, was essential for the regeneration of such prairies.|$|E

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>fires,</b> {{known as}} {{compartment}} fires, {{account for the}} fire load present in the compartment and decrease in intensity once the fuel has been burned. They widely exist and have important effects on concrete columns. In order to explain the mechanism of the combination of external loads and fire effects on concrete columns, an effective and easy-to-use method is required. As {{a first step in}} this paper, a numerical cross-section method is introduced to obtain interaction curves of columns exposed to fire. Then, this method is applied to analyze several cases with different slenderness ratios. Furthermore, also different reinforcement ratios, concrete cover thickness as well as eccentric loads are considered. Finally, occupancy-specific fires are adopted to study the fire resistance of columns subjected to different <b>natural</b> <b>fires</b> and tabulated data of columns exposed to <b>natural</b> <b>fires</b> are developed...|$|R

25|$|Among {{the most}} obvious {{patterns}} that the size distribution time series shows {{is that in the}} planet’s most southerly latitudes, nearly all the aerosols are large, but in the high northern latitudes, smaller aerosols are very abundant. Most of the Southern Hemisphere is covered by ocean, where the largest source of aerosols is natural sea salt from dried sea spray. Because land is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, the amount of small aerosols from fires and human activities is greater there than in the Southern Hemisphere. Over land, patches of large-radius aerosols appear over deserts and arid regions, most prominently, the Sahara Desert in north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where dust storms are common. Places where human-triggered or <b>natural</b> <b>fire</b> activity is common (land-clearing fires in the Amazon from August–October, for example, or lightning-triggered fires in the forests of northern Canada in Northern Hemisphere summer) are dominated by smaller aerosols. Human-produced (fossil fuel) pollution is largely responsible for the areas of small aerosols over developed areas such as the eastern United States and Europe, especially in their summer.|$|E

The exercise consisted of three events: a table top exercise (TTX) focused on pandemic influenza response, senior manager disaster response, and multinational involvement; a field training exercise (FTX) consisting of area security, entry control point, vehicle control point, convoy security, non lethal weapons, and weapons training; and a humanitarian civic action (HCA) focused on providing medical and dental assistance to the local population. During the exercise, the BFSB – as part of Task Force Kitgum – performed command and control operations in Kitgum, Uganda, in order to synchronize multinational forces conducting field training exercises and humanitarian civic assistance operations to enhance interoperability among participating forces. the 560 BFSB served as a joint and multinational task force headquarters of over 1000 army, navy, air force, marines and personnel from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.
