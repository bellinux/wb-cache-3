5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do <b>not</b> <b>give</b> very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does <b>not</b> <b>give</b> images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E

5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination.

Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E

According to Idolator's Robbie Daw, the opening lyrics to 'Not Giving Up On Love' could almost be describing Sophie’s feelings about her chart fortunes {{over the past}} year: [...] "I know you’re feeling restless, like life’s not on your side/It’s weighing heavy on your mind."In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Hold me now, nothing else matters, it’s {{just the two of}} us / And if it all falls down, nothing else matters, you know we’re strong enough / I’m <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> up, I’m <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> up on us / I said I’m <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> up, I’m <b>not</b> <b>giving</b> up on love." ...|$|R

5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, {{state that}} Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was {{put forward by}} Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does <b>not</b> <b>give</b> a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date {{to be the best}} fit for the available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does <b>not</b> <b>give</b> a precise date within that year.|$|E
