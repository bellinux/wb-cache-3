25|$|Although local {{extinction}} {{of one or}} more competitors has been less documented than niche separation or competitive exclusion, it does occur. In an experiment involving zooplankton in artificial rock pools, local extinction rates were significantly higher in areas of interspecific competition. In these cases, therefore, the negative effects are <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> population level but also species richness of communities.|$|E
25|$|At room {{temperature}} and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium {{when the air}} over the water has a humidity of about 3%. This percentage increases as the temperature goes up. At 100°C and atmospheric pressure, equilibrium is not reached until the air is 100% water. If the liquid is heated a little over 100°C, the transition from liquid to gas will occur <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface, but throughout the liquid volume: the water boils.|$|E
25|$|Kolmogorov married Anna Dmitrievna Egorova in 1942. He {{pursued a}} {{vigorous}} teaching routine throughout his life, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> university level {{but also with}} younger children, as he was actively involved in developing a pedagogy for gifted children (in literature, music, and mathematics). At the Moscow State University, Kolmogorov occupied different positions, including the heads of several departments: probability, statistics, and random processes; mathematical logic. He also served as the Dean of the Moscow State University Department of Mechanics and Mathematics.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{assumes that}} disorganized regeneration {{occurs at the}} site of the lesion. On the contrary, recent research by Choi and Raisman has provided a more thorough understanding of synkinesis through aberrant axonal regeneration. Their study has shown that regenerating axons become disorganized throughout the length of the nerve and <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site of the lesion. Previously, many developed treatment strategies (that inevitably failed) were invented based on the original hypothesis by only focusing on the lesion site for improving the organization of regeneration. The new modification to the hypothesis could allow for better success in developing treatments.|$|E
25|$|Masinissa also {{cultivated}} a grand {{vision of}} uniting all the Berbero-Libyan peoples from {{the frontiers of}} Egypt to the Atlantic. His expansionist actions were directed mainly against the surviving city-state of Carthage. Eventually Masinissa's aggressive actions achieved several major acquisitions of lands previously held by Carthage, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> borders of Numidia and Carthage, but extending also well south of Punic territory, and including Mediterranean seaports in Tripolitania {{to the east of}} Carthage. Indeed, his last war against Carthage {{turned out to be a}} prelude to the Third Punic War (149–146). Here, Rome intervened and eventually besieged and destroyed Carthage.|$|E
25|$|Uniting the Church of Byzantium {{with that}} of Rome was a simple matter, since all the {{bargaining}} chips were {{in the hands of}} the Roman Catholic West. John VIII, as the de facto head of the Byzantine Church ordered the Byzantine Church to accept Papal primacy and declared that the Filioque dispute arose from semantic confusion. Few on Byzantium's side were impressed with the Union between 1438 and 1439 held in Ferrara and Florence, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> terms at which the Byzantine Church had to stoop to, but also at the non-existent aid to Byzantium. One can safely say that the most notable effect of the Union was the increased resentment between Byzantium's populace and the Imperial government.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Jackson {{released}} {{the song and}} music video [...] "Leave Me Alone", a song about his perceived victimization {{at the hands of}} the press. The video shows Jackson poking fun <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> press but also the situation he was in. In the video, there are images of shrines to his friend Elizabeth Taylor, newspapers with bizarre headlines, Jackson dancing with the bones of The Elephant Man, and an animated nose with a scalpel chasing it across the screen.|$|E
500|$|Sidharta {{suggests}} that the novel was written as an argument that the illegitimate children of njais {{would be able to}} develop as any other person, given the proper education. Sutedja-Liem likewise finds that the need for education (including an understanding of music) is a subtext found in the novel. However, unlike Sidharta she considers this message directed <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> children of njais, but women in general. Only through receiving an education and following Chinese and European etiquette, she writes, could a woman be considered truly [...] "modern".|$|E

500|$|The tone of {{the songs}} shifts after the first verse, growing more defiant, and the second verse of the song criticizes the {{violence}} under apartheid, with Gabriel singing about trying to sleep but being able to [...] "only dream in red" [...] because of his anger at the death of black people. The lyrics of the third verse seek to motivate the listener: [...] "You can blow out a candle/But you can't blow out a fire/Once the flames begin to catch/The wind will blow it higher", suggesting that though Biko is dead, the movement against apartheid would continue. The lyrics express a sense of outrage, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> suffering of people under apartheid, but {{at the fact that}} that suffering was often forgotten or denied.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{stations}} {{owned by}} Network Rail {{also continue to}} display much of their GWR heritage. This is seen <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> large stations such as Paddington (built 1851, extended 1915) and Temple Meads (1840, 1875 & 1935) but other places such as Bath Spa (1840), [...] (1878), [...] (1879), [...] (1897), and [...] (1927). Many small stations are little changed from when they were opened, as {{there has been no}} need to rebuild them to cope with heavier traffic; good examples can be found at [...] (1841), [...] (1850, Network Rail's last surviving Brunel-style train shed), [...] (1857), and [...] (1859). Even where stations have been rebuilt, many fittings such as signs, manhole covers and seats can still be found with [...] "GWR" [...] cast into them.|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s, the {{ceremony}} of assenting by commission was discontinued {{and is now}} only employed once a year, {{at the end of}} the annual parliamentary session. In 1960, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod arrived to summon the House of Commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend {{the ceremony}}. The debacle was repeated in 1965; this time, when the Speaker left the chair to go to the House of Lords, some members continued to make speeches. As a result, the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed, creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent. As the attorney-general explained, [...] "there has been a good deal of resentment <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> loss of Parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused." [...] The granting of assent by the monarch in person, or by commission, is still possible, but this third form is used on a day-to-day basis.|$|E

500|$|After Betty and Rita {{find the}} decomposing body, they flee the {{apartment}} and their images are split apart and reintegrated. David Roche notes that Rita's lack of identity causes a breakdown that [...] "occurs <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> level of the character but also {{at the level of}} the image; the shot is subjected to special effects that fragment their image and their voices are drowned out in reverb, the camera seemingly writing out the mental state of the characters". Immediately they return to Betty's aunt's apartment where Rita dons a blonde wig—ostensibly to disguise herself—but making her look remarkably like Betty. It is this transformation that one film analyst suggests is the melding of both identities. This is supported by visual clues, like particular camera angles making their faces appear to be merging into one. This is further illustrated soon after by their sexual intimacy, followed by Rita's personality becoming more dominant as she insists they go to Club Silencio at 2 a.m., that eventually leads to the total domination by Camilla.|$|E

2500|$|Two coupled {{resonators}} may interact <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> resonant frequencies.

2500|$|The Protoevangelium was {{extremely}} popular, but it leaves {{open the possibility}} that Joseph might have had relations with Mary after the birth of Jesus ("she is not yet my wife..."). A few centuries later the developing doctrine that Mary was a virgin <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the conception and birth of Christ, but throughout her life, meant that this possibility had to be excluded.|$|E
2500|$|It {{had been}} noticed {{that when a}} {{regenerative}} receiver went into oscillation, other nearby receivers would suddenly start picking up stations on frequencies different from the stations' transmission frequency. Armstrong (and others) eventually deduced that this {{was caused by a}} [...] "supersonic heterodyne" [...] between the station's carrier frequency and the regenerative receiver's oscillation frequency. Thus if a station was transmitting on 300kHz and the oscillating receiver was set to 400kHz, the station would be heard <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> original 300kHz, but also at 100kHz and 700kHz.|$|E
2500|$|A dialectical {{approach}} is multicausal, multidirectional, integrates facts and value, rejects {{the idea that}} there are hard and fast dividing lines between social phenomena, focuses on social relations, [...] looks <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> present but also at the past and future, and is deeply concerned with both conflicts and contradictions. [...] Simmel’s sociology was concerned with relationships—especially interaction—and was known as a “methodological relationist”. His principle was that everything interacts in some way with everything else. Overall, he was mostly interested in dualisms, conflicts, and contradictions in whatever realm of the social world he happened to be working on.|$|E
