This transformation maximizes the military’s reliance upon data superiority and decision superiority, but we have yet to develop the doctrine, systems, and data insights needed to fully exploit the physical capabilities for communication being developed. To redress the problem of translating human formulated policies into machine-actionable policies that maximize the use of <b>network</b> <b>and</b> computational resources, we must understand how to translate doctrine <b>and</b> policy into <b>network</b> <b>and</b> computational management policies.

Rather, channel encoding is performed at the source node while channel decoding is done only at the destination nodes. We examine three different decoding strategies: independent network-then-channel decoding, serial <b>network</b> <b>and</b> channel decoding, <b>and</b> joint <b>network</b> <b>and</b> channel decoding. Furthermore, we describe how to implement such joint <b>network</b> <b>and</b> channel decoding using iteratively decodable error correction codes. Using simple networks as a model, we derive achievable rate regions and use simulations to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} three decoders. I...|$|R
