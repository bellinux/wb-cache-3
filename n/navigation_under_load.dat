30|$|In the {{experimental}} and contact models, the absolute values of displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> were different, but {{aspects of the}} displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions caused by differences in the loading points were similar and showed similar tendencies. The correlation coefficient of the two was 0.925, representing a significant and strong correlation (p[*]<[*] 0.01). This shows that the behavioral tendencies of the contact model are reflective of those in {{the experimental}} model and that the results obtained had high validity. The CV of the displacement <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions was calculated as about 10 % in some areas of the FEA models, but the mean was about 5 % for all three models, representing a relatively low value. This suggests that all models had highly reproducible displacements <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> and that the results obtained had high validity. Although there are limitations to the reproducible range, it appears possible to infer phenomena to an extent if the properties are understood and the limitations are known.
