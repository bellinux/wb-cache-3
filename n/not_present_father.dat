40|$|Background: Children’s nurses {{claim to}} {{practice}} family-centred care in which care is centred {{on the needs}} of the whole family and to work in partnership with parents to care for the sick child. Fathers of acutely ill children have been overlooked in prior research on parents’ experiences in which samples have been predominantly mothers, yet recent years have seen an increasing focus in other professional fields on the significance of fathers’ involvement in their children’s lives. Aim: To understand how fathers experience their child’s hospitalisation and explore relationships between children’s nurses and fathers in the acute in-patient setting. Method: An ethnographic study took place on two children’s wards consisting of participant observation (150 hours) and interviews with both n resident and non- resident fathers (n= 12) and nurses (n= 7). Thematic analysis yielded understanding of the complexities of fathers’ experiences. Findings: Nurses had no specific preparation for working with fathers and yet had clear expectations of how a good father would act on the ward, based on their experiences with mothers. Fathers, whether resident on the ward or not, played significant roles in their child’s care, yet were largely overlooked by health professionals unless the mother was <b>not</b> <b>present.</b> <b>Fathers</b> also experienced maternal, institutional and structural barriers to partnership in the care of their sick children in hospital. Conclusions and implications: The study begins to redress gaps in knowledge about parents in hospital. Children’s nurses need to recognise that parents are in reality fathers and mothers and that they may therefore have different needs and respond to their child’s illness in different ways. ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{documents}} the conflicts experienced by an Iranian family in Tehran. The screenplay {{of the film}} was written by Farid Mostafavi based on an idea of Mona Zandi’s. Within the film, Sogand (Roya Nownahall) and her son, Omid (Mehrdad Sedighiyan) do not get along. Omid acts out because he does <b>not</b> have a <b>present</b> <b>father.</b> It is suggested that Sogand has a secret that is affecting her wellbeing and relationship with her son until the arrival of Sogand’s sister, Banafshe (Haniye Tayassol) reveals the family's dark past. The film deals with topics of sexual abuse and familial dysfunction.|$|R
40|$|Our {{study is}} the first {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} advanced paternal age (APA) on the developmental trajectory of social behavior in rodent offspring. Given the strong epidemiological association between APA and sexually dimorphic neurodevelopmental disorders that are characterized by abnormalities in social behavior (autism, schizophrenia), we assessed sociability in male and female inbred mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J) across postnatal development (N = 104) in relation to paternal age. We found differences in early social behavior in both male and female offspring of older breeders, with differences in this social domain persisting into adulthood in males only. We showed that these social deficits were <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in the <b>fathers</b> of these offspring, confirming a de novo origin of an altered social trajectory in the offspring generation. Our results, highly novel in rodent research, support the epidemiological observations in humans and provide evidence for a causal link between APA, age-related changes in the paternal sperm DNA and neurodevelopmental disorders in their offspring...|$|R
40|$|Biliary atresia (BA) is a {{pediatric}} cholangiopathy with unknown etiology occurring in isolated and syndromic forms. Laterality defects affecting the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems {{are the most}} common features present in syndromic BA. Most cases are sporadic, although reports of familial cases have led to the hypothesis of genetic susceptibility in some patients. We identified a child with BA, malrotation, and interrupted inferior vena cava whose <b>father</b> <b>presented</b> with situs inversus, polysplenia, panhypopituitarism, and mildly dysmorphic facial features. Chromosomal microarray analysis demonstrated a 277 kb heterozygous deletion on chromosome 20, which included a single gene, FOXA 2, in the proband and her father. This deletion was confirmed to be de novo in the father. The proband and her father share a common diagnosis of heterotaxy, but they also each presented with a variety of other issues. Further genetic screening revealed that the proband carried an additional protein-altering polymorphism (rs 1904589; p. His 165 Arg) in the NODAL gene that is <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in the <b>father,</b> and this variant has been shown to decrease expression of the gene. As FOXA 2 can be a regulator of NODAL expression, we propose that haploinsufficiency for FOXA 2 combined with a decreased expression of NODAL is the likely cause for syndromic BA in this proband...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new point mutation in the SRY gene of a Chinese XY female with gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome). Using the double stranded DNA cycle sequencing method, a single nucleotide substitution of G [...] >A was identified at codon 113 of the patient's SRY gene, {{resulting in a}} conservative amino acid change from alanine (A) to threonine (T) at a residue that lies within the putative DNA binding motif. With this mutation, one MnlI recognition site is abolished and a new BsmAI site {{is present in the}} DNA sequence of the SRY gene; therefore, it is easily detected by analysis of the digestion of the amplified SRY DNA fragment on an electrophoretic agarose gel. In situ hybridisation to the XY female's chromosomes showed that her mutant SRY gene was indeed located on the short arm of her Y chromosome. The SRY mutation in the XY female reported here occurred de novo, as sequence analysis showed that it was <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in her <b>father</b> or other family members...|$|R

50|$|Primarily, {{the locus}} of {{decision}} making power lies with the husband in rural communities. If the husband is <b>not</b> <b>present,</b> it falls to the next male figurehead <b>present</b> (father-in-law, <b>father,</b> brother, etc.). As mentioned previously, this is difficult because many times the husband does not watch the labor and birth and is uneducated about maternal health. Therefore, they are largely uninformed when making decisions about transportation, access, and procedures for mother and baby.|$|R

40|$|EDITOR—Our {{recent report}} {{describing}} the gene mutated in Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC) included a “homozygous ” mutation in an aVected white subject (RA), ncl- 14, {{whose parents were}} not known to be related. 1 The patient’s mother and father have died but we have now studied a paternal DNA sample. Analysis of this sample showed that the single nucleotide insertion in exon 7 (910 - 911 InsA) identified in the patient was <b>not</b> <b>present</b> in her <b>father.</b> The simplest explanation for {{this would have been}} a paternally inherited deletion. However, the father was heterozygous for two intronic polymorphisms (IVS 7 + 4 T→C and IVS 7 + 10 A→G) in the PCR product spanning exon 7, indicating that this exon was amplified from both paternal chromosomes. Chromo-some 4 short tandem repeat (STR) polymor-phisms (Research Genetics set 8) were ana-lysed in the samples from the patient and her father and we observed {{that they did not have}} an allele in common for D 4 S 2366, the most telomeric marker on the short arm. For all the remaining chromosome 4 short tandem repeat polymorphisms and for nine additional non-chromosome 4 STR polymorphisms the pa-tient and her father shared an allele, making non-paternity extremely unlikely. Additional STR polymorphisms were identified from the physical map of chromosome 4 p at the Stanford Human Genome Center websit...|$|R
