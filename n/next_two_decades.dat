5|$|By {{shutting}} down Black Snow and prosecuting Takechi, Eirin {{had intended to}} suppress the new pink film genre, but the trial had the exact opposite outcome.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to describe and characterize the behaviour of fish prices in Nigeria. Drawing upon aspects of the data from a nationwide fish survey in 1980 / 81 and on various secondary data, the study analyses the pattern of fish price movement and makes projections of fish prices in Nigeria till 2002 A.

It is concluded that unless efforts are directed at stemming inflation in fish prices, prices paid by fish consumers in Nigeria will be more than doubled within the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decade...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1974, {{after years}} of {{centralised}} monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio. French television was partly liberalised in the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decade</b> {{with the creation of}} several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service Télévision Numérique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there have been}} major {{advances}} {{in our understanding of}} the molecular interplay between plants and various classes of microbial pathogens (bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, viruses, and nematodes) and microbial symbionts (rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi). These fundamental insights, reviewed in a special section in this issue (p. 741), provide a conceptual framework for rational human intervention through the breeding or engineering of crops for durable and broad-spectrum disease resistance. However, such engineered plants will eventually be deployed into soils of varying geochemistry that harbor a staggering diversity of microbes. Many of these microbes can associate intimately with crops or other plants in natural habitats. A deeper understanding of plant-associated microbial communities is likely to offer exciting opportunities for controlling plant growth and pathogen burden in sustainable agricultural settings over the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decade...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1481 and 1482, {{earthquakes}} {{destroyed the}} Jewish quarter, {{so that only}} 22 families remained in the city.

5|$|Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as Jean-Paul Ngassa and Thérèse Sita-Bella {{explored}} similar themes. In the 1960s, Mongo Beti, Ferdinand Léopold Oyono {{and other}} writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and {{the recovery of}} African identity. Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa and Daniel Kamwa dealt with the conflicts between traditional and post-colonial society. Literature and films during the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> concentrated more on wholly Cameroonian themes.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Harvard and {{serving in the}} Army during World War I, Tunis began his writing career freelancing for American sports {{magazines}} while playing tennis in the Rivera.

Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E
