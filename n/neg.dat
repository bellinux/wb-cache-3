40|$|Purpose: ‘Negging’ can be {{described}} as the purposeful lowering of a woman’s self-esteem to increase perceived attractiveness of the man in order to achieve sexual conquest. <b>Negging</b> has evolved over time. Whilst ‘Original’ <b>negging</b> was intended to be a harmless tool for attracting women, more recently dating companies have been teaching men ‘Evolved’ <b>negging</b> in a potentially damaging way, which could escalate into an abusive intimate relationship. Design: An online survey involving vignettes depicting <b>negging</b> between strangers with three conditions; ‘Original’, ‘Evolved’ and ‘Control’ was completed by 308 participants. Participants were asked how harmful, acceptable, and how likely to escalate each scenario was. A fourth vignette described ‘Evolved’ <b>negging</b> between partners. Results: Mixed methods ANOVA indicated that participants perceived all <b>negging</b> as being significantly more harmful than control ‘pick-up’ lines. ‘Evolved’ <b>negging</b> was considered to be more likely to escalate in seriousness than ‘Original’ <b>negging.</b> Conclusions: Despite the public viewing <b>negging</b> as harmful and with the potential to escalate in seriousness, women are still being targeted in this manner and the industry ‘teaching’ <b>negging</b> is growing despite controversy. This study aims to increase general awareness of <b>negging</b> in order to minimise harm caused to women who are ‘picked-up’ through this technique. To this end, directions for future research are highlighted. Originality: This paper {{is one of the first}} empirical studies in the area of <b>negging.</b> The perceived, and potential, harm caused can be studied in light of these novel findings with the aim of protecting women from harm...|$|R

5000|$|... "Negging" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as the practice of giving a woman a backhanded compliment such as [...] "nice nails -- are they real?", to weaken her confidence and therefore render her more vulnerable to seduction, or that depriving a woman of obsequious validation and attention will influence her to seek it from the man who <b>negs</b> her. [...] Conor Friedersdorf lambasted the use of <b>negging</b> by pick-up artists, but admitted that, based on his observations, <b>negging</b> did appear to be effective at generating attraction from some women. [...] A 2009 study found that men giving negative attention to [...] "high social anxiety" [...] women produced more positive behavior in the women than if the men treated them nicely.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Negging</b> {{is an act}} of {{emotional}} manipulation whereby a person makes a deliberate +backhanded compliment or otherwise flirtatious remark to another person to undermine their confidence and increase their need of the manipulator's approval. Although some believe that it builds attraction, it results in poor quality relationships. Over time the less confident person becomes resentful. <b>Negging</b> is often misunderstood as straightforward insult rather than as a pick up line. [...] The term was coined and prescribed by the pickup artist community. The term has been popularized in social media and mainstream media. The opposite is pozzing, whereby one pays a person a compliment in order to gain their affection.|$|R
2500|$|In most formats, {{correctly}} {{answering a}} toss-up earns a team 10 points.

Answering a tossup incorrectly is called [...] "negging", and may incur a 5-point penalty for a team. After a <b>neg</b> occurs, the moderator continues reading the rest of the question for the other team. There are usually no further penalties after one team has already negged.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "home market effect" [...] that Krugman {{discovered}} in NTT also features in <b>NEG,</b> which interprets agglomeration [...] "as {{the outcome of}} the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and factor price differences." [...] If trade is largely shaped by economies of scale, as Krugman's trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production. That is, NTT implies that instead of spreading out evenly around the world, production will tend to concentrate in a few countries, regions, or cities, which will become densely populated but will also have higher levels of income.|$|E
