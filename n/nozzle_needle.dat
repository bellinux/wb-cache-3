40|$|Fuel direct {{injection}} {{represents one of}} the key turning points {{in the development of the}} Diesel engines. The appeal of this solution has been growing thanks to the parallel advancement in the technology of the injection hardware and in the knowledge of the physics involved in the spray formation and combustion. In the present thesis, the effect of partial needle lift and injection rate shaping has been investigated experimentally using a multi-orifice Diesel injector. Injection rate shaping is one of the most attractive alternatives to multiple injection strategies but its implementation has been for long time impeded by technological limitations. A novel direct-acting injector prototype made it possible to carry out the present research: this injector features a mechanical coupling between the <b>nozzle</b> <b>needle</b> and the piezo-stack actuator, allowing a fully flexible control on the <b>nozzle</b> <b>needle</b> movement and enabling partial needle lift as well as the implementation of alternative injection rate shapes typologies. Different optical diagnostics were applied to study the spray development and combustion in a novel continuous flow test chamber that allows an accurate control on a wide range of thermodynamic conditions (up to 1000 K and 15 MPa). In addition, hydraulic characterization tests were carried out to analyze the fuel flow through the injector nozzle. Partial needle lift has been found to affect the injection event, reducing the mass flow rate (as expected) but also causing a reduction in the effective orifice area and an increase on the spreading angle. Moreover, at this condition, higher hole-to-hole dispersion and flow instabilities were detected. Needle vibrations caused by the needle interactions with fuel flow and by the onset of cavitation in the needle seat are likely the causes of this behavior. Injection rate shaping has a substantial impact on the premixed phase of the combustion and on the location where the ignition takes place. Furthermore, the results proved that the modifications in the internal flow caused by the partial needle lift are reflected on the ignition timing. On the other hand, the analysis of the experimental data through a 1 D spray model revealed that an increasing mass flow rate (e. g. ramp or boot injection rate profiles) causes an increase in the fuelair equivalence ratio at the lift-off length and a consequent higher soot formation during the diffusive phase of the combustion. Finally, the wide range of boundary conditions tested in all the experiments served to draw general conclusions about the physics involved in the injection/combustion event and, in some cases, to obtain statistical correlations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The jet spray {{tool for the}} production of a jet of carbon dioxide snow for dry cleaning of tube cavity, comprises a shaft (11), carbon dioxide jet nozzle (13), an inlet line for carbon dioxide, which is attached to the nozzle and which runs along the shaft. The nozzle is arranged at or in an end of the shaft in such a manner that it is tiltable around at least an axis, which does not coincide with the jet direction of nozzle and which extends through the nozzle. The shaft exhibits a round and/or an oval and/or a quadrangular and/or polygonal cross section and a joint. The inlet line runs inside the shaft. A part or the whole length of the inlet line for CO 2 is a capillary. The inlet line is arranged spirally around a straight line defined by a swivel axis of the nozzle.

40|$|Currently, the {{hydroelectric}} {{generating sets}} of small HPPs with Pelton turbines employ as their generating units conventional synchronous generators with electromagnetic excitation. To {{deal with the}} torque pulsatile behaviour, they generally install a supplementary flywheel on the system shaft that levels the pulsations. The Pelton turbine power output is adjusted by the needle changing water flow in the nozzle, whose advancement modifies the nozzle area and eventually – the flow. They limit the needle full stroke time to 20 – 40 sec. since quick shutting the nozzle for swift water flow reduction may result in pressure surges. For quick power adjustment so-called deflectors are employed, whose task is retraction of water jets from the Pelton turbine buckets. Thus, the mechanical method of power output regulation requires agreement between the needle stroke inside the turbine nozzles and the deflector. The paper offers employing frequency-controlled synchronous machines with permanent magnets qua generating units for the hydroelectric generating sets of small HPPs with Pelton turbines. The developed computer model reveals that this provides {{a higher level of}} adjustability towards rapid-changing loads in the grid. Furthermore, this will replace the power output mechanical control involving the valuable deflector drive and the turbine <b>nozzle</b> <b>needles</b> with electrical revolution rate and power output regulation by a frequency converter located in the generator stator circuit. Via frequency start, the controllable synchronous machine ensures stable operation of the hydroelectric generating set with negligibly small amount of water (energy carrier).

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the rate of fuel injection using a constant volume, fluid filled chamber and measuring the pressure change {{as a function of}} time due to the injected fluid (the so called “Zeuch” method) is an industry standard due to its simple theoretical underpinnings. Such a measurement device is useful to determine key timing and quantity parameters for injection system improvements to meet the evolving requirements of emissions, power and economy. This study aims to further the {{understanding of the nature of}} cavitation which could occur in the near nozzle region under these specific conditions of liquid into liquid injection using high pressure diesel injectors for heavy duty engines. The motivation for this work is to better understand the temporal signature of the pressure signals that arise in a typical injection cycle. A preliminary CFD study was performed, using OpenFOAM, with a transient (Large Eddy Simulation -LES), multiphase solver using the homogenous equilibrium model for the compressibility of the liquid/vapour. The nozzle body was modelled for simplicity without the <b>nozzle</b> <b>needle</b> using a nozzle hole of 200 μm diameter and the body pressurised to values typical for common rail engines. Temperature effects were neglected and the wall condition assumed to be adiabatic. The chamber initial static pressure was varied between 10 and 50 bar to reflect typical testing conditions. Results indicate that vapour formation could occur in areas 10 - 30 mm distant from the nozzle itself. The cavitation was initiated around 100 μs after the jet had started for low ΔP cases and followed the development period required for the formation of vortices associated with the vortex roll up of this jet. These vortices had localised sites, in their core region, below the vapour pressure and were convected downstream of their initial formation location. It was also found that vapour formation could occur at chamber static pressures up to 50 bar (the highest tested) due to cavitation in the shear layer and this vortex effect. The pressure signal received at the chamber would therefore be more difficult to interpret with additional error components...|$|E

Nozzles with different internal diameter sizes {{in the range of}} 0. 11 - 0. 84 mm and low gas flow rates from 0. 015 to 0. 85 ml/min are used. The bubble formation is recorded by a high speed video camera and detailed characteristics of bubble formation are obtained. Interestingly, it is realized that the bubble volume expansion rate follows a cyclic behavior for the substrate nozzles while it shows a smooth decrease after an initial increase for the <b>needle</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Force balance analysis suggests that fluctuations in the substrate are related to the rapid increase of the attaching inertial force at the initial stages of bubble formation. In contrast, the inertial force {{in the case of the}} needle is smaller and takes longer to acquire its maximum value. The results also show that bubbles emerge earlier on top of the substrate than on the needle but the initial bubble volume is smaller in the former case. However, the bubble expansion rate is larger for the substrate than for the needle and as a result the final bubble volume is similar for both cases.

Indeed, it is widely acknowledged that fuel injection equipment faults lead to increased fuel consumption, reduced power, greater levels of exhaust emissions and even unexpected engine failure. Previous investigations have identified {{fuel injector}} related acoustic emission activity as being caused by mechanisms such as fuel line pressure build-up; fuel flow through injector <b>nozzles,</b> injector <b>needle</b> opening and closing impacts and premixed combustion related pulses.

The investigation presented addresses this ambiguity by detailing a study in which AE signals were recorded and analysed from two different Diesel engines employing the two commonly encountered yet fundamentally different types of fuel injection equipment.

The effects of appliedb voltage, the distance between the disk nozzle and collector, and PVA concentration on the fibre morphology were examined. The dependency of fibre diameter on the PVA concentration showed a similar trend to that for a conventional electrospinning system using a syringe <b>needle</b> <b>nozzle,</b> but the diameter distribution was wider for the disk electrospun fibres in this study. The profiles of electric field strength in disk electrospinning showed considerable dependence on the disk thickness, with a thin disk exhibiting similar electric field profile to that of a needle electrospinning system, but a thick disk (cylinder) exhibiting levelled electric field between the disk and the collector. PVA nanofibres electrospun from disk electrospinning were compared to that electrospun from syringe needle and metal cylinder nozzles...|$|R
40|$|Precision surface {{assemblies}} can {{be found}} in the two locations in a fuel system of a diesel engine. These parts are the pumping section in an injection pump and the injector nozzles. In this paper the authors present the results of surface topography measurements of precise surface assemblies of some fuel injectors. The measurements have been made with the atomic force microscope (AFM) NT- 206. The results of surface topography measurements were presented in the form of 2 D and 3 D images and also as surface roughness profiles in some selected cross-sections of the investigated surfaces. It has been also shown cumulative roughness height distribution and roughness height distribution as well as Minkowski volume (first Minkowski functional). After scanning the surface on the atomic force microscope, the obtained data were processed with the SurfaceXplorer ® 1. 311 and Gwyddion 2. 35 software. The study concerned some new injector nozzles and also injector nozzles after a certain time of operation. The side and the conical precise surface assembly of the injector <b>nozzle</b> body and <b>needle</b> were tested. The atomic force microscope NT- 206 allows to perform a surface scan of the sample with maximum dimensions of 32 x 32 Pm and a maximum height of roughness ± 1 Pm. Scanned area was divided into 256 x 256 measurement points, while the measurement was carried out in a static (contact) mode. The results presented in this paper also includes the calculated values of Ra, Sa (roughness average) and Rq, Sq (root mean square roughness) surface roughness parameters and the value of the skewness Ssk (Rsk), kurtosis Sku (Rku) and maximum distance between the lowest valley and the highest peak of investigated surface – Rt. The obtained data allow evaluating the degree and type of wear of tested surfaces on the micro-scale...|$|R
40|$|This work reports {{investigations}} on Diesel spray transients, {{accounting for}} internal <b>nozzle</b> flow and <b>needle</b> motion, and demonstrates how seamless calculations of internal flow and external jet {{can be accomplished}} in a Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) framework using an Eulerian mixture model. Sub-grid stresses are modeled with the Dynamic Structure (DS) model, a non-viscosity based one-equation LES model. Two problems are studied with high level of spatial and temporal resolution. The first one concerns an End-Of-Injection (EOI) case where gas ingestion, cavitation, and dribble formation are resolved. The second case is a Start-Of-Injection (SOI) simulation that aims at analyzing the effect of residual gas trapped inside the injector sac on spray penetration and rate of fuel injection. Simulation results are compared against experiments carried out at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) using synchrotron X-ray. A mesh sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess {{the quality of the}} LES approach by evaluating the resolved turbulent kinetic energy budget and comparing the outcomes with a length-scale resolution index. LES of both EOI and SOI processes have been carried out on a single hole Diesel injector, providing insights in to the physics of the processes, with internal and external flow details, and linking the phenomena {{at the end of an}} injection event to those at the start of a new injection. Concerning the EOI, the model predicts ligament formation and gas ingestion, as observed experimentally, and the amount of residual gas in the nozzle sac matches with the available data. The fast dynamics of the process is described in detail. The simulation provides unique insights into the physics at the EOI. Similarly, the SOI simulation shows how gas is ejected first, and liquid fuel starts being injected with a delay. The simulation starts from a very low needle lift and is able to predict the actual Rate-Of-Injection (ROI) and jet penetration, based only on the prescribed needle motion. Finally, guidelines and future improvements of the model are discussed concerning the simulation of the transient injection phases...|$|R
40|$|Needle wells are {{conventional}} well-bores {{that contain}} several hundreds of laterals, called needle holes. The reservoir contact area is increased by these holes, which enables enhanced hydrocarbon production. The needle holes {{are created by}} dedicated pipes that are equipped with nozzles. These pipes are mounted in a special liner that is lowered downhole. By pumping fluid-abrasive particle mixtures through the nozzles, the formation is eroded away and causes the needle to propagate into the reservoir. The transport of fluid-particle mixtures in the narrow annulus of a needle geometry might result in challenges with regards to hole cleaning. Also, pressure losses for these mixtures are challenging to predict. The {{purpose of this study}} was to experimentally investigate the effects of flow rate variations, needle inclinations and needle eccentricity on pressures and hole cleaning in the annulus between a needle and the hole that it creates. From a literature study was determined that the combination of water with 4 vol. % steel particles might be a good mixture for the purpose of needle jetting. Due to strong acceleration of the mixture in the <b>nozzles</b> of the <b>needle,</b> the impact of the particles cause the formation to break and the water subsequently can enter the cracks to remove the rock cuttings. Typical pressures that have to be applied over the nozzles are in the order of 350 bar. The material properties for steel particles and water were used as input for a needle system design calculation. The needle diameter was set at 10 mm and from pressure loss calculations, and the aim to apply maximum pressure drop over the nozzle, the annulus outer diameter was defined to be 16 mm. Typical flow rates needed per needle are in the order of 30 L/min. Steel particle sizes for this system were calculated to be ~ 0. 2 mm. A program of experiments was defined wherein flow rates were varied between 10 - 30 L/min in steps of 10 L/min. Steel particle concentrations were set at 4 vol. % and particle sizes ranged from 0. 2 - 0. 3 mm. These experiments were run in a specially designed setup, wherein the annulus eccentricity and inclinations can be varied over their full range. Experiments were conducted for a concentric annulus in horizontal, vertical and 45 degree critical angle setting. For a fully eccentric annulus, the transport in horizontal and critical angle setting were investigated. In the vertical and critical angle experiments, the flow-direction was set against the force of gravity. Over a small length in the annulus, movies of the particle distributions were recorded by high speed camera. Stationary beds, moving beds and an asymmetric suspension of particles only occurred at 10 L/min & 20 L/min for horizontal eccentric setting and at 10 L/min for critical angle eccentric setting. The pressure losses for water-steel particle mixtures in concentric annuli were all higher than the losses for water flow. However, for increasing flow rates, this difference decreased. During water-steel particle experiments at 10 L/min in horizontal concentric setting, the annulus plugged. This resulted in rapid particle buildup in the annulus and should therefore be avoided. When flowing at 10 L/min in vertical concentric setting, the pressure losses were lower than for flowing at 10 L/min at horizontal and critical angle concentric settings. A pressure loss model for homogeneously suspended particles matched within 10 % accuracy with the results from vertical concentric setting. Furthermore, it was expected that at the critical angle, particle beds would slide back into the hole. This was not observed during the experiments.
