The new religious paintings at that time were <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a success, and the Imperial Academy refused to exhibit them in its annual exhibition.|$|E
5|$|While the {{overriding}} {{atmosphere of the}} interior and exterior of the palace is of the 18th century, the palace itself is <b>not.</b> <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> its appearance {{is a result of}} a long evolution dating from the 12th century, overshadowed by heavy restoration and refurnishing during the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Not</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Nerva's {{early life}} or career is recorded, {{but it appears}} he did not pursue the usual {{administrative}} or military career. He was praetor-elect in the year 65 and, like his ancestors, moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist. As an advisor to Emperor Nero, he successfully helped detect and expose the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. His exact contribution to the investigation is not known, but his services must have been considerable, since they earned him rewards equal to those of Nero's guard prefect Tigellinus. He received triumphal honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — {{and the right to}} have his statues placed throughout the palace.|$|E

5|$|The games {{received}} critical acclaim, obtaining {{an aggregate}} score of 81percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised {{the fact that}} the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an improvement over the previous games, Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. FireRed and LeafGreen were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The team {{started their}} SEC {{schedule}} back {{up with a}} trip to South Carolina. The Gamecocks were <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an opponent, as the ladies more than doubled their points at the half (53–26), and finished the game 94–52. This game was followed up with another highly ranked opponent, the twelfth-ranked Gators. Once again, the Vols ran a talented team into the ground, as they only allowed 18 first half points, ultimately winning by a score of 99–60.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the plan}} was {{theoretically}} sound, it was ineffective in stimulating economic growth. During Diem's time, there was little meaningful economic investment or development of infrastructure. The businessmen mostly used the import subsidies to purchase consumer goods such as boats, motorbikes, refrigerators, radios, music systems and other similar goods, which were luxuries at the time. The program was thus effective in expanding {{the size of the}} urban middle class, but it did not generate much economic investment. Only a minority of the purchases were of capital goods such as manufacturing equipment and supplies for factory production. As a result, <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the subsidies created more economic production. The government funds generated from selling importing licenses also became a problem, with corruption and explicit theft dogging its effectiveness as a means of bankrolling the military and civil service. In addition, some government officials would not sell the coveted licenses to the businessmen until a bribe was paid. Another criticism of the CIP was that the funds collected by the government were not used for any significant amount of government-sector economic investment but mainly to fund the army. Diem defended this by stating that national security was paramount.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee had {{a three-game}} road trip up next, {{starting}} with the Bulldogs in Athens. Tennessee started the game strong, grabbing the lead, and finished the half on a 13–0 run. However, Georgia came back, cutting the lead down to nine with seven minutes remaining in the game. It {{was at this point}} that Semeka Randall scored thirteen points, sealing a 96–71 victory. This is the largest margin of victory in the Lady Bulldogs-Lady Vols series. Tennessee had 19 steals in the game, while shooting over 50%, and Holdsclaw and Catchings both scored over 20. The next game, against Kentucky, also had Tennessee making a late first half run, giving them a 19-point lead at the break. This lead was never given up, as the Lady Vols won by twenty-eight. The final game of the road trip was against DePaul, a good team who was, however, missing their two best players. Without these players, it was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a game, as Summitt's team started the game with twenty-one straight points and ended the game with a 125–46 victory, giving the team a 20–0 record. The team's 125 points were the second most {{in the history of the}} program.|$|E
25|$|Chester County native Jesse W. Fell asked Abraham Lincoln for an autobiographical {{narrative}} in 1858. Lincoln initially refused, but eventually wrote a 606-word account, explaining that “there is <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it, for the reason, I suppose, {{that there is}} <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> me.” Fell sent this sketch to his friend Joseph Lewis in West Chester. Lewis embellished on the short account and published the biography in the Chester County Times on February 11, 1860. The first published biography of Lincoln, it was circulated in newspapers across the U.S. and was considered crucial in securing the Republican nomination by Lincoln himself. The building that {{it was written in}} is today known as the Lincoln Building.|$|E
