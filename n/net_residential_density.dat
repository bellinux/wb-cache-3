S 1. 1. 3 PURPOSE: The {{purpose of the present}} study was to document the strength, shape, and generalizability of associations of built environment variables to total {{physical activity}}, using objective measures of independent and dependent variables in an international sample of adults. METHODS: The International Physical activity and Environment Network (IPEN) Adult Study was a coordinated international study, with each country following standard methods as much as possible. The study design was to recruit participants from neighbourhoods selected to be high or low on walkability and high or low on income. Present analyses were done with 6822 adults aged 18 - 66 years from 14 cities in 9 countries from 5 continents. Seven indicators of walkability, transit access, and park access were assessed in 1 -km street network buffers around each participant’s home using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) -based methods. Total minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were measured by 4 + days of waistworn accelerometer monitoring. Associations of environmental variables with MVPA were estimated using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) with Gamma variance and logarithmic link functions, and numerous covariates. RESULTS: Four of 7 individual environmental variables were significantly and linearly related to MVPA: <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> intersection density, transit density, and number of parks. Mixed land use variables and distance to nearest transit point were unrelated. The proportional differences in MVPA between residents living in areas with the lowest and highest observed values in individual environmental attributes ranged from ~ 25 % to ~ 69 %. All associations generalized across study sites (i. e., non-significant interactions with site). When adjusting for other environmental variables, only two variables remained significant, with <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> jointly explaining 10 % of between-site and 20 % of between-neighbourhood differences in MVPA. CONCLUSION: Using objective data in a study of 14 cities in 9 countries, residential density, intersection density, transit access, and number of parks were positively related to total moderateto-vigorous physical activity, with residential density being the strongest correlate. Generalizability of findings across cities suggests built environment interventions hold promise as a strategy reduce the health burden of the global physical inactivity pandemic...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{association}} of socio-demographic and built environment characteristics on the odds of being overweight and obese {{using data from the}} Atlanta SMARTRAQ travel survey. A new methodological framework based on a multinomial logit (MNL) model and an enhanced odds ratio plot is presented. The use of an MNL model overcomes limitations of many prior studies that employ a sequence of binary logit models to examine multiple weight categories. The use of an enhanced odds ratio plot provides important information into the relative importance of socio-demographic and built environment characteristics. Several new findings for the Atlanta area result from this study. Socio-demographic variables, including age and educational attainment, exhibit a non-linear relationship with the odds of being overweight or obese. Gender, age, ethnicity, and educational attainment are strongly associated with the odds of being overweight or obese, while income and number of students between 5 and 16 years old in the household have smaller effects. Built environment characteristics such as increased <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> and enhanced street connectivity are associated with reductions in the odds of being overweight and/or obese. Relative to socio-demographic variables, however, such built environment characteristics have a much smaller impact on describing the odds of being overweight or obese.

Building on the concept of space syntax, we propose an alternative walkability index, space syntax walkability (SSW). This study examined associations of the full walkability index and SSW with walking for transport (WT). Methods: Data were collected in 2003 – 2004 from 2544 adults living in 154 Census Collection Districts (CCD) in Adelaide, Australia. Participants reported past week WT frequency. Full walkability (consisting of <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> intersection density, land use mix, and net retail area ratio) and SSW (consisting of gross population density and a space syntax measure of street integration) were calculated for each CCD using geographic information systems and space syntax software. Generalized linear models with negative binomial variance and logarithmic link functions were employed to examine the associations of each walkability index with WT frequency, adjusting for socio-demographic variables.

40|$|A {{substantial}} body {{of research}} is focused on understanding the relationships between socio-demographics, land-use characteristics, and mode specific attributes on travel mode choice and time-use patterns. Residential and commercial densities, inter-mixing of land uses, and route directness in conjunction with transportation performance characteristics interact to influence accessibility to destinations as well as time spent traveling and engaging in activities. This study uniquely examines the activity durations undertaken for out-of-home subsistence; maintenance, and discretionary activities. Also examined are total tour durations (summing all activity categories within a tour). Cross-sectional activities are obtained from household activity travel survey data from the Atlanta Metropolitan Region. Time durations allocated to weekdays and weekends are compared. The censoring and endogeneity between activity categories and within individuals are captured using multiple equations Tobit models. The analysis and modeling reveal that land-use characteristics such as <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> {{and the number of}} commercial parcels within a kilometer of a residence are associated with differences in weekday and weekend time-use allocations.

40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{involving}} {{the built environment}} have typically relied on US Census data to measure <b>residential</b> <b>density.</b> However, census geographic units are often unsuited to health-related research, especially in rural areas where development is clustered and discontinuous. Objective We evaluated the accuracy of both standard census methods and alternative GIS-based methods to measure rural density. Methods We compared <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (units/acre) in 335 Vermont school neighborhoods using conventional census geographic units (tract, block group and block) with two GIS buffer measures: a 1 -kilometer (km) circle around the school and a 1 -km circle intersected with a 100 -meter (m) road-network buffer. The accuracy of each method was validated against the actual <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> for each neighborhood based on the Vermont e 911 database, which provides an exact geo-location for all residential structures in the state. Results Standard census measures underestimate <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> in rural areas. In addition, the degree of error is inconsistent so even the relative rank of neighborhood densities varies across census measures. Census measures explain only 61 % to 66 % {{of the variation in}} actual <b>residential</b> <b>density.</b> In contrast, GIS buffer measures explain approximately 90 % of the variation. Combining a 1 -km circle with a road-network buffer provides the closest approximation of actual <b>residential</b> <b>density.</b> Conclusion <b>Residential</b> <b>density</b> based on census units can mask clusters of development in rural areas and distort associations between <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> and health-related behaviors and outcomes.

Data were collected through an extensive housing survey carried out on 1, 485 household residences in 56 wards within 12 administrative units in Lagos megacity. The spatial dimension of <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> in the city generates three unique residential patterns which are low <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (LRD), medium <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (MRD), and high <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (HRD) areas.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} widely attached to urban density and by implication housing density, it is curious that our general understanding of housing densities and their relations or effects remains remarkably unsophisticated, {{and seems to}} attract even less academic or professional attention now than at some times in the past. When housing densities are measured comparisons are infrequently made or evaluated. In general, little concern is shown for achieving comparability as different measures (site density, <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density)</b> are common. And what goes for density goes for the relations between density and other measures important to understanding or forming judgements about appropriate densities, such as site cover and plot ratio. We seem to have little more to go on than our intuitions or statements of preferences concerning what are tolerable or appropriate densities, relative to inhabitation. The best general text on this matter remains Housing as if People Mattered, which was published over 20 years ago and confined itself to medium density family housing. As for the mix of built form and social or cultural factors influencing our density preferences or impressions it is anybody’s guess.

Understanding environmental risk factors for health is of public health importance. We contribute to these efforts by asking: Are attributes {{of the social and}} built residential environment able to explain between-people differences in gait speed? A cross-sectional analysis of relatively healthy community-dwelling older adults was conducted using baseline participants (n= 2, 637; female= 52 %; average age= 74 + 2. 89; Black= 39 %) from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study. Performed 6 meter walk at usual gait speed was the outcome of interest. The associations between measures of the residential environment (tracts) and gait speed (meters per-second, m/sec) were assessed using linear regressions. After adjusting for socioeconomics, health behaviors and conditions, results indicated that neither street connectivity nor <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> explained between-people variance in gait speed. Poverty concentration did explain between-people variance in gait speed. Living in a tract where a 30 % or more of the residents are in-poverty is associated with a 0. 02 m/sec slower gait speed when compared to living in a tract where poverty concentration is < 9 %. In this observational study, poverty concentration in residential environment was significantly associated with gait speed.

Our objectives were to assess the associations between characteristics of the {{built environment}} and physical activity among adults in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and to examine potential moderation by perceived park and neighborhood safety. MethodsWe conducted a population-based study of adults in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in 2011 (N = 677). Participants wore Actigraph GT 3 X accelerometers for 7 days. We used geographic information systems (GIS) to generate 500 -m- and 1 -km-buffer 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cbased measures of <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> proportion of commercial land use, land-use mix, connectivity, walkability, and number of parks and transit routes. We also obtained data on distance to the nearest park with GIS. Perceived neighborhood and park safety were self-reported. We created quartile-based categories for all built environment characteristics and ran linear regression models to estimate the association between each characteristic and total weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and MVPA within 10 -minute bouts. ResultsWalkability was inversely related to total weekly minutes of MVPA (1 -km buffer, 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 01946. 9 [standard error, 20. 0]; P =. 03) and weekly minutes of MVPA within bouts (500 -m buffer, 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 01931. 5 [12. 9]; P =. 02). The number of transit routes in the 500 -m buffer was inversely related to total weekly minutes of MVPA (22 ̆c 62 ̆ 01923. 8 [10. 6]; P =. 04). Perception of park safety moderated the association between physical activity and having a park intersect the 500 -m buffer.

40|$|Internationally, transit {{oriented}} development (TOD) is characterised by {{moderate to}} high density development with diverse land use patterns and well connected street networks centred around high frequency transit stops (bus and rail). Although different TOD typologies {{have been developed}} in different contexts, {{they are based on}} subjective evaluation criteria derived from the context in which they are built and typically lack a validation measure. Arguably there exist sets of TOD characteristics that perform better in certain contexts, and being able to optimise TOD effectiveness would facilitate planning and supporting policy development. This research utilises data from census collection districts (CCDs) in Brisbane with different sets of TOD attributes measured across six objectively quantified built environmental indicators: net employment density, <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> land use diversity, intersection density, cul-de-sac density, and public transport accessibility. Using these measures, a Two Step Cluster Analysis was conducted to identify natural groupings of the CCDs with similar profiles, resulting in four unique TOD clusters: (a) residential TODs, (b) activity centre TODs, (c) potential TODs, and (d) TOD non-suitability. The typologies are validated by estimating a multinomial logistic regression model {{in order to understand the}} mode choice behaviour of 10, 013 individuals living in these areas. Results indicate that in comparison to people living in areas classified as residential TODs, people who reside in non-TOD clusters were significantly less likely to use public transport (PT) (1. 4 times), and active transport (4 times) compared to the car. People living in areas classified as potential TODs were 1. 3 times less likely to use PT, and 2. 5 times less likely to use active transport compared to using the car. Only a little difference in mode choice behaviour was evident between people living in areas classified as residential TODs and activity centre TODs. The results suggest that: (a) two types of TODs may be suitable for classification and effect mode choice in Brisbane; (b) TOD typology should be developed based on their TOD profile and performance matrices; (c) both bus stop and train station based TODs are suitable for development in Brisbane...|$|E
40|$|Background: To more {{accurately}} quantify {{the potential impact}} of the neighbourhood environment on adults' physical activity (PA), it is important to compare environment-PA associations between periods of the day or week when adults are more versus less likely to be in their neighbourhood and utilise its PA resources. We examined whether, among adults from 10 countries, associations between objectively-assessed neighbourhood environment attributes and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) varied by time of the day and day of the week. The secondary aim was to examine whether such associations varied by employment status, gender and city. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 6, 712 adults from 14 cities across 10 countries with >= 1 day of valid accelerometer-assessed MVPA and complete information on socio-demographic and objectively-assessed environmental characteristics within 0. 5 and 1 km street-network buffers around the home. Accelerometer measures (MVPA min/h) were created for six time periods from early morning until late evening/night, for weekdays and weekend days separately. Associations were estimated using generalized additive mixed models. Results: Time of the day, day of week, gender and employment status were significant moderators of environment-MVPA associations. Land use mix was positively associated with MVPA in women who were employed and in men irrespective of their employment status. The positive associations between MVPA and <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> intersection density and land use mix were stronger in the mornings of weekdays and the afternoon/evening periods of both weekdays and weekend days. Associations between number of parks and MVPA were stronger in the mornings and afternoon/evenings irrespective of day of the week. Public transport density showed consistent positive associations with MVPA during weekends, while stronger effects on weekdays were observed in the morning and early evenings. Conclusions: This study suggests that space and time constraints in adults' daily activities are important factors that determine the impact of neighbourhood attributes on PA. Consideration of time-specific associations is important to better characterise the magnitude {{of the effects of the}} neighbourhood environment on PA. Future research will need to examine the contribution of built environment characteristics of areas surrounding other types of daily life centres (e. g., workplaces) to explaining adults' PA at specific times of the day...|$|E

40|$|Community {{resilience}} to disasters is an affected area’s {{ability to}} rebound after a catastrophic event. The mounting frequency and scale of natural disasters, increasing urbanization, a growing reliance on interdependent technologies and infrastructure systems, and inflated expectations of interventions {{are responsible for}} greater disaster vulnerability and demonstrate {{the need to develop}} more resilient communities. Given the increasing shocks of natural disasters, a more complete understanding of resilience is important for creating safer, more sustainable communities. One factor that is known to impact resilience is social networks. Urban planning research has shown that walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods can encourage the development of social networks and place attachment through an increase in interactions and a higher density of neighborhood amenities, including characteristics of the built environment that influence social networks, such as varied land uses and pedestrian-oriented design. The built environment connects residents to a place and can serve as a benchmark for recovery. Therefore, {{it is possible that the}} traditional planning domain of urban design can be harnessed to foster greater resilience by facilitating stronger social networks. In order to determine the legitimacy of this supposition, this research examines how social networks and the built environment create greater resilience to disasters. Given that social networks increase community resilience to all types of disasters, social networks are shown to be influenced by certain types of space, and the built environment is a common intervention for planners, this research explores the potential for creating cities that are more resilient by creating spaces that foster social networks. The Mississippi Gulf Coast was chosen as a case study area in order to explore the above relationships. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the region, resulting in massive wind and storm surge damage to the Mississippi Coast. Communities in the area have recovered at varying rates and levels. Therefore, this region provided an opportunity to contrast higher and lower resilience communities and to test the above research questions. The research was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, a quantitative model was developed in order to address whether there are statistically significant effects on resilience due to the built environment. In the second stage, a qualitative case study analysis of communities was undertaken using interviews with local residents. The results demonstrate that certain aspects of the built environment are associated with greater resilience, including intersection density, <b>net</b> <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> the density of historic sites, and community amenities where social networks gather. Furthermore, urban design features with the greatest capacity to increase resilience were also useful features for the types of local social networks that were found to be most important for resilience.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> on commuting behavior across U. S. cities while controlling for available opportunities, the technology of transportation infrastructure, and individual socio-economic and demographic characteristics. The measures of metropolitan and local density are addressed separately. It is suggested that metropolitan <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> serves principally as a surrogate for city size. Markets react to high interaction costs found in large cities by raising density rather than density being a cause of those high costs. Local <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> measures relative location (accessibility) within the metropolitan region as well as indexing the level of congestion. Regressions are conducted to predict commuting time, speed, and distance, by mode of travel on a cross-section of individuals nationally and city by city.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> on commuting behavior across U. S. cities while controlling for available opportunities, the technology of transportation infrastructure, and individual socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The measures of metropolitan and local density are addressed separately. We suggest that metropolitan <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> serves principally as a surrogate for city size. We argue that markets react to high interaction costs found in large cities by raising density rather than density being a cause of those high costs. Local <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> measures relative location (accessibility) within the metropolitan region as well as indexing the level of congestion. We conduct regressions to predict commuting time, speed, and distance by mode of travel on a cross-section of individuals nationally and city by city. The results indicate that <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> {{in the area around}} the tripmaker’s home is an important factor: the higher the density the lower the speed and the shorter the distance. However, density’s effect on travel time is ambiguous, speed and distance are off-setting effects on time.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the context}} of recent social and {{economic}} transitions in China, lack of physical activity among adolescents is an emerging health risk, particularly so in rapidly expanding urban areas. Evidence from Western countries suggests that built environ-ment attributes can influence the physical activity participation of young people, {{but whether or not}} this is the case for China is unknown. We recruited high school students from ten urban districts in Nanjing, Mainland China (n= 2, 375; mean age= 13. 9 ± 1. 0 years old; 46 % boys; survey response rate= 89 %). The outcome variable was self-reported recreational physical activity time; the primary explanatory variable was the <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> of the urban districts. Analysis was conducted using mixed-effects logistic regression models. After adjustment for potential confounding variables, including sedentary behavior and green space, there was a consistent and graduated association between <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> and physical activity; <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> was significantly negatively associated with recreational physical activity time for students from the higher tertile of <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (OR; 95 % CI= 0. 64; 0. 42 to 0. 97) compared to those from the lower tertile. The direction and magnitude of the negative association between <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> and physical activity was similar for boys and girls. It should be a public health priority to identify the particular urban environment attributes that can encourage and support young people’s participation in physical activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since {{the seminal}} work of Jane Jacobs, it has become {{conventional}} wisdom among scholars and professional planners that high <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> and mixed commercial and residential land use reduce street crime. This notion has been influential in guiding planning decisions, but empirical evidence is limited. This paper examines the impact of mixed land use and <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> on crime using a unique high–resolution dataset from Chicago over the period 2008 – 2013. I employ a novel instrumental variable strategy based on the city’s 1923 zoning code. I find that commercial uses, especially liquor stores and late–hour bars, lead to more street crime in their immediate vicinity, with relatively weak spillover effects. Higher <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> leads to lower per capita crime rates and ameliorates the criminogenic externalities of commercial activity. I discuss the implications for zoning policy and policing strategy. 1...|$|R
40|$|Municipalities {{sometimes}} reform {{property tax}} schedules {{in an effort}} to increase suboptimal <b>residential</b> <b>densities.</b> One such approach is to reduce the tax rate applied to building values and increase the tax rate applied to land, known as a two-rate property tax (TPT). This paper evaluates the impact of a TPT on <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> in Nashville-Davidson County,Tennessee where a conventional property tax schedule prevails during 2006 – 2007. When land taxes are proportionally higher than taxes on structures, 1. 07 to 1 and 1. 25 to 1 for general and urban service districts, respectively, ex ante simulations suggest that housing density increases by 18 % in general services districts and 83 % in urban services districts. Key words: <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> spatial lag probit, two-rate property tax. JEL codes: Q 24, R 14. Most municipalities in the United States collect residential real estate property taxes based on a percentage of total assessed property value. These policies place equal value on land and structures, but the taxation of build-ings or structures inflates the perceived cost of improvements, thereby discouraging site improvement and potentially reducing eco-nomic returns (Mathis and Zech 1982). Thus, the landowner can reduce their tax burden by developing projects that use relatively more land than structures. This behavior leads to lower than optimal <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> (Skaburskis and Tomalty 1997). In response to suboptimal <b>residential</b> <b>densities,</b> researchers have investigated reducing tax rates applied to structures and increasing tax rates on land using a “two-rate property tax ” (TPT) as an alternative to plac-ing equal weight on land and structure taxes. ...|$|R
