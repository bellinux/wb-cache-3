5|$|Nickel {{is slowly}} {{oxidized}} by air {{at room temperature}} and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, {{it has been used}} for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant <b>nickel</b> <b>plating.</b> Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon {{in the metal}} finishing field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|E

500|$|Holsters for the Type 94 pistol were {{generally}} made from either pigskin or cowhide leather and ranged in color from tan to dark reddish brown. Holsters faced the same degradation in quality as the Type 94 pistol. As supplies of leather were exhausted in Japan, holsters manufactured in 1944 became fabricated from olive drab fabric. The Type 94 pistol holster is distinguishable from other Japanese holsters having a pointed closure flap and a vertically positioned magazine pouch. The pouch tow has a narrow extension {{to accommodate a}} cleaning rod. The majority of holsters were made in civilian owned tanneries with some ink stamped with arsenal and inspection marks. A belt loop and two shoulder strap [...] "D" [...] rings are provided on {{the rear of the}} holster and are made from brass, galvanized steel, or <b>nickel</b> <b>plating.</b>|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in October 1993, but was delayed because Crowe was busy on another film in Australia. Principal photography for The Quick and the Dead lasted from November 21, 1993 to February 27, 1994. Locations included Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and Mescal, 40 miles southeast of Tucson. Production was briefly halted at times over weather problems. Thell Reed, who was hired as the gun coach and weapons master, worked with the cast through over three months of training. To age Cort's Colt 1851 Navy Revolver and the other guns used, Reed experimented with simple measures. [...] "I took them out by my swimming pool and dipped them in chlorine water to let them rust," [...] he explained. [...] "They looked rusty and old, but were brand new guns." [...] Such detail, including the <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> and ivory handles on Ellen's Colt Peacemakers, was accurate to the time period.|$|E

2500|$|In {{all types}} of multimeters, {{the quality of the}} {{switching}} elements is critical to stable and accurate measurements.

5000|$|After the war, in 1947, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway {{ended its}} {{control of the}} <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate,</b> when it sold off its {{remaining}} shares.

50|$|From its {{completion}} in 1882, the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (<b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> Road) ran over the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway from a junction at Grand Crossing neighborhood north to downtown Chicago, {{where it had}} its own terminal south of LaSalle. The LS&MS quickly gained control of the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate,</b> and later allowed it into its LaSalle Street Station as a tenant.

The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks. [...] Originally, the reverse side had a relief profile of Antoinette Perry; this later was changed to contain the winner's name, award category, production and year. The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrazine is a {{convenient}} reductant because the by-products are typically nitrogen gas and water. [...] Thus, {{it is used}} as an antioxidant, an oxygen scavenger, and a corrosion inhibitor in water boilers and heating systems. [...] It {{is also used to}} reduce metal salts and oxides to the pure metals in electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> and plutonium extraction from nuclear reactor waste. [...] Some colour photographic processes also use a weak solution of hydrazine as a stabilizing wash, as it scavenges dye coupler and unreacted silver halides. Hydrazine is the most common and effective reducing agent used to convert graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via hydrothermal treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Its main {{industrial}} use is for electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> (Ni–P), {{although it is}} primarily used as a salt (sodium hypophosphite). In organic chemistry, [...] H3PO2 {{can be used for}} the reduction of arenediazonium salts, converting [...] to Ar–H. [...] When diazotized in a concentrated solution of hypophosphorous acid, an amine substituent can be removed from arenes, selectively over alkyl amines. Owing to its ability to act as a mild reducing agent and oxygen scavenger it is sometimes used as an additive in Fischer esterification reactions, where it prevents the formation of colored impurities. Hypophosphorous acid is also used in the formulation of pharmaceuticals, discoloration of polymers, water treatment, retrieval of precious or non-ferrous metals.|$|E

2500|$|Due to high {{demands for}} copper and zinc {{during the war}} effort, the use of Tombac was suspended. A new {{composition}} of steel with [...]0127mm plating of nickel and [...]0003mm plating of chromium became the norm. The plating process of these coins meant that strips had to be plated before blanks were punched out. The end result was that {{the edges of the}} blanks were unplated. Although the RCM returned to nickel after WWII, the Korean war effort resulted in the use of steel again in 1951. Some of the steel coins were later discovered to have only the <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> and had a grey rather than the usual [...] "bluish" [...] appearance. Until recently, this variety did not command a premium price from collectors, but the fact that some years are rarer than others has started to generate interest in this variety.|$|E

50|$|Electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> layers {{are known}} to provide extreme surface {{adhesion}} when plated properly. Electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> is non-magnetic and amorphous. Electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating</b> layers are not easily solderable, nor do they seize with other metals or another electroless nickel-plated workpiece under pressure. This effect benefits electroless nickel-plated screws made out of malleable materials like titanium. Electrical resistance is higher compared to pure metal plating.|$|E

50|$|Electroless <b>nickel</b> <b>plating,</b> {{also known}} as enickel and NiP, offers many advantages: uniform layer {{thickness}} over most complicated surfaces, direct plating of ferrous metals (steel), superior wear and corrosion resistance to electroplated nickel or chrome.

5000|$|To {{save his}} company, Lackawanna president, Perry Shoemaker, sought a merger with the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Plate</b> Road, {{a deal that}} would have created a {{railroad}} stretching more than 1,100 mi from St. Louis, Missouri, to New York City and would have allowed the Lackawanna to retain the 200 mi of double-track mainline between Buffalo and Binghamton, New York.
