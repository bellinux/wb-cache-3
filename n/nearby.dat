5|$|A more {{substantial}} Bronze Age settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains of what may have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form of wooden piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and <b>nearby</b> Barway. A Bronze Age ring and a late Bronze Age sherd were excavated <b>nearby.</b> There {{have been a number of}} Bronze Age finds in the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at <b>nearby</b> Fordey farm, Barway, and at Little Thetford, a middle Bronze Age (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late Bronze Age flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E

5|$|According to NJDEP reports, two {{developed}} lake {{communities in}} the Papakating Creek watershed—Lake Neepaulin and the <b>nearby</b> Clove Acres Lake contribute to phosphorus loading {{in the waters of}} Papakating Creek.

5|$|As of the 2010 census, {{the city}} of Brookings had a {{population}} of 6,336, while <b>nearby</b> Harbor had 2,391.

5|$|As {{part of an}} {{operation}} {{that resulted in the}} Coral Sea battle, the Japanese Navy sent troops to occupy Tulagi and <b>nearby</b> islands in the southern Solomons. These troops—mainly members of the 3d Kure Special Naval Landing Force—occupied Tulagi on 3 May 1942, and constructed a seaplane, ship refueling, and communications base on Tulagi and the <b>nearby</b> islands of Gavutu, Tanambogo and Florida, all of which were soon operational. Aware of the Japanese efforts on Tulagi, the Allies' concern increased in early July 1942 when the Japanese Navy began constructing a large airfield near Lunga Point on <b>nearby</b> Guadalcanal. By August 1942, the Japanese had about 900 troops on Tulagi and <b>nearby</b> islands, and 2,800 personnel (many of whom were Korean and Japanese construction specialists and laborers) on Guadalcanal. The airfield—when complete—would protect Japan's major base at Rabaul, threaten Allied supply and communication lines, and establish a staging area for possible future offensives against Fiji, New Caledonia, and Samoa (Operation FS).|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived <b>nearby</b> and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the <b>nearby</b> hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a <b>nearby</b> area that was more salubrious.|$|E

5|$|During Darwin's lifetime, many {{geographical}} {{features were}} given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the Beagle Channel was named Darwin Sound by Robert FitzRoy after Darwin's prompt action, {{along with two}} or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a <b>nearby</b> shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the <b>nearby</b> Mount Darwin in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the Beagle was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend John Lort Stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain Wickham named Port Darwin: a <b>nearby</b> settlement was renamed Darwin in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.|$|E

The city of Gonaïves was completely flooded after a <b>nearby</b> river overflowed its banks. Residents sought safety from the flood waters in the upper floors and roofs of their homes. Sixteen {{people were killed in}} the city after a bridge was destroyed by the swollen river. The Tonazeau River near Port-au-Prince also topped its banks, inundating <b>nearby</b> areas.|$|E
