5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Pechersky {{returned}} to Rostov-on-Don, where he lived before the war, and started working as administrator in an Operetta theater. The mass murder of Jews at the Sobibor death camp {{became part of the}} charges against leading Nazis at the <b>Nuremberg</b> Trials. The International Tribunal at <b>Nuremberg</b> wanted to call Pechersky as a witness, but the Soviet government wouldn't allow him to travel to Germany to testify.|$|E
5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at <b>Nuremberg,</b> but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he saw this as poor reward for the work he had put in at <b>Nuremberg.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the <b>Nuremberg</b> Trials and the Subsequent <b>Nuremberg</b> trials.|$|E
5|$|The two panels were reunited in 2012 {{during a}} Dürer {{exhibition}} in <b>Nuremberg</b> having been separated since sometime between 1588 and 1628.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Göring {{was convicted}} of war crimes and crimes against {{humanity}} at the <b>Nuremberg</b> trials. He {{was sentenced to death}} by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting cyanide the night before the sentence was to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the <b>Nuremberg</b> {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the <b>Nuremberg</b> standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{surrendered}} unconditionally on 8 May 1945. Hess, facing charges {{as a war}} criminal, {{was ordered}} {{to appear before the}} International Military Tribunal and was transported to <b>Nuremberg</b> on 10 October 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Bavaria legally {{defined the}} apothecaries' pound as 360.00g (an ounce of 30.00g). In 1815, <b>Nuremberg</b> lost {{its status as}} a free city and became part of Bavaria. From now on the <b>Nuremberg</b> apothecaries' pound was no longer the {{official}} apothecaries' pound in Nuremberg; but the difference was only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries' pound was officially defined by this standard, four years after Otto, the son of the king of Bavaria, became the first king of Greece. But only few German states followed the example of Bavaria, and with a long delay. The apothecaries' pound of 360g was also adopted in Lübeck, where it was official as of 1861.|$|E
5|$|In August 1927, Wessel {{traveled}} {{in a group}} of fifty SA men to the Nazi Party rally in <b>Nuremberg,</b> joining other Berlin-based Nazis to make a group of 400, led by Goebbels. At the time, the SA was banned in Berlin. When they returned, the brownshirts were arrested.|$|E
5|$|In January 1532, Cranmer was {{appointed}} the resident ambassador {{at the court}} of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in Ratisbon (Regensburg). He passed through the Lutheran city of <b>Nuremberg</b> and saw {{for the first time}} the effects of the Reformation. When the Imperial Diet was moved to <b>Nuremberg</b> in the summer, he met the leading architect of the <b>Nuremberg</b> reforms, Andreas Osiander. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife. This was all the more remarkable given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all {{former high}} {{officials}} of the Nazi regime, were flown from <b>Nuremberg</b> to Berlin under heavy guard. The prisoners were taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what became West Berlin, where they were designated by number, with Speer given Number Five. Initially, the prisoners were kept in solitary confinement for all but half an hour a day, and were not permitted to address each other or their guards. As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months in four that the three Western powers were in control; the four occupying powers took overall control on a monthly rotation. Speer considered himself an outcast among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at <b>Nuremberg.</b>|$|E
5|$|Röhm was purged {{from all}} Nazi propaganda, {{such as the}} film of the 1933 <b>Nuremberg</b> rally, {{although}} a print copy {{of the motion picture}} by film director Leni Riefenstahl survived and was found in the United Kingdom many years later.|$|E
5|$|The SS was the {{organization}} {{most responsible for}} the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims in the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at <b>Nuremberg</b> to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, {{was found guilty of}} crimes against humanity at the <b>Nuremberg</b> trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E
5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in <b>Nuremberg.</b> Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and <b>Nuremberg,</b> {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E
5|$|After a {{difficult}} {{leg of the}} tour in Japan, where {{some members of the}} band had difficulty obtaining heroin, Thin Lizzy played their final UK concert before their break-up at the Reading Festival on 28 August 1983, which was eventually released in 1992 as their BBC Radio One Live in Concert album. The last concert came in <b>Nuremberg</b> on 4 September, at the Monsters of Rock festival, after which the band members went their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} title, Steinitz played in tournaments more {{frequently}} than he had previously. He won at New York 1894, and was fifth at Hastings 1895 (winning the first brilliancy prize for his game with Curt von Bardeleben). At Saint Petersburg 1895, a super-strong four player, multi-round-robin event, with Lasker, Chigorin and Pillsbury, he took second place. Later his results began to decline: 6th in <b>Nuremberg</b> 1896, 5th in Cologne 1898, 10th in London 1899.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazi {{seizure of}} power in 1933, Hess was {{appointed}} Deputy Führer of the NSDAP and received a post in Hitler's cabinet. He was the third {{most powerful man in}} Germany, behind only Hitler and Hermann Göring. In addition to appearing on Hitler's behalf at speaking engagements and rallies, Hess signed into law much of the legislation, including the <b>Nuremberg</b> Laws of 1935, which stripped the Jews of Germany of their rights in the lead-up to the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|As of 1800 all German {{states and}} cities except Lübeck (which had the Dutch troy standard) {{followed}} the <b>Nuremberg</b> standard. It was also the standard for Denmark, Norway, the Russian Empire and most cantons of Switzerland. Poland and Sweden had their own variants of the standard, which differed from each other by 0.6%.|$|E
5|$|Austria and {{the states}} of the Habsburg monarchy officially had a {{different}} standard since 1761, and Prussia, followed by its neighbours Anhalt, Lippe and Mecklenburg, would diverge in the opposite direction with a reform in 1816. But in both cases apothecaries continued to use the <b>Nuremberg</b> standard unofficially {{for a long time after}} it became illegal.|$|E
5|$|Braun was {{a member}} of Hoffman's staff when she {{attended}} the <b>Nuremberg</b> Rally {{for the first time in}} 1935. Hitler's half-sister, Angela Raubal (the dead Geli's mother), took exception to her presence there, and was later dismissed from her position as housekeeper at his house in Berchtesgaden. Researchers are unable to ascertain if her dislike for Braun was the only reason for her departure, but other members of Hitler's entourage saw Braun as untouchable from then on.|$|E
5|$|Edmund's fictitious {{continental}} origins {{were later}} expanded into legends which {{spoke of his}} parentage, his birth at <b>Nuremberg,</b> his adoption by Offa of Mercia, his nomination as successor to the king and his landing at Hunstanton on the North Norfolk coast to claim his kingdom. Other accounts state {{that his father was}} the king he succeeded, Æthelweard of East Anglia, who died in 854, apparently when Edmund was a boy of fourteen.|$|E
5|$|Göring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, {{a wealthy}} Jewish {{physician}} and businessman {{his father had}} met in Africa. Epenstein provided the Göring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau, then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near <b>Nuremberg.</b> Göring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of Ritter (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{lived with}} his half-niece, Geli Raubal, in an {{apartment}} at Prinzregentenplatz 16 in Munich from 1929 until her death. On 18 September 1931 Raubal {{was found dead in}} the apartment with a gunshot wound, an apparent suicide with Hitler's pistol. Hitler was in <b>Nuremberg</b> at the time. The relationship—likely the most intense of his life—had been important to him. Hitler began seeing more of Braun after Raubal's suicide.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, {{physician}} Johann Friedrich Engelhardt discovered some vertebrae and leg bones at Heroldsberg near <b>Nuremberg,</b> Germany. Three {{years later}} German palaeontologist Hermann von Meyer designated {{them as the}} type specimen of a new genus, Plateosaurus. Since then, remains of well over 100 individuals of Plateosaurus have been discovered at various locations throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the regime}} {{withdrew from the}} Treaty of Versailles and {{introduced}} the <b>Nuremberg</b> Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities. Germany also reacquired control of the Saar in 1935, remilitarized the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement and in direct violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia with the proclamation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939.|$|E
5|$|Lamason was {{not afraid}} to speak his mind. On the night of 30/31 March 1944, when 795 bombers were sent to attack <b>Nuremberg,</b> he was very {{critical}} of the route chosen, warning his station commander that heavy losses could be expected. On the moonlit night, 95 bombers were lost, its heaviest losses of the entire war during a single raid.|$|E
5|$|Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 <b>Nuremberg</b> Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered {{techniques}} of camera movement and editing that influenced later films. New {{techniques such as}} telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of National Socialist ideals.|$|E
5|$|Nazi war leader Hermann Göring used cyanide to {{kill himself}} {{the night before he}} was {{supposed}} to be hanged during the <b>Nuremberg</b> Trials. Adolf Hitler had also taken a pill of cyanide but he bit down on the capsule and shot himself in the right temple shortly before the fall of Berlin along with his wife, Eva Braun.|$|E
5|$|One {{copy of the}} Protocol with {{circulated}} {{minutes of}} the meeting survived the war. It was found by Robert Kempner in March 1947 among files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office. It was used as evidence in the Subsequent <b>Nuremberg</b> Trials. The Wannsee House, site of the conference, is now a Holocaust memorial.|$|E
5|$|Several senior German {{military}} officials were tried and convicted for {{their involvement in}} the reprisal shootings at the <b>Nuremberg</b> trials and the subsequent <b>Nuremberg</b> trials. The massacre {{had a profound effect}} on the course of the war in Yugoslavia. It exacerbated tensions between the two guerrilla movements, the communist-led Partisans and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, and convinced Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović that further attacks against the Germans would only result in more Serb civilian deaths. The Germans soon found mass executions of Serbs to be ineffectual and counterproductive, as they tended to drive the population into the arms of insurgents. The ratio of 100executions for one soldier killed and 50executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. The massacre is commemorated by the October in Kragujevac Memorial Park and the co-located 21stOctober Museum, and has been the subject of several poems and feature films. The day the massacre took place is commemorated annually in Serbia as the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Tasci {{made his}} debut for the Germany under-21 team on 6 February 2007 in a 2–0 win against Scotland {{and went on}} to make his senior {{international}} debut for Germany on 20 August 2008 in a friendly match against Belgium in <b>Nuremberg,</b> which they won 2–0. The debut came exactly two years after his Bundesliga debut.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi regime {{began to}} persecute Jews {{soon after the}} seizure of power. Hess's office was partly {{responsible}} for drafting Hitler's <b>Nuremberg</b> Laws of 1935, laws that had far-reaching implications for the Jews of Germany, banning marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and depriving non-Aryans of their German citizenship. Hess's friend Karl Haushofer {{and his family were}} subject to these laws, as Haushofer had married a half-Jewish woman, so Hess issued documents exempting them from this legislation.|$|E
