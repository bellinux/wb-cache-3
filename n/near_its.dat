5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs <b>near</b> <b>its</b> atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF <b>near</b> <b>its</b> original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is <b>near</b> <b>its</b> dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is <b>near</b> <b>its</b> maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma {{is between}} the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, {{generally}} sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary.

The state's lowest point is on the Little River <b>near</b> <b>its</b> far southeastern boundary {{near the town of}} Idabel, Oklahoma, which dips to 289 feet (88m) above sea level.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical cyclone, Chantal maintained scattered convection <b>near</b> <b>its</b> center, though its main area of convection and clouds extended to its north. Midday on August 1, the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, hitting the Placentia Area with full force. It subsequently intensified to attain winds of near hurricane-force. On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening {{trend in the}} far northern Atlantic Ocean, and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone {{to the east of}} Iceland.|$|E
