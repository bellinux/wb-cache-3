The solubility of <b>nadifloxacin</b> in oils, surfactants and cosurfactants was evaluated to screen the components of the microemulsion. Various surfactants and cosurfactants were screened for their ability to emulsify the selected oily phase. The pseudoternary diagrams were constructed to identify the area of microemulsion existence. The influence of km (surfactant/cosurfactant) ratio on the microemulsion existence region was determined and optimum systems were designed. The systems were assessed for drug-loading efficiency and characterised for optical birefringence, pH and refractive index, robustness to dilution, globule size, drug content and thermodynamic stability. Optimised microemulsion systems were formulated into gel form and evaluated for viscosity, spreadability, drug content, ex vivo skin permeation and antibacterial activity. The maximum solubility of <b>nadifloxacin</b> in the microemulsion system was found to be 0. 25 %. The <b>nadifloxacin</b> microemulsions had a small and uniform globule size (67. 3 - 121. 23 nm).

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>nadifloxacin</b> alone and with benzoyl peroxide {{in the treatment of}} mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris. Patients and Methods: This double-blind, randomized study was conducted in a total of 93 acne patients, with at least 10 inflammatory lesions, but no more than 3 nodules or cysts on the face. All patients were instructed to apply <b>nadifloxacin</b> 1 % cream twice daily and randomized to apply either benzoyl peroxide 5 % lotion or its vehicle once daily for 8 weeks. Results: The mean percent reduction in inflammatory lesions were 22. 08 % in the <b>nadifloxacin</b> group (n= 46) and 53. 5 % in the nadifloxacin+benzoyl peroxide group (n= 47). Five (10. 9 %) patients in the <b>nadifloxacin</b> group and 18 (38. 3 %) patients in the nadifloxacin+benzoyl peroxide group achieved a 50 % and greater reduction in the inflammatory lesion count. Conclusion: Both treatment regimens were statistically effective, but a significantly greater reduction of the inflammatory lesions was seen in the nadifloxacin+benzoyl peroxide group.

High-performance thin-layer chromatographic separation was performed on aluminum plates precoated with silica gel 60 F 254 and methanol:ethyl acetate:toluene: acetonitrile: 3 M ammonium formate in water (1 : 2. 5 : 6. 0 : 0. 3 : 0. 2, % v/v) as optimized mobile phase at detection wavelength of 224  nm. The retardation factor (Rf) values for <b>nadifloxacin,</b> mometasone furoate, and miconazole nitrate were 0. 23, 0. 70, and 0. 59, respectively. Percent recoveries in terms of accuracy for the marketed formulation {{were found to be}} 98. 35 – 99. 76 %, 99. 36 – 99. 65 %, and 99. 16 – 100. 25 % for <b>nadifloxacin,</b> mometasone furoate, and miconazole nitrate, respectively. The pooled percent relative standard deviation for repeatability and intermediate precision studies was found to be < 2 % for three target analytes. The effect of four independent variables, methanol content in total mobile phase, wavelength, chamber saturation time, and solvent front, was evaluated by fractional factorial design for robustness testing. Amongst all four factors, volume of methanol in mobile phase appeared to have a possibly significant effect on retention factor of miconazole nitrate compared with the other two drugs <b>nadifloxacin</b> and mometasone furoate, and therefore it was important to be carefully controlled.

40|$|Background: A {{combination}} of topical retinoid and antibacterial therapy is often advocated for acne to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Aims: A preliminary study {{to evaluate the}} efficacy and tolerability of a topical fixed {{combination of}} <b>nadifloxacin</b> (1 %) and adapalene (0. 1 %) {{in the treatment of}} mild to moderate acne in Indian patients. Materials and Methods: This was an open-labeled, phase 3 non-randomized, non-comparative study conducted at five centers (Ahmedabad, Nagpur, Thane, Bangalore, and Mumbai) across India. Of 119 enrolled patients with mild to moderate acne, 117 patients were evaluated {{at the end of the}} study for efficacy parameters. A fixed combination of <b>nadifloxacin</b> (1 %) and adapalene (0. 1 %) topical gel was applied at the affected area once at night for a period of 8 weeks. Reduction in the total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts from the baseline, investigator global assessment (IGA) and reduction in the severity of acne as per combined acne severity classification were the primary efficacy variables measured at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Results: Overall, 98. 3 % patients showed a statistically significant progressive reduction in non-inflammatory lesion counts, inflammatory lesion counts, and total lesion counts over the study duration. By the end of 8 weeks, 75 % of the patients had their global assessment scores approaching to normal healthy skin score. The adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Conclusion: This preliminary study shows that a fixed combination of 1 % <b>nadifloxacin</b> and 0. 1 % adapalene topical gel could be an effective and well-tolerated option for the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{recent years}} inhibitors {{directed}} against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have evolved as effective targeting cancer drugs. Characteristic papulopustular exanthemas, often described as acneiform rashes, are the most frequent adverse effect associated with this class of novel cancer drugs and develop in > 90 % of patients. Notably, the rash may significantly compromise the patients' quality of life, thereby potentially leading to incompliance as well as dose reduction or even termination of the anti-EGFR therapy. Yet, an effective dermatologic management of cutaneous adverse effects can be achieved. Whereas various case reports, case series or expert opinions on the management of EGFR-inhibitor (EGFRI) induced rashes have been published, data on systematic management studies are sparse. Methods Here, we present a retrospective, uncontrolled, comparative study in 49 patients on three established regimens {{for the management of}} EGFRI-associated rashes. Results Strikingly, patients' rash severity improved significantly over three weeks of treatment with topical mometason furoate cream, topical prednicarbate cream plus <b>nadifloxacin</b> cream, as well as topical prednicarbate cream plus <b>nadifloxacin</b> cream plus systemic isotretinoin. Conclusions In summary our results demonstrate that EGFRI-associated rashes can be effectively managed by specific dermatologic interventions. Whereas mild to moderate rashes should be treated with basic measures in combination with topical glucocorticosteroids or combined regiments using glucocorticosteroids and antiseptics/antibiotics, more severe or therapy-resistant rashes are likely to respond with the addition of systemic retinoids. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: In {{external}} preparations, {{types and}} ratios of additives {{are not necessarily}} the same for brand-name drugs and generic drugs. Thus, the physicochemical properties of preparations may differ {{despite the fact that they}} contain the same ingredients or additives. This study examined differences in brand-name and generic versions of <b>nadifloxacin</b> (NFX) creams. Material and Methods: Three types of NFX creams (NFX-A, NFX-B, and NFX-C) were used. The viscosity of each preparation was determined, its yield value was calculated, and each preparation was subjected to light microscopy, x-ray powder diffraction, and near-infrared absorption spectroscopy. Results: Comparison of viscosity of different preparations revealed that NFX-B had a lower viscosity than NFX-A and NFX-C (14. 5 vs. 24. 6 and 17. 9 Pa?s). NFX-B also had a lower yield value than NFX-A and NFX-C. Microscopy revealed that NFX-A and NFX-B had satisfactory emulsification although crystallization was observed with NFX-C. Near-infrared absorption spectroscopy revealed changes in the absorption spectra of NFX-B in comparison with those of NFX-A and NFX-C that were due to differences in water content and differences in fat and oil content. Conclusions: These findings confirmed that there were differences in the viscosity and flattening of NFX-A, NFX-B, and NFX-C. In addition, microscopy revealed differences in emulsification and it revealed the precipitation of NFX crystals in NFX-C. Near-infrared absorption spectroscopy revealed that differences in the type and amount of additives and water content in the creams had contributed to differences in the preparations.

40|$|Objective : Biological {{dressings}} like collagen are impermeable to bacteria, {{and create}} the most physiological interface between the wound surface and the environment. Collagen dressings have other advantages over conventional dressings in terms of ease of application and being natural, non-immunogenic, non-pyrogenic, hypo-allergenic, and pain-free. This study aims to compare the efficacy of collagen dressing in treating burn and chronic wounds with that of conventional dressing materials. Materials and Methods : The records of 120 patients with chronic wounds of varied aetiologies and with mean age 43. 7 years were collected and analyzed. The patients had been treated either with collagen or other conventional dressing materials including silver sulfadiazine, <b>nadifloxacin,</b> povidone iodine, or honey (traditional dressing material). Patients with co-morbidities that could grossly affect the wound healing like uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or renal disease, or major nutritional deprivation were not included. For the purpose of comparison the patients {{were divided into two}} groups; &#x 2032;Collagen group&#x 2032; and &#x 2032;Conventional group&#x 2032;, each having 60 patients. For assessment the wound characteristics (size, edge, floor, slough, granulation tissue, and wound swab or pus culture sensitivity results) were recorded. With start of treatment, appearance of granulation tissue, completeness of healing, need for skin grafting, and patients&#x 2032; satisfaction was noted for each patient in both groups. Results : With two weeks of treatment, 60 &#x 0025; of the &#x 2032;collagen group&#x 2032; wounds and only 42 &#x 0025; of the &#x 2032;conventional group&#x 2032; wounds were sterile (P = 0. 03). Healthy granulation tissue appeared earlier over collagen-dressed wounds than over conventionally treated wounds (P = 0. 03). After eight weeks, 52 (87 &#x 0025;) of &#x 2032;collagen group&#x 2032; wounds and 48 (80 &#x 0025;) of &#x 2032;conventional group&#x 2032; wounds were > 75 &#x 0025; healed (P = 0. 21). Eight patients in the &#x 2032;collagen group&#x 2032; and 12 in the &#x 2032;conventional group&#x 2032; needed partial split-skin grafting (P = 0. 04). Collagen-treated patients enjoyed early and more subjective mobility. Conclusion : No significant better results in terms of completeness of healing of burn and chronic wounds between collagen dressing and conventional dressing were found. Collagen dressing, however, may avoid the need of skin grafting, and provides additional advantage of patients&#x 2032; compliance and comfort...|$|E
40|$|NoPropionibacterium acnes is {{the target}} of {{antimicrobial}} treatments for acne vulgaris. Acquired resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracyclines {{has been reported in}} strains from diverse geographical loci, but the molecular basis of resistance, via mutations in genes encoding 23 S and 16 S rRNA, respectively, has so far only been elucidated for isolates from the U. K. The study set out to determine whether similar or different resistance mechanisms occur in resistant P. acnes isolates from outside the U. K. The phenotypes and genotypes of 73 antibiotic-resistant strains of P. acnes obtained from the skin of acne patients in the U. K., U. S. A., France, Germany, Australia and Japan were compared. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements, and polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to identify mutations in genes encoding rRNA. Most erythromycin-resistant isolates (MIC 90 ¿ 512 ¿g mL¿ 1) were cross-resistant to clindamycin but at a much lower level (MIC 90 ¿ 64 ¿g mL¿ 1). As in the U. K., resistance to erythromycin was associated with point mutations in 23 S rRNA in 49 of 58 strains. An A¿G transition at Escherichia coli equivalent base 2058 was present in 24 strains. This gave a unique cross-resistance phenotype against a panel of macrolide, lincosamide and type B streptogramin antibiotics. Two further point mutations (at E. coli equivalent bases 2057 and 2059) were identified (in three and 22 isolates, respectively) and these were also associated with specific cross-resistance patterns originally identified in isolates from the U. K. However, nine of 10 erythromycin resistant-strains from Germany did not exhibit any of the three base mutations identified and, in six cases, cross-resistance patterns were atypical. Consistent with previous U. K. data, 34 of 38 tetracycline-resistant strains carried a base mutation at E. coli 16 S rRNA equivalent base 1058. Tetracycline-resistant isolates displayed varying degrees of cross-resistance to doxycycline and minocycline, but isolates from the U. S. A. had higher MICs for minocycline (4 ¿ 16 ¿g mL¿ 1) than isolates from other countries and, in particular, Australia. All the P. acnes isolates resistant to {{one or more of the}} commonly used antiacne antibiotics were sensitive to penicillin, fusidic acid, chloramphenicol and the fluoroquinolone, <b>nadifloxacin.</b> All but one isolate (from the U. K.) were sensitive to trimethoprim. This study shows that 23 S and 16 S mutations identified in the U. K. conferring antibiotic resistance in P. acnes are distributed widely. However, resistant strains were isolated in which mutations could not be identified, suggesting that as yet uncharacterized resistance mechanisms have evolved. This is the first report of high-level resistance to minocycline and is of concern as these strains are predicted to be clinically resistant and are unlikely to remain confined to the U. S. A. Epidemiological studies are urgently required to monitor how resistant strains are selected, how they spread and to ascertain whether the prevalence of resistance correlates with antibiotic usage patterns in the different countries...|$|E
