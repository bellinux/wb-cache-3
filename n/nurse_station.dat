The system is able to detect different postures of a person and recognize high-level actions performed by a patient by monitoring different pattern of postures. This activity can be monitored remotely from a <b>nurse</b> <b>station</b> or a handheld device. The monitoring system {{can be used for}} alerting the <b>nurse</b> <b>station</b> in a hospital, if a patient performs some abnormal action. In the proposed system, the Sun SPOTs are affixed on a person's chest, thigh, leg and arm. The application determines the posture of a person by sensing the acceleration and tilt values of the SPOT in the direction of X, Y and Z axis. Based on these values the application can determine the postures of a person such as Lying Down, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Bending, and Arm Moving. We provide user mechanisms to define high level actions such as “attempting to get up from Lying Down position”, in terms of patterns of lower-level posture sequences. The system detects these patterns from the posture sequences reported by the Sun SPOTs, and reports them at desired locations...|$|E

The items are stored in <b>nursing</b> <b>stations</b> from where they are retrieved by the nurses and used {{for the needs of}} in-patients or out-patients. The <b>nursing</b> <b>stations</b> are replenished from a central warehouse. Items are moved between the hospital’s central warehouse and the <b>nursing</b> <b>stations</b> by a capacitated porter cart. In the representative <b>nursing</b> <b>station</b> that we analyze, the need for the medical supplies by the in-patients can arise at any time during day or night. It is possible to replenish the <b>nursing</b> <b>stations</b> during the day time on a continuous scale; however, this is not possible after-hours because the warehouse operates only during regular working hours. For this particular setting, we propose a hybrid inventory control policy which consists of a continuous review joint replenishment policy to manage the day time demand and a periodic review policy to manage the night time demand. The prior performance measure is set to satisfy the target service levels in the <b>nursing</b> <b>stations.</b> For a special case of the problem with a single item, we develop exact expressions to estimate the policy parameters. For the multi-item case, we analyze the impact of the policy parameters on the service level targets by simulating a representative system under different scenarios.

A questionnaire based on the Japanese Ministry of the Environment's guidelines on odor index regulation {{was used to assess}} nurses' perceptions of odor intensity, comfort, tolerability, and description in the aforementioned settings. Questionnaires were distributed to nursing department directors at three Japanese hospitals, who then disseminated the questionnaires to nursing staff. Of the 1, 151 questionnaires distributed, 496 nurses participated. Human waste disposal rooms had greater odor intensity and were perceived as more uncomfortable than the other settings. Unpleasant odors in disposal rooms, hospital rooms, and <b>nurse</b> <b>stations</b> were rated as slightly intolerable in comparison. Hospital and disposal rooms were mainly described as having a “pungent odor such as of urine and stool. ” In contrast, <b>nurse</b> <b>stations</b> were described as having other unpleasant odors, such as chemical, human-body-related, or sewage-like odors. Given that nurses spend much of their time in hospital rooms and <b>nurse</b> <b>stations,</b> odor management in these two settings would likely improve nurses' working conditions at hospitals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A training database with 32 Korotkoff sounds recordings from the British Hypertension Society was played randomly to 20 observers who were divided into four groups according to the years of their nursing experience (i. e. ≥ 10 years, 1 - 9 years, nursing students with frequent training, and those without any medical background; five observers in each group). All the observers were asked to determine manual auscultatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) both in a quiet clinical assessment room and in a noisy <b>nurse</b> <b>station</b> area. This procedure was repeated on another day, yielding a total of four measurements from each observer (i. e. two room environments and two repeated determinations on 2 separate days) for each Korotkoff sound. The measurement error was then calculated against the reference answer, with the effects of room environment and nursing experience of the observer investigated. RESULTS: Our results showed that there was no statistically significant difference for BPs measured under both quiet and noisy environments (P> 0. 80 for both SBP and DBP). However, there was a significant effect on the measurement accuracy between the observer groups (P< 0. 001 for both SBP and DBP). The nursing students performed best with overall SBP and DBP errors of - 0. 8 ± 2. 4 and 0. 1 ± 1. 8 [*]mmHg, respectively.

There are different types of occupants in a care home. They differ {{in the type of}} activities they perform and also in their clothing requirements. This study sought to determine thermal comfort levels for the different groups of occupants. Continuous monitoring of indoor and outdoor parameters was carried out for the summer period. Energy consumption for specific final use and heat delivered to radiators were also measured, as well as spot measurements of air speed. The POE also included structured interviews with the staff who answered questions about their comfort and the operation of the building. Residents were not interviewed due to their poor health. Predicted Mean Votes were calculated from the measurements and the information provided in the interviews. Calculations were carried out for both residents and staff in each of the spaces monitored including a selection of occupied bedrooms, lounge, dining room, <b>nurse</b> <b>station</b> and reception. The results were compared with data from the comfort survey of the staff and showed that most members of the staff are not comfortable and consider the building to be too warm in the summer. However, the PMV calculation showed that while indoor temperatures were too high for staff, they were acceptable to the residents because of their lower activity rate. Staff often accepted this discomfort because they were aware of the needs of the residents and acknowledged that higher temperatures are necessary for their comfort. This suggests complex relations are at work, which would normally be glossed over in conventional comfort studies. The paper concludes by considering the implications of this in the design of caring environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case {{study was to explore}} nurses’ and nurse administrators’ {{perceptions}} about how the built environment in a healthcare facility contributes to patient care delivery. The study focused on a group of nurses and nurse administrators as they made the transition from an existing patient care facility to providing care in a new facility. The experiences of the care providers in these two facilities were used to identify and characterize the design features significantly influencing their performance. ^ How did caregivers perceive the impact of evidence-based design components on patient care? This was answered by determining what physical elements within the work environment were perceived among nurses and nurse administrators as barriers to providing quality patient care and which were perceived as enhancements to the provision of quality patient care. The study spanned 13 months with interviews and observations occurring at three intervals. The first at the original hospital one month before the transition, the second just three months after the move, and the final one year after the new hospital had opened. ^ The study was descriptive in nature: introducing the participants in terms of their experience and patient responsibilities; providing information about the design of each healthcare setting; creating an outline of the planning and design process for the new facility; and recounting the nurses’ involvement in that process. The study revealed two primary components of the built environment, private patient rooms and decentralized nurse work areas, as having a positive impact on their ability to provide patient care. However, caregivers simultaneously expressed some preference for the social networking opportunities that a central <b>nurse</b> <b>station</b> design offers. ^ One lesson from this study is that evidence-based design of healthcare facilities should include research from the perspective of those providing patient care. This study was conducted using qualitative data; further empirical study should be conducted to validate the perceptions of these caregivers about the value of the built environment. ...|$|E
40|$|While {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} suggests that the layout of inpatient hospitals impacts a range of outcomes such as noise, falls and mortality, the research has not yet established systematic association between layout and patient experience of care. Experience of care is of growing importance to hospitals with the adoption development of the 1995 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems program (CAHPS). The CAHPS Hospital Survey tool (known as HCAHPS) has become the leading indicator for quality and as well as other patient satisfaction surveys which publically report the patient experience known as patient self-reported outcome. Previous research has focused on service excellence through staff development, improvement of key service behaviors, and understanding of the influence of patient characteristics. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify associations between spatial variables in the room and unit and patient self-reported outcomes such as Press-Ganey and HCAHPS patient satisfaction scores. This retrospective research study examines 17 units with 81 inpatient room types over 2 to 5 years at a large teaching hospital. This study identifies spatial measures shown through previous research to influence layouts and explores their statistical associations with standard patient satisfaction measures including both HCAHPS and Press-Ganey patient satisfaction surveys. Five primary spatial measures were identified and analyzed: window width, room handedness, head of the bed location, distance to the <b>nurse</b> <b>station,</b> and location of first encounter. Two separate phases of analysis were conducted: a preliminary study of 3, 751 respondents in a limited Disease Related Group (DRG) and a general study expanded to 4, 615 respondents with a broader range of DRGs. Finding indicate that there are statistically significant relationships between all of the five spatial measures analyzed and specific questions in the surveys pertaining to perceived nursing, physician, individual care and overall room variables. The results emphasize the importance of hospital design on patient satisfaction outcomes of importance to healthcare systems. Ph. D...|$|E
