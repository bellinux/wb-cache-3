The smaller the group, {{the more likely}} each member was to participate, {{regardless}} of range (dispersed or collocated). The main difference stated between distributed and collocated groups was the social pressure at least to appear busy that is present in collocated groups. When others are present, people feel the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{as if they are}} working hard, while those who are not in the presence of others do not.|$|E

Some people still need medical attention, and we also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the living {{conditions}} of workers and the community at large. Then there is the problem of the unemployment of women and the high rate of illiteracy here. We need to help realise programmes to ensure people can get an income, that they can enjoy a reasonable standard of living.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – {{they just want to}} do it when they get to the surface. The solitude they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E

500|$|Warner's {{management}} style frustrated many studio employees. Comedian Jack Benny, {{who once worked}} at Warner Bros., quipped, [...] "Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie". Warner frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio's executive dining room, with the explanation, [...] "I don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at actors when I eat." [...] The studio executive did, however, win the affection of a few film personalities.|$|E

Platforms of former commuter rail stations, such as those on the IND Rockaway Line, are even longer.

500|$|One of {{the first}} ideas Assis had for the film was to show the mons pubis of a {{waitress}} he knew. Though he was unsure how to include this element, the yellow-colored pubic hair matched the book Tempo Amarelo ("Yellow Time"), by sociologist Renato Carneiro Campos. The title of the film was borrowed from the book, in which the author describes the [...] "rotten teeth of children, the color of poverty in the country". Assis {{wanted to create a}} film to show [...] "the face of the Brazilian people. We are from the Third World and we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at ourselves".|$|E

In the session, which started at 15:00 local time (...) on Saturday afternoon, Lewis Hamilton took the third out of three possible pole positions of the season, narrowly beating his teammate by 0.04 seconds. Nico Rosberg was frustrated about the result, lamenting that his team had put unnecessary pressure on him by telling him to go faster during his last warm-up lap, saying [...] "e <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that as that was not ideal to put me under pressure like that".|$|E

500|$|While {{earning his}} law degree at Widener University, Tierney founded Tierney & Company Public Relations in 1984, which he financed on his credit card. In 1986, {{he sold the}} company to Lewis Gilman & Kynett. Tierney stayed with Lewis Gilman & Kynett {{and by the time}} he turned twenty-nine he had become {{president}} and CEO of the public relations division. In 1989, he left Lewis Gilman & Kynett and founded Tierney Group, another public relations company, with just three people. One of those people remembers Tierney's saying [...] "We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what everyone else is charging and charge our clients $15 an hour more." [...] When told that was crazy Tierney responded, [...] "We're going to be the best at what we do. We need to charge people accordingly." [...] The company quickly grew with billings of US$3.5 million and thirty-five employees in offices in three cities.|$|E
500|$|Taryn Manning, {{already an}} {{established}} actress, {{did not have}} to audition for the role of Doggett and was offered it. Manning, when speaking about this to Joshua Rotter of Download.com, said that she immediately accepted the offer [...] "I loved it and didn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> any further. I was sold." [...] To prepare for the role, Manning did some research on faith healing and evangelistic ceremonies. She also states that her inspiration for Doggett at least partly comes from the White family in the 2009 documentary film The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia. The only make-up that Manning wears for her role as Doggett, in the first season, is on her teeth to create the effect of receding gums and missing teeth. From the second season onwards, however, Doggett has false teeth in place and so the teeth seen are Manning's own.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} {{discusses}} {{negative aspects of}} religion and society, and {{is seen as a}} [...] "companion piece" [...] to Enter Shikari’s A Flash Flood of Colour. Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could do and how we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the images}} connect back to his earlier works. The images of life as boat adrift with a leak {{is similar to the}} [...] "Death by Water" [...] section of The Waste Land. Like images about old age and {{experience}} found in East Coker, this image reinforces the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the whole of life and try to see things beyond the limitations of time. Men are supposed to progress, but they aren't supposed to focus on what they can gain in the future. The prayer to the Virgin Mary is intended to help guide the journey which would end with understanding eternity and the Annunciation. It is Mary who will guide the metaphorical sailors to their proper harbour.

500|$|Season two {{is set in}} 1947, {{approximately}} {{six months}} to a year following the events of the first, with the time jump made to show [...] "people are in a little bit different positions, and things have happened between these seasons that we maybe don't know about." [...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E
500|$|In early {{planning}} stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith {{was to be}} one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E

500|$|Of all of Sherwood's evangelically themed books, The History of the Fairchild Family was {{the most}} popular. When she {{published}} it with John Hatchard of Piccadilly, she assured it and the ten other books she published with him a [...] "social distinction" [...] not attached to her other publications. The Fairchild Family {{tells the story of}} a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children (Emily, Lucy and Henry) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also the right earthly morality (envy, greed, lying, disobedience, and fighting are immoral). The overarching narrative of the tale also includes a series of tract-like stories which illustrate these moral lessons. For example, stories of the deaths of two neighborhood children, Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble, help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to the state of their own hearts. The faithful and [...] "true" [...] Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience, suggesting that he was saved; by contrast, the heedless and disobedient Augusta burns up while playing with candles and is presumably damned. Unlike previous allegorical literature with these themes, such as Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Sherwood domesticated her story—actions in the children's day-to-day lives, such as stealing fruit, are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation. Each chapter also includes prayers and hymns (by Philip Doddridge, Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper and Ann and Jane Taylor, among others) that are thematically linked to it.|$|E
500|$|The Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra {{felt all}} of the album's tracks were strong, and wrote [...] "Every track plays like a {{potential}} hit single, and that's exactly what fans will love about 'E=MC²'. Expect it to soundtrack much of the summer and beyond." [...] Los Angeles Times staff writer, Richard Cromelin, gave the album two out of four stars, noting its [...] "alternatives to the glass-shattering flamboyance of her early '90s youth." [...] He concluded in his mixed review of the album, [...] "Of course, consistency isn't so important when an album is assembled {{as a series of}} singles rather than a cohesive work. Fortunately for Carey, the tabloid-tailored real-life back story {{on one side and the}} producer's craft on the other matter more than the art of singing in this particular fairy tale." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt the album didn't level up to par with Carey's previous release, writing [...] "Much of the record sounds like urban-radio imitations, without the peculiarities and effective hooks of 'Mimi'. Maybe emancipation isn't a continuing procedure; maybe it only comes once." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey rated E=MC² four out of ten discs, describing it as a [...] "shallow imitation of its predecessor". Sawdey concluded his review on a mixed note, stating [...] " [...] the second act of Mariah's comeback doesn't wisely expand her sound: it instead succumbs to the blueprint so carefully laid out by its predecessor, a pointless remake that exists only because it has to. If you ever had a doubt as to its formulaic nature, you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> no further than its title. Long live the Diva." [...] Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone questioned why she limited her vocal abilities throughout the record, [...] "nearly every song confines Carey to four-note verses, offering little room for her glorious range." [...] Journalist Eric Henderson, writing for Slant Magazine, graded the album three out of five stars, and concluding with, [...] "Such are the rewards of an album like 'E=MC²', in which one does reach a solution, but not before Mariah bends over backward to show her work." [...] The album finished in the top-ten of several [...] "best of 2008" [...] lists, ending at number four on an official poll held by Billboard, eight by The Detroit News, and number ten by The San Diego Union-Tribune. Robert Christgau picked out one song from the album, [...] "Touch My Body", as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
