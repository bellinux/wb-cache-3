40|$|Using {{this concept}} of definition, I {{compared}} my <b>nephanalysis</b> with those presented by the authors and the probability-of-cloudiness charts (diagnostic charts). The results are quite interesting. On page 182, the authors note a “discrepancy ” between the diagnosed and the observed clouds south of Iceland on 1500 GMT February 2 (fig. lob in their paper). They are quite correct in rejecting this cloud layer since they observed only stratocumulus on the videograph. Had they initially rejected these clouds, which form behind the trough {{as a result of}} the flow of cold air over warm water, this discrepancy would not have occurred at all. These stratocumulus, stratus, or cumulus clouds are easily identified on the satellite cloud pictures. Their rejection in the <b>nephanalysis</b> of significant clouds would hel...|$|E

A study of this cas ^ was undertaken with three objectives in mind: (a) to describe interesting features of the organizat,ion manifested in the cloud patterns and compare these with conventional analyses; (b) to present a subjective interpretation of some of the cloud images and discuss the criteria which form the basis for interprctation; and (c) to show cxamplcs of practical application of these pictures of the storm to routine frontal analysis and <b>nephanalysis.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring of climatic {{variability}} and climate modeling both require a reliable global cloud data set. Examination {{is made of}} the temporal and spatial variability of cloudiness in light of recommendations made by GARP in 1975 (and updated by JOC in 1978 and 1980) for cloud data archiving. An examination of the methods of comparing cloud cover frequency curves suggests {{that the use of}} the beta distribution not only facilitates objective comparison, but also reduces overall storage requirements. A specific study of the only current global cloud climatology (the U. S. Air Force's 3 -dimensional <b>nephanalysis)</b> over the United Kingdom indicates that discussion of methods of validating satellite-based data sets is urgently required...|$|E
40|$|A {{predictive}} {{relationship is}} developed between over-ocean cloud system albedo and the cloud amount present, using as a data base ERB satellite microwave readings at 0. 5 - 0. 7 micron and the USAF three-dimensional <b>nephanalysis</b> archive. The ERB data provided global coverage at {{a resolution of}} 2. 5 x 2. 5 deg during the 1974 - 78 period. Regression analyses were performed on the amounts and albedos for several years of data for one month in order to detect seasonal variations. A logarithmic relationship {{was found between the}} cloud system albedo and cloud amount over the oceans, with negligible seasonal variance. The analysis is noted to apply only where low surface albedos are encountered, and further work to extend the study to continental vegetated areas is indicated...|$|E
40|$|Cloud-top {{heights and}} cloud amounts are {{produced}} {{as part of}} the operational processing of polar-satellite data at the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS). These products were compared with similar products from the air force's real-time <b>nephanalysis</b> (RTNEPH), from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, and from NASA Goddard's processing of satellite data. It was found that the amount of high-level cloud was too small in the NESDIS results, while the amount of low-level cloud was too large. An examination of the NESDIS algorithm revealed that the differences in cloud distributions were caused by the selection of channels used for the cloud retrievals. Cloud retrievals are most accurate at the levels at which the channels that are used are most sensitive. In addition, it was found that no one pair of channels was best at all levels. A new procedure was developed that varied the channels as a function of an initial estimate of the cloud height. This procedure produced improved cloud retrievals that were then compared with the RTNEPH results. The comparison showed that the two methods provide similar retrievals of cloud height and amount...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} {{estimates of the}} percent of fixed geographical regions (160 x 160 km) either free of cloud (clear) or covered by low, middle, and high (opaque) cloud have been intercompared. The estimates were derived by analysts interpreting geosynchronous satellite images, with concurrent meteorological observations; from Nimbus 7 temperature humidity infrared radiometer (THIR) CLOUD ERB (CLE) data; and from Air Force three dimensional <b>nephanalysis</b> (3 DN) data. Air Force 3 DN agrees better with the analyst than THIR/CLE, except for high cloud amount; the CLE and 3 DN results tend to overestimate clear amount when clear amount is large and underestimate it when clear amount is small, by 10 - 20 percent for CLE and by 5 - 10 percent for 3 DN, and both agree well with the analyst in the mean. Systematic and random errors for 3 DN and CLE are specified. CLE estimates of cloud amount over land at night {{should not be used}} for scientific purposes unless restricted to high cloud amount. It is believed that the CLR and 3 DN are the only two digitized, global cloud type and amount data sets in existence...|$|E
40|$|The {{type and}} amount of cloud cover over Amazon region (75 W to 45 W, 19 S to 5 N) was {{analyzed}} in different spatial scales for the period September 2002, that is, during the Dry-to-Wet AMC/LBA Campaign. Multispectral GOES- 8 imagery was classified following a clustering method developed at DSA/CPTEC, which is iterative (of the "dynamical centroids"-type), considering each pixel as an 11 -dimensional vector (with components defined by brightness temperature in channels 2 to 5, and related variables as texture and difference between channels). VIS channel was not included, {{in order to avoid}} sharp discontinuities during one daily cycle. About 7 million pixels were clustered for five days, distributed in eight different times, defining 232 11 -dimensional centroids. Factor analysis suggests de existence of no more than 4 - 6 principal modes (factors) and about 40 different groups of scenes. Resulting groups exhibit coherence with <b>nephanalysis</b> (visual inspection). Once defined the clustering method and typical centroids, classification of all images (eight by day) during one month allows to describe daily cover evolution for main types of cloudy (Cu, St, Ci, deep convective type) and clear-sky pixels, as well as transitions between them. Preliminary results (averaged over the region) suggest that clear-sky area varied between a minimum of 30 % (at 06 GMT) and a maximum of about 45 % (nearly constant between 12 and 24 GMT). Deep convection showed maximal area at 21 - 24 GMT, being minimal at 15 GMT. Cu cover showed influence of diurnal solar cycle, attaining up to 20 % of the region at about 18 GMT...|$|E
40|$|A Routine is {{described}} {{which is a}} collection of computer-programed techniques designed for the interpretation of meteorological satellite videograph observations. From the inferred evolution of the mass-structure distribution, the Routine diagnoses the horizontal velocity distribution for one or more isentropic surfaces. Using the horizontal velocity distribution as input, the Routine further derives net horizontal and net vertical, parcel-displacements (in the synoptic range of scale) for specified regions and periods of time. This permits pattern configurations of layer-cloudiness to be remapped to later positions which are consistent with the mass-motion evolutions. The use of the Routine for interpreting satellite cloud observations is illustrated by the presentation of two case studies. The layer-cloudiness distributions for the initial and terminal times of each case are analyzed primarily from the TIROS operational <b>nephanalysis.</b> The initial distribution of layer-cloudiness is rembpped in accordance with the net horizontal displacement field. The cloud evolutions are shown and comparisons are made between the joint 24 -hr. cloud displacement and net vertical, parcel-displacement patterns and the verifying layer-cloudiness distributions. A close correspondence is found between the terminal position of the displaced cloudiness and the verifying cloudiness distributions. The patterns evolved in the hoiizontally displaced cloudiness are realistic reflections of the stages of development associated with vortex cloud patterns. Net vertical, parcel-displacement fields are generated which are consistent with conventional synoptic desiderata and the observed cloudiness. The results indicate that the major portion of layer-cloudiness distributions in the synoptic range of scale in extratropical latitudes can be accounted for by the time-integrated, horizontal and vertical parcel-displacements. The implications of these results to the objective use of satellite data are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Distinguishing. clouds {{from light}} surface {{backgrounds}} such as sand or snow in satellite photographs {{is an important}} but often difficult task. It {{is the purpose of}} this note to present an example in which snow was mistaken for clouds over the Adirondack region of New York and to provide some guidelines for more accurate interpretation of ambiguous cases. Figure 1 is a <b>nephanalysis</b> chart for 1533 GMT, December 7, 1964, showing the northeastern United States with cloudiness surrounding the Adirondacks. Figure 2 shows the picture from which the chart was prepared. In reality most of the area around the Adirondacks was clear. In the area of interest, the Laurentians, Adirondacks, Green, and. White Mountains in all seasons of the year usually appear relatively dark while the surrounding valleys are lighter in tone. Of these mountainous areas, the Adirondacks and Laurentians are darker than the others. These observations disagree with those of Cronin [3] who mapped the tonal shades of the United States and southern Canada from TIROS photography for the period from February to April. He showed the Laurentians, Adirondacks, and Green Mountains as light in tone. The Adirondacks were described as “nothing particularly distinctive ” although he added, “ [...] . since the tree cover is principally coniferous, the crowns may retain snow for a while after a fall. ” Later, Bird and Morrison [11, also utilizing TIROS photography, noted that the Laurentians, when snow covered, appeared grey, while the nearby valleys which were free of snow were dark. They documented this further (Morrison and Bird [4]) by presenting a case of change from light to dark tone as a snow cover melted in the St. Lawrence Valley over a 2 -week period...|$|E
