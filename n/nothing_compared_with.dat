500|$|Mason had hope, {{coming into}} the convention, that it would yield a result that he felt would {{strengthen}} the United States. Impressed {{by the quality of}} the delegates, Mason expected sound thinking from them, something he did not think he had often encountered in his political career. Still, he felt that the [...] "hopes of all the Union centre [...] in this Convention", and wrote to his son George, [...] "the revolt from Great Britain & the Formations of our new Government at that time, were <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the great Business now before us." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was this}} {{important}} difference, however, between Waller's idea and Cromwell's achievement that the professional {{soldiers of the}} New Model were disciplined, led, and in all things, inspired by [...] "godly" [...] officers. Godliness, devotion to the cause, and efficiency were indeed the only criteria Cromwell applied in choosing officers. Long before this, he had warned the Scottish major-general, Lawrence Crawford, that the precise colour of a man's religious opinions mattered <b>nothing,</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> his devotion to them. He had told the committee of Suffolk: ...|$|E

Provisions finally arrived on a steamship before they starved.|$|R
5000|$|The {{university}}'s motto, [...] "Na Hi Gyanena Sadrusham" [...] (<b>Nothing</b> <b>compares</b> <b>with</b> knowledge) {{is taken}} from the Bhagavad Gita. It is inscribed in Devanagari script {{at the top of}} the university crest. At the bottom of the same crest is a saying in Sanskrit, reading [...] "Sathyamevoddharamyaham" [...] (I uphold only the truth).|$|R
5000|$|Those who {{say they}} will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will receive <b>nothing.</b> (<b>Compare</b> <b>with</b> {{translation}} provided by the Nag Hammadi library: [...] "Those {{who say that the}} Lord died first and then rose up are in error - for He rose up first and then died.") ...|$|R
2500|$|The North Carr Lightship was {{launched}} in 1932 and created quite a stir in Edinburgh on account of her fog horn being tested while lying ¾ mile off Granton, Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth. As the fog horn had a range of approximately 10 miles, north Edinburgh could hear it loud and clear and the complaints were numerous - particularly as it was being sounded in clear weather. [...] "Hundreds of city dwellers have had no sleep over three consecutive nights" [...] and [...] "The most flagrant individual breach of the peace is as <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the ceaseless boom and consequent suffering {{of the past three}} nights" [...] were typical statements at the time.|$|E
2500|$|I have {{discovered}} that {{the public in the}} Holy Land does not fully believe the terrible horror that has befallen our nation in exile. Sadly, the bitter truth is many, many times worse than anything you have heard. All that is known in the free world is but a drop in the ocean of massacres battering European Jewry. To all those doubters, I can bear witness from my own personal experience that all current descriptions are as <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the awful truth. On leaving Hungary, I saw with my own eyes wagonloads of Italian Jews being transported to their death in Poland. Elderly, women, young children, pushing their shrunken hands through the bars, begging for [...] "Water! Water!" [...] But the Gestapo troops did not allow anyone to approach the death train and assist the captives. I saw prisoners crazed from thirst attacking each other and biting their flesh.|$|E
2500|$|After the Japanese {{occupation}} of Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, and fearing their attack posed {{a serious threat}} to the Northwest, a strong American naval force was deployed in Alaskan waters. Some estimates had put the Japanese naval strength at four 6-inch cruisers, eight destroyers and as many as eighteen submarines in the Aleutians. Late August 1942, Prince David, Prince Henry, Prince Robert and the corvettes [...] and , were ordered to co-operate with American forces being transported to Kodiak. Operating under orders of the United States Navy, and designated as Force [...] "D", they escorted convoys between Kodiak and Dutch Harbor (now Unalaska), Alaska as part of the Aleutian Islands campaign. Prince David and her sister ships made no actual contact with the enemy during their almost 3-month tour of duty in the northern waters. This was not to say, however, that the work was dull or uneventful. Seamen who were used to the open ocean seldom allow themselves to be impressed by anything the weather and navigational difficulties have to offer; but the men of the 'Prince' ships soon realized that whatever the perils of the North Atlantic, <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the sudden gales, erratic currents and uncharted shoals of the North Pacific. In 1942, the Canadian ships were equipped with only rudimentary radar which made navigation a [...] source of constant danger. Fog gave way to gales which gave way to fog.|$|E

With it, we can produce trees and forests. With it we can make fertile fields on the desert plains, and make the unsightly and uninviting plateau attractive for agriculture and home-building. ...|$|R

30|$|Chandler’s {{historical}} work {{provided a}} useful foil, which sociologists used ad nauseam to debunk the generic argument that “certain institutions exist {{because they are}} efficient solutions to various problems in the economy” (Granovetter and Swedberg 2011). A similar critique, rooted in detailed empirical analyses of how firms work, was leveraged against the new institutionalist theory that hierarchical structures arise as efficient responses to problems of transaction costs and opportunism (Granovetter 1985). And <b>nothing</b> <b>compares</b> <b>with</b> the feeling of jubilation that came from exposing the crudeness of Gary Becker’s view of human action, where preferences are exogenously given and “de gustibus non est. disputandum.” (Stigler and Becker 1977).|$|R
5000|$|... "And many recent {{recordings}} of pop music demonstrate how music is {{killed by a}} metronome for they are as square as a draftsman's T. For the convenience of recording engineers, each player has to record their part on a separate track while listening to a click track - a metronome - and the clicks are then used to synchronize the tracks while the technicians adjust them to their taste and mix them. I know talented young musicians who can't do it; we can understand why. <b>Nothing</b> <b>compares</b> <b>with</b> a recording of a live performance in which the players provide each other with the time-framework.... {{if you want to}} kill a musical performance, give the player a click track!" ...|$|R
