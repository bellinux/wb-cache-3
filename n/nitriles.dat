When induced with Co/urea, cells of R. rhodochrous DAP 96253 expressed {{the highest level}} of <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity (~ 200 units/min·mg-cdw) when compared with the other inducers tested. Cells induced with Co had the second highest <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity (~ 7 units/min·mg-cdw), whereas in the uninduced cells, <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity was lower than 1 unit/min·mg-cdw. Similarly in R. rhodochrous DAP 96622, when induced with Co/urea, the <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity of R. rhodochrous DAP 96622 cells was around 50 units/min·mg-cdw which was the highest of all inducers tested. When induced with Co only, the <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity of R. rhodochrous DAP 96622 was around 20 units/min·mg-cdw, and the <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity of R. rhodochrous DAP 96622 uninduced was the same as the <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity of uninduced R. rhodochrous DAP 96253. When Co/urea induced R. rhodochrous DAP 96253 cell lysate was examined on gradient SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Image Quant TL, the <b>nitrile</b> hydratase bands (both α and β subunits) accounted for more than 55 % of the total cytosolic proteins. Whereas in Co/urea induced R. rhodochrous DAP 96622, the <b>nitrile</b> hydratase bands accounted for around 25 % of the total cytosolic proteins. According to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry results, amidase in R. rhodochrous DAP 96253 was approximately 38 kDa from the nitrilase/cyanide hydratase family and amidase in R. rhodochrous DAP 96622 was 55 kDa from the amidase signature family. In addition, the <b>nitrile</b> hydratase regulation system in both R. rhodochrous DAP 96253 and DAP 96622 strains are different. Moreover, the <b>nitrile</b> hydratase regulation system in R. rhodochrous DAP 96253 is different from R. rhodochrous J 1. Purified <b>nitrile</b> hydratase from R. rhodochrous DAP 96253 may form a protein complex with glutamine synthetase, resulting in a <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity of approximately 1500 units/mg-proteins, and <b>nitrile</b> hydratase from R. rhodochrous DAP 96622 is not a protein complex and results in a <b>nitrile</b> hydratase activity of 950 units/mg-proteins...|$|R

5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to <b>nitriles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), <b>nitriles</b> and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
