40|$|A kinetic {{spectrophotometric}} method {{based on the}} initial rate measurement has been developed for the determination of N-acetyl L-cysteine. The developed method {{is based on the}} oxidation of N-acetyl L-cysteine with iodate. The reaction product was studied and characterized using the mass spectrometry and the structure of the product was proposed. From the mass spectrometric studies it was concluded that the oxidation of the drug resulted in the formation of a disulfide. The developed method was validated as per the guidelines of international conference on harmonization. The developed initial rate method was found to be linear in the concentration range of 1. 25 – 30 µg ml- 1. The detection and quantitation limits were found to be 0. 018 and 0. 056 µg ml- 1.

We investigated {{the interplay between}} TGF-β 1, cerebrovascular function, and cognition using transgenic TGF mice featuring astrocytic TGF-β 1 overexpression. We further assessed the impact of short, late therapy in elderly animals with the antioxidant <b>N-acetyl</b> [...] <b>cysteine</b> (NAC) or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist pioglitazone. The latter was also administered to pups as a prophylactic 1 -year treatment. Elderly TGF mice featured cerebrovascular dysfunction that was not remedied with NAC. In contrast, pioglitazone prevented or reversed this deficit, and rescued the impaired neurovascular coupling response to whisker stimulation, although it failed to normalize the vascular structure. In aged TGF mice, neuronal and cognitive indices—the stimulus-evoked neurometabolic response, cortical cholinergic innervation, and spatial memory in the Morris water maze—were intact. Our findings show that impaired brain hemodynamics and cerebrovascular function are not accompanied by memory impairment in this model. Conceivably in AD, they constitute aggravating factors {{against a background of}} aging and underlying pathology. Our data further highlight the ability of pioglitazone to protect the cerebrovasculature marked by TGF-β 1 increase, aging, fibrosis, and antioxidant resistance, thus of high relevance for AD patients...|$|R

40|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) target tumour acidic pH {{and have}} an antineoplastic effect in {{melanoma}}. The PPI esomeprazole (ESOM) kills melanoma cells through a caspase-dependent pathway involving cytosolic acidification and alkalinization of tumour pH. In this paper, we further investigated the mechanisms of ESOM-induced cell death in melanoma. ESOM rapidly induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through mitochondrial dysfunctions and involvement of NADPH oxidase. The ROS scavenger <b>N-acetyl</b> [...] <b>cysteine</b> (NAC) and inhibition of NADPH oxidase significantly reduced ESOM-induced cell death, consistent with inhibition of cytosolic acidification. Autophagy, a cellular catabolic pathway leading to lysosomal degradation and recycling of proteins and organelles, represents a defence mechanism in cancer cells under metabolic stress. ESOM induced the early accumulation of autophagosomes, {{at the same time}} reducing the autophagic flux, as observed by WB analysis of LC 3 -II accumulation and by fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, ESOM treatment decreased mammalian target of rapamycin signalling, as reduced phosphorylation of p 70 -S 6 K and 4 -EBP 1 was observed. Inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of Atg 5 and Beclin- 1 expression significantly increased ESOM cytotoxicity, suggesting a protective role for autophagy in ESOM-treated cells. The data presented suggest that autophagy represents an adaptive survival mechanism to overcome drug-induced cellular stress and cytotoxicity, including alteration of pH homeostasis mediated by proton pump inhibition...|$|R

We reported here that safingol-induced primarily accidental necrotic cell death in MDA-MB- 231 and HT- 29 cells, {{as shown by the}} increase in the percentage of cells stained positive for 7 -aminoactinomycin, collapse of mitochondria membrane potential and depletion of intracellular ATP. Importantly, safingol treatment produced time- and concentration-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Autophagy was triggered following safingol treatment, as reflected by the formation of autophagosomes, acidic vacuoles, increased light chain 3 -II and Atg biomarkers expression. Interestingly, scavenging ROS with <b>N-acetyl</b> [...] <b>cysteine</b> could prevent the autophagic features and reverse safingol-induced necrosis. Our data also suggested that autophagy was a cell repair mechanism, as suppression of autophagy by 3 -methyladenine or bafilomycin A 1 significantly augmented cell death on 2 - 5 [*]μ safingol treatment. In addition, Bcl-xL and Bax might be involved in the regulation of safingol-induced autophagy. Finally, glucose uptake was shown to be inhibited by safingol treatment, which was associated with an increase in p-AMPK expression. Taken together, our data suggested that ROS was the mediator of safingol-induced cancer cell death, and autophagy {{is likely to be a}} mechanism triggered to repair damages from ROS generation on safingol treatment...|$|R
40|$|N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is the <b>N-acetyl</b> {{derivative}} of <b>cysteine,</b> and is less reactive, less toxic, and {{less susceptible to}} oxidation than cysteine, {{as well as being}} more soluble in water. For these reasons it is a better source of cysteine than the parenteral administration of cysteine itself [1]. NAC is rapidly absorbed, with time to peak plasma levels (tmax) being 1. 4 ± 0. 7 h following oral administration. The average elimination half-life (t 112) has been reported to be 2. 5 ± 0. 6 h [2]. The bioavailability of NAC increases according to the dose, with the peak serum level being on average 16 μmol/L after 600 mg and 35 μmol/L after 1200 mg [3]. When taken orally NAC is readily taken up in the stomach and gut and sent to the liver where it is converted almost entirely to cysteine and used for glutathione (GSH) synthesis [4]. Cysteine that is not converted to GSH is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier by means of sodium-dependent transport systems [5]...|$|R

50|$|In both rodents {{and humans}} phase I {{metabolism}} involves the biotransformation of 4-IPO into an epoxide intermediate by CYPs. This epoxide is unstable, so it degrades into an enedial intermediate. The enedial intermediate is toxic, {{as it can}} bind to proteins. However, it can be detoxified in phase II metabolism, in which the enedial can be conjugated with either N-acetyl lysine (NAL) or <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (NAC). This results in a NAL/NAC-IPO adduct, which can be excreted. Furthermore, 4-IPO can directly undergo phase II metabolism, by conjugating glucuronosyl to the hydroxyl group of 4-IPO by uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), forming 4-IPO glucuronide. This can, like the NAL/NAC-IPO adduct, be excreted. However, the major pathway involves the enedial intermediate and the NAL/NAC-IPO adduct is the major product of biotransformation.|$|E
40|$|Kainate receptors are ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors located postsynaptically, mediating frequency-dependent transmission, and presynaptically, modulating transmitter release. In {{contrast to}} the excitatory postsynaptic kainate receptors, presynaptic kainate receptor can also be inhibitory and their effects may involve a metabotropic action. Arachidonic acid (AA) modulates most ionotropic receptors, in particular postsynaptic kainate receptor-mediated currents. To further explore differences between pre- and postsynaptic kainate receptors, we tested if presynaptic kainate receptors are affected by AA. Kainate (0. 3 - 3  [mu]M) and the kainate receptor agonist, domoate (60 - 300  nM), inhibited by 19 - 54 % the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope in rat CA 1 hippocampus, and increased by 12 - 32 % paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). AA (10  [mu]M) attenuated by 37 - 72 % and by 62 - 66 % the domoate (60 - 300  nM) -induced fEPSP inhibition and paired-pulse facilitation increase, respectively. This inhibition by AA was unaffected by cyclo- and lipo-oxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin (20  [mu]M) and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, 50  [mu]M) or by the free radical scavenger, <b>N-acetyl</b> [...] <b>cysteine</b> (0. 5  mM).

Finally, the KD (40 - 55  nM) of the kainate receptor agonist [3 H]-(2 S, 4 R) - 4 -methylglutamate ([3 H]MGA) (0. 3 - 120  nM) binding to hippocampal synaptosomal membranes was increased by 151 - 329 % by AA (1 - 10  [mu]M).

40|$|Addiction is {{a chronic}} {{relapsing}} disorder hypothesized {{to be produced}} by drug-induced plasticity that renders individuals vulnerable to craving-inducing stimuli such as re-exposure to the drug of abuse. Drug-induced plasticity that may result in the addiction phenotype includes increased excitatory signaling within corticostriatal pathways that correlates with craving in humans and is necessary for reinstatement in rodents. Reduced cystine–glutamate exchange by system xc– appears to contribute to heightened excitatory signaling within the striatum, thereby posing this as a novel target {{in the treatment of}} addiction. In the present report, we examined the impact of repeated <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine,</b> which is commonly used to activate cystine–glutamate exchange, on reinstatement in rodents in a preclinical study and on craving in cocaine-dependent humans in a preliminary, proof-of-concept clinical experiment. Interestingly, repeated administration (7 days) of <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (60 [*]mg/kg, IP) produced a significant reduction in cocaine (10 [*]mg/kg, IP) -induced reinstatement, even though rats (N= 10 – 12 /group) were tested 24 [*]h after the last administration of <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine.</b> The reduction in behavior despite the absence of the <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> indicates that repeated <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> may have altered drug-induced plasticity that underlies drug-seeking behavior. In parallel, our preliminary clinical data indicate that repeated administration (4 days) of <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (1200 – 2400 [*]mg/day) to cocaine-dependent human subjects (N= 4 per group) produced a significant reduction in craving following an experimenter-delivered IV injection of cocaine (20 [*]mg/ 70 [*]kg/ 60 [*]s).

This study attempts to investigate the protective effects of taurine and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> against the cytotoxicity induced by amodiaquine. Hepatocytes were prepared by the method of collagenase enzyme perfusion via portal vein. This technique is based on liver perfusion with collagenase after removal of calcium ion (Ca 2 +) with a chelator (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) 0. 5 mM). Cells were treated with different concentrations of amodiaquine, taurine and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine.</b> Cell death, protein carbonylation, reactive oxygen species formation, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial depolarization were assessed as toxicity markers.

Except Sham, ovarian torsion procedure was implemented to all other groups for 2 hours. Detorsion procedure was implemented to other groups for 2 hours, except the torsion group. Medications were given through intraperitoneal way half an hour before the detorsion procedure in saline (two milliliter), resveratrol (20 mg/kg) and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (150 mg/kg) groups. Then, 2 ml of blood samples were drawn for markers of oxidative stress and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) work and the ovaries, which were torsioned for the histologic examination, were ex­tracted from all rats. Edema, congestion, hemorrhage, leuko­cyte infiltration and degeneration of follicles were evaluated by histopathological examination. Results: According to histopathologic damage scores, the least damage was seen in sham group and the most damage was seen T-DT group (1. 00 ± 0. 81 vs. 11. 00 ± 1. 15, respectively; p< 0. 001). It was seen that resveratrol and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> treatments were effective in decreasing tissue damage (total damage score average 83. 85 ± 0. 89 vs. 3. 85 ± 0. 89, respec­tively; p< 0. 001), {{and on the other hand}} there was not any dif­ference between resveratrol and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> treatments (p= 0. 966). Besides, it was determined that oxidative stress levels were higher in torsion - detorsion group and the resve­ratrol and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> treatment caused a significant de­crease in oxidative stress levels. In additionally, the reductions of TNF-α levels were found to be equally effective in both drugs (8. 68 ± 1. 88 vs. 7. 85 ± 2. 08, P= 0. 968).

Glutathione is an important extracellular and intracellular thiol oxidant in the lungs. These studies were carried out to determine the effect of <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> on thiol concentrations in plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue. METHODS [...] Studies were carried out on normal subjects, patients with COPD, and those undergoing lung resection. In the first study <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> was given to three groups; healthy subjects (600 mg once daily by mouth) and two groups of patients with COPD. In the first group of patients with COPD the dose was 600 mg once daily and in the second 600 mg thrice daily, all for five days. The latter dosage regimen was also given to six patients before bronchoscopy and to 11 patients before lung resection. Lung glutathione (GSH) levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung tissue were compared with the same numbers of patients who did not receive <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine.</b> RESULTS [...] <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> was detected in plasma after a single 600 mg dose in normal subjects and patients with COPD up to 1. 5 hours after the drug was given. Plasma cysteine concentrations increased in normal subjects on both days 1 and 5, and in patients with COPD on day 5. Glutathione concentrations in plasma increased on day 1 in normal subjects but not in patients with COPD given 600 mg <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> daily. With the higher dose of 600 mg thrice daily, however, there was a sustained elevation of GSH concentrations in plasma in patients with COPD. In patients undergoing routine diagnostic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage those who were given <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (600 mg) thrice daily for five days had higher concentrations of cysteine in the plasma, but no significant differences in cysteine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage or epithelial lining fluid compared with a control group; nor were there any differences in reduced glutathione concentrations in plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage or epithelial lining fluids between the control and treated groups. Moreover, in patients undergoing lung resection those treated with <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (600 mg thrice daily for five days) had similar concentrations of cysteine and glutathione in both plasma and lung tissue when compared with a control untreated group.

Results: It was revealed that liver toxicity induced by sumatriptan in in freshly isolated parenchymal hepatocytes is dose-dependent. Sumatriptan caused significant free radical generation followed by lipid peroxide formation, mitochondrial injury as well as lysosomal damage. Moreover, sumatriptan reduced cellular glutathione content. Taurine and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> were able to protect hepatocytes against sumatriptan-induced harmful effects. Conclusion: It is concluded that sumatriptan causes oxidative stress in hepatocytes and the decreased hepatocytes glutathione has {{a key role in the}} sumatriptan-induced harmful effects. Also, <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> and/or taurine could be used as treatments in sumatriptan-induced side effects...|$|E

40|$|Aggression {{is a major}} {{hallmark}} worldwide attributing {{negative traits}} in personality. Wide variety of antioxidants {{is used for the}} treatment of many ailments. The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (15. 42 and 30. 84 mg/kg), beta carotene (1. 02 and 2. 05 mg/kg), vitamin E (2. 5 and 5. 0 mg/kg), and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (102. 85 and 205. 70 mg/kg) in the treatment of aggression. Two aggression models (isolation induced aggression model and L-DOPA induced aggression model) were used in the study. Male albino mice (n = 330) were used in the study which were further subdivided into 11 groups (Group I-control, group II-diseased, group III-standard group, group IV–V treated with ascorbic, group VI–VII treated with beta carotene, group VIII–IX treated with vitamin E, group X–XI treated with <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> for 14 consecutive days). Different biochemical markers (glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) were determined to evaluate the antioxidant potential in oxidative stress. High dose of vitamin E (5. 0 mg/kg) was more effective to reduce the aggression in isolated animals while all other antioxidants produced dose-dependent anti-aggressive effect except <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> which had marked anti-aggressive effect at low dose (102. 75 mg/kg). Low doses of vitamin E (2. 5 mg/kg) and <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (102. 75 mg/kg) and high dose of beta carotene (2. 05 mg/kg) were effective to prevent all aggression parameters in acute anti-aggressive activity against L-DOPA induced aggression. However, all test antioxidants were equally effective in chronic anti-aggressive studies against L-DOPA induced aggression. It may be concluded that selected antioxidants can reverse the aggression which is a key symptom of many neurological disorder...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Recently, we have {{demonstrated}} that silymarin has a comparable pharmaceutical activity as Phyllanthus uri-naria extract when used to rescue mice from acetami-nophen-induced acute liver injury. In the present study, we further compared the therapeutic action of silymarin with <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (commonly used in clinical prac-tice for emergency treatments) as a rescuer in mice after administering a lethal dose of acetaminophen for 24 h. Methods: Acute liver injury was induced in the treatment groups by intraperitoneally administered acetaminophen at a dose of 550 mg/kg body weight on day 1. The con-trol group received an equal volume of physiological sa-line intraperitoneally. From day 2 to 4, the treatment groups received various doses of silymarin or <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> orally once daily, while the control group an...|$|E
40|$|Inducible {{vascular}} cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) in glomerular mesangial cells (GMC) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro involves the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and its {{interaction with the}} proximal VCAM- 1 promoter. We used a murine model to assess {{the effect of the}} antioxidant, <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> on GMC activation in vivo. Single intraperitoneal administration of <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> completely suppressed LPS-induced VCAM- 1 expression on the GMC surface. When an oligonucleotide spanning the NF-kappa B binding region of the VCAM- 1 promoter was incubated with extracts from the renal cortex of LPS-treated animals, a single nucleoprotein complex formed. This complex was composed of p 50 and p 65, but not p 52, c-Rel, or RelB, and its formation was dramatically inhibited by pretreatment with <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine,</b> D,L-Buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximide, a compound that depletes glutathione, augmented VCAM- 1 expression inducible with a suboptimal amount of LPS to levels comparable with using 50 micrograms of LPS alone, D,L-Buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximide also potentiated the p 50 -p 65 binding activity induced with a suboptimal amount of LPS. These data provide a redox-sensitive, transcriptional link between NF-kappa B and VCAM- 1 in GMC in vivo and implicate oxidative stress as an important regulatory signal in the pathogenesis of glomerular mesangial cell disorders...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the protective effects of <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> on the pancreas and kidney after pancreatic ischemia reperfusion injury in a rat model. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Pancreatic ischemia reperfusion {{was performed in}} Wistar rats for 1 hour. Revascularization was achieved followed by 4 h of reperfusion. A total of 24 animals were divided into four groups: Group 1 : sham; Group 2 : pancreatic ischemia reperfusion without treatment; Group 3 : pancreatic ischemia reperfusion plus <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> intravenously; and Group 4 : pancreatic ischemia reperfusion plus <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> per os. Blood and tissue samples were collected after reperfusion. RESULTS: There were significant differences in amylase levels between Group 1 (6. 11 ± 0. 55) and Group 2 (10. 30 ± 0. 50) [p= 0. 0002] {{as well as between}} Group 2 (10. 30 ± 0. 50) and Group 4 (7. 82 ± 0. 38) [p= 0. 003]; creatinine levels between Group 1 (0. 52 ± 0. 07) and Group 2 (0. 77 ± 0. 18) [p= 0. 035] as well as between Group 2 (0. 77 ± 0. 18) and Group 3 (0. 48 ± 0. 13) [p= 0. 012]; and pancreatic tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels between Group 1 (1. 27 ± 0. 96) and Group 2 (2. 60 ± 3. 01) [p= 0. 026] as well as between Group 2 (2. 60 ± 3. 01) and Group 4 (0. 52 ± 0. 56) [p= 0. 002]. A decrease in pancreatic tissue GST-&# 945; 3 gene expression was observed in Group 2 in comparison to Group 1 (p = 0. 006), and an increase was observed in Groups 3 and 4 when compared to Group 2 (p= 0. 025 and p= 0. 010, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that <b>N-acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> has a beneficial effect on pancreatic ischemia reperfusion injury and renal function in a rat model...|$|E
