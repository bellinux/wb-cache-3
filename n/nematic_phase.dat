5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient {{themselves in}} a layer-like fashion known as the discotic <b>nematic</b> <b>phase.</b> If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar.

5|$|The objects {{created by}} amphiphiles are usually spherical (as {{in the case}} of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These {{anisotropic}} self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves {{in much the same way}} as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> of rod-shaped micelles).|$|E
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
40|$|Three {{new types}} of terminally {{connected}} ABA-heterotrimesogens and heterodimesogens, composed of a bent 3, 5 -diphenyl- 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazole central unit {{and one or two}} rod-shaped 4 -cyanobiphenyl cores or one 2 -phenyl- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole core, connected by flexible spacers, have been synthesized, and their mesomorphic behavior was studied by optical polarizing microscopy (PM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). All dimesogens exhibit broad ranges of cybotactic <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> (N cybA and N cybC), in some cases accompanied by additional mesophases (CybA or SmC) at lower temperature. The combination of the 3, 5 -diphenyl- 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazole unit with one cyanobiphenyl core leads to the removal of tilted smectic and cybotactic <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> (SmC, N cybC), which are replaced by the nontilted CybA <b>phases</b> and <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> composed of SmA-type clusters (N cybA). The orthogonal cybotactic <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> of bent-core mesogens are of special interest for achieving biaxial <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> of the orthorhombic type. The orthogonal (N cybA) and skewed (N cybC) cybotactic <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> were distinguished by XRD and optical observations...|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. Analogous to {{rod-shaped}} and disc-shaped molecules, bent-core molecules also exhibit <b>nematic</b> <b>phases,</b> {{in addition}} to other higher order mesophases. Presently, about 600 bent-core or banana-shaped molecules are known to exhibit <b>nematic</b> <b>phases.</b> In this article, the chemistry and mesomorphic properties of all these materials are summarized...|$|R
40|$|A novel, highly polar {{rod-like}} {{liquid crystal}} {{was found to}} exhibit two distinct nematic mesophases (N and Nx). When studied by microscopy and X-ray scattering experiments, and under applied electric fields, the <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> are practically identical. However, calorimetry experiments refute {{the possibility of an}} intervening smectic mesophase, and the transformation between the <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> was associated with a weak thermal event. Analysis of measured dielectric data, along with molecular properties obtained from DFT calculations, applying the Maier-Meier relationship allowed for the degree of antiparallel pairing of dipoles in both <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> to be quantified. Based on the results, we conclude that the onset of the lower temperature phase is driven by the formation of antiparallel molecular associations...|$|R
5|$|In 1969, Hans Kelker {{succeeded in}} synthesizing a {{substance}} that had a <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> at room temperature, MBBA, {{which is one of}} the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} insight here is that, whilst parallel {{arrangements of}} anisotropic objects {{lead to a}} decrease in orientational entropy, there {{is an increase in}} positional entropy. Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a <b>nematic</b> <b>phase.</b> Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} {{can also be}} found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> {{in the case of the}} smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{molecular}} dynamics study of reentrant <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> using the Gay-Berne-Kihara {{model of a}} liquid crystal in nanoconfinement. At densities above those characteristic of smectic A <b>phases,</b> reentrant <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> form that are characterized by a large value of the nematic order parameter S≃ 1. Along the nematic director these "supernematic" phases exhibit a remarkably high self-diffusivity which exceeds that for ordinary, lower-density <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> by an order of magnitude. Enhancement of self-diffusivity is attributed to a decrease of rotational configurational entropy in confinement. Recent developments in the pulsed field gradient NMR technique are shown to provide favorable conditions for an experimental confirmation of our simulations. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in the Landau-de Gennes functional introduced to study the transition between the smectic and <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> of a liquid crystal. We define a reduced functional by constraining the director field to satisfy a non-homogeneous Dirichlet condition and we prove that, below a critical temperature and if some elastic coefficients are explicitly large, then, the minimizers have to be <b>nematic</b> <b>phases.</b> Comment: 29 page...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that spin <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> can appear in either {{frustrated}} magnets or in those described by Hamiltonians with large exotic non-Heisenberg terms like biquadratic exchange. We show in the present study that non-frustrated spin- 1 1 D, 2 D and 3 D antiferromagnets with single-ion easy-axis anisotropy can show <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> in strong magnetic field. For 1 D case we support our analytical results by numerical ones. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
5|$|Thermotropic phases {{are those}} that occur in a certain {{temperature}} range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating {{a particular type of}} LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.|$|E
5|$|The chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This {{phase is}} often called the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of recent works devoted to spin <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> deal with either frustrated magnets or with those described by Hamiltonians with large non-Heisenberg terms. We {{show in the}} present study that nonfrustrated antiferromagnets (AFs) containing ferromagnetic (FM) bonds can show <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> in a strong magnetic field. Among the particular spin systems discussed are a ladder with FM rungs, two AF layers coupled ferromagnetically, a chain containing alternating AF and FM bonds, and an AF anisotropic spin- 1 chain.

40|$|<b>Nematic</b> <b>phases,</b> {{breaking}} spontaneously rotational symmetry, {{provide for}} ubiquitously observed states of matter in both classical and quantum systems. These nematic {{states may be}} further classified by their $N$ [...] fold rotational invariance described by cyclic groups $C_N$ in 2 + 1 D. Starting from the space groups of underlying $ 2 d$ crystals, we present a general classification scheme incorporating $C_N$ <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> that arise from dislocation-mediated melting and discuss the conventional tensor order parameters. By coupling the $O(2) $ matter fields to the $Z_N$ lattice gauge theory, an unified $O(2) /Z_N$ lattice gauge theory is constructed in order to describe all these <b>nematic</b> <b>phases.</b> This lattice gauge theory is shown to reproduce the $C_N$ nematic-isotropic liquid phase transitions and contains an additional deconfined phase. Finally, using our $O(2) /Z_N$ gauge theory framework, we discuss phase transitions between different $C_N$ nematics. Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|Predicting the {{macroscopic}} chiral behaviour {{of liquid}} crystals from the microscopic chirality of the particles is highly non-trivial, {{even when the}} chiral interactions are purely entropic in nature. Here we introduce a novel chiral hard-particle model, namely particles with a twisted polyhedral shape and obtain a stable fully entropy-driven cholesteric phase by computer simulations. By slightly modifying the triangular base of the particle, {{we are able to}} switch from a left-handed prolate (calamitic) to a right-handed oblate (discotic) cholesteric phase using the same right-handed twisted particle model. Furthermore, we show that not only prolate and oblate chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phases,</b> but also other novel entropy-driven phases, namely chiral blue <b>phases,</b> chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> featuring both twist and splay deformations, chiral biaxial <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> with one of the axes twisted, can be obtained by varying particle biaxiality and chirality. Our results allow to identify general guidelines for the stabilization of these phases...|$|R
500|$|One of {{the most}} common LC phases is the nematic. The word nematic comes from the Greek [...] (...) , which means [...] "thread". This term {{originates}} from the thread-like topological defects observed in nematics, which are formally called 'disclinations'. Nematics also exhibit so-called [...] "hedgehog" [...] topological defects. In a <b>nematic</b> <b>phase,</b> the calamitic or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel. Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order. Most nematics are uniaxial: they have one axis that is longer and preferred, with the other two being equivalent (can be approximated as cylinders or rods). However, some liquid crystals are biaxial nematics, meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis, they also orient along a secondary axis. Nematics have fluidity similar to that of ordinary (isotropic) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field. Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in liquid-crystal displays (LCD).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{cholesterol}} derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) {{are known}} to generate the liquid crystalline [...] "cholesteric phase". The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phase,</b> and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in liquid-crystal display thermometers and in temperature-sensitive paints.|$|E

40|$|Liquid crystal {{phases of}} the polar {{molecule}} DB 9 ONO 2 display fluctuations on two incommensurate and temperature dependent length scales. We have used high resolution X-ray scattering to study the structure of this material between 80 °C and 230 °C at atmospheric pressure. We confirm the previously reported phase sequence of multiply reentrant <b>nematic</b> <b>phases.</b> The low temperature <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> are highly ordered, with correlation lengths exceeding 3 300 A far from the phase boundary.

40|$|We {{construct}} a tensor model for <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> of bent-core molecules from molecular theory. The form of free energy {{is determined by}} molecular symmetry, which includes the couplings and derivatives of a vector and two second-order tensors, with the coefficients determined by molecular parameters. We use the model to study the <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> resulted from the hard-core potential, and obtain the phase diagram about the molecular parameters. The tensor model is applicable to other molecules with the same symmetry, which we demonstrate by studying the phase diagram of star molecules. Comment: 20 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of structure modification of various discotic liquid crystal side chain polymers on their phase transitions and the resulting dynamics.

In addition we have exam-ined the dynamics of field-induced order parameters in the isotropic phase of calamitic side chain polymers using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and dynamic Kerr effect measurements...|$|R
50|$|Another {{strategy}} towards biaxial nematics {{is the use}} of {{mixtures of}} classical rodlike mesogens and disklike discotic mesogens. The biaxial <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> is expected to be located below the minimum in the rod-disk phase diagram. In one study a miscible system of rods and disks is actually found although the biaxial <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> remains elusive.|$|E
50|$|Chirality is {{important}} in context of ordered phases as well, for example {{the addition of a}} small amount of an optically active molecule to a <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.|$|E
50|$|The {{phase diagram}} of APFN/H2O system is {{delineated}} {{by the presence}} of a lamellar phase and a <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> with awide isotropic solution. The <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> is of the type I, and the aggregates have a positive and diamagnetic anisotropy. In the presence of a magnetic field, the aggregates align parallel to the field direction. The change of phase at the lamellar-nematic temperature has been ascribed to order-disorder transitions.|$|E

40|$|The neat {{phases of}} a series of {{quaternary}} ammonium halides based on trioctadecylamine have been investigated by optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and H- 2 NMR spectroscopy. Phase behaviour depends primarily on the structure of the fourth substituent on nitrogen and the thermal history of the samples. For instance, the iodide salts with methyl, ethyl, or propyl as the fourth substituent form enantiotropic <b>nematic</b> <b>phases,</b> while those with a proton or a longer alkyl substituent exhibit complex phase behaviour that does not include a liquid crystalline phase.

40|$|Chirality is {{ubiquitous}} {{in nature and}} plays crucial roles in biology, medicine, physics and materials science. Understanding and controlling chirality is therefore an important research challenge with broad implications in fundamental and applied sciences. Unlike other classes of chiral colloids, such as nanocellulose or filamentous viruses, amyloid fibrils form <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> but appear to miss their twisted form in the phase diagram, the so-called cholesteric or chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phases,</b> and this despite a well-defined chirality at the single fibril level. Here we report the discovery of cholesteric phases in amyloid fibrils, by using e̱ṯa̱-lactoglobulin fibrils suitably shortened by shear stresses. The physical behavior of this new class of cholesteric materials exhibits unprecedented structural complexity, with confinement-drivenordering transitions between at least three types of nematic and cholesteric tactoids. We use energy functional theory to rationalize these results and demonstrate a chirality inversion upon increasing hierarchical levels, from the left-handed amyloids to the right-handed cholesteric droplets. These findings significantly deepen our understanding of chiral <b>nematic</b> <b>phases</b> and may {{pave the way to}} their optimal use in soft nanotechnology, nanomaterials templating and self-assembly...|$|R

50|$|In doing so, {{varying degrees}} of order and {{mobility}} within mesogens results in different types of liquid crystal phases, Figure 1. The <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> (N) is the least ordered and most fluid liquid crystalline state or mesophase {{that is based on}} the rigid core of mesogen moieties. The <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> leads to long range orientational order and short range positional order of mesogens. The smectic (Sm) and columnar (CoI) phases are more ordered and less fluid than their nematic phases and demonstrate long range orientational order of rod-shaped and disk-shaped rigid cores, respectively.|$|E

This transition is observed on heating from the Nu phase with Polarizing optical microscopy as {{a change in}} Schlieren texture and increased light transmittance and from x-ray diffraction as the splitting of the nematic reflection. The transition is a second order transition with low energy content and therefore not observed in differential scanning calorimetry. The positional order parameter for the uniaxial <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> is 0.75 to 1.5 times the mesogen length and for the biaxial <b>nematic</b> <b>phase</b> 2 to 3.3 times the mesogen length.|$|E
40|$|We found, using {{polarization}} microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering, {{that for}} goethite, a low polydispersity suffices to form two separate <b>nematic</b> <b>phases,</b> while previous theory showed {{that this is}} only possible for mixtures of particles with extremely different lengths or diameters. Applying a critical magnetic field, which induces some of the goethite nanorods to rotate, leads to sufficient excluded volume between the particles to cause macroscopic phase separation between two orthogonal <b>nematic</b> <b>phases.</b> The larger the polydispersity of the system, the broader the range of field strengths where nematic−nematic phase separation occurs.
