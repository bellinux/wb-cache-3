5|$|For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on {{most major}} Cold War conflicts, {{including}} the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, {{such as the}} conflict between Israel and Palestine and Iran's suspected development of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>are</b> also heavily influenced by the veto, actual or threatened. Additionally, the veto applies to {{the selection of the}} UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes. Recently China also exercised its VETO on India's Resolution to put Masood Azhar on list of Global terrorist list. He is proclaimed head of Jaish E Mohammad a terror Outfit which is already designated as Global terrorist group by UNSC.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E

50|$|The {{complete}} {{conversion to}} PAL systems was relatively slow. In 1974, U.S. Defense Secretary James Schlesinger {{found that a}} variety of tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> still not fitted with Permissive Action Links, even though the technology had been available for some time. It took another two years until all the tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> fully equipped with PALs. In 1981, almost 20 years after the invention of PALs, just over half of U.S. <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> still equipped only with mechanical locks.

5000|$|A {{tactical}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> (TNW) or non-strategic <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> [...] <b>is</b> a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> which <b>is</b> {{designed to}} be used on a battlefield in military situations, mostly with friendly forces in proximity and perhaps even on contested friendly territory. This is opposed to strategic <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> which <b>are</b> {{designed to be}} mostly targeted in the enemy interior away from the war front against military bases, cities, towns, arms industries, and other hardened or larger-area targets to damage the enemy's ability to wage war.

25|$|The {{fact that}} John Bumgarner, a former {{intelligence}} officer {{and member of}} the United States Cyber-Consequences Unit (US-CCU), published an article prior to Stuxnet being discovered or deciphered, that outlined a strategic cyber strike on centrifuges and suggests that cyber attacks are permissible against nation states which are operating uranium enrichment programs that violate international treaties gives some credibility to these claims. Bumgarner pointed out that the centrifuges used to process fuel for <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> a key target for cybertage operations and that they can be made to destroy themselves by manipulating their rotational speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} free energy {{contained}} in nuclear fuel is millions {{of times the}} amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as gasoline, making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy. The products of nuclear fission, however, are on average far more radioactive than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel, and remain so for significant amounts of time, giving rise to a nuclear waste problem. Concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and over the destructive potential of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> a counterbalance to the peaceful desire to use fission as an energy source, and give rise to ongoing political debate over nuclear power.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the {{administration}} {{increased the number}} of nuclear warheads from 1,000 in 1953 to 18,000 by early 1961. Despite overwhelming U.S. superiority, one additional <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> produced each day. The administration also exploited new technology. In 1955 the eight-engined B-52 Stratofortress bomber, the first true jet bomber designed to carry <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>was</b> developed.|$|R

25|$|In the 2004 reimagining of the {{television}} series Battlestar Galactica, <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> a recurring weapon in the arsenal of both the Human and Cylon forces, though the Cylons use the weapons in colossal force when they bombard the Twelve Colonies with nuclear weapons, wiping out almost all life on the twelve planets. While the Galactica is stated to possess five nuclear warheads shortly after they flee the destroyed Twelve Colonies, (though it is later shown to carry six, possibly having been given several from the Battlestar Pegasus), the Cylons possess an unknown number, though given the sheer amount of the nukes used to devastate the Twelve Colonies, {{it is estimated that}} they possess many thousands.|$|E
25|$|British <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} and {{developed by the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment. The boats are capable of deploying with a maximum of 192 independently targetable warheads, or MIRVs, with immediate readiness to fire. However, {{as a result of}} a decision taken by the 1998 Strategic Defence Review this was reduced to 48 warheads with a readiness to fire reduced 'to days rather than minutes'. Furthermore, the total number of warheads maintained by the United Kingdom was reduced to approximately 200, with a total of 58 Trident missiles. The reduced warhead load per missile allowed the development of lower-yield non-strategic warheads loading options. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review reduced this number further and the submarines will put to sea in future with a reduced total of 40 warheads and a reduced missile load of 8 (from a maximum possible 16). The number of operationally available nuclear warheads is to be reduced 'from fewer than 160 to no more than 120 and the total UK nuclear weapon stockpile will number no more than 180.|$|E
25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E
