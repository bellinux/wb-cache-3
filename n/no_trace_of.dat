5|$|Coprolites (fossilized dung) {{containing}} small bones but <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> plant fragments, {{discovered in}} the Ischigualasto Formation, have been assigned to Herrerasaurus based on fossil abundance.

5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> an {{enclosure}} wall, which {{is present in}} both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply because the wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E

5|$|The {{head was}} {{conclusively}} seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, {{and it was on}} the south side of the Hall. Archaeological evidence also disproved its authenticity.

5|$|A nearby village, Niguili, {{was located}} {{near the mouth of}} Aliso Creek likely near the {{confluence}} of Aliso and Sulphur Creeks. Present-day Laguna Niguel takes its name from this settlement. The Acjachemen were renamed the Juaneño by Spanish priests in the 18th century, who established a mission at the present-day location of San Juan Capistrano. Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño clustered around the mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, and there is <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> it remaining.|$|E
5|$|Although {{bought at}} the auction (it is {{believed}} by Barwicks of London) by December 1935, Lew was working for Sidney Castle, the dismantler of the railway. This work was completed by July 1936 and in September, Lew was moved by rail to Swansea and loaded onto the S.S. Sabor destined for the port of Pernambuco (since renamed Recife), Brazil. Most of the relevant shipping records were destroyed in World War II, Lew then vanished from history and despite several attempts, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> the locomotive, or evidence of its fate, {{has so far been}} found.|$|E

5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> it has been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|Many people camp on Helvellyn {{throughout}} the year, often near Red Tarn which gives good views of Striding Edge, Swirral Edge, and {{the summit of}} Helvellyn itself. Although camping in England is illegal without {{the permission of the}} landowner, there is a tradition of wild camping in the Lake District. This has often been tolerated so long as people have camped unobtrusively, for no more than one night, and have left <b>no</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> their campsite behind.|$|E
