The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E
5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have a dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would {{go a step further}} in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E

Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|Adamson was {{replaced}} by former Leeds and England star Allan Clarke. Clarke shored up the defence, ensuring that Leeds survived the 1980–81 season, but {{in the first game}} of the 1981–82 season Leeds lost 5–1 to Swansea City, and the team <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> recover. The previously watertight defense started to ship goals, and the team seemed unable to score. Clarke spent freely in the transfer market, notably purchasing Peter Barnes, but his impact was slight – between 12 December 1981 and 6 April 1982, the team scored just five goals in fourteen league games. Leeds were relegated at the end of the 1981–82 season; Clarke was sacked and replaced by former teammate Eddie Gray.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian {{was always}} troubled by {{financial}} shortcomings; his income <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{be enough to}} sustain his large-scale goals and policies. For this reason {{he was forced to}} take substantial credits from Upper German banker families, especially from the Baumgarten, Fugger and Welser families. Jörg Baumgarten even served as Maximilian's financial advisor. The Fuggers, who dominated the copper and silver mining business in Tyrol, provided a credit of almost 1 million gulden for the purpose of bribing the prince-electors to choose Maximilian's grandson Charles V as the new Emperor. At the end of Maximilian's rule, the Habsburgs' mountain of debt totalled six million gulden, corresponding to a decade's worth of tax revenues from their inherited lands. It took {{until the end of the}} 16th century to repay this debt.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, when {{an offer}} to assume the Presidency of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was made, it was quickly accepted. This company {{operated}} a railroad between Baltimore and Washington, but its ambition was built a route to the Ohio River, and move commerce from the west through the City of Baltimore. In 1837 the western tracks went {{only as far as}} Harpers Ferry, Virginia and McLane’s great accomplishment was seeing to the extension of the “main line” as far as Cumberland, Maryland. This brought the route into proximity with enough coalfields to provide a regular profit. The profits were not substantial, however, and McLane was consumed with financing rearrangements and negotiations with Pennsylvania and Virginia over possible routes west. Ultimately Wheeling and an all Virginia route was decided upon, but it was left to McLane’s immediate successor to see the goal realized. McLane <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> appreciate the value of this work and ultimately retired on September 13, 1848.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
25|$|Series 8 and 9 {{featured}} Bodger and Badger {{running a}} Bed & Breakfast {{hotel in the}} fictional seaside town of Puddleford (location filming for series 8 and 9 took place around Brighton). Various guests stayed at the hotel {{over the course of}} the two series and again Bodger kept Badger's presence a secret from all of them. Guests included two Spanish flamenco dancers, Miss Peake (a bad-tempered school teacher), Mr Tucknott (a dim-witted bank manager), the bubbly Mrs Bobbins, Miss Piper (a mad old woman) and Mr Wilson (a pathetic trainee bank manager). In Series 8 the characters of Millie the Milkwoman and China the dog were introduced, who featured in the show until the very end. Millie was friends with Bodger and knew about Badger, as he was friends with her dog, China. Series 8 also featured the return of Mr Smart, as he ran the B next door to Bodger's. Smart <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have any guests staying at his hotel and was always trying to steal Bodger's. This was the first series to utilise the 1997 BBC logo and the last series to use the pink background for its title card and end credits.|$|E

One account described Dunlap's throwing prowess as follows: [...] "ndless practice made him adept as a monkey at grabbing a sizzling ground ball in either hand and firing it off from the very spot he seized it. His whistling throws, which seemed to clear the grass {{by no more than}} half a foot, <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> lose more than an inch or two." ...|$|E

500|$|Dustin Hoffman {{says that}} the play {{was the first one}} he ever read and predated his {{interest}} in becoming an [...] actor. He noted that the play resonated with him because his father was a travelling salesman and he had an older brother. Hoffman eventually played the role in a high-school production. In 1965, Hoffman served as the assistant director in an off-Broadway revival of A View from the Bridge at the Sheridan Square Playhouse with a cast that included Robert Duvall and Jon Voight. The show's director Ulu Grosbard suggested to Miller that Hoffman had the potential to make a great Willy Loman. Miller was unimpressed and later wrote that [...] "My estimate of Grosbard all but collapsed as, observing Dustin Hoffman's awkwardness and his big nose that <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> get unstuffy, I wondered how the poor fellow imagined himself a candidate for any kind of acting career." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of The Secret Service has been mostly negative. Gerry Anderson, however, {{said that it}} was his favourite of all the series that he had produced. Leo Eaton, who directed four episodes, has referred to The Secret Service as [...] "just a bit weird" [...] and questioned the effectiveness of Unwin's humour. Production manager Desmond Saunders' verdict was [...] "strange. I suppose it was the gobbledegook and the mixture of live action with puppets. It <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me {{to be a very good}} idea." [...] In discussing the production of the series on the website TVCentury21.com, Simon Wickes judges the premise [...] "very strange", and suggests that The Secret Service was made first and foremost to bridge the Andersons' Supermarionation series and their subsequent efforts in live action. Kif Bowden-Smith of the Transdiffusion website concurs with this latter point, describing the mix of puppetry and live action as [...] "an experimental format for the following live-action series".|$|E

500|$|Adelaide Anne Procter {{was born}} at 25 Bedford Square in the Bloomsbury {{district}} of London, on 30 October 1825 to the poet Bryan Waller Procter and his wife Anne (née Skepper). The family had strong literary ties: novelist Elizabeth Gaskell enjoyed her visits to the Procter household, and Procter's father was friends with poet Leigh Hunt, essayist Charles Lamb, and novelist Charles Dickens, {{as well as being}} acquainted with poet William Wordsworth and critic William Hazlitt. Family friend Bessie Rayner Belloc wrote in 1895 that [...] "everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow {{in and out of the}} house. The Kembles, the Macreadys, the Rossettis, the Dickens , the Thackerays, <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be exactly visitors, but to belong to the place." [...] Author and actress Fanny Kemble wrote that young Procter [...] "looks like a poet's child, and a poet ... a preter-naturally [...] thoughtful, mournful expression for such a little child".|$|E
500|$|After Diamonds Are Forever, Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as Bond, but he declined. After considering Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover, the two producers finally turned to Roger Moore, who they had previously discussed for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but who had been unavailable, and he was ultimately cast to play Bond in Live and Let Die. At the time Moore was an established television actor, known for his performances as Simon Templar in The Saint and Lord Brett Sinclair in The Persuaders!: in both of which he played a [...] "charming, debonair, international playboy". When playing Bond, Moore tried not to imitate either Connery or his previous roles, and screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay around Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted feel to Bond, an approach that led Raymond Benson to describe Moore's Bond as [...] "a rather smarmy, eyebrow-raising international playboy who <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> get hurt".|$|E
500|$|After {{his brief}} stay in Pittsburgh, the Pirates sent Clarke to Greenville in 1920.

[...] In 1925, he played for the Salisbury Indians in the Eastern Shore League. In the spring of 1925, The Sporting News wrote: [...] "Nig Clarke not only led the league with the bat and the mitt and the arm, he was the very picture of a {{baseball}} player. I rather suspect that Nig put away as much corn juice as the next man. In the days of his greatness he was wont {{to take a couple}} of snifters every morning before breakfast. <b>Never</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> hurt Nig any." [...] At the end of the season, he was given most valuable player honors for his performance with Salisbury. Clarke concluded his professional baseball career in 1927 with Tulsa.|$|E
