5|$|Having visited Bath, in {{the hope}} its waters would aid conception, Queen Mary became {{pregnant}} in late 1687. When the pregnancy became public knowledge shortly before Christmas, Catholics rejoiced. Protestants, who had tolerated James's Catholic government {{because he had no}} Catholic heir, were concerned. The Protestant disillusion came to a head after the child was known to be male, and many Protestants believed the child was spurious; if not, James II's Catholic dynasty would have been perpetuated. Popular opinion alleged that the child, named James Francis Edward, was smuggled into the birth chamber as a substitute to the Queen's real but stillborn child. This rumour was widely accepted as fact by Protestants, despite the many witnesses of the birth. Mainly by mismanagement on James' part, these rumours had some excuse as from personal prejudice he had excluded many from the ceremony whose testimony must have been counted valid; most of the witnesses were Catholics or foreigners, and several, such as the Princess Anne of Denmark, later to be Queen Anne, and the Protestant prelates, or the family of the Princesses whom the <b>new</b> <b>birth</b> would remove from the direct succession, were not allowed to be present. Anne later answered a memorandum of 18 questions regarding James Francis Edward's birth for her sister, the Princess of Orange. Anne's answers, biased and unreliable, convinced the Princess of Orange that her father had thrust a changeling upon the nation. Count Zuylestein, returning to the Netherlands shortly after the birth, agreed with Anne's findings.|$|E

25|$|Spener {{stressed}} {{the necessity of}} a <b>new</b> <b>birth</b> and separation of Christians from the world, (see Asceticism). Many Pietists maintained that the <b>new</b> <b>birth</b> always had to be preceded by agonies of repentance, and that only a regenerated theologian could teach theology. The whole school shunned all common worldly amusements, such as dancing, the theatre, and public games. Some believe this led to a new form of justification by works. Its ecclesiolae in ecclesia also weakened the power and meaning of church organization. These Pietistic attitudes caused a counter-movement {{at the beginning of the}} 18th century; one leader was Valentin Ernst Löscher, superintendent at Dresden.|$|E

40|$|The United States Census Bureau samples <b>new</b> {{employer}} <b>births</b> quarterly using a two-phase sample design. The {{source of}} these <b>new</b> employer <b>births</b> is the Census Bureau’s Business Register. The Business Register is a multi-relational database {{that contains a}} record for each known establishment in the United States and is periodically updated with administrative data {{from a variety of}} sources, including the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration. In {{the first phase of the}} sample design, <b>new</b> employer <b>births</b> are identified. A sample of these is mailed a classification form. In addition to providing new or refined industry classification codes, the completed form provides sales, receipts or revenue, company organization, and other key information needed for sampling. If a response is available, the reported two months of sales (receipts) may be used to compute the measure of size for second-phase sampling. However, not all businesses respond, so it is necessary to use administrative payroll data to compute the measure of size for these. This paper documents the research that looks at using administrative payroll data to calculate the measure of size for all <b>new</b> employer <b>births.</b> This research is a continuation of research to determine the feasibility of eliminating the first phase of the <b>new</b> employer <b>birth</b> sample selection, basing the measure of size only on administrative data...|$|R

25|$|Since 4 April 2005, as per the Gender Recognition Act 2004, it is {{possible}} for transgender people to change their legal gender in the UK, allowing them to acquire a <b>new</b> <b>birth</b> certificate, affording them full recognition of their acquired sex in law for all purposes. Transgender people must present evidence to a Gender Recognition Panel, which considers their case and issues a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC); they must have transitioned two years before a GRC is issued. It is not a requirement for sex reassignment surgery to have taken place, although such surgery will be accepted as part of the supporting evidence for a case where it has taken place. There is formal approval of medical gender reassignment available either on the National Health Service (NHS) or privately.|$|E
