40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the contribution of}} geomorphologic documents and the criteria and methodology used {{for the implementation of}} Geo-tourist maps and Environmental-Tourist Maps in three protected areas located in mountain, hilly and plain areas of the Modena Province (Northern Italy). The study mountain area is the upper Tagliole Valley located in the Modena Apennines. It is mainly characterised by glacial and cryogenic landforms. The hilly area is the Natural Reserve of Salse di Nirano located in the Modena Apennines margin. The “Salse” are small mud volcanoes. The third study area is the Natural Oasis of Mirandola Valleys which is characterised by fluvial <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> and humid environment. Geomorphologic maps and Digital Terrain Models (DTM) have been realized. The Geo-tourist maps, derived from the Geomorphologic maps, combine the most evident <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> with fundamental tourist information (e. g. parking places, excursion trails, picnic areas, overnight-stay sites, etc…). The goal was to produce maps that could be easily interpreted by tourists and help them to understand the landscape. The Geo-Tourist maps and the DTM are the cartographic documents characterising Environmental-Tourist maps. These are thematic pocket foldable maps printed on both sides with illustration notes both in English and Italian. The Environmental -Tourist maps are part of the initiatives adopted for improving the knowledge, fruition and appraisal of the environment of protected areas.

40|$|AbstractIn the Southern Eastern Desert of Egypt, A NW–SE {{oriented}} structural graben {{extends from}} the North of Aswan to the Red Sea coast with a length of about 400 km and an average width of 30 km. The area has significant potential for development {{as it may be}} provided with water from surface and subsurface sources and is the site of prospection for petroleum. The present paper is an attempt to understand the structural evolution and genetic development of the <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> of the area and constructing presently a new geomorphological map at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 using Landsat ETM images and field checks. Available geological maps and the produced geomorphological map are digitized by using the ARC-GIS software. The same program is also used to produce a 3 D DEM for surface and subsurface features. Based on new interpretations of aeromagnetic and radiometric data, the subsurface features of the basement cover were illustrated on a 3 D map. Geological–geomorphological profiles have been constructed in different directions in the area to identify present and ancient <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features.</b> The place and shape of subsurface deep seated NW–SE trending faults have been determined. The faults, which generated the graben have downthrows in the order of 900 – 5800 m. The surface and subsurface observations delineate the dominant downthrow of about 3750 m. Three E–W subsurface faults have been detected under Nubia sandstone, one of them, displaying a downthrow of about 845 m, cuts through the basement rocks...|$|R
40|$|Species invasions {{are known}} to change biotic and abiotic {{ecosystem}} characteristics such as community structure, cycling of materials and dynamics of rivers. However, their ability to alter interactions between biotic and abiotic ecosystem components, in particular bio-geomorphic feedbacks and the resulting landscape configuration in tidal wetlands, such as tidal channels {{have not yet been}} demonstrated. We studied the impact of altered bio-geomorphic feedbacks on <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> (i. e. tidal wetland channels), by comparing proxies for channel network geometry (unchanneled flow lengths, fractal dimension) over time between non-invaded and invaded salt marsh habitats. The non-invaded habitats (the south of eastern Chongming Island, Yangtze estuary, China) show little change in network geometry over time with a tendency for an increased drainage density. The invaded site (salt marshes in the north of eastern Chongming Island invaded by the exotic plant species Spartina alterniflora) showed a decreasing tendency in channel drainage density throughout and after the species invasion. This suggests that species invasions might not only affect biotic ecosystem characteristics, but also their ability to change bio-geomorphic feedback loops, potentially leading to changes in existing <b>geomorphologic</b> <b>features</b> and therefore landscape configuration. Our results further suggest that the species invasion also altered sediment composition. Based on observations we propose a mechanism explaining the change in channel drainage density by an alteration in plant properties. The physical and physiological characteristics of the invading species Spartina alterniflora clearly differ from the native species Scirpus mariqueter, inducing different bio-geomorphic feedback loops leading to the observed change in salt marsh channel configuration. </p...|$|R

Using this approach, the Herbert River in north Queensland can be divided into seven 'fluvial fields'. By considering the likely migration directions of field boundaries in the lower floodplain we conclude that, contrary to many sequence-stratigraphic models, lowering sea-level would drive a general aggradation of the system on the Great Barrier Reef shelf, whereas a sea-level rise would cause further incision of the modern coastal plain...|$|R
