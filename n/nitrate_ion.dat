5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an {{oxidizing}} agent. Depending on the reaction, {{this may}} be due to the Pb2+(aq) ion, which has a standard reduction potential (E0) of −0.125V, or the <b>nitrate</b> <b>ion,</b> which under acidic conditions has an E0 of +0.956V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an acidic condition, while the lead(II) works best in a neutral aqueous solution.|$|E
25|$|If metal nitrates are {{prepared}} from N2O4 in completely anhydrous conditions, {{a range of}} covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals. This is {{because there is a}} thermodynamic preference for the <b>nitrate</b> <b>ion</b> to bond covalently with such metals rather than form an ionic structure. Such compounds must be prepared in anhydrous conditions, since the <b>nitrate</b> <b>ion</b> is a much weaker ligand than water, and if water is present the simple hydrated nitrate will form. The anhydrous nitrates concerned are themselves covalent, and many, e.g. anhydrous copper nitrate, are volatile at room temperature. Anhydrous titanium nitrate sublimes in vacuum at only 40°C. Many of the anhydrous transition metal nitrates have striking colours. This branch of chemistry was developed by Clifford Addisson and Noramn Logan at Nottingham University in the UK during the 1960s and 1970s when highly efficient desiccants and dry boxes started to become available.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nitrate</b> <b>ion</b> (NO3−), for instance, must form {{a double}} bond between {{nitrogen}} {{and one of}} the oxygens to satisfy the octet rule for nitrogen. However, because the molecule is symmetrical, it does not matter which of the oxygens forms the double bond. In this case, there are three possible resonance structures. Expressing resonance when drawing Lewis structures may be done either by drawing each of the possible resonance forms and placing double-headed arrows between them or by using dashed lines to represent the partial bonds (although the latter is a good representation of the resonance hybrid which is not, formally speaking, a Lewis structure).|$|E

2500|$|There are {{situations}} whereby {{a single}} Lewis structure {{is insufficient to}} explain the electron configuration in a molecule, hence a superposition of structures are needed. The same two atoms in such molecules can be bonded differently in different structures (a single bond in one, a double bond in another, or even none at all), resulting in a non-integer bond order.

2500|$|Further {{modifications}} to the MLE were to come: [...] Bardenpho and Biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of <b>nitrate</b> <b>ion</b> to molecular nitrogen gas. [...] Use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria, thereby biologically reducing orthophosphate ion in the treated wastewater. [...] Even newer improvements, such as Anammox Process, interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of nitrification, shunting nitrite-rich mixed liquor activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas, saving energy, alkalinity, and secondary carbon sourcing. Anammox™ (ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation) works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria {{through the use of}} substrate added to the mixed liquor and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification. Many other proprietary schemes are being deployed, including DEMON™, Sharon-ANAMMOX™, ANITA-Mox™, and DeAmmon™.

The nitrate reductase deposited on the GCE/RGO/PPy carried direct electron transfer effectively from nitrate to the electrode. Nitrate reductase is an enzyme that assists the direct electron transfer from the active site of composite RGO/PPy electrode surface leading to the enhancement of current density up to 4.24 mA cm− 2.
