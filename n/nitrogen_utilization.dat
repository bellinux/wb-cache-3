50|$|Nitrilases have {{critical}} {{roles in}} plant-microbe interactions for defense, detoxification, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>utilization,</b> and plant hormone synthesis. In plants, {{there are two}} distinguishable groups in regard to substrate specificity: those with high hydrolytic activity towards arylacetonitriles and those with high activity towards β-cyano-ʟ-alanine. N121, 2, and 3 of the A. thaliana species are examples of {{the first group of}} plant nitrilases (arylacetonitrilases) which hydrolyze the nitriles produced during the synthesis or degradation of cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. The arylcetonitrile substrates for these particular enzymes consist of phenylpropionitrile and other products that result from glucosinolate metabolism. N1T4 however, belongs to the second group of plant nitrilases and is critical for cyanide detoxification in plants.|$|E
50|$|NADP-malic enzyme, as {{all other}} C4 decarboxylases, did not evolve de novo for CO2 pooling to aid RuBisCO. Rather, NADP-ME was {{directly}} {{transformed from a}} C3 species in photosynthesis, and even earlier origins from an ancient cystolic ancestor. In the cytosol, the enzyme existed {{as a series of}} housekeeping isoforms purposed towards a variety of functions including malate level maintenance during hypoxia, microspore separation, and pathogen defense. In regards to the mechanism of evolution, the C4 functionality is thought to have stemmed from gene duplication error both within promoter regions, triggering overexpression in bundle-sheath cells, and within the coding region, generating neofunctionalization. Selection for CO2 preservation function as well as enhanced water and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>utilization</b> under stressed conditions was then shaped by natural pressures.|$|E
40|$|The {{phosphotransferase}} system (PTS), encompassing EI, HPr, {{and assorted}} EII proteins, uses phosphoenolpyruvate to import and phosphorylate sugars. A paralog of EIIA {{of the sugar}} PTS system known as ptsN has been purported to regulate organic <b>nitrogen</b> source <b>utilization</b> in Escherichia coli K- 12. Its known biochemical function, however, relates to potassium homeostasis. The evidence for regulation of organic <b>nitrogen</b> source <b>utilization</b> by ptsN is based primarily on the defective growth of ΔptsN mutants on amino acid nitrogen sources and other nutrient combinations. These observations were made with E. coli strains MG 1655 and W 3110, which carry a nonfunctional version of ilvG. There are three isozymes that effectively catalyze the first committed step of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, but ilvG is unique for doing so effectively {{across a range of}} potassium concentrations. Here we show that all of the nutrient utilization phenotypes attributed to ptsN are manifested selectively in strains lacking functional ilvG. We conclude that the ptsN gene product does not regulate organic <b>nitrogen</b> source <b>utilization</b> as previously proposed...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} of wine yeast {{to utilize the}} nitrogen available in grape must directly correlates with the fermentation and growth rates of all wine yeast fermentation stages and is, thus, of critical importance for wine production. Here we precisely quantified the ability of low complexity nitrogen compounds to support fast, efficient and rapidly initiated growth of four commercially important wine strains. Nitrogen substrate abundance in grape must failed to correlate with the rate or the efficiency of <b>nitrogen</b> source <b>utilization,</b> but well predicted lag phase length. Thus, human domestication of yeast for grape must growth has had, at the most, a marginal impact on wine yeast growth rates and efficiencies, but may have left a surprising imprint on {{the time required to}} adjust metabolism from non growth to growth. Wine yeast <b>nitrogen</b> source <b>utilization</b> deviated from that of the lab strain experimentation, but also varied between wine strains. Each wine yeast lineage harbored <b>nitrogen</b> source <b>utilization</b> defects that were private to that strain. By a massive hemizygote analysis, we traced the genetic basis of the most glaring of these defects, near inability of the PDM wine strain to utilize methionine, as consequence of mutations in its ARO 8, ADE 5, 7 and VBA 3 alleles. We also identified candidate causative mutations in these genes. The methionine defect of PDM is potentially very interesting as the strain can, in some circumstances, overproduce foul tasting H 2 S, a trait which likely stems from insufficient methionine catabolization. The poor adaptation of wine yeast to the grape must nitrogen environment, and the presence of defects in each lineage, open up wine strain optimizatio...|$|R

Wine yeast strains have specific abilities to grow and ferment under stressful conditions compared with other strains, but the genetic basis underlying these traits is unknown. Understanding how sequence variation influences such phenotypes is a major challenge to address adaptation mechanisms of wine yeast. We aimed to identify the genetic basis of fermentation traits and gain insight into their relationships with variations in gene expression among yeast strains.

That monensin caused a greater proportion of feed OM and N to be digested and absorbed in the intestines than in the rumen (with possibly greater resultant metabolic efficiency) may account for some of the benefit of feeding this compound with high grain diets, as losses incurred in the ruminal transformation of feed nitrogen to bacterial nitrogen appear to be partially eliminated...|$|R
