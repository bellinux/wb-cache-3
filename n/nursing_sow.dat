Pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes results revealed an age- and diet-dependent bacterial succession process in piglets. During the first 3 days after birth, the bacterial community was relatively simple and dominated by Firmicutes with 79 % and 65 % relative abundance for Meishan and Yorkshire piglets, respectively. During the suckling period until day 14, the piglet breed and the nursing mother lead to increasing differentiation of the fecal bacterial community, with specific bacteria taxa associated with breed, and others with the <b>nursing</b> <b>sow</b> most likely due to its milk composition. Although the effect of nursing mother and the breed were evident through the suckling period, the introduction of solid feed and subsequent weaning were the major events occurring that dominated succession of the gut microbiota in the early life of piglets.

40|$|The {{number of}} born {{piglets per litter}} has {{increased}} in Swedish pig industry, and farmers are struggling to improve piglet survival. A common practice is to make litters more equally sized by moving piglets from large litters to smaller {{to make sure that}} all piglets get an own teat to suckle. Litter equalization is not always enough, as many sows have large litters and/or damaged teats, which results in an insufficient number of available teats. One way to solve this problem is to use <b>nurse</b> <b>sows.</b> A <b>nurse</b> <b>sow</b> raises, and weans, her own piglets before receiving a foster litter. The objectives of this study were to address how the use of <b>nurse</b> <b>sows</b> affects the welfare of sows and piglets and to explore how it impacts the contribution margin of pig production in Sweden. A literature search was made to investigate welfare aspects on sows and piglets. As there were few published studies on <b>nurse</b> <b>sows,</b> an expert group meeting was organized. In order to explore the impact on the contribution margin of pig production, a partial budgeting approach with stochastic elements was used for a fictive pig farm. Standard templates for calculating costs and benefits were supplemented with figures from existing literature and the gathered expert opinions. In Sweden, the minimum suckling period is 28 [*]days while published studies involving <b>nurse</b> <b>sows,</b> all from outside of Sweden, weaned the piglets at 21 [*]days. A Swedish <b>nurse</b> <b>sow</b> will thus get longer lactation period which might increase the risk of poor body condition, damaged teats, and shoulder ulcers. This indicates a reduced welfare of the sow and may lead to impaired fertility and increased culling risk. On the other hand, the piglet mortality could be reduced with the use of <b>nurse</b> <b>sows,</b> but the separation and mixing of piglets could be stressful. The partial budgeting suggested that the <b>nurse</b> <b>sow</b> system is slightly more profitable (+ 6, 838 Swedish krona) per farrowing group during one dry and one lactation period compared to the conventional system. The result is, however, highly dependent on the input values, and welfare aspects were not considered in the calculations...|$|R

40|$|A {{major goal}} of pig {{breeding}} {{is to produce}} sows with good longevity, which can raise many uniform litters with healthy, fast-growing piglets. The fitness of the sow, including the presence of sufficient number of functional teats, is one key {{to the success of}} the initial rearing period of the piglets. A frequently occurring type of non-functional teat, believed to not deliver sufficient amounts of milk from which piglets cannot suckle easy which is thereby less valuable for the suckling piglets, is the inverted teat. The aim of this thesis was to provide new genetic and clinical knowledge about pig teat traits, to create implements for accurate registrations and optimum focus on these traits in the breeding work. The long term aim is to provide knowledge that contributes to an increased piglet survival and a higher daily piglet growth. The present study shows that many of the inverted teats will protrude between the age of 5 month and early gestation. However, some teats remain inverted and neither inverted teats nor small teats will supply enough milk to the suckling piglets and they are therefore undesired. At three weeks of age the number of functional and non-functional teats is the same between male and female pigs. However this changes at live weight of 100 kg and the number of functional and non-functional teats differs between gender. The difference noted may be caused by differences in the recording because of, e. g. divergent development during puberty. Total teat number, number of functional teats and inverted teats are heritable traits and the number of functional teats can therefore be improved by selection. There is no significant genetic correlation between litter size and teat number. This motivates that the number of functional teats should be included in any genetic evaluation which includes litter size. Present study has identified tentative chromosome regions for the total number of teats, the number of inverted and number of functional teats. Further research is needed to fine-map and verify the candidate genes. This thesis has assisted in answering important questions regarding teat traits in the pig. The complexity of the interaction between the <b>nursing</b> <b>sow</b> and its piglets was further emphasized, but there are still questions that need to be focused and new questions have been raised. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{was to develop a}} new method of heating of pig houses and more specifically the swine nurseries with the use of Solar Heating Systems. In the proposed method a Test Shell with Solar Mass Wall, is used to service the heating needs of nursing sows while for the nurslings was created a special flooring (pad) with embodied heated pipes, throw a system of solar collectors and heating storage tank. The structural elements of this system are a solar mass wall, a specially designed heated flooring (shelter), a solar absorber, a solar collector, a heating storage tank and a heating supply tank. These elements are combined together using appropriate fluid circuits and digital controllers. The system provides a suitable environment for the nursling’ shelter {{as well as to the}} <b>nursing</b> <b>sow</b> through the solar mass wall. The system is composed of two main circuits. The first one includes the solar units and the storage (heating) tank (Circuit A) and the second one contains the supply (after-heating) tank and the pad (Circuit B). The first days are the most critical in a piglet’s life. Up to 80 % of piglet losses occur in the first 3 days of life and the majority of deaths are attributed to crushing. To reduce piglet losses by crushing by the sow the nest area must be warm. However, because of economic and hygienic disadvantages, straw is becoming less and the modern practice is to use either electric or gas infrared heaters, or underground heaters with solid plates. In the first 10 days of life, the young piglets require temperatures of at least 32 - 36 OC in the nest. Infrared heaters with IR-emitter have the highest temperature on the surface directly under the centre of the radiator, and outwards from the centre the temperature drops. An underground heater (warm water heat source) has a homogeneous surface temperature, therefore every piglet of the litter gets the same temperature in the nest area. The flooring in farrowing pens must satisfy a wide variety of criteria. The floor must be durable and easily to clean. The aim of this investigation was to test a new heating system for young piglets and to compare it with the conventional electric heating lamps and the warm water bed. This system incorporates all the benefits of the floor heating systems. In addition the controlled distribution of the solar energy, not only reduces the consumption of the electric energy to the 20 - 25 % of the consumption of the conventional system with infrared lamps, but also provides the specific thermal environment for the weaned piglets as well as to the nursing sown. Using a control system, the fluid temperature is kept close to the desired optimal temperature, in contrast with the conventional halogen and incandescent infrared lamps where the heating is regulated by the distance between the lamp and the piglets. Furthermore, the optimal temperature is regulated to decrease one degree centigrade per day and this means that the electric consumption is decreased as well. ...|$|E
40|$|Peri- and {{postnatal}} survival data, including birth {{weights and}} cross-foster information from two line/farm combinations with 33717 and 29200 piglets, respectively, were analyzed {{to find the}} best genetic model to describe piglet survival. This was done in terms of direct (piglet), maternal and <b>nurse</b> <b>sow</b> genetic effects, maternal to cover uterine quality and <b>nurse</b> <b>sow</b> to cover mothering ability. The two component traits, farrowing and pre-weaning survival and — birth weight, the most important factor for survival — were similarly analyzed. As fixed effects, Year/Season, cross, parity, birth weight in classes of 100 g, litter size as such, and sex were included in the analyses. Models combining the different genetic effects were compared {{on the basis of the}} log-likelihood. A maternal/nurse sow model fitted the data best for pre-weaning survival, a direct/maternal model for birth weight, a direct model for farrowing survival in the dam line and a direct/maternal model for farrowing survival in the sire line. Including <b>nurse</b> <b>sow</b> effect in a model for piglet survival as a whole gave erratic results, making it difficult to define an optimal model. Estimated heritabilities for pre-weaning survival, measured on the binary scale, in the dam line were 0. 02 ± 0. 005 for both maternal and <b>nurse</b> <b>sow</b> effects. Heritabilities for birth weight were, on average for the two lines, 0. 04 ± 0. 01 for the direct effect and 0. 20 ± 0. 03 for the maternal effect.

40|$|Abstract We review {{critical}} {{factors associated with}} reproductive performance of female breeding pigs, their lifetime performance and herd productivity in commercial herds. The factors include both sow-level and herd-level factors. High risk sow-level groups for decreasing reproductive performance of female pigs are low or high parity, increased outdoor temperature, decreased lactation feed intake, single inseminations, increased lactation length, prolonged weaning-to-first-mating interval, low birth weight or low preweaning growth rate, a few pigs born alive at parity 1, an increased number of stillborn piglets, foster-in or <b>nurse</b> <b>sow</b> practices and low or high age at first-mating. Also, returned female pigs are at risk having a recurrence of returning to estrus, and female pigs around farrowing are more at risk of dying. Herd-level risk groups include female pigs being fed in low efficiency breeding herds, late insemination timing, high within-herd variability in pig flow, limited numbers of farrowing spaces and fluctuating age structure. To maximize the reproductive potential of female pigs, producers are recommended to closely monitor females in these high-risk groups and improve herd management.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if using maternal sounds, at a higher frequency, associated with lactation, would indirectly influence milk production by the sow, thus increasing litter weight.

The sounds of the <b>nursing</b> <b>sows</b> were recorded using a video camera, and was reproduced in the farrowing pen using a stereo system. The treatment consisted of reproducing the sound for 3 minutes every 59 or 49 minutes for the first and second phase, respectively. Exposing sows and litters to maternal vocalizations resulted in increased liveweight of the litter. The effect was more evident when the frequency of stimulation was approximately 50 minutes. It was observed that the increase in growth, which has to be mediated by an increase in milk production, was brought about by a temporary increase in feed intake.

Per extra piglet <b>nursed,</b> <b>sows</b> had a 23 % (P < 0. 01) higher probability of a prolonged weaning-to-estrus interval. A higher daily feed intake during lactation reduced tissue loss of the sow, increased litter weight gain (P < 0. 01), and reduced the probability of a prolonged weaning-to-estrus interval (by 42 % per extra kilogram; P < 0. 01). Sows with a lower daily body weight loss during first lactation had a larger second litter (1. 28 piglets/kg; P < 0. 01), and their probability of a prolonged weaning-to-estrus interval was reduced by 61 % per kilogram (P < 0. 001). With increasing litter size, it is therefore recommended to reduce body weight loss during lactation by stimulating daily feed intake and by genetic selection...|$|R
40|$|At {{the time}} of Queen Elizabeth’s {{coronation}} in 1953, diabetes was still relatively uncommon. Inthe young the situation was profoundly depressing. Those whose lives had been saved by insulin in the previous 30 years were now succumbing to blindness, kidney failure and heart attacks for {{which there was no}} treatment. Clinics were poorly organised, patchily distributed and, except in major cities, run by general physicians with no training in the management of chronic disease. Yet, in the five years after the coronation, the seeds of many future advances including the delineation of diabetic angiopathy, photocoagulation and diabetes specialist <b>nurses</b> were <b>sown</b> by pioneers whose work went largely unrecognised at the time.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the associations between hematological parameters at weaning and post-weaning weight gain in piglets. Five well-managed conventional herds of average herd size of 1000 sows were selected. All herds provided a single injectable iron (either i. m. or s. c, 200 mg) supplementation from different commerical products at 3 – 4 days of life. Within each herd, litters belonging to a weekly farrowing batch close to weaning were identified and among them 20 litters were chosen randomly after exclusion of <b>nursing</b> <b>sows.</b> Within each litter, a random piglet was selected. EDTA and non-stabilized blood sample was taken from the anterior Vena cava of each piglet 1 – 3 days before weaning (average weaning age of 25. 7 days) and analyzed by complete hematology including serum iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). The associations between each measured hematological parameter and the average daily gain (ADG) of piglets in a three-week period were tested using PROC MIXED procedure in SAS. A total of 99 piglets were included in the study but 3 were lost during follow up. The average hemoglobin concentration of piglets was 121. 5 ± 15 gl− 1 and the ADG was 202. 9 ± 78. 4 g day− 1. A positive association between hemoglobin and ADG in the three-week period (p= 0. 0003) was observed. Also, red blood cells (p< 0. 0001) and hematocrit (p= 0. 0005) had positive association with ADG while red blood cell distribution width (p= 0. 05), hemoglobin distribution width (p= 0. 04), and reticulocyte red cell distribution width (p= 0. 01) had a negative association with ADG. Hence the results indicate that improved hematological status at weaning is positively correlated to weight gain post-weaning. An increase in 10 g hemoglobin/l blood corresponded to a weight gain improvement of 17. 2 g daily weight gain in the 3 weeks post-weaning period. The strategies for improving the hematological values of piglets at weaning need to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} energy intake during a 21 -day {{lactation}} and from weaning to estrus on sow and litter performance was studied. Lactation treatments {{consisted of two}} energy intakes, either 8 (Low Energy; LE) or 16 (High Energy, HE) Meal of metabolized energy (ME) per sow per day. Lactation diets were equivalent to daily feed intakes of 6 or 12 lb, respectively, of a grain-soybean meal diet. Energy intake from weaning to first estrus was either 5. 5 (LE) or 11 (HE) Meal of ME per sow per day, formulated to approximate feeding of 4 or 8 lb of a grain-soybean meal diet daily. Any sow in estrus by 30 days postweaning was artificially inseminated or hand-mated and fed 4 lb daily of a 14 % grain-soybean meal diet during gestation. Sows remained on the same lactation-post weaning energy intakes during two parities. First and second parity sows fed 8 Meal/day during lactation lost more (P<. 05) weight and backfat during lactation compared to sows fed 16 Mcal of ME/day. Likewise, litters <b>nursing</b> <b>sows</b> fed LE weighed less at weaning. Regardless of lactation treatments, first-parity sows fed 11 Mcal/day from weaning to first estrus gained more backfat (P<. 05) during the first 14 days postweaning and more weight (P<. 01) during the initial 28 days postweaning compared to those fed 5. 5 Meal of ME/day. Slightly fewer first-parity sows fed LE during lactation were in estrus by 7 days postweaning compared to those fed HE. Increasing energy intake from weaning to first estrus {{had no effect on}} percentage of sows exhibiting estrus by 14 days postweaning. These results indicate that increasing the energy intake of first-litter sows during lactation or from weaning to estrus will minimize weight and backfat loss during the feeding period but will not substantially reduce the number of days from weaning to estrus in the first two parities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this field trial was to {{determine}} if maximal care of pigs from birth until 16 d of age would result in a significant alteration in the survivorship and growth performance of the pigs compared with control pigs born in the same time period. Sows were randomly assigned to treatment group prior to farrowing. Control pigs received the standard, commercial farm care. In maximal care litters, pigs were dried off at farrowing, given a rubber mat in the creep area, and given electrolytes, chilled pigs were warmed and given colostrum or glucose, surgical instruments used for processing were dipped into an antiseptic between pigs, the castration wounds were sprayed with iodine, and sows were fed 3 times rather than twice a day. Pigs that received the maximal care weighed 170 g (+/− 80 g) more at 16 d of age than standard care pigs. Factors that reduced weight at 16 d included having a low birth weight, nursing a gilt or a parity 5 – 6 <b>sow,</b> <b>nursing</b> in a large litter, being clinically ill or being lame after 3 d of age, being cross-fostered and <b>nursing</b> an ill <b>sow.</b> In general, maximal care did not reduce mortality. Providing maximal care did improve weaning weights and enabled small birth weight pigs to reach 3. 7 kg at 16 d of age...|$|R
40|$|Piglets that nurse {{anterior}} mammary glands {{grow faster}} than those suckling posterior mammary glands. The underlying mechanisms are not known. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate if there is a difference in composition in colostrum and milk secreted by anterior and posterior mammary glands. Seven healthy sows were used. The first three pairs of mammary glands were defined as anterior mammary glands (AMG) and the rest as posterior mammary glands (PMG). Additionally, the total of 87 born piglets from 7 litters derived from the sows involved in the experiment was analyzed. Piglets from each litter that nursed AMG were defined as AMG group while the rest of piglets from the litter were defined as PMG group. Colostrum and milk were collected at days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after parturition. Samples taken from anterior and posterior mammary glands were pooled, respectively. Results showed that total protein, IGF-I and insulin concentrations were significantly higher in the colostrum of anterior than posterior glands and IGF-I concentration remained significantly higher in milk of anterior compared to posterior glands. There were no significant differences in fat, dry matter and lactose among anterior and posterior glands during all examined periods. Additionally, blood samples from <b>nursing</b> <b>sows</b> were obtained at days 1 and 7 after parturition. Results showed that concentrations of Ca, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin and insulin significantly increased from day 1 to day 7 of parturition while concentrations of P, BUN, CK and IGF-I did not significantly change during this period. Initial body weight of pigs nursing the anterior gland was higher but not significantly that those suckling posterior glands. Pigs that nursed anterior glands gained weight faster then those which suckled posterior glands resulting with significantly higher body weigh of piglets nursing anterior compared to posterior glands at day 8 of neonatal life (p < 0. 05). Therefore, it may be concluded that the priority of anterior glands milk secretion in total protein and grow stimulating factors may have an impact on increased body weight gain of nursing pigs.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} involving 140 pigs {{were conducted}} to evaluate cow colostrum and twice-a-day feeding in artificial rearing of baby pigs. Piglets were allowed to <b>nurse</b> the <b>sow</b> for 15 hours after birth and allotted by litter and weight to milk replacer or milk replacer plus cow colostrum. Piglets were housed in individual wire cages and fed four times on day one, three times on day two, and twice daily days 3 through 21. Dry feed was offered to pigs after day 14. Pigs {{were removed from the}} individual cages and moved to a conventional nursery at 21 days of age. Piglets receiving cow colostrum had improved weight gains and decreased incidence of scours {{during the first week of}} life. Piglets fed cow colostrum had increased livability (98 vs. 91 %) compared to piglets receiving only milk replacer. There was little advantage to feeding cow colostrum after the first week. Piglets raised artificially were similar in weight to sow-reared pigs at 6 weeks of age. These results suggest a practical, inexpensive method of artificially rearing of orphaned or extra baby pigs...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-two pigs {{were used}} to compare the {{oxidation}} rates of uniformly labeled (U- 14 C) palmitic (16 : 0), stearic (18 : 0), oleic (18 : 1) and linoleic (18 : 2) acids in fasting neonatal pigs. The pigs were allowed to <b>nurse</b> the <b>sow</b> for 24 to 48 h following birth. Subsequently, they were removed, an indwelling catheter was surgically placed in the external iliac vein and the pigs were fasted for 12 h to attain a postabsorptive state. The 14 C fatty acids were administered as a single infusion (10 / μCi) via the catheter, and recovery of the label as expired 14 CO 2 was determined at 45 -min intervals for a 6 -h period. Blood samples were taken following the infusion (15, 60, 120, 240, 360 min) to monitor activity maintained within the free fatty acid (FFA) fraction of the plasma pool. The oxidation rate of each fatty acid was corrected for the difference in dose dilution using a uniform factor based on plasma concentration of 18 : 1. The cumulative 6 -h 14 CO 2 recovery rates (percentage of dose) were 19. 1, 6. 6, 30. 1 and 13. 1...|$|R
