5000|$|Because of {{the strong}} {{influence}} of Western European music, present-day performers of Georgian folk music often employ Western tuning, bringing the seconds, fourths, sixths, and sevenths, and sometimes the thirds as well, closer to the standard equally tempered scale. This process started {{from the very first}} professional choir, organized in Georgia in 1886 (so called [...] "Agniahsvili choro"). From the 1980s some ensembles (most notably the Georgian ensembles [...] "Mtiebi" [...] and [...] "Anchiskhati", and the American ensemble Kavkasia) have tried to re-introduce the original <b>non-tempered</b> traditional tuning system. In some regions (most notably in Svaneti) some traditional singers still sing in the old, <b>non-tempered</b> tuning system.|$|E

Buckwheat (the name Wheat used in later life) and his Sausalito, California roommate Bill Loughborough, a musician and electronic engineer, built instruments for Partch, such as a marimba played with a large soft mallet over the resonator, delivering barely audible, low-Hertz tones. Loughborough borrowed diagnostic and metric instruments from the Mare Island Navy Yard; using an oscilloscope and audio oscillator, {{they were able to}} work at a technical level not previously possible. Together they moved onto a Sausalito barge with Jak Simpson, who in 1954 founded a business named the [...] "Boobam Bamboo Drum Company". Wheat, who was also working on the President Lines cruises to the Orient as a bass player, would buy large-diameter giant bamboo in the Philippines and bring them back on the ship to build the South Pacific Island bamboo drums, which they manufactured in Mill Valley, California, as Boobam's, ('bam' and 'boo' switched around). The drums fascinated several jazz groups, which added them to their percussion sections. In 1956, Chet Baker's Ensemble used them to perform on the Today Show.|$|E

40|$|Escalating {{environmental}} concerns have prompted {{efforts to reduce}} vehicle weight and carbon emissions, resulting in increased application of advanced high strength steels (AHSS). 22 MnB 5 hot stamping grade AHSS, namely USIBOR 1500 P, provide high strength to weight ratio allowing sheet thickness reduction to decrease weight, while maintaining high safety characteristics. Resistance spot welding (RSW) has been the predominant welding process for automotive assemblies. Welding hot-stamping AHSS has introduced new challenges for achieving acceptable welds. The added alloying elements and high hardenability characteristics resulting in low weldability and weld toughness complicates this initiative. The current study examines the effects of in-process weld tempering with secondary current pulse has on the weld toughness during RSW of USIBOR steels. RSW and weld tempering were tested on USIBOR at two different surface conditions; as-delivered and hot-stamped.

40|$|Cocoa butter (CB) is the {{predominant}} continuous phase in chocolate systems {{and has a}} significant impact on the macroscopic properties of the end product. Conventional methods such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (pNMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and polarized light microscopy (PLM) have been used to study CB crystallization primarily in bulk. Potential of alternative techniques to study crystallization such as Raman spectroscopy and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been explored. The main objective of this thesis research was to study the feasibility of both conventional and alternative techniques to study CB crystallization in different matrices and in tempered conditions. Bulk fat (CB with 1 %, 5 % or without lecithin), suspensions (CB with 1 % lecithin (on fat basis) and sucrose or inulin) and chocolates were sampled as such (<b>non-tempered</b> systems) subjected to a laboratory scale tempering procedure to produce tempered systems. Both <b>non-tempered</b> and tempered products were subjected to DSC, NMR, XRD, PLM, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR and diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS), in which primary crystallization was monitored or long-term storage was assessed. A toolbox was developed comprising feasibility of complementary techniques and, moreover, the toolbox was used to study the effect of lecithin and bulking materials on the CB crystallization behavior. The tempering procedure was successfully validated for every sample, as proven by the melting profile at 6 hours through DSC. The determination of the solid fat content (SFC) from the raw free induction decay signal by NMR showed to be more useful than the scripted SFC, especially for bulk fat systems. XRD showed its feasibility to study fat polymorphism for both bulk matrices and suspensions, except when sucrose is present, due to its interference in short spacings. PLM could only be used for <b>non-tempered</b> bulk fat systems since in other systems sample preparation cannot be standardized to measure crystallinity. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy seemed to be useful complementary techniques and capable of differentiating polymorphic forms, as is also possible using XRD. DWS showed to be comparable with DSC with an additional improved deconvolution of crystallization peaks.
