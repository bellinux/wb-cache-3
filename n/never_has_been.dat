25|$|The {{layout of}} the gojūon table {{promotes}} a systematic view of kana syllabograms as being always pronounced with the same single consonant followed by a vowel, {{but this is not}} exactly the case (and <b>never</b> <b>has</b> <b>been).</b> Existing schemes for the romanization of Japanese either are based on the systematic nature of the script, e.g. nihon-siki チ ti, or they apply some Western graphotactics, usually the English one, to the common Japanese pronunciation of the kana signs, e.g. Hepburn-shiki チ chi. Both approaches conceal the fact, though, that many consonant-based katakana signs, especially those canonically ending in u, can be used in coda position, too, where the vowel is unvoiced and therefore barely perceptible.|$|E

Adjusted and unadjusted for inflation, it beat Star Trek: First Contact for the largest American opening for a Star Trek film.

Star Trek ended its United States theatrical run on October 1, 2009, with a box office total of $257,730,019, which places it as the seventh highest-grossing film for 2009 behind The Hangover. The film grossed $127,764,536 in international markets, for a total worldwide gross of $385,494,555. While foreign grosses represent only 31% of the total box office receipts, executives of Paramount were happy with the international sales, as Star Trek historically was a movie franchise that <b>never</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a big draw overseas.|$|E
500|$|The film, which premiered in Los Angeles at the Carthay Circle Theatre, was {{the first}} musical film in history for which one of its cast members won an Academy Award. Luise Rainer {{received}} the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Ziegfeld's first wife, Anna Held. The film, the pride of MGM {{at a time when}} Warner Brothers and RKO Pictures were the leading studios in Hollywood for musical production, was a major commercial and critical success {{and one of the most}} successful films of the 1930s, grossing US$4,673,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) worldwide at the box office. It was acclaimed upon release as the greatest musical biography to be made in Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. At just short of three hours, The Great Ziegfeld was also the longest talking film of the time. (D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance, both silent films, had each run over three hours.) TCM has acclaimed the [...] "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" [...] sequence as one of [...] "the most famous musical numbers ever filmed". Thomas S. Hischak has said that the film has rarely been topped for pure showmanship and glamor, [...] and Variety considered it an [...] "outstanding picture", a [...] "symbol of a tradition of show business". Variety praised the performances of the cast, remarking that as Ziegfeld, William Powell [...] "endows the impersonation with all the qualities of a great entrepreneur and sentimentalist without sacrificing the shades and moods called for" [...] and noting that Luise Rainer is [...] "tops of the femmes with her vivacious Anna Held". Stanley Green cited The Great Ziegfeld as [...] "the first of a number of elaborate show-business screen biographies". Otis Ferguson, writing for New Republic magazine, remarked that the [...] "musical numbers seem as irresistible as Ziegfeld himself". The New York American said that the film is [...] "pretty nearly everything such an extravaganza should be", with [...] "romance and reality, song and dance, gaiety and beauty, pathos and bathos". Time magazine qualified it as [...] "Pretentious, packed with hokum and as richly sentimental as an Irving Berlin lyric, it is, as such, top-notch entertainment." [...] A reviewer for the Spokane Chronicle praised the film for its superb acting, writing that [...] " [...] the great producer [...] would have been unable to produce scenes of magnitude and splendor that are given as part of the picture telling his life." [...] Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times was also highly praising of the film, noting that it had [...] "more stars than there are in the heavens" [...] and remarking that [...] "the picture achieves its best moments in the larger sequences devoted to the Girls — ballet, chorus and show. At least one of these spectacular numbers, filmed to the music of Irving Berlin's [...] "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody", with overtones of [...] "Rhapsody in Blue", <b>never</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> equaled on the musical comedy stage or screen." [...] John Mosher of The New Yorker called it [...] "the most lavish display the screen has had to offer" [...] with chorus numbers that were [...] "gigantic and effective", though he found the romance to be [...] "peculiarly average screen-story stuff." [...] Both The New York Times and Film Daily rated the film in the [...] "Ten Best" [...] of the year.|$|E
