40|$|The {{population}} in SR Serbia {{is in the}} third phase of deagrarianization as seen by the sudden decrease of farmers, deformation of the age and sex structure and the sharp fall of the natural increase. The excess of men, especially middle age men, {{and the absence of}} an ageing process are the main characteristics of the non- -farming population. In contrast, the farming population has an excess of women, mainly older women, with a very progressive ageing process. The mortality rate of farmers is higher, while the fertility rate is significantly lower than the remaining population. Because of the complementary structure of the farming and <b>non-farming</b> <b>population</b> one way heterogamy is very widespread: farm girls marry non-farm boys. Because of the difference in age structure, the active farming population is considerably older while the percentage of women in the active farming population is higher. The autonomous region of Kosovo has undergone the least amount of deagrarianization — the farming population continues to grow. The very high natural increase, mearly equal in the farming and <b>non-farming</b> <b>population,</b> represents a demographic brake for deagrarianization among the Kosovo population. The age and sex structure of the farming and <b>non-farming</b> <b>population</b> in Kosovo is equal. It is of a progressive type an excess of men. The difference between the age and sex structure of the farming and <b>non-farming</b> <b>population</b> is the greatest in Serbia proper. The process of deagrarianization has affected the low natural increase among the farmers. The autonomous region of Vojvodina has the least amount of farmers, the oldest population and an excess of women. However some characteristic differences between the farmers and non-farmers are less noted in Vojvodina than in Serbia proper. One may conclude that the early process of deagrarization disturbs the relatively homogenous structure of the agrarian population. Later, however, the demographic and social differences between farmers and non-farmers decrease. Differences in the activity level of the male {{population in}} the three regions of Serbia, which vary is development, can be explained by the: a) age structure b) ratio between farming and <b>non-farming</b> <b>population</b> and c) relationship between growth and activity. However sharp differences between the active female population in the three regions of Serbia are neither associated with the age structure nor with the ratio between the farming and <b>non-farming</b> <b>population,</b> but rather are conditioned by specific social and cultural factors...|$|E

It was found that British colonial capitalism had structurally transmuted the indigenous farmers’ lifeways: they now became small-scale subsistence farmers vis-à-vis the colonial large-scale commercial planters. This newly acquired inferior status justified the discrimination and marginalisation of the Malay farmers by the colonial administration as witnessed their agricultural land, financial and R&D development policies. Yet, against all these odds the small-scale Malay farmers had proven their resillience. As rice cultivators and coconut smallholders they managed to feed the entire <b>non-farming</b> <b>population</b> of the colony. As rubber smallholders they managed to compete with the privileged colonial planters.

40|$|During the {{production}} of agricultural commodities, an agricultural landscape is simultaneously being produced. In many regions, agriculture is no longer valued for just {{the production}} of food and fibre {{but also for the}} social, cultural and environmental amenities associated with the landscape. The paradigm of multifunctional agriculture has become concerned with the joint production of agricultural products and these rural amenities. The loss of agricultural land especially in areas around the urban-rural fringe has greatly affected the demand for these rural amenities. In response, governments and volunteer organizations have developed programs to preserve farmland. The Niagara Region is home to some of the best fruit growing land in Canada but {{has a long history of}} fighting to maintain its farmland. Drawing from the multifunctional paradigm, this study analyzes the preference for different rural amenities and farmland preservation in this unique region.

5000|$|The farm {{population}} shrank steadily {{as families}} moved to urban areas, where on average {{they were more}} productive and earned {{a higher standard of}} living. [...] Friedberger argues that the postwar period saw an accelerating mechanization of agriculture, combined with new and better fertilizers and genetic manipulation of hybrid corn. It made for greater specialization and greater economic risks for the farmer. With rising land prices many sold their land and moved to town, the old farm becoming part of a neighbor's enlarged operation. Mechanization meant less need for hired labor; farmers could operate more acres even though they were older. The result was a decline in rural-farm population, with gains in service centers that provided the new technology. The rural <b>non-farm</b> <b>population</b> grew as factories were attracted by access to good transportation without the high land costs, taxes, unionization and congestion of city factory districts. Once remote rural areas such as the Missouri Ozarks and the North Woods of the upper Midwest, with a rustic life style and many good fishing spots, attracted retirees and vacationers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Local governments at {{the urban}} fringe are {{increasingly}} “downzoning”. Downzoning is {{the exercise of}} police power to reduce the legally permitted density on undeveloped land in a community. This practice is typically challenged by those who perceive the action to limit their market opportunities (e. g., farmers and developers), but supported by others who perceive positive benefits (e. g., environmentalists, conservationists, and homeowners). Proponents may prefer downzoning {{as a supplement to}} other preservation techniques, based on concerns over the growing public costs of land acquisition and the perceived urgency to act to manage growth. This paper conceptualizes the public decision-making process that leads to downzoning, specifies an analogous empirical public choice model, and tests its efficacy using a New Jersey case study. The probability of downzoning is found to increase with the amount of open space that remains to be protected, declining farm population, recent growth in <b>non-farm</b> <b>population</b> and land values, and the presence of alternative growth management tools. Results suggest that decision-makers choose downzoning due to concerns over the affordability of other preservation options, such as purchase of development rights programs. Given the direction of causal factors, the prevalence of downzoning is expected to increase as the ability of communities to affor...|$|R
40|$|Available data on {{per head}} incomes in {{agriculture}} {{to those in}} the rest of economy show that in almost all countries, with very few exceptions, per head incomes in agriculture are lower than those on other occupations. Since such disparity exists in the USA too, the subject of the study is the analysis of the relation between agricultural and non-agricultural incomes and of the causes of income disparity. The analysis leads {{to the conclusion that the}} narrowing of the gap between the incomes per head of farm and <b>non-farm</b> <b>population</b> is due to the growing off-farm incomes received by the farm population. The disparity between incomes from farming and from non-farm sources has not yet disappeared. The main cause of income disparity is not the difference in productivity in agriculture and in the rest of the economy, but the unfavourable tendencies in the level of prices received and paid by the farmers. Since one of the principal aims of the American agricultural policy is the rise of agricultural incomes level and the narrowing of the disparity between incomes received from farming and from other occupations, it can by said, that in this respect the American agricultural policy appears ineffective.

40|$|As the {{proportion}} of farm family incomedue to nonfarm sources continues to grow nationally, {{it is important to}} understand how farm families in various regions or states are affected. This paper develops a better understanding of the contribution of income from nonfarm sources to the level and distribution of income among farm families in New York. In analyzing income distribution, the Gini ratio is decomposed to determine the effects of marginal changes in income by source to overall inequality. The results are compared with the simulated changes in income inequality due to changes in income by source as measured by an “adjusted ” Gini ratio which accounts specifically for negative farm incomes. Differences in the policy implications from both procedures are compared. The relationships among sources of income and policy implications can be brought into sharper focus by examining both measures Nonfarm sectors of the rural economy are inextri-cably tied to agriculture through input and output markets and as a source of employment for dis-placed agricultural labor. Families remaining in ag-riculture also depend increasingly on nonfarm sources of income. Nationally, about one-third of farm family income was from nonfarm sources in the 1950 s; about 6070 of farm family income now comes from nonfarm sources. Incomes of farm families rose from 50 % to 80 % of that of the <b>non-farm</b> <b>population</b> between the 1950 s and the 1980 s (U. S. Department of Agriculture 1986; Johnson...|$|R
40|$|Farmers, {{large and}} small, and the <b>non-farm</b> <b>population</b> {{in rural areas}} all suffer from the {{liquidity}} constraint. Credit is needed to acquire command {{over the use of}} working capital, fixed capital, and consumption goods. The Green Revolution technologies have increased the credit requirement for modern inputs and farm investment. A new expanded role of rural credit institutions has emerged {{in the wake of the}} technology revolution in rural areas. Two distinct approaches have been used to provide the financial services to the rural poor. The most widely favoured approach in the past was the use of subsidised interest rates with a portion of credit reserved for the poor. The low interest policy was based on the premise that it would induce farmers, large and small, to use modern inputs on a larger scale. One of the adverse side-effect of this policy was the introduction of an element of financial unsustainability in the loan portfolios of the credit institutions. The recent view about the delivery of rural credit consists of using market interest rates and using a mixture of 'bottom-up initiatives' at the local level, using non-government groups and 'top-down initiatives' by the formal credit institutions in terms of the simplification of the procedures and decentralisation of the credit operation for credit supply to the rural poor. In this paper, an attempt is made to evaluate the efficacy of these two approaches in the case of Pakistan for delivering credit to the rural poor. ...|$|R

However, {{virtually all of the}} claims identified in that research resulted from incidents that occurred in areas with predominantly agricultural land use. With recent increases in the rural <b>non-farm</b> <b>population,</b> many traditionally urban problems are also appearing in built-up areas under county jurisdiction. This trend is expected to continue so that counties must anticipate a change {{in the nature of the}} tort claims they will encounter. Problems that heretofore have been unique to cities may become commonplace in areas for which counties are responsible. The research reported here has been directed toward an investigation of those problems in rural subdivisions that lead to claims growing out of the provision of highway services by counties. Lacking a sufficient database among counties for the types of tort claims of interest in this research, a survey was sent to 259 cities in Iowa in order to identify highway related problems leading to those claims. The survey covered claims during a five year period from 1975 to 1980. Over one-third of the claims reported were based on alleged street defects. Another 34 percent of the claims contained allegations of damages due to backup of sanitary sewers or defects in sidewalks.

40|$|Rural {{areas of}} the world are {{developing}} and implementing tourism programs to diversify and reinvigorate their local economies. Often, these programs focus on privately-held lands in largely agricultural regions. In some countries, tourism development strategies have combined agriculture and tourism to create a new industry – agritourism. This industry, although not new in the United States, is still in its nascent stages. Before starting an agritourism enterprise, farmers and ranchers must consider the various factors that will likely influence their potential for long-term success. These factors can be grouped into 1) farm-specific factors such as an operator’s personality or the aesthetic qualities of the individual farmstead and 2) location-based factors such as a proximity to a city or nearness to a major road. The research on agritourism is relatively sparse and most studies have focused on only the farm-specific factors of agritourism potential; relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} the geospatial dimensions of this industry. This thesis addresses this shortcoming in the literature by developing a GIS-based model that maps the spatial distribution of agritourism potential, using the state of Nebraska as a case study. Through regression and histogram analysis of existing agritourism operations, four critical location-based variables were determined to be especially important for assessing the potential for agritourism: proximity to rivers, proximity to roads, vegetative variety, and <b>non-farm</b> <b>population.</b> The variables were combined in a GIS using a linear combination model to produce maps portraying agritourism potential in Nebraska. The maps generated with this GIS-based model can be used by farmers and ranchers considering starting an agritourism enterprise on their farm or by state-wide economic and tourism development entities looking to make strategic investments in the state’s tourism infrastructure.

40|$|Data from {{measurements}} {{on the body}} burden Of (CS) -C- 134, Cs- 137 and K- 40 in various Swedish populations between 1959 and 2001 has been compiled into a national database. The compilation is a co-operation between the Departments of Radiation Physics in Malmo and Goteborg, the National Radiation Protection Authority (SSI) and the Swedish Defense Research Agency (FOI). In a previous study the effective ecological half time and the associated effective dose to various Swedish populations due to internal contamination of Cs- 134 and Cs- 137 have been assessed using the database. In this study values of human body burden have been combined with data on the local and regional ground deposition of fallout from nuclear weapons tests (only Cs- 137) and Chernobyl debris (both Cs- 134 and (CS) -C- 137), which have enabled estimates of the radioecological transfer in the studied populations. The assessment of the database shows that the transfer of radiocesium from Chernobyl fallout to humans varies considerably between various populations in Sweden. In terms of committed effective dose over a 70 y period from internal contamination per unit activity deposition, the general (predominantly urban) Swedish population obtains 20 - 30 mu Sv/kBq m(- 2). Four categories of populations exhibit higher radioecological transfer than the general population; i.) reindeer herders (similar to 700 mu Sv/kBq m(- 2)), ii.) hunters in the counties dominated by forest vegetation (similar to 100 mu Sv/kBq m(- 2)), iii.) rural <b>non-farming</b> <b>populations</b> living in sub-arctic areas (40 - 150 mu Sv/kBq m(- 2)), and iv.) farmers (similar to 50 mu Sv/kBq m(- 2)). Two important factors determine the aggregate transfer from ground deposition to man; i.) dietary habits (intakes of foodstuff originating from natural and semi-natural ecosystems), and ii.) inclination to follow the recommended food restriction by the authorities. The transfer {{to the general population}} is considerably lower (similar to a factor of 3) for the Chernobyl fallout than during the 1960 s and 70 s, which is partly explained by a higher awareness of the pathways of radiocaesium to man both by the public and by the regulating authorities, and by the time-pattern of the nuclear weapons fallout during the growth season in Sweden.

40|$|Background: Asthma {{severity}} {{indicators and}} their risk factors are understudied in the farming and <b>non-farming</b> <b>populations.</b> Further study is needed. Our {{objective was to}} evaluate rural exposures and pulmonary function in a rural pediatric population and their relationships. Methods: For this study, data from the Saskatchewan Rural Health Study (SRHS) child component was used. SRHS is a population-based study, conducted in 2011, evaluating the health of rural dwelling residents {{in the province of}} Saskatchewan, Canada. The SRHS is designed as a cohort study. However, the data used for this analysis is from the baseline data collection. The initial data collected included a parent-completed survey questionnaire answered on behalf of the child. From this study sample, a subset of children (6 - 14 years old) was selected to participate in clinical testing, which included anthropometric measures and pulmonary function testing (PFT) using spirometry (n= 584). PFTs followed ATS criteria and all statistical analyses were controlled for child age, sex, and height. Results: Among children participating in the clinical testing, 47. 5 % were female and 54. 5 % lived on a farm. Of those living on farms, 77. 5 % were livestock farms. The mean percent predicted value (PPV) for Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) among those living on the farm were 104. 8 % and 105. 4 %, respectively while the mean PPV for FEV 1 and FVC among the non-farm dwellers were 102. 7 % and 101. 4 %, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders using linear regression, higher FEV 1 (p= 0. 03) and FVC (p= 0. 006) were seen among farm dwelling children while there was a trend towards lower FEV 1 /FVC ratio (p= 0. 09) among farm dwellers compared to non-farm dwellers. Higher FVC and lower FEV 1 /FVC ratio were also seen with children who regularly emptied grain bins (p< 0. 05). Trends towards a higher FEV 1 (p= 0. 14) and FVC (p= 0. 08) were also seen with children living on a farm {{in the first year of}} life. Conclusion: Differences in lung function were seen between farm and non-farm rural dwelling children and certain farming activities, specifically, emptying grain bins. Despite a higher FEV 1 and FVC among farm dwellers, the FEV 1 /FVC ratio was lower compared to non-farm dwellers. A trend towards a higher FEV 1 and FVC was also seen with living on a farm in the first year of life suggesting that differences in lung function seen in farm dwelling children may not be purely due to reverse causality...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the {{developed}} world, {{the share of}} agriculture in total income of the rural population is declining. This is due to push and pull factors. On one hand, terms of trade of agriculture are falling and farmers are forced to seek additional income sources. On the other hand, population expansion in rural areas, including {{an important component of}} urban-to-rural migration, creates attractive opportunities for alternative income-generating activities. The question is whether agriculture is good or bad for rural well-being. Are communities with more agriculture composed of stronger farms that enhance economic well-being, or perhaps more agriculture means lack of alternatives, in which case the outcome is the opposite? The answer has important implications for agricultural and rural policy. This paper attempts to answer this question in the context of Israeli Moshav semi-cooperative villages. These villages were established by farmers but have experienced a rising trend of exodus from farming in recent years and an inflow of <b>non-farm</b> <b>population.</b> We use village-level data derived from Censuses of Population and Censuses of Agriculture to study three complementary measures of well-being: income per-capita, housing spaciousness, and automobile ownership. We estimate a recursive system of simultaneous equations in which housing spaciousness and automobile ownership depend on income per-capita. The fraction of agriculture in total income in each village is the central explanatory variable. We also use explanatory variables representing demographic and economic characteristics of the villages, as well as geographic location and institutional affiliation. The results show that agriculture has a significantly negative effect on income per-capita. Income per-capita is also affected positively by the fraction of the population in the labor force, by the fraction of self-employed, and by the fraction of the population holding academic degrees. It is affected negatively by the distance from Tel-Aviv (the economic center of the country). Housing spaciousness and automobile ownership are affected positively by income per-capita. Holding income per-capita constant, housing spaciousness and automobile ownership are affected positively by the importance of agriculture. Housing spaciousness is also affected positively by median age in the village and the dependency ration, and negatively by household size. Automobile ownership is affected positively by household size and negatively by the dependency ratio. We conclude that rural communities that rely more heavily on agriculture are worse off in terms of income per-capita, but this adverse effect on well-being is partially offset by opposite results with respect to housing spaciousness and automobile ownership. The decline of agriculture is clearly not fully compensated by alternative sources of income. Provided that the global decline of agriculture will continue, the challenge of the authorities is to promote sufficiently attractive employment opportunities in rural areas that will smooth the occupational migration out of farming and prevent rural poverty.

40|$|Background : Atrazine is an {{agricultural}} herbicide used extensively in corn production worldwide. Atrazine is an endocrine disruptor {{and has been}} linked to many other deleterious health outcomes. Exposure assessment studies have been carried out in Iowa among farm and <b>non-farm</b> <b>populations.</b> However, commercial pesticide applicators have been left out of those studies. Atrazine is also used in developing countries in grain production. In developing countries there is great concern about acute pesticide poisonings, but chronic exposure to less acutely toxic pesticides has not been studied extensively. This study assessed the in-home contamination of atrazine among commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and then quantitatively analyzed these results with results from similar studies. Occupational inhalation exposure to atrazine was also assessed in Honduras. Methods : Dust samples were taken from 29 commercial pesticide applicator households in four different locations. This sampling was done once during the atrazine application season and again six months later during winter months to assess atrazine persistence. Occupational and household characteristics were analyzed for associations with atrazine dust levels. Data from two previous studies that analyzed farm and non-farm household dust samples for atrazine were combined with data from the commercial applicator 2 ̆ 7 s homes. This new and larger dataset was analyzed to identify which population has the greatest risk for take-home atrazine exposure and what determinants were associated with in-home atrazine dust levels. Lastly, corn production practices in Honduras were evaluated and personal air samples were taken from pesticide applicators during atrazine application to assess inhalation exposure. Results : The first study found that atrazine levels persist into the winter months in the homes of commercial applicators. Atrazine handling (days, pounds, and acres sprayed) were all positively associated with in-home atrazine levels. Commercial applicators that change their shoes inside had higher atrazine levels. More frequent floor cleaning was associated with lower atrazine levels. The second study identified commercial applicators 2 ̆ 7 homes as the most contaminated compared with farmers who apply atrazine to their own land, farmers who hire out atrazine application, and non-farm homes. Farmers that apply their own atrazine also had significantly higher atrazine levels in their homes. The association between atrazine handling and household atrazine levels was highly significant in this study (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). In Honduras, atrazine is applied to corn fields with tractor/boom equipment and manual backpack sprayers. Despite applying about one-fifteenth the amount of atrazine, backpack sprayers are exposed to nearly equal amounts of atrazine via inhalation exposure and likely have greater exposure via the dermal route. Among backpack sprayers, which type of spray nozzle used is associated with inhalation exposure. Among tractor/boom applicators, tractor drivers have much lower inhalation exposure than workers who operate and observe the boom. Conclusions : The amount of atrazine handled is the most important determinant for predicting in-home atrazine levels in Iowa. Ubiquitous atrazine contamination and its distribution within homes and among household type provide strong evidence for the take-home pathway. While some improvements have been made in Honduras regarding pesticide application, poor farm workers and small farmers still use antiquated pesticide application techniques which leads to a higher risk of inhalation and dermal exposure...|$|R

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2, 308 adults (age 20 - 72 years). A pulmonary function test was performed measuring pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC and MMEF. Spatial exposure was assessed as 1) number of farms within 500 m and 1, 000 m of the home, 2) distance to the nearest farm, and 3) modelled annual average fine dust emissions from farms within 500 m and 1, 000 m of the home address. Temporal exposure was assessed as week-average ambient PM 10 and ammonia (NH 3) concentrations prior to lung function measurements. Data were analyzed with generalized additive models (smoothing). Results: A negative association {{was found between the}} number of livestock farms within a 1, 000 m buffer from the home address and MMEF, which was more pronounced in non-atopic participants. No associations were found with other spatial exposure variables. Week-average PM 10 and NH 3 levels were negatively associated with FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC and MMEF. In a two-pollutant model, only NH 3 remained associated. A 25 µg/m 3 increase in NH 3 was associated with a 2. 22 % lower FEV 1 (95 %CI - 3. 69 to - 0. 74), FEV 1 /FVC: - 1. 12 % (- 1. 96 to - 0. 28) and MMEF: - 5. 67 % (- 8. 80 to - 2. 55).

The average enrollment in the one-room rural schools of the state in 1932 - 33 was only 15. 8 students; the average daily attendance was 12. 6. These ungraded rural schools of the state enrolled 29 percent of the entire number of pupils but employed 38 percent of the teachers. The first class cities, on the other hand, enrolled 23 percent of the pupils of the state but employed only 16 percent of the teachers. The town and consolidated schools, as a rule, also have small total enrollments and small enrollments per teacher. Before the depression the average salary of teachers of one-room rural schools in Iowa was 722 per year, while that of city elementary teachers was 1, 573 per year. When the depression brought a demand for reducing expenses, the rural teacher 2 ̆ 7 s wage was cut approximately 35 percent, to 465 per year, and the city elementary teacher 2 ̆ 7 s wage was reduced 19 percent, to 1, 271 per year. From the foregoing it follows that rural people, in general, may have only teachers of inferior training for their children. Yet, in many instances, the per-pupil cost of such instruction is actually higher than that in the elementary grades of city schools; and it appears, on the whole, that there is no great difference in the per-pupil cost of elementary instruction in the two types of schools. This condition clearly reveals the handicap which children face who are born and reared in the country. Moreover a disadvantage also seems to have fallen upon their parents, whose per capita income, even in normal times, is apparently not more than half of that of the <b>non-farm</b> <b>population.</b> Not only must they accept inferior educational opportunities for their children, but they must pay for such facilities a sum more than twice as much, in relation to their incomes, as that paid by people not living in the country. So far no satisfactory solution has been suggested for the problem of how to provide education for rural children that is equal in quality to that which is generally available to the non-farm children of Iowa. Yet with the establishment of the many graded school systems during the past 3 or 4 decades, and with the more recent improvement of the roads of the state, it has seemed that an acceptable solution was gradually becoming possible. In fact, for some time there has been reason to believe that not nearly all of the one-room schools being maintained in Iowa are really needed; many children attending a considerable number of them apparently could be transported to nearby graded school systems and educated at a total cost actually no greater than that being paid at present, provided the patrons of such one-room schools desired to do so. lf arrangements could be made, therefore, whereby the rural and non-rural children of Iowa would attend the same schools they would enjoy more nearly equal educational advantages and opportunities. To remove the present educational handicap of all rural children of Iowa in this manner, however, would entail a considerable increase in educational costs. 1 For how many of them it might be removed without additional cost has been determined for a considerable part of the state in connection with an investigation, the results of which are reported in the following pages. Nothing presented in this bulletin, however, suggests any changes in the existing school systems, other than those which would and could at present be taken purely upon local initiative...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tracks the}} {{economic}} status of American Jewry {{over the past}} three centuries. It relies on qualitative material in the early period and quantitative data since 1890. The primary focus is on the occupational status of Jewish men and women, compared to non-Jews, with additional analyses of earnings, self-employment, and wealth. The Jews in Colonial America, many of Sephardic origin, disproportionately lived in the east coast seaports and were engaged in international trade and finance. The mid- 19 th century German Jewish immigrants settled throughout the country; often beginning as itinerant peddlers, they advanced to small businesses, and some to not so small businesses in the retail trade. The Yiddish-speaking Eastern European and Russian Jewish immigrants, who arrived primarily in the four decades starting in 1881, are the ancestors of most contemporary American Jews. Starting in operative, craft and laborer jobs in small scale manufacturing or in retail trade in the northern and midwestern industrial cities, they experienced rapid economic advancement. Over the course of the 20 th century their descendants achieved very impressive improvements in earnings and occupational status, attaining significantly higher levels than those of the non-Jewish white population. By the year 2000, 53 percent of Jewish men compared to 20 percent of white non-Jewish men were in professional occupations. Among working women in 2000, 51 percent of the Jewish women and 28 percent of non-Jewish white women were in professional jobs. Differences by gender were smaller than differences by religion. Other determinants of earnings the same, including schooling, American Jewish men earned about 16 percent more than other white men, an advantage that is about 8 percent when major occupational group is also held constant. American Jews, from the earliest period to the present, have had high rates of self-employment compared to the <b>non-farm</b> white <b>population</b> of the United States. The nature of this self-employment has changed over time, and currently includes many self-employed professionals. The high level of human wealth of contemporary American Jews is not at the expense of non-human wealth. Overall, and even when other variables including schooling are held constant, Jews have higher levels of wealth and higher rates of wealth accumulation than other religious groups. In summary, over the 350 years since the first Jews settled in what is now the United States, American Jews have consistently demonstrated a very high level of economic achievement. Jews, immigrants, occupations, earnings, self-employment, wealth...|$|R
40|$|Farm {{statistics}} are regularly {{quoted in the}} press and in policy circles, often in misleading ways. This, in turn, can easily lead to mistaken policies. Two examples of misleading statistical presentation include the common refrain that farm incomes are now higher than non-farm incomes, so there is little justification, from either an equity or a social justice perspective, for funding farm programs. Another is the oft-quoted statement that 60 % of farmers and ranchers never get any government support at all (Environmental Working Group 2004). It is not just the press and advocacy organizations that present data in misleading ways. Noted agricultural economist Bruce Gardner, in a recent New York Times article, argued that small family farms were thriving. He cited the slowed rates of farm loss and the growth of “non-traditional” small farms sustained by off-farm income. As he noted, 90 % of farm household income is from off-farm sources, and as a result farmers now enjoy living standards above the national average (Gardner 2005). All of the above statements are true – and truly misleading. The same data present a very different story when treated more carefully. Small and mid-sized full-time family farms have incomes at or below the national average, and less than half of that income is from their full-time-farming activities. A large majority of this group, which accounts for over three-quarters of full-time farmers, receives government farm-support payments of some sort, and many depend on them to stay above the poverty line and to stay in farming. The largest group of farms in the United States today are so-called “rural residence farms,” which are indeed thriving as Gardner points out, but are doing so primarily because they are part-time operations with ample outside sources of income, from retirement or from full-time non-farm careers. This paper is intended to both highlight some of the common errors in depicting the farm sector and present a more accurate image of family farming in the United States. Based on readily available data from the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, I identify six common errors: 1. Including “Rural Residence Farms,” which represent two-thirds of all U. S. farms but do not farm for a living, in the totals for the farm sector. This leads to the misleading statement that a minority of farms get farm payments. A minority of part-time farmers gets payments, but a significant majority of full-time commercial and family farmers receives farm payments. 1 Comments and other correspondence may be directed to tim. wise@tufts. edu. 2 GDAE Working Paper No. 05 - 02 : Understanding the Farm Problem 2. Using averages for the farm sector as a whole when presenting income data. The accurate but misleading statement that average farm household income is 18 % higher than that of the <b>non-farm</b> <b>population</b> is rooted in this error. Some 56 % of full-time farmers sell less than $ 100, 000 a year and have average incomes only 86 % of the U. S. average. 3. Including non-farm income in analyses of farm programs. Family farm households rely heavily on off-farm income to keep their households solvent, getting more than half their incomes from off-farm activities. On the farm they are squeezed between low prices for their products and rising prices for their inputs. 4. Ignoring the impact of land ownership. Farm payments are presented as going to the farmers themselves, but some go to landowners who do not farm the land. Roughly 45 % of U. S. farm land is cultivated by operators who do not own the land. 5. Viewing the skewed distribution of farm payments in isolation from the structure of the farm sector itself. Farm payments historically have been based on production, and some still are. Others are based on acreage. Payments are mainly skewed because land and production are highly skewed. To the extent payments remain tied to either production or land ownership, they will continue to go disproportionately to the wealthiest farmers. 6. Presenting farm subsidies as going unfairly to the top 10 %- 20 % of farmers, who don’t need it. Payments are highly concentrated, but the average full-time family farmer, with income around the national average, finds herself in the top 13 percent of payment recipients with modest payments of under $ 18, 000. The most widely used data on individual recipients is misleading: Nearly half of the top 20 subsidy recipients in 2003 went to cooperatives, Indian tribes, and conservation trusts, and the rest went to corporations, not family-owned farms. Again, the data presented here are readily available. Hopefully, this paper will contribute to a more accurate depiction of the family farm sector and the problems it faces, and to a more grounded discussion of the policy reforms that are desperately needed in U. S. farm programs. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{providing a}} depth analysis of {{total factor productivity}} in Vietnamese agriculture and its determinants. Specifically, the research focuses on four major aspects: (a) measuring agricultural total factor productivity growth; (b) regional analysis of agricultural total factor productivity; (c) determinants of provincial agricultural total factor productivity levels; and (d) convergence in agricultural total factor productivity. The works on those aspects in this thesis could be considered as separate essays. The research uses both Data Envelopment Analysis and Stochastic Frontier Analysis to measure the sources of agricultural total factor productivity growth in Vietnam, based on provincial level data in the period 1990 - 2006. It concludes that (a) total factor productivity had grown during the period; (b) shift of the production possibility frontier (technical change) was {{the major source of}} total factor productivity growth, while actual production moved further away from the frontier (technical efficiency reduction); (c) pure technical efficiency change was the most important reason for explaining technical efficiency reduction; and (d) there was a trend of technical efficiency diversification among provinces. Regional analysis of total factor productivity in Vietnamese agriculture has been done in this thesis by using both global meta-frontier Malmquist index and meta-frontier Stochastic Frontier Analysis. By grouping all provinces into six regions, the thesis concludes that (a) not only gaps in agricultural production technology existed, but also these gaps widened among regions; North Midlands and Central Coast lagged further behind; (b) North provinces and Central Coast were better in exploiting their production condition efficiently, while South provinces were better in applying new production technology. The gaps in production technology among those regions were well explained by regional characteristics, especially input ratios (land per labour, tractor per labour). By using the concept of shadow price, implicit input value share and Tornqvist total factor productivity index, a model examining determinants of provincial differences in agricultural total factor productivity level was constructed in this thesis. It concludes that Vietnam’s agriculture has become relatively more capital-intensive during the period 1990 - 2006. The research found several important on-farm and off-farm determinants of agricultural total factor productivity such as provincial GDP per capita, credit access of agricultural household, land quality, size of agricultural <b>population,</b> percentage of <b>non-farm</b> rural <b>population</b> in total agricultural population, farm size, size of land plot, and land fragmentation. This thesis also tests the productivity convergence hypothesis in Vietnam’s agriculture by using both cross-section beta convergence and stochastic long-run convergence. It concludes provinces in the same regions with similar production conditions showed stronger evidence for convergence in their agricultural total factor productivity levels. This thesis suggests several policies for improving agricultural total factor productivity, which focused on three major issues of Vietnam’s agriculture: labour immobility, land consolidation and mechanization. Such policies include promoting labour mobility and resources accumulation in the agricultural sector, agricultural land consolidation, promoting agricultural credit, encouraging agricultural production technology transfer and resource mobility among provinces, developing irrigation activities and developing large scale agricultural areas...|$|R
