Postoperatively, transient elevation of serum <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> and decrease of serum Na, Cl, HCO 3 were noted. Urinary excretion of sodium tended to decrease and that of potassium increase, thus making high Uk/UNa ratio. 2. Cases of renal surgery were divided into normal renal function group (N) and impaired renal function group (I). Each was subdivided into young (Y) and aged cluster (A). Postoperative increase of serum <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> was more striking in group I than in group N. There was, however, no difference between group N and group I as to water, electrolytes and acid-base balance. Acidosis was more marked in group N than in group I. In group I, cluster-Y showed acidosis more prominent but slighter elevation of serum <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> than cluster-A. 3. Cases of other operations were studied in the similar manner. There was no remarkable difference between group N and group I. In group N, cluster-Y showed smaller changes in serum <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> and electrolytes than cluster-A. In group I, cluster-A did not show decrease of sodium excretion as cluster-Y did. 4. When non-electrolyte fluid was infused during operation, postoperative elevation of serum <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> was influenced by amount of sodium administration after surgery. The cases administered 65 to 82 mEq of sodium showed the slighter elevation than the cases administered less. Metabolic acidosis was of similar tendency as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances.</b> Elevation of UK/UNa ratio was suppressed by sodium administration. 5. When Ringer's lactate was administered during operation and 107 to 180 mEq of sodium postoperatively, increase of the serum <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> as well as changes in serum electrolytes and acid-base balance was minimal. Urinary sodium excretion was also kept undiminished. 6. Based upon above results, criteria were established as to quality and quantity of fluid administration during and after operation. More sodium administration was suggested than used to be indicated; namely, more than 100 mEq/day was thought to be adequate...|$|R

This thesis was focused on assessing the difference and suitability between two organic granular compound feed (starter), which were made to order. Feeding mixtures consisted of a different representation of the same components, where the experimental feed had higher <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> (NL). To confirm this difference was conducted chemical analysis. In that year 80 lambs were weighed, and they {{were divided into two}} groups since 06. 02. 2014 to 23. 05. 2014. The average age of lambs after attempt was 104 days. The measured values were subjected to statistical evaluation of weight, weight gain and daily gain during the test, weighing and period of weaning from milk. Lambs achieved during the test total increase of weight gain in the experimental group 17. 9 +- 0. 252 kg and 20. 75 +- 0. 775.

40|$|A direct {{determination}} of blood ammonia circumventing {{the use of}} microdiffusion apparatus which was devised by Fujii consists in (1) deproteinization of blood by a modified Folin-Wu's procedure, (2) coloration of thus deproteinized supernatant of blood by the Berthelot reaction and (3) colorimetry. This is a simple and convenient method, but our experience disclosed several drawbacks in it. A series of experiments were carried out in our laboratory {{in the hope that}} Fujii's method might be improved. The following is the outline of our improvement. 1 ゜. Collection of blood sample. Blood (about 3 ml) is withdrawn with a syringe by venous puncture, transferred into a test tube containing the crystals of potassium oxalate, stirred gently to prevent coagulation, and immediately cooled by inserting into a pile of ice cubes so that release of ammonia from non-NH_ 3 <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> may be stopped completely. 2 ゜. Deproteinization. To the blood (1. 0 ml) thus collected are added 10 g/dl sodium tungstate solution (0. 5 ml) and 1 N sulfuric acid (0. 5 ml), allowed to stand (for 15 minutes), and centrifuged to get clear supernatant. (This procedure of deproteinization insures the elimination of danger for the spontaneous increase in ammonia reading which may arise while the mixture of blood with deproteinzing reagent is allowed to stand at room temperature). 3 ゜. Coloration. The deproteinzed supernatant of blood (0. 5 ml) is mixed with phenol-nitroprusside solution (2. 0 ml) and antiformin solution (2. 0 ml), mixed and incubated at 37 ℃ (for 3 minutes). (A stable blue coloration which is not disturbed by the co-existing non-NH_ 3 <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> is obtained in this way.) 4 ゜.

Mixed feeding ration is loaded twice a day and it is compiled in advisory way according to the laboratory analysis results of feed. It was balanced with a moderate abundance of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>substances</b> and solids in production cows and with a deficit of solids in feeding ration of very pregnant non-lactating cows in both years (about 9 %). The fat and protein contents were relatively fixed, with a decline in summer months. The limit for somatic cells was exceeded once (by 3 %) and so the TVC (by 36 %) in 2008. Reproduction indicators showed annual improvement {{with the exception of the}} intervening period length. There came to reduction in number of coves on the 3 rd and later lactations and to decrease of their longevity thus. Their own and purchased feed took share in costs mostly (33, 3 % in total). In 2007 the loss per litter of sold milk arose but the income moved to positive values after including all revenues. In 2008 a profit per litter of sold mild was reached the milk production reached 3, 64 % and the total income increased...|$|R

The qualitative analysis of the pyrograms allowed us to discriminate between four main families of compounds: aromatic compounds, lipids, polysaccharides and nitrogen-containing substances. The quantitative data revealed some variations in the chemical composition of the macromolecular content. Lipids are the most transformed fraction during the composting process. Animal and plant fatty acids showed a sensible decrease. Fungal fatty acids mainly increased during the thermophilic phase whereas bacterial fatty acids increased when the growth of fungi is repressed. During composting of solid wastes from traditional tanneries an adapted microbial community has been developed. Various lignin-derived units during composting showed a strong increase in p-hydroxyphenyl type-compounds in comparison with the other aromatic structures due to high decomposition of grass cuttings. Tannin derived compounds also increased throughout the composting. Lignin and condensed tannins polymers are partially degraded and stabilized by covalent linkage to more complex organic molecules such as humic <b>substances.</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> containing compounds increased during composting {{as a consequence of the}} high rate of degradation of the other fractions and/or their combination with polyphenolic structure leading to the formation of humic substances. In our study a correlation was found between NTK and <b>nitrogen</b> containing <b>substances...</b>|$|R
40|$|As in many sweet foods, flavour is an {{essential}} characteristic of cocoa and chocolate. The compounds responsible for the aroma are methylpyrazines, <b>nitrogen</b> heterocyclic <b>substances</b> formed during the roasting process. Among these compounds, 2 -methylpyrazine and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetramethylpyrazine {{are the most important}} compounds because they are both responsible for the respective sweet and strong cocoa aroma. They can represent a useful index for the assessment of product and process qualities. The aim of this work is to set-up and optimize the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) analytical method, in order to determine flavour compositions and, at the same time, perform a predictive analysis of the aroma content of different cocoa blends. Results show a statistical correlation between pyrazine content, geographical origin and sensory properties...|$|R
