These {{are very high}} numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are no problems with <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply.</b> This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E
5|$|Sundews {{generally}} grow in seasonally moist or {{more rarely}} constantly wet habitats with acidic soils {{and high levels}} of sunlight. Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and moist streambanks. Many species grow in association with sphagnum moss, which absorbs much of the soil's <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply</b> and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.|$|E
5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply</b> and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E

40|$|Competitive {{interactions}} among free living organisms such as plants and algae {{are known to}} be regulated by rates and ratios of environmental <b>nutrient</b> <b>supplies</b> 1. Micro-organisms that rely on a host for their reproduction cycle hijack host metabolic machinery, as well as host resources in metabolites, enzymes and proteins. As the synthesis of these molecules requires nitrogen and phosphorus, altered host <b>nutrients</b> <b>supplies</b> have been hypothesized and thereafter shown to influence microbial dynamics, based on the response of single and a group of micro-organism species 2. Yet, rates and ratios of <b>nutrients</b> <b>supplied</b> to hosts could also mediate the {{interactions among}} co-occurring micro-organisms. Understanding these effects would be an important advance because interactions among co-occuring microbes can alter both host population dynamics and epidemiological processes 3.

5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply</b> of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E
5|$|During the Tauca phase, {{water levels}} in Laguna Miscanti {{were higher than}} today; shorelines formed from an event in Ch'iyar Quta lake; saline lakes formed in the Lipez area, and water levels rose in the Guayatayoc-Salinas Grandes basin and lakes at Uturuncu and Lazufre. Some Atacama Altiplano lake levels {{increased}} by , and evidence exists at the Quebrada Mani archeological site for a higher water supply 16,400–13,700 years ago. During the Tauca, greater flow occurred in rivers in the Atacama region; more precipitation fell in the Rio Salado valley; the excavation of the Colca Canyon may have been aided by an increased water supply, and glaciers advanced in the Cordillera de Cochabamba. A moraine formed at Hualca Hualca; the Choqueyapu II glacier in the Eastern Cordillera advanced; moraines formed from glacial advances in Argentina (including the Sierra de Santa Victoria); basal sliding glaciers formed at Sajama; landslide activity in northwestern Argentina decreased; the climate grew wetter over the southern Amazon; flooding in the Río Paraguay-Parana basin and precipitation and forest cover in Pampa del Tamarugal increased; erosion occurred along the Pilcomayo, {{and an increase in}} Pacific plankton was probably linked to increased runoff (and an increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply)</b> from the Andes. A glacial advance in central Chile around 15,000 years ago, also associated with increased precipitation and the Lake Tauca period, was probably triggered by tropical circulation changes.|$|E

30|$|The {{ability to}} digest pelotons to obtain <b>nutrient</b> <b>supplies</b> is an {{important}} strategy in orchids {{in order to achieve}} successful plantlet formation. For mycotrophic orchids, nutrients have to come from the mycorrhizal fungi. A recent study by Fochi et al. (2017) demonstrated that a bidirectional nutrient transfer can occur between orchids and its symbionts. Future studies using combined techniques of molecular genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and physiology will provide additional insights and possible mechanisms into nutrient transfer between them. Besides contributing <b>nutrient</b> <b>supplies</b> to the orchid host, mycorrhizal fungi are known to produce phytohormones (Liu et al. 2010). Can they contribute to morphogenesis and subsequent plantlet formation of protocorms through phytohormone supplies? Although there are still many unanswered questions, the above examples highlight the unique properties of protocorms and the process of mycorrhizal establishment and their interactions.|$|R

25|$|Another {{issue is}} the risk of algal blooms. When temperatures, <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply,</b> and {{available}} sunlight are optimal for algal growth, algae multiply at an exponential rate, eventually exhausting nutrients and causing a subsequent die-off in fish. The decaying algal biomass depletes the oxygen in the pond water because it blocks out the sun and pollutes it with organic and inorganic solutes (such as ammonium ions), which can (and frequently do) lead to massive loss of fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between cell size and cell division {{has been extensively}} studied in yeast. For some cells, there is a mechanism by which cell division is not initiated until a cell has reached a certain size. If the <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply</b> is restricted (after time t = 2 in the diagram, below), {{and the rate of}} increase in cell size is slowed, the time period between cell divisions is increased. Yeast cell-size mutants were isolated that begin cell division before reaching a normal/regular size (wee mutants).|$|E
25|$|In normal early {{embryonic}} development, {{the outer}} epithelial layer contains cytotrophoblast cells, a stem cell type {{found in the}} trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries causing artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply</b> to the growing fetus with low resistance and high blood flow.|$|E

25|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) applied to agricultural land (via synthetic fertilizers, composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic {{sources such as}} manures (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome.

Due to undersea conditions (high salt concentrations, fluctuating temperatures and limited <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply),</b> the Navy may deploy MFCs with a mixture of salt-tolerant microorganisms.

25|$|Reefs are chronically {{at risk of}} algal encroachment. Overfishing {{and excess}} <b>{{nutrient}}</b> <b>supply</b> from onshore can enable algae to outcompete and kill the coral. Increased nutrient levels can {{be a result of}} sewage or chemical fertilizer runoff from nearby coastal developments. Runoff can carry nitrogen and phosphorus which promote excess algae growth. Algae can sometimes out-compete the coral for space. The algae can then smother the coral by decreasing the oxygen supply available to the reef. Decreased oxygen levels can slow down coral's calcification rates weakening the coral and leaving it more susceptible to disease and degradation. In surveys done around largely uninhabited US Pacific islands, algae inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral locations. The algal population consists of turf algae, coralline algae, and macro algae.|$|E

25|$|Anthropogenic actions {{also can}} cause eutrophication, or {{increase}} the nutrient load, of marine ecosystems, through runoff {{into the system}} containing fertilizer, sewage, dishwasher soap, and other nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich substances. Eutrophication is pervasive in coastal marine ecosystems (Lotze et al. 2006) and can indirectly initiate trophic cascades and increase consumer control of plants. For example, insect herbivory in marshes has been positively correlated with nutrient availability in Atlantic salt marshes (Bertness et al. 2008). In Narragansett Bay, insect herbivory suppresses primary production of human disturbed salt marshes by almost 40%. Nitrogen additions through human activity can increase insect herbivory so much that primary production is suppressed by nearly 60%, while marshes without human shoreline development remain solely under bottom-up control (Bertness et al. 2008). Increased <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply</b> can lead to runaway herbivory in other systems as well (Gough and Grace 1998, Silliman and Zieman 2001).|$|E
25|$|Asphyxia {{directly}} causes {{basal ganglia}} damage {{due to lack}} of oxygen and therefore, insufficient <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply.</b> The lesions caused by asphyxia are most prominent on the caudate nucleus and the putamen. However, a less-studied consequence of the resulting hypoxia is its effect on the concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the synapses of neurons in the basal ganglia. Hypoxia leads to an increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and therefore, an increase in the activity of the dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, this increase in extracellular concentration is not caused by an increase in the neurotransmitter synthesis, but instead on inhibiting its reuptake back into the neurons and glial cells. Therefore, there is an increased dopaminergic effect as dopamine remains in the synapse at higher concentrations leading to additional post-synaptic response. As a result, the uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed with athetosis deal with the over-activity of synapses within the basal ganglia.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors which}} {{may have contributed to}} the decline of the water {{hyacinth}} in Lake Victoria include varying weather patterns, such as El Niño during the last few months of 1997 and first six months of 1998 bringing with it higher levels of water in the lake and thus dislodging the plants. Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, <b>nutrient</b> <b>supply,</b> temperature, and other environmental factors could have played a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective than any one deterrent would have been by itself. The water hyacinth is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{tropical}} monodominant trees are associated with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi networks. Mycorrhizal fungi are known to effect plant diversity trends {{in a variety of}} ecosystems around the world. Ectomycorrhizal relations with trees can increase <b>nutrient</b> <b>supplies</b> through a more effectual use of larger capacities of soils or through the direct decomposition of leaf litter.

50|$|Paleosols in {{this sense}} are always {{exceedingly}} infertile soils, containing available phosphorus levels orders of magnitude lower than in temperate regions with younger soils.
