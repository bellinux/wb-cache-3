5|$|In 1825, {{engineers}} {{working on}} the Delaware and Hudson Canal found large numbers of dolostone rocks in the region, which enabled the production of <b>natural</b> <b>cement.</b> The rocks contained dolomite of the Upper Silurian's Rondout formation. Joppenbergh was rich in the mineral, and was mined. Several quarries operated on the mountain, including the New York and Rosendale Cement Company, and the James Cement Company. No one company had complete control of the entire mountain.|$|E
5|$|An 1895 fire {{destroyed}} {{half the}} village, {{as it had}} no form of fire protection at that time. Throughout the 20thcentury, {{the decline of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>cement</b> industry caused Rosendale to suffer economically and lose population. The village was also battered by a series of severe floods, and the center of commerce began to shift from Main Street to Route32. By the 1970s the village was having severe problems with its utilities and tax code, and was no longer producing cement. The hippie movement brought many artists to the village during this time, which led to ideological clashes between the newcomers and the more conservative, established residents. In 1976, the village voted to dissolve itself to solve its municipal problems, and on January1, 1978, Rosendale became disincorporated. The village's mayor {{at the time of the}} vote viewed the dissolution as a work of conceptual art, and published a book on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Rosendale is {{underlain}} by a shale {{member of}} the Martinburg Formation called Martinburg shale, deposited as early as 500 million years ago; Martinburg shale also lines {{the bottom of the}} Rondout Creek as it flows through the town. A conglomerate of the Shawangunk Formation was deposited over the Martinburg layer approximately 425 million years ago. The conglomerate is in turn covered by High Falls Shale, a reddish shale formed by mud flats. Subsequent streams left a layer of gray Binnewater Sandstone above the shale. After the sandstone was deposited, the region experienced folding and faulting, and was submerged in a shallow sea. This allowed the creation of fossiliferous limestone roughly 390 million years ago, specifically the Rondout Formation and New Scotland Formation. The Rondout Formation's dolostone member, formed during the upper Silurian, was mined throughout the village because of its ability to form <b>natural</b> <b>cement.</b> The region experienced repeated glaciation, and large amounts of till and alluvium were deposited during the Wisconsonian glaciation.|$|E
50|$|Later, in the 1800s {{various sources}} of the correct type of marl, known also as Cement Stone, were {{discovered}} across Europe and so there were a range of <b>natural</b> <b>cements</b> (with varying properties) in use across Europe.|$|R
25|$|Portland cement was {{developed}} from <b>natural</b> <b>cements</b> made in Britain {{beginning in the}} middle of the 18th century. Its name is derived from its similarity to Portland stone, a type of building stone quarried on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England.|$|R
50|$|In Portland cement kilns, C12A7 is {{an early}} {{reaction}} product of aluminium and calcium oxides in the temperature range 900-1200 °C. With the onset of melt-phases at higher temperatures, it reacts with further calcium oxide to form tricalcium aluminate. It thus can appear in under-burned kiln products. It also occurs in some <b>natural</b> <b>cements.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the US {{the first}} {{large-scale}} use of cement was Rosendale cement, a <b>natural</b> <b>cement</b> mined from a massive deposit {{of a large}} dolostone rock deposit discovered in the early 19th century near Rosendale, New York. Rosendale cement was extremely popular for the foundation of buildings (e.g., Statue of Liberty, Capitol Building, Brooklyn Bridge) and lining water pipes.|$|E
25|$|In the plant's last years, {{one of the}} few markets it {{had left}} was the {{restoration}} of historic buildings that had originally used it or similar materials. The factory's closure left those builders without any source of authentic material. In 2004 Edison Coatings, Inc., of Plainville, Connecticut, trademarked the brand Rosendale <b>Natural</b> <b>Cement</b> Products and began offering an authentic, historically accurate replacement.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time he also took {{advantage}} of a discovery that Portland cement could be made even more quickly and last longer when combined with <b>natural</b> <b>cement</b> in an 80-20 ratio.

50|$|In general, {{artificial}} cement is {{made from}} limestone, clay and gypsum (<b>natural</b> <b>cements</b> are obtained from rocks containing lime and clay). The main components are lime and kaolinitic clay. There are some cements such as the aluminous, derived from aluminous and lime materials, that are black (melanocratic). The presence of aluminum {{in the analysis of}} the Bélmez face called El Pelao (The bald one) could indicate that an aluminum-type cement was being dealt with. However, in his report Alonso does not indicate the percentage of said cation, nor its structure, resistance to compression, elasticity module, chemical resistance or other characteristics necessary to differentiate a Portland cement from an aluminum cement.|$|R

25|$|In 1825, Jacob ceded {{a portion}} of his land to John B. Jervis of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company so that a canal could be built across the property.

Experimental milling studies and numerical simulations are going hand in hand to better understand the fragmentation behavior of this biological material and to improve milling performance. We present a numerical study of the e↵ect of granule size distribution on the strength of such a cemented granular material. Samples of bi-modal starch granule size distribution were created and submitted to uniaxial tension, using a peridynamics method.

5000|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>cements</b> were {{frequently}} used in stucco mixes during the 1820s. The popularisation of Portland cement changed {{the composition of}} stucco, as well as mortar, to a harder material. The development of artificial cements had started early in the 19th century. In 1811, James Frost took out a patent for an artificial cement obtained by lightly calcining ground chalk and clay together. The French Engineer Louis Vicat in 1812-1813 experimented with calcining synthetic mixtures of limestone and clay, a product he introduced in 1818. In 1822, in the UK, James Frost patented (another?) process, similar to Vicat's, producing what he called [...] "British cement". Portland cement, patented in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin, was called so because {{it was supposed to}} resemble Portland stone. Aspdinís son William, and later Isaac Johnson, improved the production process. A product, very similar to modern Portland cement, was available from about 1845, with other improvements taking place in the following years.|$|R

Three other cements are produced commercially: quick setting Prompt cement from Vicat, France, and Rosendale cements from Edison Coatings Inc., USA. The hydration of the cements studied was shown to comprise two distinct stages.
