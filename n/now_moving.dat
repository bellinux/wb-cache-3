5|$|In 281 BC, at {{the request}} of the Greek city of Tarentum, Pyrrhus, the King of the Greek state of Epirus, went with an army of 25,500 men and 20 {{elephants}} to Italy to help fight the Romans. The Romans had succeeded in conquering most of Italy and were <b>now</b> <b>moving</b> in to take the Greek cities in Magna Graecia. After arriving in Italy in 280 BC, Pyrrhus defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea, near Tarentum. Pyrrhus repeated his success against Romans by defeating another army at the Battle of Asculum.|$|E
5|$|NGC 2207 and IC 2163 are {{a pair of}} face-on {{interacting}} spiral galaxies located 125 {{million light-years}} from Earth. About 40 million years ago, the two galaxies had a close encounter and are <b>now</b> <b>moving</b> farther apart; nevertheless, the smaller IC 2163 will eventually be incorporated into NGC 2207. As the interaction continues, gas and dust will be perturbed, sparking extensive star formation in both galaxies. Supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 in 1975 (type Ia SN 1975a), 1999 (the type Ib SN 1999ec), 2003 (type 1b supernova SN 2003H), and 2013 (type II supernova SN 2013ai). Located 16 million light-years distant, ESO 489-056 is an irregular dwarf- and low-surface-brightness galaxy that {{has one of the}} lowest metallicities known.|$|E
5|$|As his musings {{developed}} {{along these}} lines, Hazlitt continued to contribute miscellaneous articles to various periodicals. In February 1816, he reviewed August Wilhelm Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Literature for the Edinburgh Review. The German critic Schlegel showed {{an appreciation for}} Shakespeare of a kind {{that no one in}} Hazlitt's country had yet demonstrated, and Hazlitt, sympathising with many of Schlegel's ideas, felt there was a place for a whole book that would provide appreciative criticism of all of Shakespeare's plays. Such a book would provide liberal quotations from the text, and focus on the characters and various qualities particular to each play; and he felt that he could write it. His writing career was <b>now</b> <b>moving</b> in this direction (he had been contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to the Examiner and elsewhere during this period), he needed the money to support his family, and his growing reputation as a drama critic enabled him to have his name appear on the title page (as a reviewer for periodicals, his contributions were anonymous, as was customary at the time).|$|E

5|$|Hours before {{striking}} the Philippines on November4, both agencies reported Thelma {{to have reached}} its peak intensity. The JTWC estimated the storm to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) while the JMA estimated ten-minute sustained winds at 75km/h (45mph). Additionally, its barometric pressure reached 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg). Thelma soon made landfall in Samar before weakening to a minimal tropical storm. Maintaining gale-force winds, the system eventually passed over Palawan Island on November6 before moving over the South China Sea. Despite being back over water, strong wind shear prevented re-intensification and caused Thelma to weaken to a tropical depression by November7. <b>Now</b> <b>moving</b> westward, the depression eventually made its final landfall over the Mekong River Delta in Southern Vietnam on November8. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system weakened into an area of low pressure as it moved westwards, before it moved into the Andaman Sea during November 10. Once in the Andaman Sea, the systems remnants contributed to the formation of the Karaikal tropical cyclone during the next day.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{attempted}} {{to influence the}} outcomes of the elections in the Holy Roman Empire, which would appoint a new King of the Romans. When the more prominent German candidates failed to gain traction, Henry began to back his brother Richard's candidature, giving donations to his potential supporters in the Empire. Richard was elected in 1256 with expectations of possibly being crowned the Holy Roman Emperor, but continued {{to play a major}} role in English politics. His election faced a mixed response in England; Richard was believed to provide moderate, sensible counsel and his presence was missed by the English barons, but he also faced criticism, probably incorrectly, for funding his German campaign at England's expense. Although Henry now had increased support in the Empire for a potential alliance against Louis of France, the two kings were <b>now</b> <b>moving</b> towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully; for Henry, a peace treaty could allow him to focus on Sicily and his crusade.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Bess, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Susang, was {{responsible}} for the disappearance of a United States Air Force weather reconnaissance aircraft. Developing out of a poorly organized system on October8 to the east of the Philippines, Bess featured two centers of circulation. Initially the southern low was monitored; however, a low to the north soon became the dominant center. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the storm gradually intensified before striking northern Luzon as a minimal typhoon on October11. Temporary weakening took place due to interaction with land. After moving back over water the following morning, Bess regained typhoon intensity. This was short-lived though, as conditions surrounding the cyclone soon caused it to weaken. <b>Now</b> <b>moving</b> due west, the weakening storm eventually struck Hainan Island as a tropical storm on October12 before diminishing to a tropical depression. The depression briefly moved back over water before dissipating in northern Vietnam on October14.|$|E

5|$|When Mardonius' raids {{disrupted}} the Allied supply chain, it forced the Allies {{to rethink their}} strategy. Rather than <b>now</b> <b>moving</b> to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of communication. Despite this defensive move by the Greeks, {{it was in fact}} the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue the Greeks. Since he did not expect the Greeks to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried {{to take advantage of the}} altered strategic situation he thought he had produced. Conversely, the Greeks had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.|$|E

25|$|An ECG {{that reveals}} ST segment {{elevation}} or new left bundle branch block suggests complete blockage {{of one of}} the main coronary arteries. These patients require immediate reperfusion (re-opening) of the occluded vessel. This can be achieved in two ways: thrombolysis (clot-busting medication) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Both of these are effective in reducing significantly the mortality of myocardial infarction. Many centers are <b>now</b> <b>moving</b> to the use of PTCA as it is somewhat more effective than thrombolysis if it can be administered early. This may involve transfer to a nearby facility with facilities for angioplasty.|$|E

Allenby told Smuts of Robertson's private instructions (sent by hand of Walter Kirke, appointed by Robertson as Smuts' adviser) {{that there was no}} merit in any further advance. Allenby worked with Smuts to draw up plans to reach Haifa by June and Damascus by the autumn, reinforced by 3 divisions from Mesopotamia. The speed of the advance was limited by the need to lay fresh rail track. This met with War Cabinet approval (6 March 1918).|$|E
25|$|His procedure, {{widely known}} as the Nuss procedure, {{involves}} slipping {{in one or more}} concave steel bars into the chest, underneath the sternum. The bar is flipped to a convex position so as to push outward on the sternum, correcting the deformity. The bar usually stays in the body for about two years, although many surgeons are <b>now</b> <b>moving</b> toward leaving them in for up to five years. When the bones have solidified into place, the bar is removed through outpatient surgery. Although initially designed to be performed in younger children (less than 10 years of age) whose sternum and cartilage is more flexible, there are successful series of Nuss treatment in patients well into their teens and twenties. The Nuss procedure is a two-stage procedure.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} more subtle shifts away from the core {{influences}} of Dungeons & Dragons {{that existed in the}} 1980s and 1990s.
