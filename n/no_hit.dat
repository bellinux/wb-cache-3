500|$|Berry {{returned}} to Chess from 1970 to 1973. There were <b>no</b> <b>hit</b> singles from the 1970 album Back Home, but in 1972 Chess released a live recording of [...] "My Ding-a-Ling", a novelty song {{which he had}} recorded in a different version as [...] "My Tambourine" [...] on his 1968 LP From St. Louie to Frisco. The track became his only number-one single. A live recording of [...] "Reelin' and Rockin'", issued as a follow-up single in the same year, was his last Top 40 hit in both the US and the UK. Both singles were included on the part-live, part-studio album The London Chuck Berry Sessions (other albums of London sessions were recorded by Chess's mainstay artists Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf). Berry's second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album Chuck Berry, after {{which he did not}} make a studio record until Rock It for Atco Records in 1979, which would be his last studio album for 38 years.|$|E

500|$|Closely {{associated}} with the now unpopular disco and having had <b>no</b> <b>hit</b> singles in the preceding few years, after leaving Fantasy Sylvester was not a particular draw for major record labels. Recognizing this state of affairs, in 1982 Sylvester commented that [...] "there's nothing worse than a fallen star" [...] who still has [...] "illusions" [...] of their continuing fame. Rather than chasing major chart success, Sylvester wanted to focus on retaining creative control over his music. Hiring his former tour manager and longstanding friend Tim McKenna as his new manager, Sylvester decided to produce his next album with Megatone Records, a small San Francisco company that had been founded in 1981 by Patrick Cowley and Marty Blecman and which catered largely to the gay club scene. The result was All I Need (1982), on which James Wirrick had written most of the songs, which were dance-orientated and influenced by the new wave music then in vogue. Sylvester insisted that he include several ballads on the album, which featured cover art by Mark Amerika depicting Sylvester in ancient Egyptian garb.|$|E
500|$|During {{both the}} late 1990s and the 2000s, glam metal {{began to have}} {{something}} of a revival. Some established acts who had managed to weather the storm enjoyed renewed popularity, others reformed and new bands emerged to emulate the glam metal style. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with [...] "It's My Life" [...] (2000). They branched into country music with a version of their 2005 song [...] "Who Says You Can't Go Home", which reached {{number one on the}} Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 and the rock/country album Lost Highway which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound and reached number one on the Billboard 200. Mötley Crüe reunited with Vince Neil to record the 1997 album Generation Swine and Poison reunited with guitarist C.C. DeVille in 1999, producing the mostly live Power to the People (2000); both bands began to tour extensively. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007). The long-awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum in the US, produced <b>no</b> <b>hit</b> singles, and failed to come close {{to the success of the}} band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. Europe's [...] "Final Countdown" [...] enjoyed a new lease of popularity as the millennium drew to a close and the band reformed. Other acts to reform included Ratt, Britny Fox, Stryper (annually), and Skid Row.|$|E

As the pilot reported the problem to his wingman, the wingman observed the damaged Delta Dagger explode in midair, killing the pilot.

Reproduction failed to chart, but after an impromptu appearance on Top of the Pops in May 1980, Travelogue entered the UK Album Chart and peaked at No.16. Despite this, the band still had <b>no</b> <b>hit</b> singles and, dogged by the lack of commercial success, Oakey and Ware's working relationship became increasingly strained.
