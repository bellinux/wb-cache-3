Different types of load peak charts are supported, which make it possible to identify load peaks from single devices or compare load peaks of several devices in one chart. In addition, there are charts simplifying the identification of regularities in the timing of load peak events.

The charts a user generated during his session were saved at database and loaded automatically at the next login.

40|$|Reasonable {{distribution}} <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> is {{an essential}} prerequisite of the economics and security of the future power grid. The comprehensive benefit evaluation of a distribution <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> project can make significant contributions towards guiding decisions during the planning scheme, the optimization of the distribution network structure, and the rational use of resources. In this paper, {{in light of the}} characteristics of the power distribution network, the comprehensive benefit evaluation index system is constructed considering the influencing factors of technical benefit, economic benefit, and social benefit. To eliminate the influence of subjective factors on the evaluation effects and the uncertainty of the influencing factors effectively, the improved interval analytic hierarchy process is employed to calculate the index weights more simply. Moreover, based on the traditional single-factor extension evaluation, this study proposes a multi-level extension assessment model to evaluate the comprehensive benefit of the power distribution <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> project. The model can not only identify the key factors that affect the evaluation effect of the power distribution <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> project, but also can predict the overall development trend of the project. Finally, using a specific urban distribution <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> project as an example, the findings indicate that the comprehensive benefit grade of this power distribution <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> project is “better” due to the benefit grade variable eigenvalue j * ∈ [3. 33, 3. 418] ∈ [3, 4], and illustrates that the model is credible and practical to achieve the comprehensive benefit evaluation of the power distribution <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> project...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to use {{artificial}} intelligence to evaluate the risks of urban power <b>network</b> <b>planning.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A fuzzy Bayesian least squares support vector machine (LS_SVM) model is established in this paper, which can learn the risk information of urban power <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> through artificial intelligence and acquire expert knowledge for its risk evaluation. With the advantage of possessing learning analog simulation precision and speed, the proposed model can be effectively applied in conducting a risk evaluation of an urban <b>network</b> <b>planning</b> system. First, fuzzy theory is applied to quantify qualitative risk factors of the planning to determine the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value of the risk factors.
