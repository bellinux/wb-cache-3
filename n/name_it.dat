The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and <b>name</b> <b>it</b> in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than A.obovatus, with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm.|$|E

5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run.

5|$|Construction of I-496 {{started in}} 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of {{downtown}} Lansing {{were built in}} the location of a historically black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to <b>name</b> <b>it</b> resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state <b>name</b> <b>it</b> as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since.|$|E
