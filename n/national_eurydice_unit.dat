50|$|The network {{consisted}} originally of a European Unit {{and one or}} more units set up by Education Ministries in each of {{the then}} 9 member states of the European Union. These national units were normally located within Ministries responsible for Education, although in some cases (e.g., England) they were outsourced to research or documentation bodies. In federal countries (such as Germany or Belgium) the more than one unit was needed to respond to the structure of education in the country: thus, in Germany one <b>national</b> <b>Eurydice</b> <b>Unit</b> was established inside the documentation service of the Federal Ministry for Education; and another in the Conference of State Ministers of Education, which brings together the Education Ministers of the federal states.|$|E

The content is under the responsibility of the <b>Eurydice</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unit.</b> At Kindergarten Level (ages 3 to 5) pupil assessment focuses on their physical development, social development, creative development, intellectual development (which includes language and mathematical development) and their understanding of the world around them. At this level there is no formal teaching; the Kindergarten practitioner is responsible for the creation of learning opportunities and assessment activities that are related to the areas of development indicated earlier. Assessment is carried out informally and is based thoroughly on pupil observation. At Primary Level (ages 5 to 10 +) pupil assessment is carried out differently in Years 1 to 3 and in Years 4 to 6. In the first three years of Primary Education assessment is carried out informally and for a formative purpose. This paper discusses the objectives, organization, and use of results of the national testing of pupils in Malta. This paper contains the following parts: (1) General Overview of Pupil Assessment; (2) Historical Background to National Testing and its Political Framework; (3) Aims and Organizations of National Testing; and (4) Impact of National Testing. A bibliography is included. N/...|$|R

The Commission established the European <b>Eurydice</b> <b>Unit</b> directly; and following some years' negotiations, the network held its first meeting in 1980.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntegrating {{content and}} {{language}} {{is not a new}} idea but one that is becoming increasingly more practiced in language classrooms around the world and one that is continuously evolving. According to the <b>Eurydice</b> European <b>Unit</b> (2006), one of the goals for using this approach besides the obvious objective of mastering a language as well as learning subject matter, is to prepare for life in a more internationalized society. The purpose of the present research is to identify the relationship between learning and developing vocabulary and learning English in CLIL classes among Iranian EFL learners of SAMA schools. In SAMA schools all subjects are taught in Persian except mathematics and science, which are taught in English. The research method was quantitative, and the research sample was all the students of SAMA school in Tabriz city (40 students) and students of an ordinary school (40 students). Data were gathered through a researcher-made tool which consisted of 50 items. Results showed that the students of SAMA school have the ability to develop and retain vocabulary better than ordinary school students because of the Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) method and textbooks which they are taught for science and mathematics subjects...|$|R
