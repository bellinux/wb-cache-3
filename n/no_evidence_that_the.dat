5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, and there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latest common ancestor of pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms was sessile and fed by means of tentacles.|$|E

The kirkyard stone predates the Battle of Barry by three centuries and the most widely accepted interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD.|$|E

Although the music {{written for the}} concerto focused on high voices, there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ensemble used either castrati or falsettists. This fact is surprising, considering that castrati were shortly to become the biggest stars of a new art form, opera. In 1607, Monteverdi's Orfeo featured four castrato roles out of a cast of nine, showing the new dominance of this vocal type. It also contrasts with Margherita's father's court, where Guglielmo Gonzaga actively sought out eunuchs.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E

5|$|In 212, the constitutio Antoniniana (Antonine decree) of emperor Caracalla granted Roman {{citizenship}} {{to all the}} free inhabitants of the Empire– the peregrini– thus abolishing their second-class status. But there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> citizens-only rule for legions was also abolished at this time. The legions simply gained a much wider recruitment base, as they were now able to recruit any male free resident of the empire. Auxiliary units were now recruited mainly from Roman citizens, but probably continued to recruit non-citizen barbari from outside the Empire's borders. However, the citizens-only rule for legions {{appears to have been}} dropped some time during the 3rd century, as by the 4th-century Romans and barbarians are found serving together in all units.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, there is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius received more rain and had a more stable climate than Rodrigues, there was probably less need for male dodos to fight over territory. The solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{photography}} {{continued to}} develop, both in France and abroad, after the Nadar images were shot. In Europe, several further cases of intersexuality were documented, {{although there is}} <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> photographers were aware of Nadar's work. In April 1870 a Monsieur Delacroix presented photographs of an intersex individual at the Société Médicale de Reims. In 1930 German physician Magnus Hirschfeld published a portrait of himself with an intersex individual in his five-volume Geschlechtskunde (Sexology), while Louis Ombrédanne published 25 images of cases he had handled in his 1939 book Les hermaphrodites et la chirurgie (Hermaphrodites and Surgery).|$|E

5|$|The Order of the Illuminati was an Enlightenment-age {{secret society}} founded by {{university}} professor Adam Weishaupt on 1 May 1776, in Upper Bavaria, Germany. The movement consisted of advocates of freethought, secularism, liberalism, republicanism, and gender equality, {{recruited from the}} German Masonic Lodges, who sought to teach rationalism through mystery schools. In 1785, the order was infiltrated, broken up and suppressed by the government agents of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, in his preemptive campaign to neutralize the threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the Bavarian monarchy and its state religion, Roman Catholicism. There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bavarian Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Government-in-Exile, in London, {{was taken}} by surprise; it had not {{expected}} Ukrainian anti-Polish action of such magnitude. There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Polish Government in Exile contemplated a general policy of revenge against the Ukrainians, but local Poles, including commanders of Home Army units, engaged in various retaliations. Polish partisans attacked the OUN, assassinated prominent Ukrainian commanders, and carried out operations against Ukrainian villages. According to Grzegorz Motyka, the Polish actions resulted in 10,000-11,000 to 15,000 Ukrainian deaths in 1943-47, including 8,000-10,000 in the territory of present-day Poland. By winter 1943 and spring 1944, the Home Army was preparing for Operation Tempest; one of its goals was to reinforce the Polish position in Volhynia. Most notably, in January 1944 the 27th Home Army Infantry Division, numbering 7,000, was formed, tasked with defending Polish civilians and with engaging the OUN and German forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{documentary evidence}} of building work at Halton Castle shows {{that during the}} 15thcentury and into the 16thcentury it was regularly maintained. Between 1450 and 1457 a new gate tower was built. There is <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> castle featured in the Wars of the Roses; {{this would have been}} unlikely because of its relatively obscure position. However a survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609 suggests that by then the castle had fallen into disrepair. During the Tudor period it was used less as a fortress and more as a prison, an administrative centre, and a court of law. In 1580–81 the castle was designated as a prison for Catholic recusants, but {{there is no evidence that}} it was ever used for that purpose.|$|E
