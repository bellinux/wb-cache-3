5|$|In the {{case-hardening}} {{of steel}} by <b>nitriding.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Tenifer process {{produces}} a matte gray-colored, nonglare {{surface with a}} 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration. Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including Teflon, bluing, hard chrome plating, or phosphates. During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath <b>nitriding</b> Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed gas <b>nitriding</b> process. After applying the <b>nitriding</b> process, a black Parkerized decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying <b>nitriding</b> treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.|$|E
25|$|Gaseous {{ferritic}} nitrocarburizing is {{also known}} as controlled nitrocarburizing, soft <b>nitriding,</b> and vacuum nitrocarburizing or by the tradenames Nitrotec, Nitemper, Deganit, Triniding, Corr-I-Dur, Nitroc, NITREG-C and Nitrowear, Nitroneg. The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath process, except gaseous mixtures are used to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Common {{industrial}} coatings {{applied by}} PVD are titanium <b>nitride,</b> zirconium <b>nitride,</b> chromium <b>nitride,</b> titanium aluminum <b>nitride.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like carbides, <b>nitrides</b> {{are often}} {{refractory}} materials owing to their high lattice energy which reflects the strong attraction of [...] "N3−" [...] for the metal cation. Thus, titanium <b>nitride</b> and silicon <b>nitride</b> {{are used as}} cutting materials and hard coatings. Hexagonal boron <b>nitride,</b> which adopts a layered structure, is a useful high-temperature lubricant akin to molybdenum disulfide. <b>Nitride</b> compounds often have large band gaps, thus <b>nitrides</b> are usually insulators or wide bandgap semiconductors, examples include boron <b>nitride</b> and silicon <b>nitride.</b> The wide band gap material gallium <b>nitride</b> is prized for emitting blue light in LEDs. [...] Like some oxides, <b>nitrides</b> can absorb hydrogen and have been discussed {{in the context of}} hydrogen storage, e.g. lithium <b>nitride.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Nitrides</b> of the Group 7 and 8 {{transition}} metals decompose readily. For example, iron <b>nitride,</b> Fe2N decomposes at 200 °C. Platinum <b>nitride</b> and osmium <b>nitride</b> may contain N2 units, {{and as such}} should not be called <b>nitrides.</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the naming}} {{the process is}} a {{modified}} form of <b>nitriding</b> and not carburizing. The shared attributes of this class {{of this process is}} the introduction of nitrogen and carbon in the ferritic state of the material. The processes are broken up into four main classes: gaseous, salt bath, ion or plasma, or fluidized-bed. The trade name and patented processes may vary slightly from the general description, but they are all a form of ferritic nitrocarburizing.|$|E
25|$|Both {{carbon and}} alloy steels are {{suitable}} for case-hardening; typically mild steels are used, with low carbon content, usually less than 0.3% (see plain-carbon steel for more information). These mild steels are not normally hardenable due to the low quantity of carbon, so {{the surface of the}} steel is chemically altered to increase the hardenability. Case-hardened steel is formed by diffusing carbon (carburization), nitrogen (<b>nitriding)</b> and/or boron (boriding) into the outer layer of the steel at high temperature, and then heat treating the surface layer to the desired hardness.|$|E
25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low volume production is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose steel billet. This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be heat treated via gas <b>nitriding,</b> which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E
50|$|Yttrium <b>nitride</b> is hard ceramic {{material}} similar to titanium <b>nitride</b> and zirconium <b>nitride.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Boron nanosheets (BNNS) {{defined as}} single or few layers of boron <b>nitride</b> whose aspect ratio is small. [...] However, {{there are a}} couple {{variations}} of 2D boron <b>nitride</b> structure. Boron <b>nitride</b> nanoribbons (BNNR) are boron <b>nitride</b> nanosheets with significant edge effects and have widths that are smaller than 50 nanometers. Boron <b>nitride</b> nanomeshes (BNNM) are boron <b>nitride</b> nanosheets that are placed upon specific metal substrates.|$|R
40|$|In {{search of}} {{opto-electronic}} nano materials, we often come across Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes (GaN-NT) with excellent electrical and optical characteristics. Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes are predominantly semiconducting {{and have been}} less explored in its application as a transistor channel through Density Functional Theory (DFT). Comparing Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes with Boron <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes (BN-NT) and Carbon nanotubes (CNT), we have obtained distinguishing features of Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes. In this work, Transistor simulation with Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes has been reported with the nanotube as channel. Properties of various configurations of nanotubes are compared among Carbon, Boron <b>Nitride</b> and Gallium <b>Nitride</b> nanotubes...|$|R
2500|$|Plasma-assisted {{ferritic}} nitrocarburizing is {{also known}} as ion <b>nitriding,</b> plasma ion <b>nitriding</b> or glow-discharge <b>nitriding.</b> The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath and gaseous process, except the reactivity of the media is not due to the temperature but to the gas ionized state. In this technique intense electric fields are used to generate ionized molecules of the gas around the surface to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece. Such highly active gas with ionized molecules is called plasma, naming the technique. The gas used for plasma <b>nitriding</b> is usually pure nitrogen, since no spontaneous decomposition is needed (as is the case of gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing with ammonia). Due to the relatively low temperature range ( [...] to [...] ) generally applied during plasma-assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing and gentle cooling in the furnace, the distortion of workpieces can be minimized. Stainless steel workpieces can be processed at moderate temperatures (like [...] ) without the formation of chromium nitride precipitates and hence maintaining their corrosion resistance properties.|$|E
2500|$|This {{spurred the}} {{development}} of a more environmentally friendly salt bath process by the German company Degussa after acquiring ICI patents. Their process is the widely known [...] as the Tufftride or Tenifer process. Following this the ion <b>nitriding</b> process was invented in the early 1980s. This process had faster cycle times, required less cleaning and preparation, formed deeper cases, and allowed for better control of the process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rectangular}} slide is milled from {{a single}} block of ordnance-grade steel using CNC machinery. The barrel and slide undergo two hardening processes prior to treatment with a proprietary <b>nitriding</b> process called Tenifer. The Tenifer treatment is applied in a [...] nitrate bath. The Tenifer finish is between [...] in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.|$|E
40|$|Mesoporous {{graphitic carbon}} <b>nitride</b> {{was used as}} both a nanoreactor and a {{reactant}} for the synthesis of ternary metal <b>nitride</b> nanoparticles. By infiltration of a mixture of two metal precursors into mesoporous carbon <b>nitride,</b> the pores act first as a nanoconfinement, generating amorphous mixed oxide nanoparticles. During heating and decomposition, the carbon <b>nitride</b> second acts as reactant or, more precisely, as a nitrogen source, which converts the preformed mixed oxide nanoparticles into the corresponding <b>nitride</b> (reactive templating). Using this approach, ternary metal <b>nitride</b> particles with diameters smaller 10 nm composed of aluminum gallium <b>nitride</b> (Al−Ga−N) and titanium vanadium <b>nitride</b> (Ti−V−N) were synthesized. Due to the confinement effect of the carbon <b>nitride</b> matrix, {{the composition of the}} resulting metal <b>nitride</b> can be easily adjusted by changing the concentration of the preceding precursor solution. Thus, ternary metal <b>nitride</b> nanoparticles with continuously adjustable metal composition can be produced...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Nitriding</b> heats {{the steel}} part to [...] in an {{atmosphere}} of ammonia gas and dissociated ammonia. The time the part spends in this environment dictates the depth of the case. The hardness is achieved by the formation of nitrides. Nitride forming elements must be present for this method to work; these elements include chromium, molybdenum, and aluminium. The advantage of this process is that it causes little distortion, so the part can be case-hardened after being quenched, tempered and machined.|$|E
2500|$|During manufacture, {{propeller}} pistons, which {{control the}} pitch of the propellers, are coated through a process called <b>nitriding,</b> which hardens them and makes them more resistant to surface wear. [...] They {{are supposed to be}} inspected to make sure the process is completed. [...] While it is not known why the propeller on N73130 was not nitrided or failed inspections, the fact remains that it was, and was installed on N73130. [...] During the life of the engine, the piston had been slowly wearing away. During the flight, the piston finally failed, causing the propeller to over-speed. [...] The propeller subsequently failed due to overstress, 1 to 2 seconds later. [...] When the propeller failed, the blades were hurled through the cabin, severing control cables as well as the structural integrity of the plane itself. [...] The investigators determined that the crash was solely caused by the propeller defect and subsequent failure.|$|E

40|$|Metal oxide {{semiconductor}} capacitors with oxidized {{thick and thin}} <b>nitride</b> films of two different <b>nitride</b> thicknesses were used to study the conduction and charge-trapping behavior under positive stress bias to the upper electrode. Although the top oxide thickness {{of the two groups}} of oxidized <b>nitride</b> films is the same, the charge-trapping character-istics are different. It was found that due to the positive stress to the upper electrode of oxidized thick <b>nitride,</b> the gate voltage is shifted to the negative direction, whereas in oxidized thin <b>nitride,</b> it is shifted to the positive direction, just like the <b>nitride</b> films. It was also observed that in <b>nitride</b> films, irrespective of <b>nitride</b> thickness, due to the positive stress bias, the gate voltage is shifted to the positive direction. From the experimental results of oxidized thick and thin <b>nitride,</b> it can be inferred that in oxidized thick <b>nitride,</b> due to electron injection from the lower electrode, holes are generated in the <b>nitride</b> film and are trapped near the interface. As a result of trapped holes near the interface of the top oxide and <b>nitride,</b> as well as a shallow electron trap centered below the conduction band of the <b>nitride,</b> a large increase in current is observed in oxidized thick <b>nitride.</b> On the other hand, in oxidized thin <b>nitride</b> films for the same positive stress bias, only a few holes are generated in the <b>nitride</b> film because most of the injected electrons from the lower electrode tunnel through the <b>nitride</b> and are trapped in the top oxide. Also shallow trap centers are generated below the conduction band of the thin <b>nitride</b> films. As a result of fewer trapped holes in the interface, the increase of current in oxidized thin nitrid...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the plasma}} <b>nitriding</b> processes, {{nitrogen}} gas (N2) {{is usually the}} nitrogen carrying gas. Other gasses like hydrogen or Argon are also used. Indeed, Argon and H2 can be used before the <b>nitriding</b> process during the heating of the parts to clean the surfaces to be nitrided. This cleaning procedure effectively removes the oxide layer from surfaces and may remove fine layers of solvents that could remain. This also helps the thermal stability of the plasma plant, since the heat added by the plasma is already present during the warm up and hence once the process temperature is reached the actual <b>nitriding</b> begins with minor heating changes. For the <b>nitriding</b> process H2 gas is also added to keep the surface clear of oxides. This effect can be observed by analysing {{the surface of the}} part under <b>nitriding</b> (see for instance [...] ).|$|E
