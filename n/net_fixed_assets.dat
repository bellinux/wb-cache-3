Nor do all countries have efficient legal systems in which a broad range of property rights can be enforced. Still, variables that predict capital structures in the United States also predict choices of capital structures in the countries sampled. Variables suggested by agency theory explain more of the variation than variables suggested by tax-based theories.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of a new type of “princeling” {{political}} connection on Chinese listed companies. Three specific issues are examined through three interconnected essays: characteristics of “princeling” politically connected firms (PCFs) with respect to accounting numbers in financial statements and corporate governance; the expropriation on earnings by PCFs; and {{the impact of}} political connections on stock returns. Firstly, to examine the characteristics of PCFs, this thesis systematically examines the differences between PCFs and their matching firms with respect to financial statement accounts and corporate governance during the period from 1992 to 2011. This thesis finds that PCFs have significantly greater profitability and market valuation, but they have significantly lower net investments and <b>net</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> compared to non-connected firms. Moreover, board directors are on average older and have higher educational levels in PCFs, relative to non-connected firms. Surprisingly, PCFs exhibits larger percentage of directors with academic backgrounds. Secondly, an investigation is made on the link between political connections and value expropriation. This thesis finds PCFs stockpile disproportionately larger retained earnings but pay lower cash dividends, compared to unconnected firms. This thesis further finds such behaviour in PCFs is not due to either investment or precautionary motives. These results immediately give rise {{to the question of what}} happens to the retained earnings. By examining the components of retained earnings, this thesis identifies a new form of tunnelling in the form of a discrepancy in the accounting for changes in retained earnings, newly defined as “grey usage”. Specifically, PCFs have higher average grey usages on retained earnings than matching firms, by CNY 4. 68 million. The findings provide important information for investors that PCFs may potentially increase the risk of expropriation through grey usages. The final examination investigates the market response to the “princelings” political connection. This thesis compares the cumulative abnormal stock returns between PCFs and unconnected firms. Three benchmarks are applied: cumulative market adjusted abnormal returns (CMAARs); cumulative risk adjusted abnormal returns (CRAARs); and cumulative abnormal returns adjusted from the Fama-French three factors model (CFAARs). No matter which benchmark is used, firms connected to PCFs show higher cumulative abnormal stock returns than matching firms. Also, this study finds that PCFs outperform matching firms in the Conglomerates and Industrials sectors, but not in others. This result could be due to the predominance of firms in the Conglomerates and Industrial sectors in the connected firm samples...|$|E

The study presented in this paper provides a financial analysis of electricity utilities in West Africa.

5000|$|In recent times, Eurostat {{publishes the}} [...] "business {{investment}} rate" [...] (also called the [...] "gross investment rate of non-financial corporations") in its quarterly sector {{accounts for the}} EU27. This ratio is defined as gross fixed capital formation divided by gross value added, in other words the share of GFCF in gross product. It provides {{an indication of how}} much of the total factor income is reinvested in new <b>fixed</b> <b>assets.</b> Normally that ratio is about 20-23% of gross value-added. However, calling it the [...] "business investment rate" [...] or the [...] "gross investment rate" [...] is somewhat deceptive, since this indicator refers only to fixed investment, and more specifically, the <b>net</b> <b>fixed</b> investment (<b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> bought, less disposals of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets).</b> The actual total funds which are spent by enterprises on investments, in gross terms, are much larger, both because enterprises invest in far more than <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> only (they also buy intermediate goods and services, and some financial assets), and because the total money they spend on buying <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> is larger than the same sum netted of asset disposals. The main reason why this Eurostat indicator is published is that it shows something about the longer-term expectations of enterprises. If business confidence is low, enterprises are less likely to tie up new earnings in additional <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> which are usually held for a number of years. If, on the other hand, business confidence is buoyant, {{it is more likely that}} enterprises will spend more of their current earnings on longer-term investments in <b>fixed</b> <b>assets.</b> In turn, the rate at which enterprises invest earnings in longer-term assets is an indicator of business expansion - if the rate declines, then this typically lowers the rate of cumulative business expansion. For example, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the ratio dropped to slightly below 20% in Q1 2010 from a high of 23% in Q2 2008. Although this 3% drop in the ratio may not seem so large, in reality it signifies a very large amount of money that was no longer spent. The reason is that the total gross investment and gross value-added for the European Union amount to trillions of euro's, while the total gross value-added also fell significantly in 2008-2010.|$|R
