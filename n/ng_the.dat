5|$|The story {{follows a}} Shoshone National Forest fire lookout named Henry in 1989, {{following}} the Yellowstone fires of 1988. A month {{after his first}} day at work, strange things begin happening to both him and his supervisor Delilah, which connects to a conspired mystery that happened years ago. Henry interacts with Delilah using a walkie-talkie, with the player choosing from dialog options to communicate. His exchanges with Delilah inform {{the process by which}} their relationship is developed. The game was directed by Olly Moss and Sean Vanaman, written by Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Moss and Vanaman, and produced by Gabe McGill and artist Jane <b>Ng.</b> <b>The</b> game's environment was modelled by Ng, based on a single painting by Moss. The design draws inspiration from New Deal advertisements by the National Park Service and field research conducted in Yosemite National Park.|$|E
25|$|The F-35 was {{evaluated}} along with JAS 39 Gripen by the Norwegian Future Combat Aircraft Capability Project {{as a replacement}} for the F-16s currently in-service. On 20 November 2008, the government released a statement saying it will support buying F-35s for the Royal Norwegian Air Force instead of the Gripen <b>NG.</b> <b>The</b> government's reasoning for choosing the F-35 over Gripen was that only the US aircraft supposedly fulfilled the operational requirements, and that it was allegedly offered at a more competitive price than the Swedish fighter. This has been strongly criticized by Saab, saying that Norway made errors when calculating the cost for Gripen NG vs the cost for the JSF.|$|E

30|$|For Case B and D, <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> system {{includes}} <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> storage VG 1. Case A and C, NG {{storage is}} not considered.|$|R
30|$|Similarly, in Case B <b>the</b> {{modeling}} of <b>NG</b> storage flattens <b>the</b> marginal costs of NG (compared to Case A), reducing the scattering and achieving an economic {{benefit to the}} sector (Fig.  9). This is because, in stages of higher <b>NG</b> demand, <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> storage runs as a gas producer, competing with <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> wells.|$|R
2500|$|Gregory <b>Ng,</b> <b>the</b> self-proclaimed [...] "Frozen Food Master," [...] {{served as}} the host for each episode of Freezerburns. Each episode began with the Freezerburns theme song written and sung by {{independent}} artist Skyrmish. Along with written reviews available on the Freezerburns website, Greg hosted different types of reviews, among them full length reviews, one word reviews, [...] "Fro-Down" [...] reviews, which featured a comparison between two similar items, and Live reviews. Ng's style was relaxed, speaking casually to the audience. He displayed the frozen dish, and, after cooking, commented on its taste, sometimes upon the first bite. Each episode ended with a [...] "question of the day," [...] which helped Ng interact with his followers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{explanation}} of the letter ng also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ng, but by King Sejong's day, initial ng was either silent or pronounced [...] in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of <b>ng</b> (<b>the</b> short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of [...] ) would have looked almost identical to the vowel [...] Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from [...] {{was added to the}} null symbol [...] to create [...] (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation [...] in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null [...] and ng [...] was eventually lost.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In German, the g {{is mostly}} a hard g, also before e and i: geben (to give), Geld (money), Gier (greed), Gift (poison, venom). Soft g occurs in loanwoards (Girokonto, Orange, rangieren, [...] but agieren, Generation, for example, are {{pronounced}} with a hard g). Some pronunciations vary: The word Giraffe is pronounced with a soft G in Austria, but with a hard G in Germany. The g in Magnet is pronounced as a hard g, but the gn in Champagner is pronounced like the French gn in champagne. In the letter combination <b>ng,</b> <b>the</b> g is only weakly spoken, e.g., in the German word Finger, {{it is not as}} clearly audible as in the English word finger. The same is true for German Sänger and English singer. However, in the verb fingieren, the hard g is clearly audible.|$|E

30|$|The Argentinean Natural Gas System (ANGS) {{has three}} main {{productive}} NG basins: Northwest, Neuquén and Austral. Also, {{there are two}} pipelines coming from Bolivia {{that allow them to}} import up to 17 MMCM/days (Mega standard cubic meters per day (106  m 3 /days), commonly used in <b>NG</b> sector). <b>The</b> <b>NG</b> supply has been increased from 2008 with the injection of regasified LNG (liquefied NG). For this purpose, two maritime ports (southern and northern Buenos Aires) were conditioned to allow the connection of LNG regasification vessels to inject gas into <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> network. For this, floating storage and regasification units (FSRU) with 14 MMCM/days of maximum injection capacity were rented. For the LNG delivery from LNG carriers to the FSRU without interrupting <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> supply into <b>the</b> network, a ship-to-ship LNG transfer configuration was implemented. <b>The</b> <b>NG</b> transportation system consists of a set of pipelines that start in <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> basins and converge in Buenos Aires (city gate). <b>The</b> <b>NG</b> transportation system has a total of 52 compressor stations. In all stations, NG-fired turbines burn a small portion of <b>NG</b> from <b>the</b> pipeline to generate the energy needed to run the compressors.|$|R
30|$|Comparing both figures, <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> {{injection}} peak {{achieved in}} Case D {{is greater than}} in Case C, due to the additional injection capacity of <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> storage in <b>the</b> peak demand period (stages 6, 7).|$|R

If <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> is to respond as efficiently as possible, <b>the</b> <b>NG</b> leadership must be educated on preparation for and response to disasters.
