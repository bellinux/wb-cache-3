5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> (or equivalently when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that {{take advantage of the}} parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E
5|$|Laser {{data are}} also used {{horizontally}} in two dimensions. An algorithm provides a real-time position estimation of the robot when enough elements from the landing gears and engines are visible.

This mode is particularly used when the robot moves beneath the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. To craft such weapons, the player must use a workbench, possess either the necessary schematics or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items needed to make them. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each weapon's schematic has three copies that can be found, and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or <b>number)</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> produced at the workbench, while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E

5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is an action-adventure game {{presented}} in stereoscopic 3D polygonal graphics, with gameplay predominantly experienced from a top-down perspective. Players control {{a young boy}} named Link, who embarks on an adventure to rescue the Seven Sages and defeat Yuga, the game's primary antagonist. The game is set in two kingdoms—Hyrule and Lorule—both of which bear an open world structure and similar layout, but contrast in style and tone. A Link Between Worlds {{is seen as a}} successor to the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title , and is similar in many aspects.

5|$|There are a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> {{scattered}} around the castle, of which the player may carry up to three at a time. Some of these are always {{in the same place}} {{at the start of the}} game, whereas others are distributed randomly. Items include differently-coloured keys which will unlock their respective doors, the three pieces of the ACG key, and other items that affect certain enemies or are mere red herrings. Common enemies appear in each room upon entering and will attack the player on sight. Collision with these enemies destroys them but drains a portion of the player's health. There are also stationary poisonous fungi which will drain health constantly if the player is in contact with them, and enemies that require special items in order to either distract, repel or kill them, otherwise they remain invulnerable to conventional attacks. Bosses guard pieces of the ACG key, and contact with them will rapidly drain away the player's health.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{supporting}} characters that consistently appear throughout the episodes. Bosco is {{the proprietor of}} the nearby convenience store and supplies the Freelance Police with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> across the game. Driven paranoid by repeated shoplifting, Bosco is obsessed with conspiracies, believing that nearly every US government agency, {{as well as many}} criminal outfits, are after him. As such, his store is overwhelmed with security devices and contraptions created by Bosco himself. He regularly attempts to disguise himself as a variety of foreign nationals, but to little effect. Further down the neighborhood is Sybil Pandemik, who owns a small office across from Sam and Max. Sybil is unable to keep a consistent job and regularly changes her career choices. Introduced as a psychotherapist, she is noted to have worked as a tattoo artist, software tester, tabloid journalist and professional witness. In a hole in Sam and Max's own office resides Jimmy Two-Teeth, a rat who works as a petty criminal, confidence trickster and fence. He profusely dislikes Sam and Max, who he sees as always interfering with his work.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Compact Disc, the various labels for which Horowitz {{recorded}} began reissuing his pre-digital recordings. This began in the mid-1980s and increased in the years immediately following Horowitz’s death. Beginning in 1987, Columbia issued single-composer compilations drawn from various albums. RCA Victor issued many of Horowitz’s recordings on their Gold Seal mid-priced label. By 1993, both Columbia's and RCA's entire cache of previously issued recordings was available on CD, including several older items which had never appeared on LP. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> were issued more than once, including the 1978 recording of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 which was issued on CD in 1987, again in 1993, with a new cover, and in a new remastering in 2000. Over the past two decades, several previously unavailable Horowitz recordings have been issued. These include studio and live recordings from the Columbia era, and a collection from Carnegie Hall recitals between 1945 and 1951 which were recorded privately by Horowitz. In addition, several smaller labels have issued CDs made from bootleg recordings from the 1960s onward and several of Horowitz’s stereo recordings have been issued in the blu-spec and SHM-CD (Super High Material) formats.|$|E
5|$|As a {{survival}} horror title, Resident Evil 2 features {{the same basic}} gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, Resident Evil. The player explores a fictional city while solving puzzles and fighting monsters. The game's two protagonists may be equipped with firearms, but limited ammunition adds a tactical element to weapon use. On the status screen, the player can check {{the condition of the}} protagonists, use medicine to heal their wounds, and assign weapons. The characters' current health can also be determined by their posture and movement speed. For example, a character will hold their stomach in pain if wounded, and will limp slowly if on the verge of death. The protagonists may carry a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items,</b> and must store others in boxes placed throughout the game world, where they may later be retrieved. Each protagonist is joined by a support partner {{during the course of the}} story. These characters accompany the player in certain scenes, and occasionally become playable. Certain rooms contain typewriters that the player may use to save the game. However, each save expends one of a limited number of ink ribbons, which the player must collect in the game world. The graphics of Resident Evil 2 are composed of real-time generated– and thus movable– polygonal character and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds that are viewed from fixed camera angles.|$|E
