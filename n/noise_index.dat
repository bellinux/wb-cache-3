40|$|Abstract: Chronic sleep {{disturbance}} induced by traffic noise {{is considered to}} cause environmental sleep disorder, which {{increases the risk of}} cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and other stress-related diseases. However, <b>noise</b> <b>indices</b> for the evaluation of {{sleep disturbance}} are not based on the neurophysiological process of awakening regulated by the brainstem. In this study, through the neurophysiological approach, we attempted (1) to investigate the thresholds of awakening due to external stimuli in the brainstem; (2) to evaluate the dynamic characteristics in the brainstem and (3) to verify the validity of existing <b>noise</b> <b>indices.</b> Using the mathematical Phillips–Robinson model, we obtained thresholds of awakening in the brainstem for different durations of external stimuli. The analysis revealed that the brainstem seemed insensitive to short stimuli and that the response to external stimuli in the brainstem could be approximated by a first-order lag system with a time constant of 10 – 100 s. These results suggest that the brainstem did not integrate sound energy as external stimuli, but neuroelectrical signals from auditory nerve. To understand the awakening risk accumulated in the brainstem, we introduced a new concept of “awakening potential ” instead of sound energy...|$|R

30|$|As {{part of the}} MBCT protocol, {{patients}} {{fast for}} 6 hours prior to the exam. No bowel preparation or nasogastric tube insertion is needed. An oral solution of 9 % Telebrix- 38 (meglumine ioxitalamate; Tyco healthcare, Quebec, Canada) is administered rather than 3 % used for most standard CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. This oral contrast has a high attenuation (500 to 600 HU), increasing contrast resolution on this unenhanced CT protocol. Denser oral contrast cannot be used as it would cause beam hardening artifacts. Patients drink 300 ml aliquots of 9 % of oral contrast every 15 minutes over 60 minutes, for a total volume of 1200 ml. The isotonic nature of the 9 % oral contrast gives better distension of the bowel lumen compared to water or other lower osmolal solutions, since there is physiologically less absorption of the isotonic solution by the small bowel. The hyperdense oral contrast is visible on scout images, thus when it {{is seen in the}} ascending colon, this indicates satisfactory opacification of the small bowel. A <b>Noise</b> <b>Index</b> of 28 is used with Auto-mA modulation on 16 or 64 -slice scanners (GE Lightspeed, VCT LightSpeed (Germany)) compared to a typical <b>noise</b> <b>index</b> of 12 – 18 for a standard abdominopelvic CT scan. Image noise (GE Healthcare, <b>noise</b> <b>index</b> [NI]) is an operator-selected variable which alters the range of mA over which an automated tube current modulation varies during gantry rotation. In this way, one can produce a selected level of average noise in an image [1]. This higher <b>noise</b> <b>index</b> can be used in of the MBCT because there is inherent high contrast between the hyperdense oral contrast used in this CT protocol, and the bowel wall. The combination of high <b>Noise</b> <b>Index</b> and Auto-mA modulation reduces patient radiation dose. Remaining parameters include 120 kV, mA range of 100 to 240 mA, a 0.5 sec gantry rotation and a pitch of 1, with slice reconstruction of 0.5 to 1.25 mm, depending on the scanner used. Prone and supine scanning ensures opacification of all parts of the small bowel, but at the discretion of the radiologist, the prone scan can be omitted, particularly in follow-up studies.
