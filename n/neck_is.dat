5|$|Mantises have large, {{triangular}} {{heads with}} a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, {{and a pair}} of antennae. The articulation of the <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180°.|$|E
5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and {{the skin of the}} head and <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E
5|$|The female half has karanda-mukuta (a basket-shaped crown) on {{her head}} or well-combed knotted hair or both. The left ear wears a valika-kundala (a type of earring). A tilaka or bindu (a round red dot) adorns her forehead, {{matching}} Shiva's third eye. The left eye is painted with black eyeliner. While the male <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> sometimes adorned with a jewelled hooded serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Necks</b> <b>are</b> {{always made}} of {{multiple}} laminates of hardwood, {{rather than one}} solid block. Three-piece <b>necks</b> <b>are</b> most common.|$|R

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} when murderers multiplied, the {{ceremony}} of breaking a heifer's <b>neck</b> <b>was</b> discontinued.. The Rabbis {{taught in a}} Baraita that when murderers multiplied, the ceremony of breaking a heifer's <b>neck</b> <b>was</b> discontinued, because the ceremony was performed only {{in a case of}} uncertainty about who the murderer was; but when murderers multiplied openly, the ceremony of breaking a heifer's <b>neck</b> <b>was</b> discontinued (because the identity of murderers was no longer uncertain)..|$|R
5|$|Vertebral artery dissection, {{a tear in}} {{the arteries}} in the neck which provide blood to the brain can result from {{rotation}} of the neck while the <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> extended. This can occur {{in a variety of}} contexts, but is an event which could occur in some yoga practices. This is a very serious condition which can result in a stroke.|$|E
5|$|All colors {{other than}} Appaloosa are allowed for registration. Welara Sport Ponies {{may be of}} any color or size, without the {{restrictions}} of the purebred Welara. The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement, spirit and hardiness, as well as good movement. The head is small and slightly , the <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> arched (and prone to be cresty in stallions). The shoulders and croup are long and the back short. Welaras are used mainly in English riding, especially in hunter classes. They are also seen in show jumping, three-day eventing, pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses. Welara/Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes.|$|E
5|$|In non-breeding plumage, the {{nominate}} has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, {{with the}} colour {{on the upper}} portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts {{on the sides of}} the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{buildings}} on the <b>neck</b> <b>were</b> designed by Lindley Johnson, though the first few were designed by Wilson Eyre. The homes on Grindstone <b>Neck</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "cottages" [...] though {{many of them have}} upwards of 7-12 bedrooms.|$|R
5|$|Originally, Borsuk-Białynicka {{assumed that}} in {{standard}} position the <b>neck</b> <b>was</b> horizontal or slanted slightly downward. This {{was based on}} the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament, which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight of the head and neck. Although an S-curved, swan-like ascending <b>neck</b> <b>was</b> envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods, recent studies argue that sauropod <b>necks</b> <b>were</b> relatively straight and were carried more horizontally.|$|R
5000|$|Giraffe's <b>necks</b> <b>are</b> often {{portrayed as}} if they can {{function}} as a ladder, staircase or even a slide. Suffice {{to say that this}} bears no truth in reality, since their <b>necks</b> <b>are</b> not strong enough for this purpose, nor designed to be used that way.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} have {{developed their own}} style in clothing and jewellery, using local products, such as shells. Giving somebody a shell necklace and placing it around the recipients <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> a goodwill and love gesture. They make a type of sarong, called a pareu, which is typically brightly coloured. Like the other islands of Melanesia such as Fiji and Samoa, the Cook Islanders {{are known for their}} hand-painted and silk-screened dress fabrics. An important practice among women is tivaevae, a type of quilting.|$|E
5|$|Mary sits under a brocade canopy or {{cloth of}} honour, painted in brown hues which have since {{discoloured}} to dark green. The canopy hangs {{down to a}} wooden bench attached to the wall behind her. Mary's hair is loose and she wears an embroidered dress lined with fur. Around her <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> a light veil, and she {{is shown in the}} act of nursing. Her dress is a centrepiece of the panel, composed of a variety of blues overlaid with lead white and deep blue lapis lazuli highlights. The inner parts of her robe contain violet coloured fabrics, lined with greyish blues and purples.|$|E
50|$|Sauropod <b>neck</b> posture <b>is</b> {{a subject}} {{occasionally}} debated among scientists, who consider either a horizontal, or upright posture to <b>be</b> how the <b>necks</b> <b>were</b> held habitually.|$|R

5|$|The Man-of-War (as it {{is called}} by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> red. It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees its prey, it flys down head {{foremost}} to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The adult sarus crane is {{very large}} with grey wings and body; a bare red head {{and part of}} the upper neck; a greyish crown; and a long greenish-grey pointed bill. In flight, the long <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> held straight, unlike that of an heron, which folds it back, and the black wing tips can be seen; the crane's long pink legs trail behind them. This bird has a grey ear covert patch, an orange-red iris and a greenish-grey bill. Juveniles have a {{yellowish}} base to the bill and the brown-grey head is fully feathered.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} is omnivorous {{and although}} mainly a scavenger, it preys on frogs and large insects and will also take birds, reptiles and rodents. It {{has been known}} to attack wild ducks coming within reach and swallowing them whole. Their main diet however is carrion and like the vultures their bare head and <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> an adaptation. They are often found on garbage dumps and will feed on animal and human excreta. In 19th-century Calcutta, they fed on partly burnt human corpses disposed along the Ganges river. In Rajasthan, where it is extremely rare, it has been reported to feed on swarms of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but this has been questioned.|$|E

5|$|The head is well-proportioned {{and similar}} to that of the Selle Francais, with wide nostrils, small ears and a {{straight}} or convex facial profile. The <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes roached. The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The hindquarters are powerful, although not so much as in heavy draft breeds, and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E
5|$|The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, {{sometimes}} {{having a}} black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> short and thick. It swims {{very low in}} the water, with sometimes only its head held above and horizontal to water. It must run across the water surface to get in flight. During flight, its head is slightly lower than its body, with its feet trailing behind. It has a skeletal structure {{made up of a}} number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and filled with air to make the lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.|$|E
5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> the same diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing {{abilities of the}} river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E
5|$|Turtles are {{notable for}} their {{protective}} shells. They have an inflexible trunk {{encased in a}} horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth {{have been replaced by}} sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.|$|E
5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its {{head back and}} then arches it forward into the water, with the body {{following}} and a slight springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming {{on the surface of}} the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The <b>neck</b> <b>is</b> held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E
