40|$|In {{this work}} the {{fracture}} toughness of epoxy resin has been improved through {{the addition of}} low loading of single part and hybrid nanofiller materials. Functionalised multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) was used as single filler, increased the critical strain energy release rate, GIC, by 57 % compared to the <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy,</b> at only 0. 1 wt% filler content. Importantly, no degradation in the tensile or thermal properties of the nanocomposite was observed compared to the <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy.</b> When two-dimensional boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) were added along with the one-dimensional f-MWCNTs, the fracture toughness increased further to 71. 6 % {{higher than that of}} the <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy.</b> Interestingly, when functionalised graphene nanoplatelets (f-GNPs) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) were used as hybrid filler, the fracture toughness of <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy</b> is improved by 91. 9 %.

40|$|The {{environmental}} degradation mechanisms of epoxy-organoclay natiocomposites due to accelerated UV and moisture exposure are studied. Various characterisation tools, including FTIR, SEM, XRD and XRF analyses, {{were used to}} evaluate the effects of clay content on the progressive changes in chemical element, topography and colour of the nanocomposite. It is found that microcracks started to appear on both the <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy</b> and nanocomposite surface after about 300 h of UV exposure. The nanocomposite exhibited thicker and shallower cracks with a less degree of discoloration than the <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy</b> due to the diffusion barrier characteristics of organoclay with high aspect ratio. The presence of transition metal ions along with low-molecular-weight organic modifiers in organoclay, however, accelerated the degradation of polymer, counterbalancing the above ameliorating barrier properties of clay. FTIR analysis indicated that photo-degradation generated carbonyl groups by chain scission and the rate was slightly higher for the nanocomposites than for the <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy.</b> While moisture further accelerated the photo-degradation process through the enhanced mobility of free radicals and ions, the organoclay could limit the deteriorating effect of moisture, resulting in much better overall resistance to photo-degradation in the presence of moisture for the nanocomposite than the <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy.</b> (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{experimental}} investigation {{reports on}} the durability of epoxy-clay nanocomposites upon exposure to multiple environments. Nanocomposites are fabricated by mixing the clay particles using various combinations of mechanical mixing, high-shear dispersion, and ultrasonication. Clay morphology is characterized using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Specimens of both <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy</b> and the epoxy-clay nanocomposite are subjected to two environmental conditions: combined UV radiation and condensation on 3 -hour repeat cycle and constant temperature-humidity, for a total exposure duration of 4770 hours. The presence of nanoscale clay inhibits moisture uptake, as demonstrated by exposure to constant temperature-humidity. Nonetheless, both materials lose mass under exposure to combined UV radiation and condensation due to the erosion of epoxy by a synergistic process. Surprisingly, the epoxy-clay specimens exhibit greater mass loss, as compared to <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy.</b> Mechanical testing shows that either environment does not significant affect the flexure modulus of either material.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. It is {{well known}} that the {{mechanical}} performance and fracture behavior of a thermosetting composite is inherently determined by the properties and characteristics of its constituents. However, the performance and behavior is also drastically influenced by the viscoelastic properties and status of the material during the cure process. This brings about a need to possess knowledge of the cure history of any composite product. Such knowledge is attainable by monitoring the material response to temperature and pressure cycles throughout the cure process. Nevertheless, changes to the cure and, equivalently, the manufacturing process influences the final cost of a composite product, thus, making it crucial to select an optimum cure profile conducive to both the desired thermo-mechanical properties as well as minimum cost. The present work investigates the cure kinetics and process behavior of a commercial carbon-fiber thermoplastic-toughened epoxy resin prepreg, IM 7 / 977 - 2 UD. Experimental data and theoretical models are mostly demonstrated in the form of cure time and temperature functions, f(t,T). A comprehensive cure map is constructed based on this data in order to provide all the necessary information for design of an optimum cure profile. Material properties are measured over a broad range of isothermal cure profiles using advanced analytical techniques such as shear rheometry and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Shear rheometry is utilized to quantify some important viscoelastic properties, such as complex viscosity (η*), shear storage modulus (G′), and shear loss modulus (G″), as well as to identify important cure transitions like gelation and vitrification. Thermal properties are obtained using DSC. These include heat flow (dH/dt), glass transition temperature (Tg), and degree of conversion (α). Before performing DSC experiments it is necessary to know a material’s decomposition temperature, and this is obtained through the use of Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Since the material studied in this work is a thermoplastic-toughened epoxy prepreg, a variety of discrepancies in comparison to the kinetics of <b>neat</b> <b>epoxies</b> are observed. These inconsistencies invariably show up as variations in the values of Tg, ultimate heat of reaction (HU), and rate of reaction (dα/dt). For the 977 - 2 material, it is concluded that the addition of the thermoplastic agent to the epoxy significantly affects the progress of chemical reactions in addition to imparting a step transition in the progress of Tg at elevated isothermal cure temperatures (Tcure ≥ 180 °C). Furthermore, it is concluded that the existence of fibers among the polymer monomers alter the flow-ability of resin molecules throughout the cure process, resulting in early vitrification and lower HU over the entire range of Tcure. The variations observed in the values of HU at various Tcure may result in either under- or overestimation of α regardless of the relationship utilized to calculate it. In addition, a unique one-to-one relationship is established between Tg and α. Regarding the uncertainties present in the calculation of α, it is concluded that Tg is a better estimate {{of the state of the}} material at every desired stage of cure...|$|R

Scanning electron micrographs of the fracture surfaces for samples tested in tension and fracture showed the transition of epoxy behavior from brittle-to-ductile-to-brittle with increasing weight percentage of nanoparticles.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} beneficial effect of the variable frequency microwave (VFM) technology to cure thermosetting prepreg laminates. Further, it was to investigate the interrelationship and effect on the curing process of frequency, band width, and curing time with different types of laminates. Previous studies of microwave-assisted curing of <b>neat</b> resins (<b>epoxy)</b> and unidirectional glass and carbon fiber laminates with a fixed frequency of 2. 45 GHz, have shown that a substantial reduction in the curing time was obtained. Results of this earlier work indicate that the microwave-assisted curing of multidirectional glass fiber laminates also show a substantial reduction of the required curing time. This may be explained by the penetration of microwave energy directly and throughout the laminate with enhancement of the kinetics of the chemical reaction. The fixed frequency microwave radiation of 2. 45 GHz has been demonstrated to be a partially acceptable method to cure unidirectional carbon fiber laminates. Multidirectional carbon fiber/epoxy laminates demonstrate a lack of coupling during the curing process. A direct curing of these laminates was not possible by microwave radiation with the experimental approach used in agreement with previous work. In addition to this short coming, the unidirectional laminate samples cured with the fixed frequency are visually nonuniform. Localized areas of darker colors (burn, hot spots, overheating) are attributed to the formation of standing waves within the microwave cavity. For this reason, the laminates are subject to proper rotation while curing through fixed frequency. The present research indicates that variable frequency microwave technology is a sound and acceptable processing method to effectively cure uni-, bi- or multi-directional thermosetting glass fiber laminates. Also, this methodology will effectively cure unidirectional thermosetting carbon fiber laminates. For all these cases, this technology yielded a substantial reduction in the required cure time of these laminates. Multidirectional carbon fiber laminates demonstrated a lack of coupling of VFM energy during the curing process...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} failure {{behaviour}} {{of the matrix}} constituent found in composite materials. The investigation involves performing several experiments under both biaxial and uniaxial loading and subsequent finite element analyses of the experiment results. The results were used to establish a suitable matrix failure criterion. The need to understand matrix failure in advanced composites is of particular importance to the aerospace industry, where these materials are used in structural components which are optimised to be light weight yet strong. Experiments under biaxial tension required the designing of a suitable biaxial test fixture and a specimen design which is able to successfully demonstrate failure free of stress concentrators. In order to prevent any premature failure due to load interactions between two loading axes, removal of the cut-out corners found in cruciform specimens was very important. Reducing the central gauge region of the specimen {{was found to be}} the best way to induce a higher stress state within a predefined region of the specimen. The specimen design proposed focussed on testing material systems which are anisotropic in behaviour yet fail in the transverse direction. The biaxial tension experiments on a carbon-epoxy composite (EP 280 Prepreg) was accompanied with biaxial tension experiments on a <b>neat</b> resin <b>epoxy</b> material (EP 280 neat resin) and uniaxial off-axis tension experiments on the same material. Despite the differences in the experiments, the failure observed across them was predominantly the same where matrix tensile failure occurred. A fourth set of experiments were performed on uniaxial off-axis compression specimens to induce a compressive matrix failure mode. Over these four sets of experiments, the matrix failure envelope was able to be fully defined. Continuum modelling techniques were implemented through the use of representative volume elements to separately analyse the stress-strain states on the fibre and the matrix. The separation technique allowed the failure stress-strain states on the matrix to be examined in detail from which a failure criterion was established. Matrix failure was found to exhibit two modes of failure induced by the type of deformation (dilatational and distortional). The established failure criterion was similar to that proposed by Onset theory where a truncated region defined by the First Stress/Strain Invariant best captured matrix tensile failure (dilatational), whilst the Drucker-Prager failure criterion best described compressive and shear modes of failure (distortional). The study was concluded through a set of experiments performed under four-point bending which validated the hybrid failure criterion to accurately predict matrix failure in composites...|$|R

Different methods and approaches {{can be found in the}} literature to fabricate composite structures reinforced by MWCNTs, mostly involving two-component epoxy resin systems. For all applications, a good dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix is crucial to obtain the expected results. Unlike two-component resins, mono-component systems show a strong temperature dependent viscosity, but have the limit that, due to the premixed amine curing elements, crosslinking reactions occur if too much heat is transferred to the resin. In this study we present an investigation of the mechanical and thermal properties, from the nano- to the macro-scale, of an aerospace-grade monocomponent epoxy system (RTM 6) reinforced with different weight percentage of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The nanoindentation technique was used to determine the hardness and the modulus at the nanoscale of the MWCNT-reinforced epoxy system, whereas tensile tests were performed to determine the ultimate strain and the elastic modulus at the macro-scale. In addition, the thermal properties of the composite systems were investigated by measuring the thermal expansion coefficient so to determine the effects of the MWCNTs on the dimensional stability of the RTM 6 composite structures...|$|R
40|$|A new self-lubricating, wear {{resistant}} epoxy resin material (ER+DCi) has been obtained by {{addition of a}} 9 wt. % of the room-temperature protic ionic liquid (PIL) tri-[bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) ammonium) ] citrate (DCi) to the mixture of the prepolymer and the hardener composed of a mixture of amines. The highly polar tricationic protic ammonium carboxylate ionic liquid shows a high contact angle on the resin surface and distributes inside the epoxy matrix as spheres of around 50 µm in diameter, with a mean density of approximately 38 mm 2. The presence of the ionic liquid fluid phase inside the cavities has been determined by SEM observation of fracture surfaces and FTIR microscopy. The DCi phase reduces the residual curing enthalpy and the glass transition temperature, as determined by DSC, without significantly changing microhardness or electrical resistivity values. DMA analysis shows that DCi reduces storage modulus, loss modulus and tan δ values. The tribological performance of the new material has been {{compared with that of}} the <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy</b> resin under pin-on-disc sliding conditions. ER+DCi shows more than 50 % reduction of the friction coefficient with respect to <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy</b> resin, and no surface damage, in contrast with the severe wear that takes place in the case of <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy</b> resin.

In this work, we have synthesized SCF wrapped HPG shell (SCF-g-HPG) by a "grafting from" strategy for the strong interfacial interaction between fillers and matrix. It {{was found that the}} thermal and mechanical properties of epoxy composites were greatly improved by incorporating SCF-g-HPG. For example, the impact strength, flexural strength, tensile strength, Young's modulus and toughness of the composites with 3. 0 wt% SCF-g-HPG loading were 38. 35 KJ/m(2), 123. 40 MPa, 86. 62 MPa, 151. 7 MPa, and 417. 84 MJ/m(3), significantly increased by 119. 1 %, 55. 2 %, 45. 6 %, 43. 1 %, and 166. 1 % respectively, as compared with <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy.</b> In addition, thermal stability of SCF-g-HPG/epoxy composites also showed an obvious enhancement compared with <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy...</b>|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the influence of cutting parameters (Cutting speed and Feed rate) on drilling multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) filled epoxy / glass fabric hybrid polymeric nanocomposite. For comparison <b>neat</b> <b>epoxy</b> / glass fabric polymeric composite was also fabricated. Drilling tests were carried out on these materials with HSS twist drill of diameter 6 mm. Optimal cutting conditions were found using grey relational analysis by simultaneously considering the surface delaminations of the drilled holes at the entrance and exit sides. Surface delaminations of the drilled holes were quantified in terms of delamination factor. From the mean grey relational grades, it is observed that the multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has significant effect in improving the drilled hole quality.

40|$|M. Tech. Among the {{materials}} {{being used for}} gas sensors, metal oxides {{are the most important}} materials because of their potential to detect many gases at low concentrations. Nevertheless, sensors made of metal oxide need to be operated at high temperatures (above 200 °C) and have a weak sel ectivity. In order to overcome this difficulty, {{the materials}} are being investigated for gas sensing applications. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials with unique properties, such as high electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, nanometer–scale sizes, and high aspect ratio. Their adsorption ability and high surface area make them attractive as gas sensing materials, which have been intensively studied. CNTs can be used solely or combined with metals and oxides materials in order to constitute efficient gas sensors. In the present research, multi–walled CNTs (MWCNTs) were coated with tin dioxide (SnO 2) and incorporated into two epoxy resins with widely different mechanical properties in order to study the effect of CNTs on the morphology, mechanical, electrical, and sensing properties of the composites. In the MWCNT/polymer composite study, Epon 828 was used as the polymer matrix and D– 2000 (which gives rubbery composites) and T– 403 (which gives glassy composites) as the hardeners. Composite were prepared with 0. 1 wt. % MWCNTs in an epoxy matrix. Pristine MWCNTs (MWCNTs not treated with any acid and therefore used as received) and SnO 2 –MWCNTs were used for comparison and a two–step curing procedure was used with initial temperature set at 75 °C for 3 hours, followed by additional 3 hours at 125 °C. The sample s were characterized for morphology, mechanical, thermo–mechanical and electrical properties using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), an Instron tensile tester, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and Cascade Microtech four–point probe, respectively. In both cases, strong covalent bonds were created as a bridge between the CNTs and matrix, but due to differences in viscosity, the nanotubes dispersion was much better in the rubbery epoxy resin than in the glassy epoxy resin. A 77 % increase in tensile modulus was observed in the rubbery system using 0. 1 wt. % SnO 2 –MWCNTs compared to the <b>neat</b> rubbery <b>epoxy.</b> As for the glassy epoxy based composite, only a 3 % improvement in tensile modulus could be observed. In addition to the mechanical properties, the presence of CNTs has demonstrated a material with high vi electrical conductivity. But for the surface measurements during the gas sensing analysis, the conductivity was very low for the composites to be used for this application as envisioned. MWCNTs coated with SnO 2 nanoparticles used in the present study, were synthesized by a microwave synthesis method. The composite samples were characterized by X–ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area analysis. These techniques gave evidence for surface and chemical modifications of the synthesized composites. The results showed microwave synthesis to be a very efficient method in producing CNTs that are densely coated and well dispersed with SnO 2 nanoparticles {{in a very short time}} (total reaction time of 10 minutes). Microwave synthesis is particularly interesting because of the energy used, the higher temperature homogeneity and the shorter reaction times led to nanoparticles with high crystallinity and a narrow particle size distribution. Controlling the morphology by varying synthesis conditions such as temperature, pressure and time is also possible...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. In this study, a brittle epoxy {{polymer resin}} has {{successfully}} been toughened and strengthened by very small concentrations of diamond and SiC nanoparticles {{as well as}} Nanodiamonds (collectively called "nanoparticles" here). The tensile stress-strain response (based on the ASTM tensile tests for polymers) and the fracture energy release rate, GIC, (based on the ASTM Single-Edge-Notched-Bending, SENB, tests for polymers) of <b>neat</b> and nano-reinforced <b>epoxy</b> polymer were characterized over a range of "nanoparticle" concentrations. In addition to the large-scale improvements in mechanical properties, the nanoresins developed in this work also showed other superior multifunctional performances such as structural damping and acoustic properties. In the later part of this study, horizontally (in-plane, i. e., completely parallel to the surface) aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT with diameters of less than 100 nm) nanocarpet-nanotapes are developed as reinforcements to enhance the overall performance of resins, adhesives, and composites, globally (when it is interleaved within the composites to cover or "carpet" the entire surface of the parts) or locally (when {{it is used to}} locally reinforce the locations of joints, cut-outs, holes, etc, where stress concentrations exist). In addition to large scale improvements in mechanical properties, the nanocomposites developed in this work also showed enhanced multifunctional performance such as damping, electro-magnetic interference shielding (EMI), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and Thermal Conductivity. Finally, we report the use of chemically modified vertically aligned carbon nanotube nanoforest nanofilm directly assembled on carbon paper as Gas Diffusion Layers (GDLs) for fuel cells. GDLs enhance the delivery of gases to the catalyst layers by controlling the water in the pore channels while simultaneously completing the electrical and electronic circuits needed to deliver the power generated by the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cells. Current carbon paper products for the GDLs offer limited hydrophobic characteristics which are often enhanced by a Teflon® PTFE coating on the surfaces of the carbon paper. Our invention substantially improves both the hydrophobic nature of the carbon paper and its porosity in the fuel cell as well as enhances the electrical conductivity and the electron/proton conduction. While the GDLs prepared by current technology have major performance losses at elevated temperatures and low humidities, our modified GDL based on the nanoforest nanofilm carbon paper technology, developed in this work, shows no performance loss when operated at elevated temperatures with lower humidity conditions in additon to the enhancement in peak power density...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2016. Major: Material Science and Engineering. Advisors: Frank Bates, Lorraine Francis. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 269 pages. The great commercial importance of several brittle plastics continuously drives research efforts to {{be devoted to}} fabricating well defined structures in these materials for effectively toughening them. Amphiphilic block copolymers can be appropriately designed to generate nanometer scaled structures in a brittle plastic matrix at relatively low loadings (< 5 % by weight). The resultant nanostructured plastics exhibit significant toughness enhancement without sacrificing other desirable properties such as transparency, stiffness and use temperature. The goal of this dissertation is to understand the nanostructure formation of block copolymers and the consequent toughening effect under various conditions. In this work we designed different types of block copolymer modifiers in concert with several commercially important brittle plastics, including epoxy thermosets and poly(lactide) (PLA) thermoplastics. The block copolymer toughening strategy was first established in bulk epoxies {{as well as in}} epoxy coatings through a model system study with the Jeffamine resin. Two distinct types of diblock copolymers formed spherical micelles in cured bulk epoxies and 15 micrometer thick coatings, but the process of solvent-casting affected the micelle size and distribution in the coating. The toughness enhancement observed in bulk epoxies (up to 5 -fold increase in the critical strain energy release rate GIc) successfully translated to coatings, as evidenced by the over 40 % increase in the coating abrasive wear resistance with only 5 wt. % of modifiers. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that similar toughening mechanisms as those in bulk epoxies (micelle cavitation and matrix shear yielding) still held in thin coatings. Moreover, the hardness, modulus, transparency and glass transition temperature (Tg) of modified coatings were not appreciably affected compared to unmodified ones. Based on this model system study, we proceeded to investigate the commercially viable Cardolite resin system that is more complex thermodynamically but industrially relevant. A series of poly(ethylene oxide) -b-poly(butylene oxide) (PEO-PBO) diblock copolymers were synthesized at fixed composition (31 % PEO by volume) and varying molecular weight expanding on a commercial product under the tradename Fortegra™ 100. Direct application of this product resulted in little improvement of the poor fracture toughness of the cured material. Modification of the resin formulation and curing protocol {{led to the development of}} well-defined spherical and branched wormlike micelles in cured resins. Thermodynamic interactions and the curing reaction together controlled the micelle formation as evidenced by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. A 9 -fold increase in GIc over the <b>neat</b> bulk <b>epoxy,</b> and an over 30 % improvement in the coating abrasive wear resistance over the unmodified coating were achieved at 5 wt. % loading of wormlike micelles. We then took one step further to explore the toughening efficacy of block copolymer micelles in hybrid composite systems in the presence of a second type of modifier, rigid graphene fillers with amine-functionalization. Both types of modifiers were well dispersed in cured epoxies with no observable interactions under TEM. The crosslink density of the epoxy network strongly affected the toughening effect. In the matrix with the lowest crosslink density, the combination of micelles and graphene drastically enhanced the GIc value to 19 times that of the neat material with no reduction in the elastic modulus and Tg. Additionally, hybrid ternary composites exhibited a synergistic toughening effect, revealing some positive mutual interference to the toughening mechanisms noted for micelles and graphene particles. Lastly, we extended the block copolymer toughening strategy to the PLA thermoplastic matrix. A low molar mass PEO-PBO diblock copolymer was uniformly dispersed as short cylindrical micelles in a commercial high molecular weight glassy PLLA plastic. This structure formation resulted from the negative Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (X) between PEO and PLLA. Those micelles could effectively toughen the matrix through concurrent cavitation, crazing and shear yielding. At only 5 wt. % of loading, micelles led to a greater than 10 -fold increase in the tensile toughness and notched Izod impact strength over the neat PLLA in the glassy state. This toughening effect was retained in plastic films prepared with modified blends via a film blowing process...|$|R
