When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief. Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E

25|$|During {{election}} night, Milanović gave {{an interview}} to the three major television networks where he congratulated Ivo Josipović and called on Jadranka Kosor {{to hold a meeting}} with him where they would discuss the major political differences between their two parties {{and find a way to}} agree on how to help the economy further. The prime minister responded the very same <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> congratulated Josipović saying she invited the opposition leader for a coffee over six months ago claiming he refused. Milanović responded the next day by saying he doesn't want finger-pointing, but a constructive discussion about jobs, the budget and tax reform. They came to an agreement the following week and they held a meeting on 21 January.|$|E

60|$|She {{realized}} then, {{with one}} of those sudden quivers of her sensibilities, to which, alas! she had become so accustomed of late, that he had always met her thus in the gloom--always chosen <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> could scarce see him distinctly, and this recollection still further enhanced that eerie feeling of terror which had assailed her since that fateful moment in the vestry.|$|R
60|$|On the <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> Mattie was {{not there}} his speech was labored (as the elders noticed), but on the blessed <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> came and sang, her voice, amid all the rest, came to him, and uttered poetry and peace like a rill of cool sweet water. And afterward, when he walked home under the stars, his mind went with her, she was so strong and lithe and good to see. He did not realize the {{worshiping}} attitude the girl took before divine duties.|$|R
25|$|It {{was on the}} way to the Mediterranean on 21 February that a great tragedy occurred. Franchise and her convoy were in Falmouth Roads on {{a stormy}} <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> ran into the {{transport}} John & Jane, under the command of Captain Grimbsy, almost cutting her in two. The conditions were too severe to launch boats and the damage to the transport was so complete that almost all aboard her drowned. She was carrying elements of the 11th Regiment of Foot, 197 of whom died, as did 15 women, six children, and six seamen; 20 soldiers and eight seamen survived. Franchise had signaled that she was about to tack and had John & Jane responded with lights the accident might have been averted. Franchise herself suffered little damage and no casualties.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} Bryant High School in 1924, Merman {{was hired as}} a stenographer by the Boyce-Ite Company. One day during her lunch break, she met Vic Kliesrath, who offered her a job at the Bragg-Kliesrath Corporation for a $5 {{increase}} above the weekly $23 salary she was earning, and Merman accepted the offer. She was eventually made personal secretary to company president Caleb Bragg, whose frequent lengthy absences from the office to race automobiles allowed her to catch up on the sleep she had lost the previous <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was out late performing at private parties. During this period, Merman also began appearing in nightclubs, first hired by Jimmy Durante's partner Lou Clayton. At this time, she decided the name Ethel Zimmermann was too long for a theater marquee. She considered combining Ethel with Gardner or Hunter, which was her grandmother's maiden name. These considerations caused her father's ire, and she abbreviated Zimmermann to Merman to appease her father.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, {{she lost}} her mother, and, as her father had {{in the same year}} been elected member of the Provincial Parliament, necessitating his {{presence}} in Quebec for a considerable portion of the year, the family was, for the time being, broken up; and the above-mentioned uncle, Timothy, sent his son the long winter drive through Vermont and Canadian snowdrifts to bring this favored niece under his own roof. And here, and in the house of another uncle, Thomas Woolson, she spent the next four years, at Claremont, N. H. At the close of this time, her father gathered his family once more about him, in Oberlin, Ohio, where he afterwards held offices of trust under the United States Government. She joined him at that place, and in 1837 entered Oberlin College which had recently been established there, at first with no thought of taking a college course of study; but, as her perception of its advantages widened, she dropped her desultory work and, preparing herself in the languages, entered the class of 1844, becoming one of the earliest young women who pursued a liberal course of education in a co-educational environment She was then at the head of her father's family and found it necessary to do much of her studying at <b>night.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> neared the close of her junior year, her eyesight failed, and it was many years before she regained substantial use of her eyes. In 1845, she received the degree of AB. in 1845.|$|E

500|$|Both Yokoyama and Satou {{noted the}} [...] "Japanese-ness" [...] of the anime during the panel {{discussion}} following the main showing at the Scotland Loves Animation festival. [...] Yokoyama {{had originally been}} concerned that foreign audiences would not fully understand and appreciate the work, but {{the reaction of the}} audience at the Glasgow showing alleviated his concerns. [...] According to Yokoyama and Satou, elements of the story that exhibited strong elements of Japanese culture included the watermelon eating scene, the part where Gin hits young Hotaru over the head with a stick, and the scene where young Hotaru gets scared at <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> sees the face of a yōkai in the patterns of the wood panels on the ceiling.|$|E
500|$|After {{repairs and}} a {{successful}} eastbound crossing, Princess Matoika had {{an encounter with}} an iceberg off Newfoundland while carrying some 2,000Italian immigrants on her first return trip from Italy. On the night of 24February, the fully laden ship struck what was reported in The New York Times as either [...] "an iceberg or a submerged wreck" [...] off Cape Race. The ship's steering gear was damaged in the collision, leaving the ship adrift for over seven hours before repairs were effected. The Matoikas captain indicated that no passengers were hurt in the collision. According {{to the story of}} one third-class passenger, she, suspecting there was something seriously amiss, made inquiry after the commotion. A crew member told her that the Matoika had only stopped to greet a ship passing in the <b>night.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> went on deck, insistent on seeing the other ship herself, she saw the iceberg and observed the first-class passengers queued up to board the already-lowered lifeboats. She took her daughter with her to join one of the queues, and, though initially rebuffed, was allowed to remain. The lifeboats were never deployed, however, and the Matoika arrived in Boston, where she had been diverted due to a typhus scare, on 28February without further incident.|$|E

There were <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was haunted, <b>when</b> I had to stay with her. Vaughn and I have studied her, talked about her, and we think she's gradually recovering.

2500|$|Again {{arrested in}} 1950, she was indicted by the {{communist}} regime and found guilty of [...] "bringing disaster to the country" [...] and economic crimes in general, and of embezzlement in particular.
