50|$|Since the {{interaction}} is nuclear, each isotope {{has a different}} scattering amplitude.

After correcting for molecular binding and multiple scattering from the molecule, we find b_{np} = (- 3. 7384 +/- 0. 0020) fm and b_{nd} = (6. 6649 +/- 0. 0040) fm.

The new world averages for the n-p and n-d coherent <b>scattering</b> <b>lengths,</b> including our new results, are b_{np} = (- 3. 7405 +/- 0. 0009) fm and b_{nd} = (6. 6683 +/- 0. 0030) fm. We compare bnd with the calculations of the doublet and quartet <b>scattering</b> <b>lengths</b> of several nucleon-nucleon potential models and show that almost all known calculations are in disagreement with the precisely measured linear combination corresponding to the coherent <b>scattering</b> <b>length.</b> Combining the world data on b_{nd} with the modern high-precision theoretical calculations of the quartet n-d <b>scattering</b> <b>lengths</b> recently summarized by Friar et al., we deduce a new value for the doublet <b>scattering</b> <b>length</b> of ^{ 2 }a_{nd} = [0. 645 +/- 0. 003 (expt) +/- 0. 007 (theory) ] fm.

50|$|The {{wavelength}} of the neutrons used for reflectivity are typically {{on the order}} of 0.2 to 1 nm (2 to 10 Å). This technique requires a neutron source, which may be either a research reactor or a spallation source (based on a particle accelerator). Like all neutron scattering techniques, neutron reflectometry is sensitive to contrast arising from different nuclei (as compared to electron density, which is measured in x-ray scattering). This allows the technique to differentiate between various isotopes of elements. Neutron reflectometry measures the <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>length</b> density (SLD) and can be used to accurately calculate material density if the atomic composition is known.|$|E
5000|$|Porod's law is {{concerned}} with wave numbers q that are small compared to the scale of usual Bragg diffraction; typically [...] In this range, the sample must not be described at an atomistic level; one rather uses a continuum description {{in terms of an}} electron density or a <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>length</b> density. In a system composed of distinct mesoscopic particles, all small-angle scattering can be understood as arising from surfaces or interfaces. Normally, SAS is measured in order to detect correlations between different interfaces, and in particular, between remote surface segments of one and the same particle. This allows conclusions about {{the size and shape of}} the particles, and their correlations.|$|E
50|$|In zero order {{dynamical}} theory of diffraction the refractive index {{is directly related}} to the scattering length density and is a measure of the strength of the interaction of a neutron wave with a given nucleus. The following table shows the <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>length</b> for a few chemical elements (in 10−12 cm).Note that the relative scale of the scattering lengths is the same. Another important point is that the scattering from hydrogen is distinct from that of deuterium. Also, hydrogen is one of the few elements that has a negative scatter, which means that neutrons deflected from hydrogen are 180° out of phase relative to those deflected by the other elements. These features are important for the technique of contrast variation (see below).|$|E
50|$|X-ray photons scatter by {{interaction}} with the electron cloud of the material, <b>neutrons</b> are <b>scattered</b> by the nuclei. This means that, {{in the presence of}} heavy atoms with many electrons, {{it may be difficult to}} detect light atoms by X-ray diffraction. In contrast, the <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>lengths</b> of most atoms are approximately equal in magnitude. Neutron diffraction techniques may therefore be used to detect light elements such as oxygen or hydrogen in combination with heavy atoms. The neutron diffraction technique therefore has obvious applications to problems such as determining oxygen displacements in materials like high temperature superconductors and ferroelectrics, or to hydrogen bonding in biological systems.|$|R

40|$|Structural {{properties}} such as size, {{shape and}} density distribution {{of a range}} of N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) polymers in various solvent models have been investigated. Common atomistic force fields were compared against rotational barriers and relative conformational energies obtained from ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) data for a monomer and dimer of HPMA. This identified the AMBER 99 parameter set as the most appropriate for representing the structures and so AMBER 99 was employed for all molecular dynamics simulations. MD trajectories were calculated for a range of polymer sizes from 4 to 265 repeat units (2 to 35 kDa). The time averaged radius of gyration was extracted from trajectories and interpreted in the context of Flory's mean field approach. Comparison with data obtained from small angle <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> (SANS) experiments was then used to differentiate between alternative solvent models. The shape adopted by such polymers was evaluated by fitting structures to ellipsoids, to allow separate analysis of radius and density profile along each axis.

40|$|International audienceThe Mn 66 Ga 34 alloy at this {{particular}} composition {{is known to be}} zero alloy in which the linear combination of the two <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>lengths</b> weighted by the atomic compositions vanish. Thus for this specific concentration, the effect of the partial structure factors S-NN and S-NC is cancelled by a weighted term, which value is zero. Then the measured total structure factor S(q) gives directly the concentration-concentration structure factor S-cc(q). We present here the first experimental results of neutron diffraction on the Mn 66 Ga 34 ``null matrix alloy'' at 1050 degrees C. The main peak of the experimental S-cc(q) gives a strong evidence of a hetero-atomic chemical order in this coordinated alloy. This order also appears in real space radial distribution function which is calculated by the Fourier transform of the structure factor. The degree of hetero-coordination is discussed together with other manganese-polyvalent alloys. However manganese also shows abnormal magnetic scattering in the alloy structure factor which must be corrected. This correction gives an experimental information on the mean effective spin of manganese in this liquid alloy.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the cheralite - CaTh(PO 4) 2 - has been revisited by neutron diffraction and its behaviour under very high pressure investigated by X-ray diffraction up to 38 GPa. The neutron diffraction data at ambient pressure gave a more accurate determination of the Ca/Th cations position than previous XRD data, taking advantage that the <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>lengths</b> of calcium and thorium are of same order of magnitude. The nuclear density distribution was also determined using the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) confirming that the two cations are not located at the same position in the unit cell but are slightly displaced from one another along specific directions {{in order to minimize}} the electrostatic repulsion with the surrounding phosphorus atoms.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to discover whether the recently reported high-capacity lithium battery material LiMn 1 / 3 Ni 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 O 2 possesses a superstructure due to ordering of the transition metal cations. A recent paper in the literature concluded from ab initio calculations that, if a superstructure exists, it would likely {{take the form of}} a [2 ̆ 21 a 372 ̆ 21 a 3]R 300 type superlattice rather than an ordered stacking of Co 2 ̆ 013 O 2, Ni 2 ̆ 013 O 2, and Mn 2 ̆ 013 O 2 slabs. A suitable technique to detect the presence or otherwise of a superstructure in this material is neutron diffraction due to the contrast between Mn, Ni, and Co <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>lengths.</b> An alternative method to enhance the contrast between elements close in the periodic table is to use resonant diffraction techniques. The beneficial contrasts afforded by each method may be retained by conducting a simultaneous refinement using both neutron and X-ray data.
