At {{the upper end}} of this range are repeats of dramas such as Smallville. It aired a significant number of British sitcoms in late <b>night,</b> <b>My</b> Family for example, but these have been dropped. It was the first channel to air the first completely computer-animated series ReBoot, and it broadcast the North American premiere of Sailor Moon. While some of its shows are targeted at a younger audience, others are intended for older teenagers, with some of the shows dealing with mature content and adult themes.|$|E

500|$|Eventually, the {{personal}} horror stories Falle heard from {{other women in}} her situation convinced her {{that she needed to}} get out of prostitution. Her substance dependence became so severe that she almost died. Her best friend was killed by her pimp. By this point, many of her friends in the sex industry had died, and she thought that she would be next. One night, Falle was hiding alone in a hotel room when she found a Bible placed there by Gideons International. She began reading the Psalms and later said, [...] "For the first time I understood what God was saying to me. That <b>night</b> <b>my</b> life began to move in a new direction." [...] On her 27th birthday, Falle left her husband and returned to her mother. Because of the delusions, Falle did not recognize her mother, thinking she had been replaced with a clone. Falle told her mother about being dependent on cocaine, entering prostitution, and marrying her pimp. Her mother accepted her back. It took several more years before Falle gave up hope that her husband would change.|$|E
500|$|... "Dreams Old Men Dream" [...] was {{inspired}} by the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries and Fyodor Dostoyevskys short story The Dream of a Ridiculous Man. It tells the story of an elderly man reflecting back on the life he had and what he wished he had done before. [...] "On the <b>Night</b> <b>My</b> Love Broke Through" [...] was the last song made for the album that was recorded live. It {{was inspired}} by the works of German-American poet Charles Bukowski. [...] "Relief" [...] is written {{from the perspective of a}} person that questions God's way of controlling the Earth and handling its inhabitants. God himself answers the person's question when Willett sings, [...] "Flash flood, you got too comfortable, so I showed you, who's really in control." [...] The overall sound of the track is described as electronica in the vein of [...] "mid-era Radiohead." [...] The album closer, [...] "Cryptomnesia", {{was inspired by}} a case involving Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov being accused of plagiarism involving his 1955 novel Lolita. Willett said that it is [...] "an apt word for the way history seeps into his songwriting today." ...|$|E

500|$|Hordern was {{appearing}} {{in three to}} four films a year by 1953, a count that increased as the decade progressed. In 1956 he took a leading part in The Spanish Gardener for which he spent many months filming in southern Spain alongside Dirk Bogarde, Cyril Cusack, and Bernard Lee. The New York Times called Hordern's role of the strict and pompous Harrington Brande [...] "an unsympathetic assignment", but thought the actor did [...] "quite well" [...] in his portrayal. [...] By the mid-1950s Hordern's name was becoming one of reliability and good value; as a result, he was offered a clutch of roles. In 1956 he appeared as Demosthenes in Alexander the Great, and Commander Lindsay in The <b>Night</b> <b>My</b> Number Came Up. He appeared in two other films the following year; the medical drama No Time for Tears, and the thriller Windom's Way. The Second World War was a popular genre for filmmakers during the 1950s. Hordern said the conflict took up {{a large part of}} people's lives; [...] "whether it be one of love, loss, nostalgia or tragedy", everybody, according to the actor, had a story to tell and could relate to the situations that were being depicted before them on screen. He found his earlier naval experience to be an asset when cast in many war films, including The Man Who Never Was, Pacific Destiny, The Baby and the Battleship, all in 1956, and I Was Monty's Double two years later.|$|E

2500|$|Hopkins {{formerly}} {{suffered from}} epilepsy; {{she was being}} hospitalised around once every 10 days in early 2014, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "When I have a fit at <b>night,</b> <b>my</b> arms come out. They dislocate. So I {{have to go into}} hospital to have them relocated. That's happened 26 times in the last nine months". The seizures could occur up to ten times at night, according to Sathnam Sanghera who interviewed her for The Times in mid-2015. They began in her late teens whenever she fell asleep and did not respond to prescribed drugs, she said in 2017. In a piece for The Sun, published the following August, she announced she was considering surgery to help prevent seizures. In mid-November 2015, her condition led her to fall to the ground in the street, injuring her face, and for an ambulance to be called.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, Henry James's boat docked in New York {{on his way}} back to see his father. [...] William James, in London at the time, was kept from full {{knowledge}} of his father's decline in order not to interfere with a much needed vacation; when he learned that his father was on his deathbed, four days before his final demise, William James wrote a moving letter that his father never read. [...] In it, the famous psychologist wrote: [...] "In that mysterious gulf of the past into which the present will soon fall and go back and back, yours is still for me the central figure. [...] All my intellectual life I derive from you; and though we have often seemed at odds in the expression thereof I'm sure there's a harmony somewhere, & that our strivings will combine. [...] What my debt to you is goes beyond all my power of estimating,—so early, so penetrating and so constant has been the influence. ... Good <b>night</b> <b>my</b> sacred old Father.

2500|$|A prolifically {{successful}} composer for the cinema, Malcolm Arnold {{is credited}} with having written over a hundred film scores for features and documentaries between 1947 and 1969. In 1957, Arnold won an Academy Award for the music to David Lean's epic film The Bridge on the River Kwai. His two other collaborations with David Lean were The Sound Barrier (1952) and Hobson's Choice (1954), {{both of which were}} also resoundingly successful. The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958) won Arnold an Ivor Novello Award. [...] Also during the 1950s — an especially prolific period for Arnold — he provided a series of successful scores for major British and American feature films, such as [...] The Captain's Paradise (1953), The Sea Shall Not Have Them (1954), The <b>Night</b> <b>My</b> Number Came Up (1955), The Constant Husband (1955), I Am a Camera (1955), 1984 (1956), Trapeze (1956), A Hill in Korea (1956), Dunkirk (1958), The Key (1958) and The Roots of Heaven (1958). He also wrote the music for the entire series of St Trinian's films, including The Belles of St Trinian's (1954), which was a particular favourite with the composer. His 1960s scores included The Angry Silence (1960), Tunes of Glory (1960), No Love for Johnnie (1961), Whistle Down the Wind (1961), The Inspector (1962), The Lion (1962), Nine Hours to Rama (1963), Tamahine (1963), The Chalk Garden (1964), The Thin Red Line (1964), Sky West and Crooked (1965), The Heroes of Telemark (1965), Africa Texas Style (1967) and The Reckoning (1969). His last film score was for a star-studded version of David Copperfield (1969).|$|E

2500|$|The Dwight Schrute {{character}} {{has had a}} very positive reception, and is often cited {{as one of the}} most popular characters on the show. According to Entertainment Weekly he is one of the [...] "greatest sidekicks." [...] In TV Guide's list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th. [...] In an ABC News interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that [...] "Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company..." [...] and [...] "Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy. Dwight is a survivalist geek, a student of karate who likes to shoot a crossbow and watch [...] "Battlestar Galactica" [...] on television. And he takes himself very, very seriously..." [...] E! News commented that Rainn Wilson should be nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance of Dwight, commenting: [...] "...Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now, Dwight Schrute? Oh, only the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed the living daylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last <b>night.</b> <b>My</b> God, have I missed you, man. Mr. Schrute, you are the reason I love my job, my friend. It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man such as you that make television a nice place to be on a Thursday night. You may just be an everyday citizen who does not accept prizes for being a citizen, but you'd best be accepting a supporting actor Emmy nod this year, because, hot damn if you don't deserve it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June Pitt heard Fitzwilliam's {{objection}} {{from the}} Duke of Portland. Pitt assured [...] "that the re-establishment of the Crown of France in such {{person of the}} family of Bourbon as shall be naturally entitled to it was the first and determined aim of the present Ministry". Pitt wished to discuss this with Fitzwilliam in person. On 23 June Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland that he believed the government had moved to the Whig position and that [...] "for my own part I am now ready, not only to adopt the opinion that a junction should take place, as your sentiment, but to advise it as the genuine offspring of my own judgement... as much weight and sway should be given to us as possible. ... In my humble opinion, this junction will not produce half its effect if it is not opened to the world by such marks of real substantial favour and confidence {{on the part of the}} Crown towards us as will mark beyond dispute the return of weight, power and consideration to the Old Whigs...after thirty years' exclusion from patronage in the line of peerage" [...] new Whig peers should be created. He also rejected office except of [...] "going to Ireland, but...it is impossible". However the Duke of Portland and Lord Mansfield implored Fitzwilliam to accept office and when Lord Mansfield saw Fitzwilliam when he came down to London on 28 June he got Fitzwilliam [...] "to admit that if ever he was to take office this was the time". The next day Fitzwilliam met the Duke of Portland and reported that: [...] "I see little prospect of escaping office...the duke...seems so intent upon my accepting, as almost to say that he will not, if I do not—I left him last <b>night</b> <b>my</b> reasons for thinking that I should be more serviceable out of office, than in...if I find I have not persuaded him, I must submit". When Pitt met the Duke of Portland on 1 July he offered the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland to Fitzwilliam as soon as Lord Westmoreland could be compensated for the loss of it. Therefore, on 3 July Fitzwilliam agreed to join the coalition government as Lord President of the Council for the time being, writing that day to Lady Rockingham: [...] "It is a time when private affection must give way to public exigency".|$|E
