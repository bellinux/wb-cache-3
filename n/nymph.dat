5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or <b>nymph</b> stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the <b>nymph</b> grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a <b>nymph</b> {{about the size of}} a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E
5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the <b>nymph</b> occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the <b>nymph</b> rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the <b>nymph</b> climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|Both ixodid and argasid ticks {{have four}} {{lifecycle}} stages: egg, larva, <b>nymph,</b> and adult.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch {{in about}} 7 days. The mother may assist the <b>nymphs</b> in hatching. When the <b>nymphs</b> hatch, they eat the egg casing and {{continue}} {{to live with the}} mother. The <b>nymphs</b> look similar to their parents, only smaller, and will nest under their mother and she will continue to protect them until their second molt. The <b>nymphs</b> feed on food regurgitated by the mother, and on their own molts. If the mother dies before the <b>nymphs</b> are ready to leave, the <b>nymphs</b> may eat her.|$|R

5|$|According to the Harivamsa, Satyavati in her {{previous}} life was Achchhoda, {{daughter of the}} Pitrs (ancestors) and cursed to be born on earth. The Mahabharata, Harivamsa and Devi Bhagavata Purana assert that Satyavati {{was the daughter of}} a cursed apsara (celestial <b>nymph)</b> named Adrika. Adrika was transformed by a curse into a fish, and lived in the Yamuna river.|$|E
5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, <b>nymph,</b> and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis <b>nymph</b> grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.|$|E

25|$|As H.J. Rose states, all {{the names}} for various classes of <b>nymphs</b> are plural {{feminine}} adjectives agreeing with the substantive nymphai, {{and there was no}} single classification that could be seen as canonical and exhaustive. Thus, the classes of <b>nymphs</b> tend to overlap, which complicates the task of precise classification. Rose mentions dryads and hamadryads as <b>nymphs</b> of trees generally, meliai as <b>nymphs</b> of ash trees, and naiads as <b>nymphs</b> of water, but no others specifically.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the predation capacity of A. minki pistaciae during the nymphal stage, the food consumption of all nymphal instars was investigated in a pre-test separately. According to the results of the pre-test, the food consumption of the bugs was 50 CPPs (fourth instar <b>nymphs).</b> In the main test, newly emerged <b>nymphs</b> of 3  h-old A. minki pistaciae (first instar <b>nymphs)</b> were released individually on a Leaf-disk, and each individual was provided by 50 CPPs (fourth instar <b>nymphs).</b> Leaf-disks were checked daily, the number of consumed and alive psyllids was recorded, and the <b>nymphs</b> of the bug were moved to a new Leaf-disk containing <b>nymphs</b> of CPP. The experiments were continued for second, third, fourth, and fifth nymphal instars until the <b>nymphs</b> reached adult stage. Molting status, survival rate, and developmental durations of predator <b>nymphs</b> (the five nymphal instars) were recorded daily to determine the time spent in each nymphal stage.|$|R
25|$|<b>Nymphs</b> {{are very}} active and on average 5–6 days (but {{possibly}} up to 31 days) after moulting attach to another host. <b>Nymphs</b> feed for 4–7 days, then {{drop to the}} ground. After a further 3–11 weeks the <b>nymphs</b> moult to become adult males or females. Again the period is temperature dependent: it may, for example, take 20 days at 24-27°C but 53–65 days at 10-21°C. Dry conditions also prolong this period and can actually kill <b>nymphs.</b> Under laboratory conditions unfed <b>nymphs</b> can survive for 275 days.|$|R
5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the <b>nymph</b> {{for the whole of}} its development. If the <b>nymph</b> is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E

5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The <b>nymph</b> of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the <b>nymph</b> spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E
5|$|The Uttara Ramayana narrates a {{story about}} the birth of Mandodari. Mayasura (Maya), the son of sage Kashyapa is married to the apsara (heavenly <b>nymph)</b> Hema.

5|$|The eggs of many stick insects, {{including}} Timema, {{are attractive}} to ants, who carry them away to their burrows {{to feed on}} the egg's capitulum, while leaving {{the rest of the}} egg intact to hatch.

40|$|Serangium japonicum {{potential}} predator of Bemisia tabaci {{is capable}} of discriminating between <b>nymphs</b> with advanced stages of parasitoid and unparasitized <b>nymphs.</b> The consumption of whitefly <b>nymphs</b> by the adult as well 4 th instar larvae beetle offered 5 days postoviposition of Eretmocerus sp. and unparasitized <b>nymphs</b> were almost the same indicating that beetle are unable to distinguish between parasitized and unparasitized <b>nymphs</b> of whitefly in early stages of parasitization The consumption of parasitized <b>nymphs</b> of whitefly declined {{with the increase in}} age of parasitoid inside the whitefly <b>nymphs.</b> Whitefly <b>nymphs</b> 9 days of parasitoid postoviposition were significantly less consumed than unparasitized control <b>nymphs</b> of same age. The avoidance was more significant at the pupal stage of parasitoid (13 days postoviposition of Eretmocerus) and was more determinant in adults than the 4 th instar of S. japonicum. It can be concluded that incorporation of S. japonicum in conjunction with whitefly parasitoids in greenhouse system can suppress the rapidly increasing population of whitefly, thus enabling the whitefly parasitoids Eretmocerus and Encarsia species to keep the whitefly to acceptable thresholds without disrupting the other biological control. </p...|$|R

5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo ecdysis), each instar becoming {{larger and}} more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 days as a <b>nymph,</b> depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>nymphs</b> (technically, [...] "naiads") are aquatic {{and live}} in the benthic zone of well-oxygenated lakes and streams. A few species found in New Zealand and nearby islands have {{terrestrial}} <b>nymphs,</b> but even these inhabit only very moist environments. The <b>nymphs</b> physically resemble wingless adults, but often have external gills, which may be present on almost any part of the body. <b>Nymphs</b> can acquire oxygen via diffusing through the exoskeleton, or through gills located on behind the head, on the thorax, or around the anus. Due to their <b>nymph's</b> requirement for well oxygenated water, the species is very sensitive to water pollution. This makes them important indicators for water quality. Most species are herbivorous as <b>nymphs,</b> feeding on submerged leaves and benthic algae, but many are hunters of other aquatic arthropods.|$|R
