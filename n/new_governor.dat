5|$|Asad was {{replaced}} by Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami (727–730). The <b>new</b> <b>governor</b> at first continued Asad's policy of conciliation, but then reversed it, leading to the outbreak of a full-scale rebellion in Transoxiana, which, coupled with renewed Turgesh attacks, reduced the Arab presence there to Samarkand and its environs. Ashras was able to recover Bukhara, but his successor, Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri, presided over the disaster of the Battle of the Defile, which crippled the Khurasani army, in 731. By the time of Junayd's death in 734, the Muslim holdings in Transoxiana {{had been reduced to}} Bukhara and parts of Tokharistan. These military defeats, the long-held grievances against the Umayyad government, and the forcible requisition of food by Junayd during the famine of 733 led to the outbreak of a rebellion in early 734, led by al-Harith ibn Surayj. Harith's uprising involved both Arabs and native princes, especially from the hitherto loyal principalities of Tokharistan, and spread quickly, with the rebels capturing Balkh. The <b>new</b> <b>governor,</b> Asim ibn Abdallah al-Hilali, managed to check Harith's advance on the capital, Marw, and forced him to seek terms. Asim's position remained precarious, however, and he wrote to the Caliph, asking for the placement of Khurasan once again under the purview of Iraq, the appointment of a <b>new</b> <b>governor</b> and the substantial reinforcement of the province with Syrian troops. Hisham accepted the recommendations, and instructed Khalid al-Qasri to send Asad once again as governor to Khurasan. Early in 735, Harith renewed his rebellion. This time, whether due to pressure from local sympathizers in Marw or as an expedient way to gain time for Asad to arrive, Asim agreed to a truce with Harith, promising also to support Harith's demands against the Caliph.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Constantinople, he was tasked (late 1092/early 1093), along with Manuel Boutoumites, with the {{suppression}} of the revolts in Crete by Karykes and in Cyprus by Rhapsomates. The rebellion of Karykes was subdued easily, as the news of the imperial fleet's approach caused a counter-coup that overthrew him. At Cyprus, Rhapsomates's initial resistance was overcome, and he himself was captured soon after. Eumathios Philokales was installed as the island's <b>new</b> <b>governor,</b> and the fleet returned to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|After López de Salcedo {{had been}} {{installed}} as governor, the emissaries {{that had been}} sent by Pedrarias arrived, expecting to find Saavedra. Although they did not dare to present Pedrarias' demands to a Crown representative, López de Salcedo had them imprisoned. When the Crown had appointed the <b>new</b> <b>governor,</b> it had not defined the limits of Honduras. Pedrarias {{had been replaced by}} a Crown representative in July 1526; this prompted López de Salcedo to claim jurisdiction over Nicaragua, based upon the actions of González Dávila and Hernán Cortés. He left a few men under the command of Francisco de Cisneros in Trujillo, and marched with 150 men to impose his authority over Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Army, {{he moved to}} Riverside, Connecticut, where he worked for M. W. Kellogg. He {{eventually}} tired of commuting to New York City, and took a job with Koppers, building a coal loading facility in Turkey. He then worked for the United Nations Korean Relief at the UN Building in New York. He was also involved in mining projects in Africa. He made his home in Skaneateles, New York, while working on various projects around the world. In January 1961 he accepted an offer from the Governor of Minnesota, Elmer L. Andersen, to become that state's Commissioner of Highways. His four-year term was marred by a change of government {{in the state in}} 1963, and his final years saw a series of clashes with the <b>new</b> <b>governor,</b> Karl F. Rolvaag, and his attorney-general Walter Mondale.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Theodore Synadenos {{was rewarded}} by being made {{governor}} of Constantinople, Apokaukos became {{head of the}} imperial secretariat, Kantakouzenos remained Andronikos III's principal advisor as megas domestikos, and Syrgiannes was named governor of Thessalonica. Around 1330, Synadenos was sent as governor to Mesembria, while in 1336, after Andronikos III and John Kantakouzenos annexed Epirus, he became its governor. In late 1338, however, a revolt broke out in Epirus in favour of Nikephoros II Orsini, the last descendant of the Epirote ruling dynasty. Synadenos was taken captive in the capital, Arta by the rebels, and remained a prisoner until 1340, when Andronikos III and Kantakouzenos campaigned against the rebels and recovered the region. John Angelos, a relative of Kantakouzenos, was installed as the <b>new</b> <b>governor,</b> while Synadenos {{was moved to the}} governorship of Thessalonica.|$|E

5|$|Alvarado {{arrived at}} Buena Esperanza {{in the middle}} of its abandonment. His sudden {{appearance}} halted the exodus, and many colonists who had already left returned. Cerezeda sent messages from Naco, imploring Alvarado to take over as governor of the province. The town council joined in session and installed Alvarado as justicia mayor (chief judge), and as captain-general of Honduras-Higueras until the Crown appointed someone else, or confirmed him in his post. Alvarado's presence turned Spanish morale around overnight. The factions that had plagued the colonial government dissipated, and the colonists rallied around the <b>new</b> <b>governor.</b> Alvarado, known to the natives by his Nahuatl nickname Tonatiuh, had a fearsome reputation amongst the indigenous population, who had heard of his ruthless exploits elsewhere. Alvarado rapidly re-established firm Spanish control over the area around Buena Esperanza and founded a military encampment in Tencoa. He successfully established profitable gold and silver mines in Higueras.|$|E
5|$|Black Prince {{was again}} {{refitted}} in 1874–75, gaining a poop deck, and rejoined the Channel Fleet as flagship of Rear Admiral Sir John Dalrymple-Hay, second-in-command of the fleet. In 1878 Captain H.R.H. Duke of Edinburgh took command {{and the ship}} crossed the Atlantic {{to participate in the}} installation of a <b>new</b> <b>Governor</b> General of Canada. Upon her return Black Prince was placed in reserve at Devonport, and, reclassified as an armoured cruiser, she was reactivated periodically to take part in annual fleet exercises. Black Prince was hulked in 1896 as a harbour training ship, stationed at Queenstown, and was renamed Emerald in 1903. In 1910 the ship was moved to Plymouth and renamed Impregnable III when she was assigned to the training school HMS Impregnable before she was sold for scrap on 21 February 1923.|$|E

Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the <b>new</b> <b>governor</b> of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.|$|E

5|$|In 1585, {{war broke}} out between England and Spain. The Anglo-Spanish War {{was not limited to}} Europe—extending to Spanish and English territories in the Americas. In November 1595, Sir Francis Drake, the vice-admiral in command of the Royal Navy fleet that tackled the Spanish Armada, and Sir John Hawkins {{attempted}} an unsuccessful invasion of San Juan. Both Hawkins and Drake died of illness {{in the course of the}} campaign. On June 15, 1598, the English fleet, led by George Clifford, landed in Santurce and held the island for several months. He was forced to abandon the island upon an outbreak of bacillary dysentery among his troops. In 1599, 400 additional soldiers and 46 cannons were sent to the island along with a <b>new</b> <b>governor,</b> Alonso de Mercado, to rebuild the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1785 {{the castle}} {{was bought by}} the Oxford County Justices and {{rebuilding}} began under the London architect William Blackburn. The wider castle site {{had already begun to}} change by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow the building of the new Oxford Canal terminus. Building the new prison included demolishing the old college attached to St George's chapel and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the <b>new</b> <b>governor</b> and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle {{with the help of the}} antiquarian Edward King.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, when Unitarist Bernardino Rivadavia {{became the}} {{governor}} of the Buenos Aires province, he held a meeting with representatives from all provinces in Argentina.

Rivadavia was soon overthrown, and Manuel Dorrego became the <b>new</b> <b>governor.</b> Sarmiento contends that Dorrego, a Federalist, was interested neither in social progress nor in ending barbaric behaviour in Argentina by improving the level of civilization and education of its rural inhabitants. In the turmoil that characterized Argentine politics at the time, Dorrego was assassinated by Unitarists and Facundo was defeated by Unitarist General José María Paz. Facundo escaped to Buenos Aires and joined the Federalist government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. During the ensuing civil war between the two ideologies, Facundo conquered the provinces of San Luis, Cordoba and Mendoza.|$|E
