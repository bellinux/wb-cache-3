5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|This freelancing attempt did {{not start}} out well, with Benchley selling just one piece to Vanity Fair and accumulating countless {{rejections}} in two months. When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A. Brady was offered, Benchley accepted it, {{against the advice of}} many of his peers. This experience was a poor one, as Brady was extremely difficult to work for. Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government's Aircraft Board at the beginning of 1918. His experience there was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>better,</b> and when an opportunity was offered to return to the Tribune under new editorial management, Benchley took it.|$|E

5|$|While XXXVI Corps was {{struggling}} against the Soviets, III Corps' situation was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>better,</b> despite reinforcements arriving from the transfers of XXXVI Corps to the south. Group F's new drive on Ukhta was immediately stopped {{in its tracks}} by recent reinforcements of the 88th Rifle Division. The Soviets now launched a heavy counterattack. The Finns, who were still reorganising with the recently arrived German units for a revived push to the east, were forced to retire. To counter the new threat AOK Norwegen now threw in everything it had available to bolster the Finnish front. New assignments included another regiment from XXXVI Corps as well as parts of the 14th Finnish Infantry Regiment pulled from Operation Platinum Fox, the German front in the far north. The new reinforcements helped to stabilise the front.|$|E
5|$|Lured by {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better housing and other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative connotation. Their treatment by the Soviet government was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with them everything they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was no possibility of return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real or perceived ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of the Gorbachev policy calling {{for an increase in}} {{the quantity and quality of}} goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (19861990). To achieve these goals, the government pumped money into the machine-building sector but as time went by, Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance. He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility. However, Ryzhkov's economic policies were <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> as he continued to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods. Gorbachev and Ligachev's anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov, who agreed with the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Trade that such a drive would deprive from the state billions of rubles in income. Nevertheless, the campaign went ahead, losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues. Ryzhkov's opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations, and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect.|$|E

5|$|In August 1940, the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{reported}} that the force necessary to hold Malaya and Singapore {{in the absence of}} a fleet was 336 first-line aircraft and a garrison of nine brigades. Churchill then sent reassurances to the prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand that, if they were attacked, their defence would be a priority second only to that of the British Isles. A defence conference was held in Singapore in October 1940. Representatives from all three services attended, including Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton (Commander in Chief, China Station); the General Officer Commanding Malaya Command, Lieutenant General Lionel Bond; and Air Officer Commanding the RAF in the Far East, Air Marshal John Tremayne Babington. Australia was represented by its three deputy service chiefs, Captain Joseph Burnett, Major General John Northcott and Air Commodore William Bostock. Over ten days, they discussed the situation in the Far East. They estimated that the air defence of Burma and Malaya would require a minimum of 582 aircraft. By 7 December 1941, there were only 164 first-line aircraft on hand in Malaya and Singapore, and all the fighters were the obsolete Brewster F2A Buffalo. The land forces situation was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> There were only 31 battalions of infantry of the 48 required, and instead of two tank regiments, there were no tanks at all. Moreover, many of the units on hand were poorly trained and equipped. Yet during 1941 Britain had sent 676 aircraft and 446 tanks to the Soviet Union.|$|E

Less significant protests also occurred in Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The initial hopes of democratic change have faced several setbacks in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia.

The camp was turned into an Arbeitserziehungslager mostly for those refusing to do forced labour, but {{in the fall of}} 1944 it once again became a penal camp. The camp was liberated on 11 April 1945. From 1945 to 1946, the camp was instead used to detain Dutchmen who had collaborated with the German occupiers.

Friend and Sexual Politics author Kate Millett has said Ono inspired her activism. Ono and Lennon appeared on The Mike Douglas Show, taking over hosting duties for a week.
