40|$|Abstract: Basement {{membrane}} (BM) is {{a specialized}} extracellular matrix (ECM) that separates epithelial cells from surrounding stroma and regulates various biological processes including morphology, growth, differentiation, adhesion and motility. Type IV collagen {{is the major}} component of BM, provides structural framework of all BMs and interacts with cell surface receptors including integrins and discoidin domain receptors (DDRs). The DDRs are receptor tyrosine kinases that get activated by <b>collagens</b> in their <b>native</b> triple-helical form and present sustained and slow activation kinetics. Particularly, DDR 1 signaling mediates differentiation, immune response, migration and wound healing. However, the signal transduction pathways involved in cell migration induced by <b>native</b> IV <b>collagen</b> in breast cancer cells has been poorly studied. Here we demonstrate that <b>native</b> type IV <b>collagen</b> induces Akt 2 and FAK activation through a DDR 1, PI 3 K and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -dependent pathway in MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells. In addition, cell migration induced by <b>native</b> type IV <b>collagen</b> requires PI 3 K, Akt 2 and EGFR activity, whereas collagen IV also induces NFκB-DNA binding activity through a DDR 1, PI 3 K, Akt 2 and EGFR-dependent pathway.

50|$|Fibronectin {{is located}} in the {{extracellular}} matrix of embryonic and adult tissues (not in the basement membranes of the adult tissues), but may be more widely distributed in inflammatory lesions. During blood clotting, the fibronectin remains associated with the clot, covalently cross-linked to fibrin with the help of Factor XIII (fibrin-stabilizing factor). Fibroblasts {{play a major role in}} wound healing by adhering to fibrin. Fibroblast adhesion to fibrin requires fibronectin, and was strongest when the fibronectin was cross-linked to the fibrin. Patients with Factor XIII deficiencies display impairment in wound healing as fibroblasts don't grow well in fibrin lacking Factor XIII. Fibronectin promotes particle phagocytosis by both macrophages and fibroblasts. Collagen deposition at the wound site by fibroblasts takes place with the help of fibronectin. Fibronectin was also observed to be closely associated with the newly deposited collagen fibrils. Based on the size and histological staining characteristics of the fibrils, it is likely that at least in part they are composed of type III collagen (reticulin). An in vitro study with <b>native</b> <b>collagen</b> demonstrated that fibronectin binds to type III collagen rather than other types.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY An acute {{inflammatory}} arthritis has been induced in 76 % of rats injected intradermally with native bovine type II collagen emulsified in Freund's complete (CFA) or incomplete (ICFA) adjuvant. The arthritis became chronic in 14 out of 31 rats, and ear and tail lesions were noted in some rats. No arthritis was induced by <b>native</b> type I <b>collagen,</b> denatured type II collagen, rabbit IgG, or buffer alone injected intradermally with adjuvant. Using a solid-phase radioimmunoassay for serum antibodies {{we have shown}} that IgM and IgG levels to native bovine type II collagen were significantly higher in arthritic than nonarthritic rats. Antiglobulin antibody levels were not raised in arthritic rats. Equivalent antibody levels to <b>native</b> type II <b>collagen</b> were obtained whether this antigen was emulsified in ICFA or CFA. However, <b>native</b> type I <b>collagen</b> produced high antibody levels only when emulsified in CFA, indicating {{a difference in the}} immunogenicity of these collagens. These studies suggest that <b>native</b> type II <b>collagen</b> possesses arthritogenic properties in the rat and that humoral immunity {{may play a role in}} the induction of this arthritis. The induction of a chronic {{inflammatory arthritis}} in the rat by the intradermal injection of human, chick, or rat collagen obtained from articular carti-lage and emulsified in either Freund's complete (CFA) or incomplete (1 CFA) adjuvant has recently been described by Trentham et al. (1977). The incidence of arthritis was approximately 40 % in the rat strains tested and mainly affected the hind limbs. Both cellular and humoral immune responses to <b>native</b> type II <b>collagen</b> can be detected in these rats, and there appears to be some correlation between higher levels of sensitivity to the collagen and the presence of arthritis (Trentham et al., 1978). We here describe the induction and clinical course of arthritis in the rat using a different hetero-logous <b>native</b> type II <b>collagen</b> (bovine) and the humoral responses in arthritic and nonarthritic rats.

40|$|We have {{recently}} described a new animal model of arthritis induced by intradermal injection of a distinct type of collagen found in cartilage (type II collagen). Since immunologic sensitivity to collagen {{could play a}} role in the pathogenesis of this type II collagen-induced arthritis in rats, the ability of purified types of <b>native</b> <b>collagens</b> to induce cellular and humoral responses was quantified by antigeninduced tritiated thymidine incorporation into lymphocytes by collagen and passive hemagglutination, respectively. Rats injected intradermally with native heterologous or homologous type II collagens in adjuvant developed type-specific cellular as well as humoral reactivity. Types I and III collagens were less immunogenic than was type II. The latter collagen induced brisk cellular and humoral responses that were equivalent whether complete Freund's adjuvant or incomplete Freund's adjuvant were employed. Both responses could be induced by <b>native</b> type II <b>collagens</b> modified by limited pepsin digestion, indicating that they are not attributable to determinants in the telopeptide regions of the molecule. Thus, these studies demonstrate the unique immunogenic as well as arthritogenic properties of the type II collagen molecule and indicate that both result from a helical conformation of its structurally distinct α-chains. Further, they suggest that type II collagen may, by humoral or cellular mechanisms, provoke or perpetuate inflammation in other arthritic diseases...|$|R

Immunization with denatured type II collagen in exactly the same manner was not effective in inducing arthritis. Cell-mediated immunity in arthritic mice was assessed by measuring [3 H]thymidine incorporation by mononuclear cells cultured in the presence of collagen. The maximal proliferative response to collagen occurred at 2 wk after immunization. Equally good incorporation of label occurred when cells were cultured with native or denatured type II collagen or type I collagen. The cellular response of nonarthritic mice immunized with denatured collagen was indistinguishable from that seen in arthritic mice.

Oxidation of LDL in the vascular wall results in the formation of reactive aldehydes, which could modify surrounding matrix proteins. Like oxidized LDL, these modified matrix proteins are likely to induce immune responses. We examined whether autoantibodies against native or aldehyde-modified collagen type IV are associated with myocardial infarction. Methods: IgM and IgG against native and aldehyde-modified collagen type IV were measured by ELISA in serum from 387 survivors of a first myocardial infarction and 387 age- and sex-matched controls. Results: Post-infarction patients had significantly increased levels of IgM against <b>native</b> <b>collagen</b> type IV, and IgG against <b>native</b> <b>collagen</b> type IV was present at detectable level in 17 % of patients as opposed to 7 % of controls (p <  0. 001).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{measurements}} of the electrical properties, the specific heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of a collagen solution (7. 19 % mass fraction of <b>native</b> bovine <b>collagen</b> in water). The results of our experiments show that specific electrical conductivity of collagen solution {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. The transition region of collagen to gelatin has been observed from the measured temperature dependence of specific electrical conductivity, and has been confirmed by specific heat capacity measurements by a differential scanning calorimetry...|$|R
