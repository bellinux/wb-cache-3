This must normally be proven by taking a <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test.</b> Successful completion of an eligible integration course is an alternative. The Staatsexamen Nederlands als Tweede Taal diplomas NT2-I or NT2-II give their holder exemption from taking the <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test.</b> There are lots of other exemptions, see the Decision <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test</b> (Besluit naturalisatietoets) art. 3.|$|E
50|$|Heyman {{applied for}} {{naturalisation}} as a South Korean citizen in 1995, {{after more than}} thirty years of living in the country. He first faced a grueling <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test,</b> in which only two students passed the written portion; however, the oral portion was much simpler for him, as his interviewer asked him only to tell the tale of Heungbu and Nolbu, which he knew quite well from his pansori studies. As South Korea did not permit dual citizenship at the time, he then gave up his U.S. citizenship. He took the Korean name Hae Eui-man. In September 2010, he donated a large amount of the research materials he had collected over the years to the National Gugak Center.|$|E
40|$|The essay {{analyses}} {{the discursive}} construction {{of national identity}} in the present <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test</b> of the Federal Republic of Germany. The essay includes an overview of immigration to Germany, and a survey of political measures to improve the integration of immigrants. The language and structure of representative multiple-choice questions (and answers) of the <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test</b> are analysed by using the method of critical discourse analysis (CDA). The theoretical background {{of this study is}} grounded in cultural studies. The methodological framework consists of a combination of critical discourse analysis and textual analysis. Criteria of the linguistic analysis are: the situational context of the text, thematic roles, deixis, lexical repetitions, modality, coherence (including implicit meanings and presuppositions), intertextuality and interdiscursivity, competence and performance. The analysis shows that national identity is conceptualized by the multiple-choice questions of the <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test.</b> National identity is above all constructed by the German language.  One of the qualifications which the examinee has to fulfil is competence in German on the level B 1 (of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Linguistic competence is necessary in order to answer the questions. National identity is linguistically created by using alterity. Binary oppositions are constructed by stipulations and presumptions about migrants living in Germany. These oppositions are created by giving three alternative answers, which represent prejudices about foreigners; we is represented by an idealized construction of Germans, and the other is represented by stereotypical assumptions about foreigners. National identity is created by the content of the questions, too. Many questions deal with German laws and standards, which implies that being a German means to be law-abiding. The present study shows that German identity is constructed by language and the construction of alterity. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} number of –mostly Western European– countries have recently newly introduced citizenship tests or have added stricter requirements of civic knowledge to previously existing language tests. This working paper collects the contributions to a EUDO-CITIZENSHIP forum debate on whether such tests can be defended from a liberal perspective. The question: ‘How liberal are citizenship tests?’ can be interpreted in two ways: as a question whether applicants for <b>naturalisation</b> should be <b>tested</b> at all, or as a question about specific modes, contents and consequences of such tests that may make them either liberal or illiberal. In his kickoff contribution, Christian Joppke suggests an answer {{in line with the}} second interpretation by focusing on modes and contents. In his view, citizenship tests are defensible if applicants have reasonable opportunities to prepare for them and if questions are not inquisitive about individuals values and beliefs. Other authors claim instead that the most problematic feature of citizenship tests is the intention or effect of raising hurdles for naturalisation among long-term resident immigrants. Joseph Carens defends the view that ‘the most liberal citizenship test is none at all’. Ten authors have contributed to this lively and controversial debate, which concludes with a rejoinder by Christian Joppke. citizenship...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, on 1 April 2003, a four-hour, partiallycomputerised <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test</b> was introduced. This {{formalisation}} of {{the language}} and integration tests for naturalisation coincided with {{a rise in the}} level of language proficiency required and the introduction of questions on knowledge of Dutch society. This test significantly raised the barriers to becoming a Dutch citizen. In the first year after it was introduced, the number of applications for naturalisation decreased by 70 per cent. How can this restrictive turn in Dutch citizenship policy be explained? Have the goals of the test been attained in practice? These are the main questions addressed in this paper...|$|E
30|$|The Netherlands and Germany {{have many}} basic points {{pertaining}} to sampling of immigrants in common though with limitations. Both use {{the concept of}} migration background based on the country of birth of an individual or his/her parents. They focus on immigrants merging into resident populations in the third generation and do not envisage permanent minorities. Both renounce subjective, ethnic and biologistic categories to describe subpopulations. Differences exist in detail, as e.g. Germany includes foreigners irrespective of place of birth of the individual or the ancestors whereas the Netherlands looks at parents’ birth place at most. This makes a quantitative difference, since Germany has low naturalization rates. This begs the question whether the immigrant population captured by Dutch concepts is more integrated than those comprised by the German concept. For both countries, is has been demonstrated that naturalisation matters in regard to paid jobs, in particular for immigrants stemming from less developed countries (Peters, Vink, & Schmeets, 2017; Steinhardt, 2012). To become a Dutch citizen, a <b>naturalisation</b> <b>test</b> have to be passed in which their Dutch language skills (A 2 level) is tested. As a consequence, {{it is possible that}} immigrants also participate more often in surveys with single lingual questionnaires in the Netherlands than in Germany.|$|E
