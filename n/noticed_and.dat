5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, she {{switched}} to golf, sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54. She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches <b>noticed</b> <b>and</b> at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E

40|$|<b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice is {{the model}} for {{protecting}} privacy online in the United States. Under the model, users of online services are given notice about services information and privacy practices {{in the form of}} privacy policies. Based on this information, users can choose whether to use particular online services and whether to exercise any options for protecting their privacy that the services might offer. In theory, <b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice seems like a sound regulatory mechanism. Indeed, state and federal regulatory agencies prefer the model as a basis for privacy enforcement action. But <b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice faces harsh criticism from privacy advocates. This Note adds a new critique to the list—that <b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice leaves individual consumers who are affected by privacy policy breaches, legally, empty-handed. This is because website privacy policies—the principal mechanism for effectuating <b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice—are generally not considered to be legally binding agreements. As a result, individuals’ contract theory-based actions against companies for privacy policy breaches almost categorically fail. As a result, the users of online services are largely left without individual redress for privacy policy breaches. Much has been written about <b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice, and even more has been written about online contracting. Yet, like <b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice and contract theory themselves, these two bodies of scholarship remain misaligned. This Note fills that gap by addressing <b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice in the context of contracts, and offers alternative solutions to give individuals the opportunity to seek redress in the <b>Notice</b> <b>and</b> Choice scheme through contract theory...|$|R

5|$|The known {{material}} {{includes two}} cervical vertebrae, nine dorsal vertebrae, a few ribs, {{a fragment of}} a pubis, and many gastroliths. Of the material, only the vertebrae are diagnostic, with the ribs and pubis being too fragmentary or general to distinguish Dinheirosaurus. This material was first described as in the genus Lourinhasaurus, but differences were <b>noticed</b> <b>and</b> in 1999 Bonaparte and Mateus redescribed the material under the new binomial Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis. Another specimen, ML 418, thought to be Dinheirosaurus, is now known to be from another Portuguese diplodocid. This means that Dinheirosaurus lived alongside many theropods, sauropods, thyreophorans and ornithopods, {{as well as at}} least one other diplodocid.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{was set in}} a dystopian future {{controlled}} by Cyber-cops (referred to as such by director Brett Leonard.) It depicted an individual who records the Cyber-cops beating a man, only to be <b>noticed</b> <b>and</b> attacked himself. His camera is destroyed and the Cyber-cops leave him unconscious on the ground, as they are busy trying to put down a riot elsewhere in the city. Alone, his camera equipment lands on him and is absorbed into his body, causing him to dramatically morph into a cyborg. The cyborg then joins the riot, leading the rebels to victory.|$|E
5|$|English {{comparative}} anatomist William Henry Flower created the suborder Lemuroidea in 1883 to distinguish these primates from the simians, which were grouped under English biologist St. George Jackson Mivart's suborder Anthropoidea (=Simiiformes). According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, É. Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, {{in which he}} included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared {{the structure of the}} nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became <b>noticed</b> <b>and</b> more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times.|$|E

We begin with an attempt to articulate the purposes served by requiring <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> an opportunity for a hearing. We next consider some traditional and modern limitations on those requirements and inquire whether they are justified in light of our functional analysis. The relationship between our formulation and several landmark decisions handed down by the Supreme Court since 1968 is then examined, followed by a survey of reasons which may explain the importance in contemporary society of <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> hearing as procedural constraints...|$|R
5|$|Kajol {{made her}} acting debut {{at the age}} of {{seventeen}} in the 1992 romantic drama Bekhudi alongside debutante Kamal Sadanah and her mother Tanuja, who in the film also played her mother. Kajol played Radhika, a girl who falls in love with Sadanah's character despite her parents' wish for her to marry another man. Although the film {{turned out to be a}} box office flop, Kajol's performance was <b>noticed</b> <b>and</b> she was signed for Baazigar (1993), a thriller by Abbas-Mustan, which emerged as a major commercial success. Inspired from the Hollywood film A Kiss Before Dying, the film co-starred Shah Rukh Khan, Shilpa Shetty and Siddharth Ray, and saw Kajol portray the leading role of Priya Chopra, a girl who falls in love with her sister's murderer. The film marked the first of her many collaborations with Khan.|$|E
5|$|Mobilization of the Red Army {{had begun}} {{before the last}} round of {{meetings}} in Moscow. On June 7, the Army was ordered to prepare for an attack against Lithuania. As of June 5, all Soviet forces in the Baltic region were assigned to command of Semyon Timoshenko, People's Commissar for Defense. The Soviets gathered their forces on Lithuania′s eastern border in modern-day Belarus; they consisted of five divisions and supporting units from the 3rd and the 11th Armies. The armies included 221,260 soldiers, operating 1,140 airplanes and 1,513 tanks. Lithuania already housed 18,786 Soviet troops within its territory. At the time the Lithuanian Army comprised 28,005 troops and owned 118 planes. The Soviets readied hospitals for the wounded and prisoner-of-war camps. On June 11, {{under the command of}} General Dmitry Pavlov, the Soviets finalized their attack plan and assigned specific tasks to all units. The orders were to cross the border silently, use bayonets as gunshots would be <b>noticed,</b> <b>and</b> to maneuver around defensive forces in order to occupy the territory more quickly. The Soviets expected {{to take control of the}} entire territory in three to four days.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{mention of the}} dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. Its extinction was not immediately <b>noticed,</b> <b>and</b> some considered {{it to be a}} mythical creature. In the 19th century, research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century. Among these is a dried head, the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today. Since then, a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius, mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp. The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species. The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and it has since become a fixture in popular culture, often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, <b>noticed</b> <b>and</b> shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The second reason was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised replenishment, and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E
