500|$|Divine's {{manager and}} friend Bernard Jay {{wrote a book}} titled Not Simply Divine!, {{published}} in 1992 by Virgin Books. Admitting that he was [...] "immensely proud" [...] of Divine and the cause which he [...] "strived for", Jay noted in the book's introduction that he wrote the work because he felt that Divine deserved a [...] "memorial" [...] that would act as a [...] "record for posterity". He insisted that Not Simply Divine! was [...] "not the bitter revenge of an unappreciated manager, eager <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his share of his praise", but that equally it was not [...] "a gushing homage" [...] designed to paint Divine as [...] "both saintly and legendary." [...] He expressed his hope that the book shines light on the [...] "shades of grey" [...] between {{the man and his}} female persona, portraying a [...] "warts and all" [...] picture. The book was criticized by Divine's mother, Frances Milstead, who accused Jay of writing a [...] "mean-spirited" [...] work that provided an incorrect image of her son. Not Simply Divine! was also criticised by Divine's friend Greg Gorman, who remarked that, [...] "there was so much hostility and so much meanspiritedness in the way Divine was portrayed in the book, that it was just 180 degrees from who he was." ...|$|E

At one point, McClellan exclaimed [...] "I'm begging you <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it back," [...] to management trustee Lewis G. Bernstein, referring to the joint welfare fund for the two unions.|$|E
2500|$|Sympathy for the Devil is {{also the}} title of a producer's edit of a 1968 film by Jean-Luc Godard whose own {{original}} version is called One Plus One. [...] The film, a depiction of the late 1960s American counterculture, also featured the Rolling Stones in the process of recording the song in the studio. On the filming, Jagger said in Rolling Stone: [...] " [...] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a film of us in the studio. I mean, it would never happen <b>now,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> someone as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. We could have been recording 'My Obsession.' But it was 'Sympathy for the Devil', and it became the track that we used." ...|$|E
