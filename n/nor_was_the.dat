5|$|Gaulois was a Charlemagne-class pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} {{built for}} the French Navy in the mid-1890s. She {{spent most of her}} career assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron (Escadre de la Méditerranée). The ship accidentally rammed two other French warships early in her career, although neither was seriously damaged, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> ship herself.|$|E
5|$|National Airlines Flight 2511 was a {{domestic}} passenger flight from New York City, New York to Miami, Florida that exploded in midair on January 6, 1960. The National Airlines Douglas DC-6 was carrying five crew members and 29 passengers, {{all of whom}} perished. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation concluded that the plane was brought down by a dynamite bomb. No criminal charges were ever filed, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> blame for the bombing ever determined, though a suicide bombing is suspected. The investigation remains open today.|$|E
5|$|However, after {{less than}} a month back in York, William died, on 8 June 1154, {{allegedly}} due to poison administered in the chalice at Mass. One of William's clerks accused Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York, of the murder, and Osbert was summoned before the king to be tried at the royal court. Before the trial could take place, however, Stephen died, and the trial never took place. William was buried in York Minster and within a few months of his death, miracles were attributed to his intervention and a sweet smell came from his tomb when it was damaged during a fire. <b>Nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> body decayed or burnt in the fire. Pope Honorius III then ordered an investigation into the miracles. In 1227, he was canonised in Rome by Pope Honorius III.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by Class of '44, a slice-of-life film made up of vignettes about Herman Raucher and Oscar Seltzer's experiences in college. Class of '44 involves the boys facing army service {{in the last year}} of World War II. The only crew member from Summer of '42 to return to the project was Raucher himself, who wrote the script; a new director and composer were brought in to replace Mulligan and Legrand. Of the principal four cast members of Summer of '42, only Jerry Houser and Gary Grimes returned for prominent roles, with Oliver Conant making two brief appearances totaling less than two minutes of screen time. Jennifer O'Neill did not appear in the film at all, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> character of Dorothy mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Jack was {{not always}} {{the name of the}} Georgetown Hoyas' mascot, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> mascot always a bulldog, as other types of dogs, {{particularly}} bull terriers, were associated with the sports teams before 1962. In 2009, the American Kennel Club ranked Jack as the 8th most popular dog in American culture. Today, Georgetown is among thirty-nine American universities to use a bulldog as their mascot, with Georgia, Butler, Mississippi State, Yale and James Madison being the only others with a live bulldog. Jack is also portrayed by a costumed character Bulldog mascot, a tradition dating to 1977.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August, Porto Alegre {{received}} {{instructions from}} Mitre {{to attack the}} Paraguayan fort at Curuzú. The operation would be carried out {{under the command of}} Tamandaré. Porto Alegre not only refused to defer to his cousin, arguing that both held the same rank, but also warned that he would operate by himself at Curuzú. Porto Alegre was incapable of submitting his forces to foreign direction and was unwilling to comply with orders issued by the allied commander. <b>Nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> situation among the allied forces improved once Porto Alegre and Tamandaré found common ground in their distaste for the Brazilian commander of the 1st Corps, Field Marshal Polidoro Quintanilha Jordão (later the Viscount of Santa Teresa). Jordão was ostracized for supporting Mitre and for {{being a member of the}} Conservative Party, while Porto Alegre and Tamandaré were Progressives.|$|E

5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The {{city had}} granted {{concessions}} to the two private tram companies until 1924, after which the city could expropriate the companies. Both companies were well run and highly profitable, and on 1 May 1924, KSS and KES were merged and {{taken over by the}} city council, which gave the new company the name Kristiania Sporveier ("Kristiania Tramways"). The municipality owned 51 per cent. On 1 January 1925, the city changed its name to Oslo, with the company's name also changing. The light rail lines operated by Holmenkolbanen and Ekebergbanen were not taken over, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Lilleaker Line operated by KES; the city council did not want to take over tram lines in Aker. The Lilleaker Line operations of KES were transferred to the private company Bærumsbanen ("The Bærum Line").|$|E
5|$|Guest was Minister of Mines and Public Works, from 1 June 1938 to 1 February 1944. The Electricity Supply Commission {{came under}} his portfolio. It had {{responsibility}} for {{ensuring that the}} generation of electricity kept pace with the ever·growing needs of mining, farming and secondary industry. When Guest became Minister the Commission was constructing a thermal power station at Umsweswe, but kept running short of money. The Minister of Finance, Jacob Smit, was reluctant to grant further funds but would support a hydro-electric scheme. Guest proposed Kariba {{as a source of}} hydro-electric power and Smit provided the money for further investigation. Guest arranged with a civil engineer named Jeffares, who had earlier surveyed the route of the proposed Sinoia/Kafue railway and knew the country around Kariba, to survey the area, select a site for a power station and submit a report. When he eventually did so, Guest appointed a committee of engineers to examine the proposal. They reported favourably but did not recommend that the scheme be proceeded with immediately. <b>Nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet particularly impressed, and the idea was strongly criticised by the Opposition in Parliament. The outbreak of the Second World War caused the project to be shelved but after the war the project was revived as a joint scheme to serve the two Rhodesias.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} this failure is to be {{attributed}} not to the want of sufficient cavalry, for indeed there was an ample number for the purpose, but to the confusion and disorder consequent upon the surprise which the French attack had occasioned, and which was augmented by the darkness that had set in upon the field. <b>Nor</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> failure caused {{by the absence of}} that most essential requisite in a charge of cavalry, good example {{on the part of the}} officers who lead the well set squadrons into the midst of an enemy's ranks.|$|E
