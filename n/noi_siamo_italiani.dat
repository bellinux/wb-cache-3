50|$|Margherita (Margherita Buy) is a {{director}} {{working on a}} social-realist film about a factory strike called <b>Noi</b> <b>Siamo</b> Qui (We Are Here), starring American actor Barry Huggins (John Turturro) as the factory owner. Huggins consistently fails to deliver his lines properly and the fraught nature of the shoot is exasperated by unhelpful advice from Margherita to her actors. She breaks up with her boyfriend, an actor in the film, and is divorced from {{the father of her}} daughter, Livia (Beatrice Mancini). Her brother Giovanni (Nanni Moretti) has taken time off work to help care for their ailing mother, Ada (Giulia Lazzarini), a retired classics teacher who has been hospitalised. Margherita comes to feel guilty for not taking on more responsibility for her mother and reflects on her often cold relations with her family, friends and colleagues.|$|R

He described his candidacy as a revolution, {{and stated that}} he wanted a party closer to the people, especially the poorest, accusing Renzi of drastically changing the PD and of abandoning people on low incomes. He also accused Orlando, who was Justice Minister also in Renzi's government, of supporting Matteo Renzi's liberal and centrist policies and not to have ever opposed his reforms. Emiliano also added that as Secretary he will not run to become Prime Minister, as Renzi did from February 2014 to December 2016. The Apulia Governor asked for M5S, Democrats and Progressives (MDP), Progressive Camp and Italian Left (SI) supporters {{to vote for him}} to beat Renzi; his intention is to build a centre-left to left-wing alliance composed of PD, MDP and SI, which can cooperate with the M5S.|$|R

2500|$|Investigations held {{by police}} {{telecommunications}} expert Gioacchino Genchi attested {{the presence of}} an undercover SISDE installation in Castello Utveggio, an art nouveau castle on Monte Pellegrino, a mountain overlooking Palermo and Via D'Amelio. This was discovered by analyzing the phone calls of mafia boss Gaetano Scotto, who called a SISDE phone in the castle. Scotto's brother Pietro had done maintenance work on phone lines in Via D'Amelio; it was later discovered that Pietro had tapped Borsellino's mother's phone to obtain confirmation of Borsellino's arrival before the massacre. All trace of SISDE disappeared from Castello Utveggio immediately after the assassination. Mafia boss Totò Riina spoke about the presence of the Italian intelligence service on Monte Pellegrino on 22 May 2004, in the trial relating to the Via dei Georgofili Massacre. In an interview on the Italian state TV documentary show La storia <b>siamo</b> <b>noi</b> (History is Us), Borsellino's wife said he, {{in the days before the}} massacre, had her close the shutters on the windows because [...] "they can observe us from Castello Utveggio".|$|R
50|$|Through {{his history}} in TV he {{successfully}} found the finances {{to create his}} first full-length feature film, titled The Four Doors of the Desert, filmed mostly in the Sahara desert with an international cast including the acclaimed actress Aure Atika as a main character. The film revolves around the colonial dominance in North Africa and {{tells the story of}} two men (inspired by the life of Charles de Foucauld and Moussa Ag Amastan), a Christian and a Muslim in a colonial time {{at the beginning of the}} last century. Unfortunately the film was affected by the government of Berlusconi, who halted all the money for the independent distribution of cinema works, ultimately denying the film's release. After a long pause in his work, he created Joe Petrosino, a documentary that tells the story of an Italian policeman who challenges the Mafia for the programme La storia <b>siamo</b> <b>noi</b> for Rai 2. Disappointed with the events regarding the film, he decided to move to England with his English-Italian family to work in a more stimulating environment.|$|R
