40|$|Age-specific {{access to}} {{high-quality}} resources (e. g. territory or nest site) {{might be an}} important determinant for improved reproductive performance with increasing age. I experimentally investigated the effects of territory quality versus other age-related improvements in breeding competence (e. g. foraging skills, breeding experience and local knowledge) on age-specific reproductive success. Territory quality (i. e. territory field layer height) was manipulated in year 2 of <b>northern</b> <b>wheatears</b> (Oenanthe oenanthe) that were breeding in the same territory in two consecutive years. Changing territory quality by changing field layer height had a strong effect on within-individual change in the reproductive success of wheatears. This effect was mainly due to a corresponding change in nest predation risk. When territory quality was kept constant (i. e. no between-year change in territory field layer height), within-individual reproductive success did not change between subsequent years. Thus, age-related improvements in foraging skills, breeding experience and local familiarity had no significant effect on within-individual changes in reproductive success. Increased reproductive success with increased age in <b>northern</b> <b>wheatears</b> is therefore mainly explained by an improved access to high-quality territories with increasing age. I conclude that age-dependent access to high-quality breeding resources might be a widespread phenomenon in nature...|$|R
40|$|Continuous animal populations {{often become}} {{fragmented}} due to anthropogenic habitat alterations. These small, fragmented populations are fragile due to demographic and genetic factors, whereas immigration can enhance their long-term viability. Previously, {{we showed that}} high philopatry affected the local dynamics of three small and remnant subpopulations of <b>Northern</b> <b>Wheatears</b> in The Netherlands. Here, we show that these three populations together with an additional larger population in the European lowlands are highly genetically differentiated based on 22 microsatellite markers. In contrast, we found no evidence for differentiation using two mitochondrial DNA markers. An IMa 2 analysis indicates that gene flow has occurred regularly among our sampled populations. As immigration of colour-ringed birds among our sampled populations is rare at best, our {{results suggest that the}} populations have recently become isolated from one another. Low dispersal rates in highly mobile birds may occur when suitable habitat becomes highly fragmented, and will accentuate stochastic demographic processes and inbreeding, both reducing population viability. As dispersal rates are low among populations of <b>Northern</b> <b>Wheatears</b> in The Netherlands, there is only a small probability of recolonization of habitat patches where populations have become locally extinct. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStopover {{studies have}} {{concentrated}} so far mostly on mechanisms regulating the temporal organisation on the day-to-day level. Taking {{advantage of the}} small and isolated island of Helgoland in the North Sea, we investigated the stopover and departure behaviour of a nocturnal migrant by using radio telemetry. Special attention was paid particularly to nocturnal behaviour, their departure times within the night, and departure directions. Here, we show that <b>Northern</b> <b>Wheatears,,</b> performed regularly nocturnal exploratory flights on nights before and on departure night, which might be a common behaviour of nocturnal migrants to evaluate meteorological conditions aloft prior to departure. We proposed that migrants being prepared for an endurance flight would depart early in the night {{within a short time}} window, whereas individuals departing with low fuel load would be less prone to take off early. Our data, however, could not support this hypothesis. In respect of the migratory direction, there was a significant correlation between departure direction and departure fuel load. <b>Northern</b> <b>Wheatears</b> with high departure fuel loads headed more towards the north than lean migrants, which departed mostly towards the nearest coastline, i. e. east to south. Thus, birds with high fuel loads showed their seasonally appropriate migratory direction irrespective of the ecological barrier ahead, whereas lean birds avoided this direction.

40|$|Background: To assess {{population}} {{persistence of}} species living in heterogeneous landscapes, {{the effects of}} habitat on reproduction and survival have to be investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a matrix population model to estimate habitat-specific population growth rates for a population of <b>northern</b> <b>wheatears</b> Oenanthe oenanthe breeding in farmland consisting of a mosaic of distinct habitat (land use) types. Based on extensive long-term data on reproduction and survival, habitats characterised by tall field layers (spring- and autumn-sown crop fields, ungrazed grasslands) displayed negative stochastic population growth rates (log l s: 20. 332, 20. 429, 20. 168, respectively), that were markedly lower than growth rates of habitats characterised by permanently short field layers (pastures grazed by cattle or horses, and farmyards, log ls: 20. 056, + 0. 081, 20. 059). Although habitats differed with respect to reproductive performance, differences in habitat-specific population growth were largely {{due to differences in}} adult and first-year survival rates, as shown by a life table response experiment (LTRE). Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that estimation of survival rates is important for realistic assessments of habitat quality. Results also indicate that grazed grasslands and farmyards may act as source habitats, whereas crop fields and ungrazed grasslands with tall field layers may act as sink habitats. We suggest that the strong decline of <b>northern</b> <b>wheatears</b> in Swedish farmland may be linked to the corresponding observed loss of high quality breeding habitat, i. e. grazed seminatura...|$|R

40|$|Predation {{ultimately}} {{affects the}} fitness of individuals. In nest building species like birds, the predation of dependent offspring {{is the most}} important source of reproductive failure, favouring the selection of parental adaptations to enhance offspring survival. However, environmental heterogeneity hampers individuals of having an accurate knowledge of perceived current risks. Consequently, individuals have to acquire information about their environment to optimise their nest site selection, antipredation responses, and parental investment decisions. Thus, individual reproductive decisions should be dynamic and depend on the availability and reliability of environmental information, as well as a species life-history strategy. This thesis examines the effect of individual risk assessment and antipredation strategies on parental investment in brown thornbills Acantiza pusilla, as well as the reliability of landscape features in predicting nest predation patterns in <b>northern</b> <b>wheatears</b> Oenanthe oenanthe. During incubation brown thornbill females used dynamic risk assessment to evaluate the risk different predators posed. Decreased environmental information via greater nest concealment increased female vigilance, with greater vigilance tending to increase brood survival. Within the breeding season, parental risk sensitivity increased and decreased for consecutive breeding attempts. Feeding rates {{in the presence of a}} predator of adults and a brood predator decreased, while risk taking increased by approaching predators more closely. When facing predators, brown thornbills used two alarm vocalisations, with alarm call rate denoting the degree of danger a predator posed to the adult birds. Parental alarm calls only silenced nesting begging over short time periods. In <b>northern</b> <b>wheatears,</b> predation increased for birds breeding closer to agricultural field and woodland habitat interfaces. This was only the case during incubation but not during nestling feeding, indicating that seasonal changes in ground vegetation structure and a change in predator composition can result in highly variable predation patterns. Overall, this thesis shows that antipredation responses and predation patterns can be dynamic and change within time and space, and thus influence the breeding success of bird species in general...|$|R
40|$|Adverse weather {{conditions}} during parental care may have direct consequences for offspring production, but longer-term effects on juvenile and parental sur-vival are less well known.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{we found that}} juvenile <b>northern</b> <b>wheatears</b> (Oenanthe oenanthe) exposed to a magnetic displacement {{to the west of}} their natural migration route increased their body mass. The total intensity and inclination used for the western displacement may also have been interpreted as northern compared to the experimental site (stronger total field intensity and steeper inclination angle). In order to investigate whether the fuelling response was a response to an unexpected magnetic field or specific to the northern magnetic field, we conducted a new experiment. Juvenile wheatears from the same study population were magnetically displaced to southwestern magnetic fields, exposing the birds to unexpected magnetic combinations, but eliminating the possible effect of a northern magnetic field. A control group was kept in the local geomagnetic field in Sweden for comparison. There was no difference in body mass increase between treatments, suggesting that the fuelling response previously found was not a simple response to an unexpected magnetic field, but rather a specific response to the northern magnetic field. Juvenile wheatears may have developed a fuelling response to northern magnetic fields in order to enable a successful flight towards the migration goal...|$|R
