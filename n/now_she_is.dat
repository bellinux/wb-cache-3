5|$|In 1875 no one {{living outside}} {{of two or}} three back streets of Lynn had heard of Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early days the leader and teacher paid out half of her ten dollars a week to hire a hall, {{patching}} out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an instructor in mental healing; <b>now,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> one of the richest women in the United States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American woman.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Beyoncé {{made the}} Time 100 list, with Baz Luhrmann writing: No one has that voice, no one moves {{the way she}} moves, no one can hold an {{audience}} the way she does... When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right <b>now,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the heir-apparent diva of the USA – the reigning national voice. In 2014, Beyoncé was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured {{on the cover of}} the issue.|$|E
5|$|Briseis, {{at least}} for now, is equally {{affected}} {{by the possibility of}} separation from her lover. Troilus goes to her room and they spend the night together, trying to comfort each other. Troilus is part of the escort to hand her over the next day. Once she is with the Greeks, Diomedes is immediately struck by her beauty. Although she is not hostile, she cannot accept him as her lover. Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for herself that the gods have decreed Troy's fall and that she is safer <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> with the Greeks.|$|E

60|$|And <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> scornfully entertained at the {{behaviour}} {{of everybody}} in the war crisis.|$|R
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, Hunt got {{to talking}} about her breast removal with a twelve-year-old boy and told the boy that <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> like the Amazons of old who would have a breast removed {{so that when they}} went into battle they could use their bow without their breast getting in the way when they let their arrows fly.|$|E
25|$|Ms. Primlani {{had started}} the non profit {{organisation}} {{more than a decade}} prior to the allegations. Thimmakka's adopted son, Umesh has claimed that the organisation misuses her name to collect donations. Ms. Primlani had visited Thimmakka back in 2003 where photos were taken of her gifting Thimmakka with a saree. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> said to have allegedly taken Thimmakka's finger prints, while she says Thimmakka okayed the non-profit back then in front of a judge.|$|E

25|$|The ephemeral {{qualities of}} operatic success are once more {{exemplified}} by the case of Emilie Ambre. In {{the early days of}} the Mapleson regime she made something of a sensation in New York, particularly as Aida, a role to which her very dark complexion was well suited. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dead. Not long ago her effects were auctioned off at the Hotel Drouot. The whole civilized world heard the news, but there was scarcely a sigh from the public, for the singer had been absolutely forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Callie {{eventually}} {{confesses to}} Arizona why the date didn't go well: {{they went to}} an expensive restaurant that she couldn't afford because she has been disowned by her father and <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> broke. Arizona tells her they will stay in to eat and they reconcile. Meredith tells Bailey and Derek's idea to Izzie: they give her their wedding. Yang becomes the maid of honor and Meredith serves as Alex's best man. Back at the hospital, Izzie is sad about her hair loss but Alex tells her she doesn't need it to be beautiful. The episode concludes with Izzie having shaved her head and telling Denny to leave as {{she wants to be}} alone with her husband.|$|E
25|$|Sister Jude {{spends the}} {{evening in the}} motel diner, where she sees Shachath waiting for her. Sister Jude knows her to be the Angel of Death, but {{questions}} her about why she has appeared now, instead of the many other times when she attempted suicide: the night her husband left her after she {{told him he had}} infected her with syphilis, leaving her barren, or the night she committed the hit-and-run. Shachath tells her that the other times, she still had hope and purpose, but <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> willing to help Jude find peace. Sister Jude agrees, but says she must do one last thing. She visits the parents of the girl she killed, Missy, claiming to be a nun who found her calling after hearing of Missy's accident. She is intent on telling them the truth, when an adult Missy (Kristin Slaysman) walks into the home, revealing that she had in fact survived the accident. Sister Jude is stunned and the parents recount that they never learned who was responsible, but have made peace with it.|$|E

25|$|Kat visits Stacey for Christmas and {{discovers that}} Martin is not Arthur's father, urging Stacey {{to tell him}} the truth. As Stacey is about to do so, Kyle {{approaches}} her and formally introduces himself to her as her half-brother. After overhearing Kat talk to someone about a baby being stolen, Stacey fears for Arthur's safety and takes refuge in the church, where Dot Branning (June Brown), who has been teaching her about Christianity, finds her and tells her the story of the Massacre of the Innocents, causing Stacey to believe that Arthur is in danger. Believing people are trying to harm Arthur, Stacey unsuccessfully attempts to baptise Arthur through Dot's sink. She discovers that Charlie has died, so flees and meets Kyle, asking him to run away with her. Martin calls her, claiming that Kyle is not who he says he is and Stacey accuses Kyle of being the devil. She takes a cab and sees a vision of Charlie driving it, and he convinces her to return home to Walford. During a storm she goes to the roof of The Queen Victoria public house, saying that God is coming for Arthur. Martin finds her there and she tells him that Arthur was sent from God and <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> waiting for God to rescue them. Martin is forced to go along with this and convinces her to come home with him.|$|E
500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> smarter." ...|$|E
500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even <b>now,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> still there. That is what I heard from my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage." ...|$|E

2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, Real Madrid wanted to sell Van der Vaart, but the player decided to stay in Madrid because his wife was {{undergoing}} cancer treatment there. A year later, upon his move to England, Van der Vaart stated, [...] "She had a very serious illness {{and it is true}} that she had to be treated at the Clinica Quiron. Last season, they wanted me to leave but I couldn't leave for that reason. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> well {{and the only thing that}} happened was that Madrid wanted to sell and I wanted to get back to enjoying playing football, and Tottenham are a great team that are going to give me the football opportunities that I need." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Meiji era, Haru Hiratsuka {{took up the}} pen name Raicho Hiratsuka {{and founded}} the first all-women {{literary}} magazine called Seitō, {{with a number of}} other like minded contributors. [...] Seitō was published in 1911 with 134 pages at the start and only 1,000 copies were printed, but the launch of the magazine began the feminist movement in Japan. [...] Hiratsuka herself stated in her first essay, [...] "In the beginning, woman was truly the sun. [...] An authentic person. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the moon, a wan and sickly moon, dependent on another, reflecting another's brilliance." [...] Indicating that women had fallen from their position of power as representations of the divine and were made subservient, reflecting the grandeur of others, becoming practically invisible on their own.|$|E

Her time has passed." [...] She broke into tears after {{a game in which}} the crowd had booed her for using underhand serves and crossing the line in a discussion about an umpire decision. After a shock first-round, straight set, loss to Jelena Dokić at Wimbledon, Hingis bounced back to reach her third consecutive US Open final, where she lost to 17-year-old Serena Williams. Hingis won a total of seven singles titles that year and reclaimed the No. 1 singles ranking. She also reached the final of the WTA Tour Championships, where she lost to Lindsay Davenport.|$|E

She recalls the days when they might have been happy, but that time has passed. Onegin repeats his love for her. Faltering for a moment, she admits that she still loves him, but she will not allow him to ruin her and declares her determination to remain faithful to her husband.
