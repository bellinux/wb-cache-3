40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that assessments of <b>need</b> thwarting better predict diminished functioning and ill-being compared to low <b>need</b> satisfaction, which better predict optimal functioning and well-being. In this study we aimed to further explore the important theoretical distinction between psychological <b>need</b> thwarting and <b>need</b> satisfaction in the domain of interpersonal relationships. We examined whether the distinction between <b>need</b> satisfaction and thwarting is due to method effects resulting from positive and negative item wording, however, multitrait multi-method analyses indicated no substantial method effects. Further, we showed that a lack of <b>need</b> satisfaction (i. e., <b>need</b> dissatisfaction) is not equivalent to experiences of <b>need</b> thwarting. In fact, <b>need</b> thwarting better predicted compromised relational functioning compared to <b>need</b> dissatisfaction. <b>Need</b> satisfaction was a stronger predictor of interpersonal competence compared to <b>need</b> thwarting and <b>need</b> dissatisfaction. The current findings underline the importance of assessing <b>need</b> thwarting when examining compromised functioning in interpersonal relationships...|$|R

5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting <b>needs.</b> Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human <b>needs</b> and that these <b>needs</b> are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting <b>needs</b> clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their <b>needs,</b> the <b>needs</b> of others, and the feelings that surround these <b>needs,</b> harmony can be achieved.|$|E
