25|$|While using Delhemme {{to speak}} for them, the hijackers asked for 27 tonnes of fuel; the {{aircraft}} needed approximately 9 tonnes to fly to Paris from Marseille. The request indicated to the French authorities that the aircraft {{was going to be}} used as a firebomb or to fly the aircraft to an Islamic country sympathetic to the hijackers' cause. Hours later, the authorities received word of the firebomb plot. Passengers who were released in Algiers stated that the A300 had been rigged with explosives. Demolition experts determined that the plane was likely rigged in a way that would cause it to explode. Charles Pasqua said in an interview that the French government had decided that the aircraft was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Marseille, regardless of the consequences.|$|E
500|$|Sophie {{learns that}} Howl has been {{transforming}} into a bird-like creature {{in order to}} interfere with the plans of both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Sophie's mother — under Suliman's control — arrives and leaves behind a [...] "peeping bug." [...] The former witch promptly destroys the bug by tossing it into Calcifer, who then becomes sick and weak and unable to protect the castle. A few hours later the city is bombed by enemy aircraft. Suliman's henchmen invade the group's abode. After healing Calcifer, Howl tells Sophie that he is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> because he wants to protect her. Deducing that Howl is trying to protect the castle and everyone inside it, Sophie moves everyone out, removes Calcifer from the fireplace and destroys the castle. The witch realizes that Howl has given his heart to Calcifer, and grabs the fire demon. A panicked Sophie pours water onto the witch, which douses Calcifer. The castle is split in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from Markl, the witch and Calcifer.|$|E
500|$|A third {{attempt was}} made in late July, but was again not {{successful}} due to the mechanical troubles and heavy seasickness the Carlins experienced. The Carlins set out for a fourth time in early August, and progressed further, being sighted several days after their launch by an American destroyer almost [...] off of New York. However, the couple soon lost radio contact, prompting Pan-American Airways to direct their crews to search for their craft. Half-Safe and the Carlins were finally rescued approximately [...] off New York by the oil tanker New Jersey, bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Seven days into the voyage, a propeller bearing had welded itself fast {{due to lack of}} lubrication, leaving the vessel to drift aimlessly for a further ten days without means of steering it or navigating. According to a message Carlin radioed from the tanker to his friends in New York, the couple [...] "drifted and fished", enjoying a [...] "pleasant life, cheaper than Atlantic City". At the time of the couple's rescue, he considered abandoning the entire voyage, but was convinced to continue by the tanker's Norwegian captain, who greeted Carlin with the words: [...] "Hell, you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> that god-damned Jeep lying around?!" ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2009, The Register {{reported}} {{on an ongoing}} case involving Scientology before Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee, [...] "According to site administrators, several pro-Scientology accounts have been editing the site using Scientology-owned computers." [...] The Arbitration Committee on Wikipedia is composed {{of a group of}} volunteers elected by the editing community to resolve especially difficult conflicts. During the Arbitration case, the page about Scientology was modified by members of the organization. Scientology members had doctored entries in order to advertise for their cause. The Register noted that one of the Wikipedia users admitted he had edited from computers operated by the Scientology organization, [...] "One of these pro-Scientology editors [...] who once used the handle 'COFS' [...] has admitted as much.

500|$|Rebecca Mader's {{audition}} {{scene was}} a fake flashback {{and she was}} disappointed {{that it was not}} used for the show. [...] The character's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast. [...] Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American; however, the writers preferred Mader's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly. [...] Losts writer-producers compared Mader to [...] "a young Nicole Kidman". [...] During the casting process, Charlotte was described as a [...] "successful academic". [...] It was falsely rumored that Kristen Bell was offered the role of Charlotte; Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part; however, no role was offered to her. [...] Despite never having seen Lost, Mader decided that she [...] "was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> [...] room until [...] made [...] fall in love with [...] ". [...] Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of Lost and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role. [...] In the next two to three weeks, Mader– who was then signed on as a recurring guest star– watched the rest of the first three seasons, watching the third season finale a matter of hours before she began shooting her first [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] scene, in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group. [...] Mader was told little about her character by the writer-producers, except that [...] "she was sort of like a female Indiana Jones type". [...] Mader has found it challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives. [...] Charlotte's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis, which is an homage to the author C.S. Lewis, best known for The Chronicles of Narnia and various books about Christianity. [...] Lewis was one of Mader's favorite authors as a child and found it [...] "wicked" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] for her character to be named after him. [...] Mader also enjoyed that she only requires a small amount of hair and makeup done, saying that [...] "I just wanted to rough it. [...] I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun." [...] Mader claims that she has [...] "never had so much fun in [...] life" [...] as when she is shooting Lost. In the episode, Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in the fifth season episode [...] "LaFleur", when Charlotte is depicted as being a little girl in 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right.|$|E

The highlight of the trip was a brief, but harrowing, encounter with a tribe called the Big Nambas of northern Malekula. Once there, the chief was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let them <b>leave.</b> The intervention of a British gunboat helped them escape. The footage they got there inspired the feature film Among the Cannibal Isles of the South Seas (1918).|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Jackson {{released}} her eighth studio album, Damita Jo. The album debuted at number two on Billboard 200, was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and sold over three million copies worldwide. However, its singles received minimal airplay {{due to a}} blacklist of Jackson's music and videos on many music channels and radio formats caused by legalities surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. Jackson then decided to start {{to work on a}} new project in the coming year, involving her then-fiancé, record producer Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned to executive produce the project, in addition to a number of other producers. She decided to create a modern record, while returning to dance music, in the vein of her hit album, Control (1986). Producer Jimmy Jam revealed that while recording the album, Janet became more confident with her writing ability, doing the bulk of the writing. He also commented, [...] "We're all kind of back in there doing it again together, which I really enjoy." [...] It's the physical nature of sitting in the same room and really hashing it out. It's like, 'You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> until we have a lyric,' so it's fun." [...] Jackson and Jimmy both agreed that Dupri molded well into their tri due to him being a fan of Jam and Lewis' work and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|The love {{triangle}} of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention {{and was considered}} one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Soap Opera Digest named it the [...] "Best Love Triangle". Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Michelle Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, [...] "In a perfect world, she'd wish [...] Nick's. But he's married; he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Sharon. And she doesn't want him to." [...] The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled the week Phyllis discovered she was expecting as a [...] "can't-miss week" [...] for the popular triangle. Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, [...] "Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from my emotions. [...] Well, unless you are a person without a conscience, this is impossible. [...] Most men just don’t realize that once you have sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone you are having the affair with. [...] When this happens, things spin wildly out of control." [...] With Phyllis and Nick gaining a fan following, On-Air On-Soaps referred to this as the [...] "Phick vs. Shick" [...] fan-base war.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions Marseille. On 14 July, Marseille manager Didier Deschamps {{confirmed}} that the club was negotiating with both Diarra and Bordeaux for a transfer.

Despite Marseille remaining hopeful a deal could go through, on 30 July, a deal was declared dead. Diarra later stated that he was happy to remain at Bordeaux and see out the rest of his contract.

Despite suitable offers for the player, Lille chairman Michel Seydoux declared that Rami was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>leaving</b> the club after a reported move to Marseille for €12 million was abruptly canceled in July 2009. The announcement {{led to a}} distraught and angry Rami declaring that he would see {{out the rest of}} his contract with Lille playing in the reserves if he wasn't transferred. He even went as far as to state that there was a conspiracy between Lille and Lyon, due to the club's easy negotiations during transfers between each other, as well as Seydoux's brother, Jérôme, being a shareholder of Lyon.

40|$|SUMMARY Contrary to often-heard concerns, {{the main}} {{question}} regarding {{the future of}} the European single currency is <b>not</b> who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> but who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> join. Three of the new EU member states want to join Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and adopt the euro within the next year, and others are due to follow within the next decade. The experience of the first seven years demonstrates that membership has its benefits, but that these benefits are not free. Being part of a currency union requires discipline, and the loss of the exchange rate as an instrument for coping with economic shocks can be costly. Within the euro area some members, such as Ireland, are thriving; others, especially among the southern member sta-tes, are struggling and face painful adjustments in the future. As the chart below illustrates, economic divergences between existing members have been significant. Ireland and Portugal have experienced marked real exchange rate appreciation, but with very different consequen-ces for export growth. There has been real depreciation in both Germany and France, but only Germany’s exports have flourished...|$|R
