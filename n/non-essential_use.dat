40|$|The use of {{naloxone}} {{in emergency}} medicine is primarily {{connected to the}} treatment of a syndrome known as overdose, which is cause by <b>non-essential</b> <b>use</b> of heroin and certain opioid agonists. The dose of naloxone required to be efficacious depends on the quantity of opioid assumed, its receptorial affinity and its kinetics: in propoxyphene and pentazocine intoxication, for instance, higher doses are require than those needed in the treatment of morphine or heroin overdose. Intravenous administration is the most efficacious and fast-acting method: however, in certain cases, and depending on aspects that are typical of overdose patient management (e. g. the difficulties connected to vein access, skin scarring, severe hypotension), alternative pathways may be used. These include intraand sub-lingual and intratracheale administration, inhalatory administration via nebulisation (possible in the presence of respiratory action only), and intramuscular and subcutaneaous administration (which are efficacious in the absence of hypoperfusion). However, the most promising means of administration would appear to be intranasal administration, thanks to the relative ease of access, lower risk of contact with bodily fluids and the excellent bioavailability and rapidity of the effect, which is similar to that achieved with intravenous administration...|$|E

Some of these secondary metabolites and their semi-synthetic derivatives have proven to be indispensible to modern medicine, and others are highly desirable for <b>non-essential</b> <b>uses</b> such as food additives, fragrances and dyes. Our laboratory became interested in the actinomycetes produced pladienolide natural products when they were originally reported due to their potent antitumor activity and unique cell-cycle arrest profile. The novel assay used in their discovery, and the reported biological data indicated that these natural products probably had a unique mechanism of action against tumor cells. Herein is described research toward the synthesis and structural elucidation of the pladienolides and their close structural relative FD- 895. This research was accompanied by efforts to isolate authentic samples of the pladienolides from their producer organism, Streptomyces platensis MER 11107. These efforts led to the isolation and structural elucidation of novel spirotetronate polyketides from this organism, the spirohexenolides. Chapter 1 describes attempts toward the synthesis of the core macrolactone ring of the pladienolides and FD- 895, the synthesis of the sidechain of FD- 895, and the synthesis of two models of FD- 895 which demonstrate the feasibility of our end-game strategy toward this family of natural products.

40|$|Albania {{is among}} the most {{vulnerable}} countries to external energy shocks and climatic conditions, because of its high dependency on hydropower for electricity. Given highly volatile international energy prices and expected global warming, it is becoming increasingly important to manage the demand for electricity. However, the country has long been faced with a significant problem of electricity metering. About one-third of total energy is lost for technical and nontechnical reasons. This paper estimates the residential demand function by applying a two-stage system equation method for an endogenous censored variable, because the lack of metering makes the electricity consumption partially observable for the econometrician. It is found that metering is important to curb <b>non-essential</b> electricity <b>use</b> by households. The electricity demand could also be reduced by raising the first block rate and lowering the second block rate and the threshold between the two blocks. In addition, weather conditions and home appliance ownership would affect the demand for electricity. But the latter looks more influential than the former.

40|$|Understanding the {{architecture}} of the metabolism from annotated genome sequences of organisms is a major task for postgenomic biology. Recent studies of metabolic networks have focused on the relevance of specific metabolites [1]. However, from a practical and biological point of view, it is important to investigate the enzymatic influence on the network since metabolites are not encoded in the genome, while enzymes are subjected to evolution and can be genetically engineered to change the metabolism. A critical issue is the determination of the important enzymes that can be used as targets for drugs. We propose a novel graph analysis of the metabolism that determines the most important (essential) enzymes of an organism and apply it to E. coli [2] as a model organism. Essential enzymes belong to the set of proteins necessary to an organism to be viable.

40|$|Primary and {{secondary}} metabolites {{are produced by}} microorganisms to survive in their environment, where primary metabolites are essential and mainly used for growth, the secondary metabolites are <b>non-essential</b> and <b>used</b> for {{a broader range of}} purposes. The final products can reach from antibiotics, cytostatics, fatty acids to several other compounds [1]. A small group of secondary metabolites are produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), which produce non-ribosomal proteins (NRPs). They contain several domains of which the adenylation domain, defines the specificity of the module. Adenylation domains need sometimes the assistance of a MbtH-like domain/ protein to function properly, which gives the MbtH-like protein its function as a helper protein. MbtH-like proteins are mainly produced by Actinobacteria, but they are also found in several other bacteria, generally prokaryotes [4]. The predicted structure of the MbtH-like proteins reveals the importance of two conserved tryptophan residues, which form a small pocket in the MbtH-like domain [9]. The precise function of the MbtH-like proteins is still unknown, though several depletion and reconstitution assays show, that the MbtH-like proteins help with the activation, solubilisation and overexpression of NRPSs. Also MbtH-like proteins from several species can replace each other, which means that the protein is likely a chaperone, facilitator or stabilization factor. But some NRPSs have also activity without MbtH-like proteins or can be replaced by the RubC 1 a domain, which is a fusion of the A-domain and a MbtH-like protein and is seen as the ancestral version of the MbtH-like protein. Because of these possibilities it is likely that MbtH-like proteins have a specific function, which could by exploited for biological applications, like strain-improvement and during the optimization of antibiotic production by secondary metabolite biosynthesis. ...|$|R
40|$|DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{are highly}} {{genotoxic}} lesions, which can promote chromosomal rearrangements and tumorigenesis through oncogene activation {{or loss of}} heterozygosity (LOH) at tumour suppressor loci. To identify new genes involved in DSB repair and genome stability, an S. pombe deletion library was screened for mutants which exhibited sensitivity to the DNA damaging agents bleomycin and/or MMS. 192 mutants were isolated which exhibited increased sensitivity to {{one or both of}} these agents. These mutants were further analysed in a sectoring assay and mutants sought which exhibited elevated levels of break-induced loss and rearrangement of a <b>non-essential</b> minichromosome. <b>Using</b> this approach 57 genes were identified, including all known homologous recombination (HR) and DNA damage checkpoint genes present in the library. Further, quantitative analysis of DSB repair indicated that 25 of these genes functioned to promote efficient HR repair, thus representing a comprehensive HR gene set in fission yeast. Included in this gene set are 10 genes not previously implicated in HR repair; nse 5 ⁺, nse 6 ⁺, ddb 1 ⁺, cdt 2 ⁺, alm 1 ⁺, snz 1 ⁺, kin 1 ⁺, pal 1 ⁺, SPAC 31 G 5. 18 c⁺ and SPCC 613. 03 ⁺. Detailed characterisation of ddb 1 Δ and cdt 2 Δ established a role for the Ddb 1 -Cul 4 Cdt 2 ubiquitin ligase complex in HR. The findings presented here support a model in which break-induced Rad 3 and Ddb 1 -Cul 4 Cdt 2 ubiquitin ligase-dependent Spd 1 degradation promotes ribonucleotide reductase activation and nucleotide biosynthesis, which is required for post-synaptic ssDNA gap filling during HR repair. Lastly, the role of HR genes in suppressing chromosome loss and rearrangements was examined. A striking inverse correlation between levels of gene conversion and levels of both chromosome loss and LOH was observed across the HR gene deletion set. These findings support a common and likely evolutionarily conserved role for HR genes in suppressing both chromosome loss and break-induced chromosomal rearrangements resulting from extensive end processing associated with failed HR repair.

40|$|High-throughput {{methods to}} examine protein {{localization}} or organelle morphology {{is an effective}} tool for studying protein interactions and can help achieve an comprehensive understanding of molecular pathways. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{with the development of}} the non-essential gene deletion array, we can globally study the morphology of different organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria using GFP (or variant) -markers in different gene backgrounds. However, incorporating GFP markers in each single mutant individually is a labor-intensive process. Here, we describe a procedure that is routinely used in our laboratory. By using a robotic system to handle high-density yeast arrays and drug selection techniques, we can significantly shorten the time required and improve reproducibility. In brief, we cross a GFP-tagged mitochondrial marker (Apc 1 -GFP) to a high-density array of 4, 672 nonessential gene deletion mutants by robotic replica pinning. Through diploid selection, sporulation, germination and dual marker selection, we recover both alleles. As a result, each haploid single mutant contains Apc 1 -GFP incorporated at its genomic locus.

40|$|Abstract Background The ubiquitin(Ub) -proteasome pathway is {{implicated in}} the {{regulation}} {{of a variety of}} cellular functions and {{plays a major role in}} stress response in eukaryotic cells, by targeting misfolded and damaged proteins for degradation. In addition, in the presence of DNA damage, the Ub-proteasome system regulates proteins involved in sensing, repairing, and/or tolerating the damage. Antitumor agents such as cisplatin can activate the pathway, but the role of specific pathway components in cell sensitivity/response to the drug is not known. Since platinum compounds represent clinically relevant antitumor agents and a major limitation to their use is the development of drug resistance, there is an urgent need for identifying targets for improving their efficacy. Results In the present study, we performed a genome-wide screening for sensitivity to cisplatin <b>using</b> <b>non-essential</b> haploid deletion mutants of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, belonging to a collection of haploid strains constructed through homologous recombination. Using this approach, we identified three Ub-proteasome mutants exhibiting hypersensitivity to cisplatin (ubp 16, ubc 13 and pmt 3) and ten mutants (including ufd 2, beta 7 20 S, rpt 6 /let 1) resistant to the drug. In addition, the importance of lub 1 gene emerged from the comparison between the present screening and gene expression profile data previously obtained in fission yeast. Conclusions The factors identified in the present study allowed us to highlight most finely the close relationship between the Ub-proteasome system and DNA damage response mechanisms, thus establishing a comprehensive framework of regulators likely relevant also in higher eukaryotes. Our results provide the proof of principle of the involvement of specific genes modulated by cisplatin treatment in cell response to the drug, suggesting their potential role as targets for modulating cisplatin sensitivity. In this regard, the prospective identification of novel targets for modulation of cisplatin sensitivity in an eukaryotic model organism appears particularly intriguing towards the discovery of strategies to overcome cisplatin resistance in human tumors. </p...|$|R

Wheat, {{the main source of}} protein, was fed alone or supplemented with the purified essential amino acid lysine, methionine and/or threonine. Clycine was the source of <b>non-essential</b> nitrogen. Criteria <b>used</b> for evaluating protein quality were average daily weight gain, average daily food intake and gain per unit of food intake. In the experiment with baby pigs only one variety of wheat, high protein wheat (HPW) was used. The level of protein was the same for all the diets. The diets were supplemented with essential and non-essential amino acids as follows: (1) high protein wheat (HPW), (2) HPW + lysine, (3) HPW + lysine + methionine, (4) HPW + lysine + threonine, (5) HPW + lysine, methionine and threonine and, (6) HPW + ½ (essential amino acids used in diet 5) + glycine. Results showed no differences in feed consumption among the treatments. Higher weight gains were obtained with the supplemented diets (P 3 ̆c. 01) than with the unsupplemented one. Among the supplemented diets a decrease in growth (P 3 ̆c. 05) was observed in diets, in which one-half the amount of essential amino acid of diet 5 was used. According to the results of this experiment HPW when fed alone is not adequate for supporting growth in baby pigs.

Around 2.5 to 3.5 MBq of [18 F]FAZA, containing buffer was added per plate and incubated for 4 h under either normal or hypoxic conditions. Sunitinib maleate 90 µL of 10 ‒ 4 ‒M (in DMSO) was added to selected plates to analyze the effect of sunitinib on cellular [18 F]FAZA binding. After incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer to stop further cell uptake and then immediately lysed using 1 mL 5 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 1 h. One plate of each condition was used for protein quantification using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and bovine serum albumin {{was used as the}} protein standard. Following the 1 -h lysis with TCA, the supernatants were collected and placed into scintillation vials to be counted using the Wizard gamma counter (Wallac 1480 Wizard- 3, Perkin-Elmer) in order to determine radioactivity uptake levels in the cells. Radiotracer cell uptake levels were normalized to percent of the total added radioactivity per milligram protein (% radioactivity/mg protein). Data are presented as means ± SEM.|$|R
40|$|Die meisten sekretorischen Proteine der eukaryontischen Zellen erreichen durch das endoplasmatische Retikulum (ER) den sekretorischen Signalweg. Sie gelangen vom Zytoplasma durch einen Kanal in der ER-Membran in das ER, wo sie ihre native Konformation erhalten. Das ER enthält ein strenges Qualitätskontrollsystem, welches fehlgefaltete Proteine erkennt, im ER zurückhält und letztendlich der ER-assoziierten Degradation (ERAD) zuführt. Die ER-Qualitätskontrolle und die ER-assoziierte Degradation sind eng miteinander verknüpft, und werden unter der Bezeichnung ER-Qualitätskontrolle und assoziierte Degradation (ERQD) zusammengefasst. Die ERQD ist von der Hefe bis hin zum Menschen ein hoch konservierter Prozess. Aus diesem Grund wird die Hefe Saccharomyces cerevisiae als Modellorganismus zur Erforschung solcher sogenannter „housekeeping“ Prozesse genutzt. In dieser Arbeit wurden durch einen genomweiten Screen neue Komponenten der ER-assoziierten Degradation identifiziert. Für diesen Screen wurden die EUROSCARF Hefe-Deletionsbank und das Screeningsubstrat Sec 61 - 2 L verwendet. Die Deletionsbank besteht aus etwa 5000 diploiden S. cerevisiae Stämmen mit je einer homozygoten Einfachdeletion. Bei dem Screeningsubstrat Sec 61 - 2 L handelt es sich um das nicht glykosylierte, mutierte Translokonprotein Sec 61 - 2 und einer C-terminalen zytosolischen Fusion mit der 3 -Isopropylmalat-Dehydrogenase (Leu 2). Das für Sec 61 - 2 L kodierende Plasmid wurde in die leu 2 -auxotrophen Deletionsstämme transformiert und der Wachstumsphänotyp bei 38 ° auf Leucin-defizientem Medium getestet. Aufgrund der Punktmutation faltet sich Sec 61 - 2 bei 38 °C in einer Art und Weise, dass es der ER-Degradation unterliegt. Nur wenn Sec 61 - 2 L stabil vorliegt, also in Deletionsstämmen mit einem Defekt in der Erkennung oder der Degradation des fehlgefalteten Sec 61 - 2 L, ist ein Wachstum auf Leucin-defizientem Medium möglich. Auf diese Weise konnten über 40 bisher unbekannte, potentielle Komponenten der ER-Qualitätskontrolle und ER-assoziierten Degradation identifiziert werden. Unter anderem wurde durch diesen genomischen Screen die E 4 -Ligase Hul 5 als Komponente des ERAD für dieses nicht glykosylierte Substrat gefunden. Des Weiteren war bereits durch einen entsprechenden Screen mit dem Substrat CTL* bekannt, dass Hul 5 auch am Abbau dieses glykosylierten ERAD-Substrats beteiligt ist. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde nachgewiesen, dass für den vollständigen Abbau der ERAD-Substrate Sec 61 - 2 Lmyc und CTL*myc die katalytische Funktion der E 4 -Ligase Hul 5 benötigt wird. Außerdem wurde gezeigt, dass der Abbau der Substrate Sec 61 - 2 Lmyc und CTL*myc im Wildtypstamm sowie in der HUL 5 Deletionsmutante am N-Terminus einsetzt und über definierte Zwischenprodukte verläuft. Im Wildtypstamm kann auf diese Weise der Abbau der Substrate vollständig verlaufen. Im Gegensatz dazu erfolgt in der HUL 5 Deletionsmutante ein Abbruch der Degradation am Proteasom, was zu einer Akkumulation der C-terminalen Abbaufragmente truncSec 61 - 2 Lmyc und truncCTL*myc führt. Des Weiteren wurde gezeigt, dass für den Abbau des N-terminalen Anteils von CTL*myc keine Extraktion des Proteins aus der ER-Membran notwendig ist. Demzufolge muß der N-Terminus von CTL*myc durch die ER-Membran in das Zytosol der Zelle ragen, wo die Ubiquitinierung und die Degradation des Substrats einsetzen. Außerdem wurde gefunden, dass auch das Proteasom an der Extraktion von CTL*myc aus dem ER beteiligt ist. Es ist bekannt, dass die E 4 -Ligase Hul 5 gemeinsam mit dem deubiquitinierenden Enzym Ubp 6 und dem Ubiquitin-konjugierenden Enzym Ubc 4 den Abbau anderer proteasomaler Substrate regulieren kann. In dieser Arbeit wurde gezeigt, dass die Degradation des ERAD-Substrats CTL*myc durch Hul 5, jedoch nicht durch Ubp 6 und Ubc 4 beeinflusst wird. Dieses Ergebnis gibt Hinweise auf weitere mit Hul 5 agierende deubiquitinierende und Ubiquitin-konjugierende Enzyme. The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) plays {{an essential role}} in the folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway. It provides an enviroment optimized for folding, oxidation and oligomeric assembly of proteins translocated into the ER membrane. Folding in the ER is assisted by a large variety of folding enzymes, molecular chaperones and folding sensors. To ensure the fidelity of the maturation process, exit from the ER is regulated by a stringent quality control system that inhibits the secretion of incompletely folded or misfolded proteins. These misfolded polypeptides and orphan subunits are subsequently subjected to ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The ERAD process requires retrotranslocation of the misfolded proteins across the ER membrane into the cytoplasm and subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Degradation of a protein by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway involves two discrete and successive steps: the tagging of the substrate by covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules and the degradation of the tagged protein by the 26 S proteasome complex. Conjugation of ubiquitin, a highly evolutionarily conserved 76 -residue polypeptide, to the protein substrate proceeds via a three-step cascade mechanism. Initially, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E 1 activates ubiquitin in an ATP-requiring reaction to generate a high-energy thiol ester intermediate, E 1 -S?ubiquitin. One of several E 2 enzymes (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UBCs) transfers the activated ubiquitin moiety from the E 1, via an additional high energy thiol ester intermediate, E 2 -S?ubiquitin, to the substrate that is specifically bound to a member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family, E 3. The ubiquitin molecule is generally transferred to an ?-NH 2 group of an internal Lys residue in the substrate to generate a covalent isopeptide bond. By successively adding activated ubiquitin moieties to internal Lys residues on the previously conjugated ubiquitin molecule, a polyubiquitin chain is synthesized. In some cases, multiubiquitination requires the additional activity of certain ubiquitin-chain elongation factors, the so-called E 4 -ligases. The polyubiquitin chain is recognized by the downstream 26 S proteasome complex. The proteasome is a large, 26 S, multicatalytic protease. It is composed of two subcomplexes: a 20 S core particle (CP) that carries the catalytic activity and a 19 S regulatoy particle (RP). The regulatory particle recognizes the substrate-bound ubiquitin chain, unfolds the substrate and directs its translocation into the core particle. Critical components of the regulatory particle include ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitining enzymes, and six ATPases that have been implicated in substrate unfolding and translocation. The 19 S regulatory particle allows the entry of the substrate into the proteolytic chamber of the 20 S core particle. The substrate is degraded by the multicatalytic proteases of the 20 S core particle, short peptides derived from the substrate are relased. It {{is important to note that}} the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, especially under conditions of stress, triggers activation of a wide range of genes encoding proteins of the secretory pathway. This is the so-called unfolded protein response (UPR). Several of the UPR-induced proteins are involved in protein folding and glycosylation in the ER and in ER-associated degradation. Thus, quality control in ER and ERAD, abbreviated as ERQD (ER quality control and associated degradation) and UPR are tightly coordinated processes. Because ERQD is highly conserved from yeast to man, the easy amenability of yeast to genetic and molecular biological studies combined with the knowledge of its genome and proteome makes it a preferred organism to study such "houskeeping" functions of eukaryotic cells. To gain deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of ER quality control and associated degradation a genome-wide screen was performed, using the EUROSCARF yeast library, consisting of about 5000 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, each deleted for a single <b>non-essential</b> gene. The <b>use</b> of this library for screening mutants of ERAD is possible, because cells tolerate a defect in the process as long as the unfolded protein response is intact. A chimeric protein (Sec 61 - 2 L) consisting the nonglycosylated ER-membrane-located ERQD substrate Sec 61 - 2 fused to cytoplasmic 3 -isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, the Leu 2 protein, was used as a substrate for the genome wide screen. Cells carrying a LEU 2 deletion can only grow on media lacking leucine when the chimeric protein Sec 61 - 2 L is not degraded. Thus, only mutant cells defective in an ERQD component can grow. The generated screen yielded about 40 mutants exhibiting a reproducible growth phenotype. Among these, a strong complemetation in the strain carrying the ?hul 5 deletion was found. Hul 5 is known to act as a E 4 -ligase being specialized in the elongation of ubiquitin chains. Whether Hul 5 is also able to promote the initial recognition of a substrate by the proteasome is still unknown. At the beginning of this work an interaction of Hul 5 with Rpn 2, a non-ATPase subunit of the proteasome which is located in the base of the regulatory particle, was established. It was shown, that the enzymatic activity of Hul 5 is stimulated by its interaction with the proteasome. The chain-elongating activity of Hul 5 functions specifically in opposition to the deubiquitinating activity of Ubp 6, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) interacting with the Rpn 1 subunit of the 19 S cap of the proteasome. To test biochemically whether Hul 5 is a component of the ERAD machinery, the degradation of the substrates CTL* and Sec 61 - 2 L was analysed by cycloheximide decay and pulse-chase analyses. Degradation kinetics of CTL* with a CPY specific antibody did not show any evidence for an involvement of Hul 5 in ER-associated degradation. However, a C-terminally myc-tagged version of the substrates and the use of an myc specific antibody provided finally insight into the degradation of CTL*myc and Sec 61 - 2 Lmyc in the ?hul 5 mutant anticipated from the genetic screen: It was able to show, that the ERAD substrates CTL*myc and Sec 61 - 2 L are degraded in the wildtype as in the HUL 5 deletion strain in a stepwise manner starting at the N-terminus. In wild type cells the substrates are degraded completely, whereas in the ?hul 5 mutant truncated forms of CTL*myc and Sec 61 - 2 L, truncCTL*myc and truncSec 61 - 2 Lmyc are accumulated. The degradation of the N-terminal part of CTL*myc and Sec 61 - 2 Lmyc proceeds in the ?hul 5 mutant. However, the degradation of the C-terminal part of the substrates requires the E 4 -ligase Hul 5. The degradation of the substrates CTL*myc and Sec 61 - 2 Lmyc is halted in the ?hul 5 mutants. It is shown, that the interruption of the degradation depends on the missing chain-elongating activity of Hul 5. The fragments truncCTL*myc and truncSec 61 - 2 Lmyc consist of the cytosolic Leu 2 myc-domain and a part of the CPY* or the Sec 61 - 2 L domain. Interestingly, the molecular mass of the fragments truncCTL*myc and truncSec 61 - 2 Lmyc according to their behaviour in SDS-PAGE seems to be the same. This astonishs as CTL*myc and Sec 61 - 2 L are completely different substrates, only the cytosolic Leu 2 myc-domain is common on both substrates. For other ERAD-substrates like Sec 61 - 2, CPY*, CT* and CTG* the activity of Hul 5 is not required for degradation. The localization of truncCTL*myc gave a hint, how the degradation of the substrate CTL*myc is acchieved. The truncCTL*myc was partly found in the membrane and in the cytosol of the cell. Obviously, the degradation of the substrates can start, while they are located in the membrane. There is no previous extraction of the substrate from the ER membrane required for the start of degradation. The N-terminus of CTL*myc must loop out of the ER lumen, through the ER membrane into the cytosol of the cell, while the rest of the substrate is remaining in the membrane. The N-terminus of CTL*myc loops into the cytosol and is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. The experiments give evidence that the proteasome is involved in the extraction of the substrate CTL*myc out of the ER. It is known, that Hul 5 regulates the proteasomal degradation of special substrates together with the deubiquitinating Enzyme Ubp 6 and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc 4. However, the complete degradation of the substrate CTL*myc requires the activity of the E 4 -ligase Hul 5, but the activity of Ubp 6 and Ubc 4 is not required...|$|R
