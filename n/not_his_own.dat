5|$|Zack {{had only}} a small role in the {{original}} Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from him for years. It {{is at this point}} that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes that some of his memories and even aspects of his personality were actually Zack's, and <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he {{was the result of a}} scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape is optional in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments.|$|E

25|$|One more {{attempt at}} {{reviving}} an old game show that was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> originally {{resulted in an}} unsold pilot of the 1950s-era game Dollar a Second, hosted by Bob Eubanks. It {{had at least one}} showing on GSN, and has since become part of the collector/trader's circuit. Two more unsold pilots were called Bamboozle and Comedy Courtroom.|$|E
50|$|Of the film, Chaturvedi has {{commented that}} he drew upon <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life {{experiences}} for {{inspiration for the}} movie, as he had several of his marriage proposals rejected because he did <b>not</b> <b>own</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> home.|$|R

25|$|Pierce {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} voice and, like his Frasier co-star, Kelsey Grammer, is often called upon to provide voice work. His notable roles include the narrator of the movie The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human in 1999, walking stick insect Slim in A Bug's Life, Doctor Delbert Doppler in Disney's film Treasure Planet, and the amphibian Abe Sapien in Hellboy. Pierce refused credit for his Hellboy role because he felt it was the performance of Doug Jones, and <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> voice, which ultimately brought the character of Abe Sapien to life. He was the voice for Drix, a cold pill, in the animated comedy Osmosis Jones.|$|E
25|$|After being rousted from Annan, Edward Balliol again offered {{homage to}} Edward III, {{and though the}} idea of {{returning}} to war against Scotland did not have universal appeal, Edward III gave Balliol his backing. The English king claimed that the violation of the Treaty of Northampton was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> but those Scots who crossed the borders after John Balliol's ouster. Balliol returned to Scotland in March 1333, besieging Berwick-upon-Tweed. In response, Archibald Douglas counterattacked, which Edward III took as excuse to justify open battle. He traveled to Northumberland in May, where he and the pretender to the Scottish throne began preparing for battle, while elsewhere Archibald Douglas did the same. There was particular urgency to Scottish preparations, for Berwick had agreed to surrender to the English {{if it were not}} liberated by 20 July.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{earned an}} {{estimated}} $3,000 {{working as a}} Pony Express rider, and used the money to move to Oregon. With {{the help of his}} friend, Senator Joseph Lane, he became editor of the Democratic Register in Eugene, a role he held from March 15 to September 20, 1862. Though no copies survive, it was known as sympathetic to the Confederacy until it was forced to shut down because of its treasonable character. That year, Miller married Theresa Dyer on September 12, 1862, in her home four days after meeting her in Port Orford, Oregon. He had corresponded with her after exchanging poems with her for critique and chasing away a competing suitor. She published poetry under the pen name Minnie Myrtle. The couple had three children: Maud, George, and Henry, although Miller would later claim the baby Henry was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E

Not to the dearest friend he had on earth; for they had forsaken him, could not {{understand}} him, thought him perhaps beside himself. <b>Not</b> to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> good works, almsgivings, church-goings, church-buildings. <b>Not</b> to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> experiences, faith's assurances, frames or feelings. The matter was too terrible to be plastered over in that way, or in any way. He was {{face to face with}} God alone, in utter weakness, in utter nakedness of soul, He cried to God himself.

25|$|A {{little less}} than two decades earlier, in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), the Court had held that Congress can {{abrogate}} state sovereign immunity pursuant to its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment, which clearly contemplates limiting {{the power of the}} states. In Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989), the Court had held that Congress could also abrogate sovereign immunity under the Commerce Clause - but there was no majority in that decision. Justice Brennan was joined by three other justices in asserting that the Eleventh Amendment {{was nothing more than a}} reflection of common law sovereignty that could be swept aside by Congress; Justice Scalia was also joined by three other justices in taking the opposite view; and Justice Byron White wrote a separate opinion holding that Congress had such power, but stating his disagreement with Brennan's opinion (but <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> rationale).|$|E
25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E
500|$|The early {{operetta}} Paul Bunyan stands {{apart from}} Britten's later operatic works. Philip Brett, in Groves article on Britten, calls it [...] "a patronizing attempt by W H Auden {{to evoke the}} spirit of a nation <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> in which Britten was a somewhat dazzled accomplice". The American public liked it, but the critics did not, and it fell into neglect until interest revived {{near the end of the}} composer's life.|$|E

500|$|Malaysian society used to {{look down}} on cartoonists, {{assuming}} that those who practised the trade were intellectually inferior to writers, or were lesser artists; Lat {{was not the only}} cartoonist to be paid with movie tickets in the 1950s; Rejabhad once received one ticket for ten cartoons, and many others were likewise recompensed, or were paid very little money. [...] Despite the lowly reputation of his profession at that time, Lat is very proud of his choice of career; he once took umbrage with an acquaintance's girlfriend for her presumption that the words and ideas in his cartoons were <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> [...] Drawing cartoons is more than a career to him: ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{theme of}} exile, {{of people living}} at the margins... is treated in a literal and metaphorical sense {{throughout}} Chatwin's work," [...] stated Nicholas Murray. He identified several examples in Chatwin's work. There {{were people who were}} actual exiles, such as some of those profiled in In Patagonia and the Viceroy of Ouidah, who was unable to return to Brazil. Murray also cited the main characters in On the Black Hill, [...] "although not strictly exiles... were exiles from the major events of their time and its dominant values." [...] Similarly, Murray wrote, Utz is [...] "trapped in a society whose values are <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> but which he cannot bring himself to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 3, 1849, Poe {{was found}} delirious {{on the streets}} of Baltimore, [...] "in great distress, and... in need of {{immediate}} assistance", according to Joseph W. Walker who found him. He was taken to the Washington Medical College where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849 at 5:00 in the morning. Poe was never coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> He is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. Some sources say that Poe's final words were [...] "Lord help my poor soul". All medical records have been lost, including his death certificate.|$|E
500|$|Snodgrass's {{first-hand}} account describes Poe's {{appearance as}} [...] "repulsive", with unkempt hair, a haggard, unwashed face and [...] "lusterless and vacant" [...] eyes. His clothing, Snodgrass said, {{which included a}} dirty shirt but no vest and unpolished shoes, was worn and did not fit well. Dr. John Joseph Moran, who was Poe's attending physician, gives his own detailed account of Poe's appearance that day: [...] "a stained faded, old bombazine coat, pantaloons of a similar character, a pair of worn-out shoes run down at the heels, and an old straw hat". Poe was never coherent long enough to explain {{how he came to}} be in this condition, and it is believed the clothes he was wearing were <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> not least because wearing shabby clothes was out of character for Poe.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, the Democratic newspapers, {{especially}} the papers owned by Hearst, attacked Hanna for his supposed role as McKinley's political master. [...] The articles and cartoons {{have contributed to}} a lasting popular belief that McKinley was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> man, {{but that he was}} effectively owned by the corporations, through Hanna. [...] Homer Davenport's cartoons for the Hearst papers were especially effective in molding public opinion about Hanna. The Clevelander was often depicted as [...] "Dollar Mark", in a suit decorated with dollar signs (a term for which [...] "dollar mark" [...] was a common alternative). [...] McKinley's personal financial crisis allowed him to be convincingly depicted as a child, helpless in the hands of businessmen and their mere tool in the 1896 campaign. [...] Historian Stanley Jones, who studied the 1896 election, stated of this view: ...|$|E

500|$|Called ho Megas ( [...] , {{translated}} as [...] "the Great") by the Greeks, Manuel {{is known to}} have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him. He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary, John Kinnamos, in which every virtue is attributed to him. Manuel, who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders, enjoyed the reputation of [...] "the most blessed emperor of Constantinople" [...] in parts of the Latin world as well. Modern historians, however, have been less enthusiastic about him. Some of them assert that the great power he wielded was <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal achievement, but that of the dynasty he represented; they also argue that, since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel's death, it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign.|$|E
500|$|Unless {{the modern}} name {{is clear from}} Monro's {{spelling}} {{this can lead to}} difficulties with identification. The Dean's command of Gaelic was weak and he habitually provides island names phonetically in English rather than using Gaelic spellings. R. W. Munro states that [...] "of the 251 islands listed by Monro, I have been unable to identify 27, and a further 23 cannot be regarded as certain". Munro's belief was that Donald Monro knew the Outer Hebrides and Iona well, but that he may have written about the islands of the Argyll coast from secondhand knowledge {{as they were in the}} Diocese of Argyll and <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Diocese of the Isles. Later authors have made additional identifications, although some quite substantial islands do not appear to be in the lists. (They may of course appear under a different name, the connection to which remains to be established.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{speed and}} {{facility}} with which Dylan wrote topical songs {{attracted the attention}} of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as [...] "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" [...] and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were <b>not</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. I just put them down on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would." ...|$|E
