40|$|The {{need for}} a chemotherapeutant used {{specifically}} for fish disease became increasingly apparent with intensive fish culture practices, and {{with the possibility of}} bacterial resistance against drugs used for human and animal medicine (Austin 1985). With this in mind, <b>Nifurpirinol</b> (trade name Furanace; P- 7138) was developed by the Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan, and is currently manufactured in the United States as Prefuran. Studies have proven that the drug is effective against bacterial and fungal pathogens {{in a wide variety of}} aquatic animals. Most of the <b>Nifurpirinol</b> studies done in the past have dealt on its antimicrobial activity, tissue uptake, and effective treatment levels ranging from 0. 5 - 2. 5 mg/L. The 96 -hr median lethal concentration (LC 50) to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus Rafinesque) has also been determined at 0. 945 - 1. 90 mg/L, and at 1. 70 mg/L for milkfish, Chanos chanos Forsskaal. However, there have only been two studies that have examined the histological effects on treated fish. Histopathologically, Mitchell et al. (1978) found hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the lamellar epithelium in channel catfish gills exposed to 0. 5 mg/L for 4 d or longer at 24 plus or minus 2 degree C, while Amend and Ross (1970) working at 21 plus or minus 1 degree C observed no apparent changes in the gills of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exposed intermittently to 1 mg/L of <b>Nifurpirinol.</b> This paper describes the histological changes observed in the gills of milkfish fingerlings used in static, 96 -hr <b>Nifurpirinol</b> toxicity tests. Milkfish was used because of its economic importance as a widely cultured food fish in Asia. The gills were chosen as target organs...|$|E

40|$|<b>Nifurpirinol</b> (trade name Furanace and {{originally}} {{known as}} P- 7138), is a nitrofuran derivative synthesized by the Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Japan, and was developed exclusively as a broad-spectrum antibiotic for {{fish and other}} aquatic organisms (Shimizu and Takase 1967). It {{has been shown to}} have bactericidal and fungicidal action in vitro and in vivo (Shimizu and Takase 1967; Amend and Ross 1970; Pearse et al. 1974; Mitchell and Plumb 1980), and was used because of its excellent potential in controlling prawn diseases (Delves-Broughton 1974; Gacutan and Llobrera 1977). Milkfish (Chanos chanos Forsskal) is a widely-reared species and a very important aquaculture food crop in most parts of Southeast Asia. Thus, it was the logical choice as test animal for investigating the LC 50 toxicity levels of <b>nifurpirinol</b> (6 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -[2 -(5 -nitro- 2 -furyl) vinyl] pyridine) after 96 hr exposure. Changes in the normal gill architecture of milkfish after exposure to the drug were also studied (Tamse et al., in preparation) ...|$|E
40|$|Chromatophoroma in the croaker (Nibea mitsukurii) {{showed a}} unique {{geographic}} distribution. The contribution of environmental chemicals {{to the cause}} of chromatophoroma in the feral croaker is considered likely {{on the basis of the}} following results in our studies. 1) Chromatophoroma was induced in tank-reared N. mitsukurii by administration of certain kinds of known carcinogens such as 7, 12 -dimethyl-benz(a) anthra-cene, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and <b>nifurpirinol.</b> 2) Local accumulation of pigment-cell hyperplasia in the catfish (Protosus anguillaris) showed similar tendencies to those of chromatophoroma in N. mitsukurii. 3) Removal of contaminated sediment from the harbor and the river appeared to reduce the incidence from 47 % in 1973 – 1983 to about 20 % in 1985 – 1987. 4) Waste water from a factory located at the station where the incidence of the neoplasm was the highest contained mutagenic substances such as chloroacetones and glyoxals [5]. Exposure of catfish to the waste water induced pigment-cell hyperplasia on the skin. J Invest Dermatol 92 : 248 S– 254 S, 198...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} with the aim to identify the cause of disease in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus was conducted in Pathology Laboratory of Institute for Mariculture Research and Development, Gondol, Bali. The diseased fish showed lost appetite, swim slowly, and haemorrhage on the body surface. These clinical signs indicate that the fish infected by bacteria. The bacteria then were isolated aseptically {{from different parts of}} fish body including chin, abdomen, dorsal and caudal fins. Some media were used to isolate the bacteria, namely Triptic Soy Agar (TSA) as a general medium, Thiosulphate Citrate Bile Salt Sucrose Agar (TCBSA) for Vibrio bacteria, Cytophaga Agar (Cyt-A) for Flexibacter bacteria, and KF-Strep Breeders media for Streptococcus bacteria. As a result, one dominant bacterium was isolated from TSA and TCBSA. No bacteria growth showed on Cyt-A and KF-Strep media. The isolate was gram-negative, fermentative, swarm on TSA, growth with yellow colony on TCBSA. Based on its characteristics the isolate identified as Vibrio alginolyticus. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Vibrio alginolyticus were 1 ppm for <b>Nifurpirinol,</b> 5 ppm for Penstrep, and 10 ppm or Elbaju...|$|E
