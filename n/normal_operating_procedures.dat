40|$|This paper {{describes}} the elements {{and operation of}} a simulator {{that is being used}} to train operators of the Rotor Test Apparatus (RTA) in the large-scale 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel at Ames Research Center. The simulator, named TUTOR (for Tunnel Utilization Trainer with Operating Rotor) duplicates the controls of the rotor and its dynamic behavior, as well as the wind-tunnel controls. The simulation software uses a preexisting blade-element model of a four-bladed rotor with flapping and lead-lag degrees of freedom. Equations were developed for all hardware and controls of the RTA and of the wind tunnel that are normally required to perform a wind-tunnel test of a helicopter rotor. The simulator hardware consists of consoles designed to have the same appearance and functions as those in the control room of the 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel, allowing input from three operators who normally establish the required operating conditions during a test run. <b>Normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> can be practiced, as well as simulated emergencies such as rotor power failure...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, we take intense neutron sources (INS) as a {{somewhat}} futuristic case to unveil another dimension in disputes over {{the application of}} safeguards to nuclear technologies. The current IAEA safeguards regime is built on a distinction between facilities and materials. The assumption underlying such a distinction is that facilities are not a concern {{in the absence of}} nuclear materials. Historically, such a distinction made sense because {{there was no reason to}} operate nuclear fuel cycle facilities in the absence of nuclear materials. However, INS facilities do not require nuclear materials under <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures,</b> yet they hold out the potential for producing weapons-grade plutonium in a shorter period of time and with less source material than existing facilities. As a result, they present a new challenge to the IAEA safeguards regime. We present a comparison of the timeline to produce weapons-grade plutonium with reactors, spallation neutron sources and fusion plants and discuss possible advantages and disadvantages of the respective technologies. One focus will be the possibility of fusion plants and spallation sources producing significant quantities of plutonium with less source material than ‘one effective kilogram’ of uranium. Furthermore, the question will be raised if the corresponding technologies are adequately covered by current IAEA terms like ‘facility’ and ‘reactor’...|$|E

The instruments albeit employing the same measurement principle (gold converter and chemiluminescence) had different inlet configurations. The ECO-Physics instrument operated by ETH-Zürich in SPURT had the gold converter mounted outside the aircraft, whereas the instrument operated by FZ-Jülich in the European project MOZAIC III (Measurements of ozone, water vapour, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides aboard Airbus A 340 in-service aircraft) employed a Rosemount probe with 80 cm of FEP-tubing connecting the inlet to the gold converter.

As a step toward the goal of improving procedure use performance, researchers, together with the {{nuclear industry}}, have been looking at replacing the current paper-based procedures with computer-based procedure systems. The concept of computer-based procedures is not new by any means; however most research has focused on procedures used in the main control room.

40|$|The {{conventional}} accounting {{notion of}} ‘going concern’ — that a firm will continue its business {{operations in the}} same manner indefinitely — has underpinned accounting practice for over one hundred years. This idea has provided a rationale for spreading costs over accounting periods and for deferring costs as assets in balance sheets. An alternative idea that is widely regarded as reliable in the literatures of economics and deliberate action is that firms continually adapt to changes in market and economic conditions. That is economic behaviour. The implications of that view of a firm for accounting have been systematically explored by Chambers (1966). While not examining those particular implications, many other accounting theorists have been critical of the conventional accounting idea of 2 ̆ 7 going concern 2 ̆ 7 and of its impact on accounting practice. The two notions of ‘going concern’ - as static or adaptive enterprises - are examined by referring to the business operations of the four major Australian trading banks over the period 1983 - 1991. Banks were selected because they are commonly thought to be particularly ‘conservative’ organizations. The period 1983 — 1991 was chosen because it covers the era of deregulation of the Australian financial system. The evidence adduced by this study indicates that the Australian trading banks have continually adapted their organizational structures and business operations in the light of changes in technology, markets for financial services, government policies and domestic and global economic conditions. Illustrations of adaptive behaviour by banks ate drawn from their <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> such as the provision of products and services, loan services, acquisitions, sale of property, non-core banking operations and international banking. It is argued on analytical grounds that the cost basis of accounting does not yield financial statements that provide factual and up-to-date information about the financial capacity of firms to pay their debts and to continue trading generally; that is, to be going concerns. At any time, those financial capacities are determined by the amount of money commanded by a firm, including the money 2 ̆ 7 s worth of its assets, and by its level of debt. It is concluded on empirical grounds that the Australian trading banks, at least, are adaptive entities...|$|E

This sentiment is reflected by {{a wide array of}} public water projects, research, and educational programs which have as their justification more 2 ̆ 2 goods 2 ̆ 2 and/or fewer 2 ̆ 2 bads 2 ̆ 2. The severe droughts of the 1930 s and 1970 s in the U. S. provide examples of how complex waterbased systems, such as agricultural production, respond to stress.

The Idaho National Laboratory, the Institute for Energy Technology, and participants from the U.

The goal is to identify the types of human errors that can be mitigated by using computer-based procedures and how to best design the computer-based procedures to do this. The underlying philosophy in the research effort is “Stop – Start – Continue”, i. e. what features from the use of paper-based procedures should we not incorporate (Stop), what should we keep (Continue), and what new features or work processes should be added (Start). One step in identifying the Stop – Start – Continue was to conduct a baseline study where affordances related to the current usage of paper-based procedures were identified. The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop a model of paper based procedure use which will help to identify desirable features for computer based procedure prototypes. Affordances such as note taking, markups, sharing procedures between fellow coworkers, the use of multiple procedures at once, etc. were considered. The model describes which affordances associated with paper based procedures should be transferred to computer-based procedures as well as what features should not be incorporated. The model also provides a means to identify what new features not present in paper based procedures need to be added to the computer-based procedures to further enhance performance. The next step is to use the requirements and specifications to develop concepts and prototypes of computer-based procedures. User tests and other data collection efforts will be conducted to ensure that the real issues with field procedures and their usage are being addressed and solved in the best manner possible.

The study suggests a solution to these problems by allowing the cutting-in of pre-priming pump during engine rundown. Although the manufacturer assured the operation of the pre-priming pump during engine rundown, but it was verified that this pump failed to operate automatically or manually during the engine rundown when it was tested periodically. The relevant data for the pre-priming pump has been collected from the operating and maintenance instruction manuals for the stand-by diesel engine for phase I units at Dr. Sharief Power Station.
