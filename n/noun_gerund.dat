5000|$|The {{pronunciation}} with [...] {{rather than}} [...] is a long-established one. Old English verbs had a present participle in -ende and a verbal <b>noun</b> (<b>gerund)</b> form in -ing(e).

50|$|The -ing of Modern English in its participial (adjectival) use {{comes from}} Middle English -inge, -ynge, {{alterations}} of earlier -inde, -ende, -and, from the Old English present participle ending -ende. This is from Proto-Germanic *-andz, from the Proto-Indo-European *-nt-. This use of English -ing is cognate with Dutch and German -end, Swedish -ande, -ende, Latin -ans, -ant-, Ancient Greek -ον (-on), and Sanskrit -ant. -inde, -ende, -and later {{merged with the}} <b>noun</b> and <b>gerund</b> suffix -ing , perhaps because the French speaking elites naturally confused them as {{there was only one}} French equivalent to both (compare the Modern French participial, <b>noun</b> and <b>gerund</b> suffix -ant). Its remnants, however, are still retained in a few verb-derived words such as friend, fiend, errand, thousand, bond, etc.|$|R
5000|$|The present participle, also {{sometimes}} called the active, imperfect, or progressive participle, takes the ending -ing, for example doing, seeing, working, running. It is identical in form to the verbal <b>noun</b> and <b>gerund</b> (see below). The term present participle is sometimes used to include the gerund; and the term [...] "gerund-participle" [...] is also used.|$|R
5000|$|Prepositional phrases have a {{preposition}} as {{the central}} element of the phrase, i.e. {{as the head of}} the phrase. The remaining part of the phrase is usually followed by modifiers such as a <b>noun,</b> pronoun, <b>gerund,</b> or clause. It's sometimes called the prepositional complement. The object of the preposition will often have more than one modifier.|$|R

50|$|The normal <b>gerund</b> <b>noun</b> is {{generally}} {{the same word}} as the infinitive. The gerund {{does not have a}} plural (normally - but if so, the form would be unchanged), and its gender is neuter.|$|R
50|$|The infinitive itself differs in usage {{from the}} English infinitive; for example, the subjunctive not the infinitive {{is used in}} {{sentences}} such as 'I want to go' or 'I am able to go'. The Persian infinitive {{is more like a}} verbal <b>noun</b> or <b>gerund,</b> used in phrases such as نوشتن اين کتاب neveštan-e in ketāb 'the writing of this book' or اختراع نوشتن exterā'-e neveštan 'the invention of writing'.|$|R

50|$|German {{speakers}} {{have also}} {{raised questions about}} how sexism intersects with grammar. The German language is heavily inflected for gender, number, and case; nearly all nouns denoting the occupations or statuses of human beings are gender-differentiated. For more gender-neutral constructions, <b>gerund</b> <b>nouns</b> are sometimes used instead, as this completely eliminates the grammatical gender distinction in the plural, and significantly reduces it in the singular. For example, instead of die Studenten ("the men students") or die Studentinnen ("the women students"), one writes die Studierenden ("the who are studying"). However, this approach introduces an element of ambiguity, because <b>gerund</b> <b>nouns</b> more precisely denote one currently engaged in the activity, rather than one who routinely engages in it as their primary occupation.|$|R
25|$|Yet another {{approach}} to resultativeness views it as “a fundamental semantic distinctive feature which cuts across almost all traditional categories: verb, <b>noun,</b> adjective, infinitive, <b>gerund,</b> participle, particle, auxiliary”. It is {{claimed that the}} resultative should be a distinctive feature in language {{instead of being a}} subcategory within the verbal aspect realm.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gerund</b> (<b>noun)</b> use {{comes from}} Middle English -ing, which is from Old English -ing, -ung (suffixes forming nouns from verbs). These in turn are from Proto-Germanic *-inga-, *-unga-, *-ingō, *-ungō, which Vittore Pisani derives from Proto-Indo-European *-enkw-. This use of English -ing is thus cognate with the -ing suffix of Dutch, West Frisian, the North Germanic languages, and with German -ung.|$|R

50|$|An adposition {{typically}} combines with {{exactly one}} complement, most often a noun phrase (or, {{in a different}} analysis, a determiner phrase). In English, this is generally a noun (or something functioning as a <b>noun,</b> e.g., a <b>gerund),</b> together with its specifier and modifiers such as articles, adjectives, etc. The complement is sometimes called {{the object of the}} adposition. The resulting phrase, formed by the adposition together with its complement, is called an adpositional phrase or prepositional phrase (PP) (or for specificity, a postpositional or circumpositional phrase).|$|R

40|$|This work {{pretends to}} be a guide of the basic {{principles}} involved in using prepositions correctly. It contains {{an explanation of the}} different uses of each one of the English preposition as well as their grammatical functions in this language. Also, a classification of prepositions in groups is made. The use of these prepositions with certain syntactic elements, such as adjective clauses, <b>noun</b> clauses, <b>gerunds,</b> etc., is also treated. Phrasal verbs have also been treated in here. We'll find an explanation of what a prepositional phrase is and its function in a sentence. Prepositions in our native language, Spanish, are semantically, grammatically, and functionally analyzed. The point that matters the most in this work is the contrastive analysis regarding the use of the different prepositions in both languages, English and Spanish.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} I shall propose an {{analysis}} of the Hausa bound genitive marker which unifies its use in possessives and partitives with that in gerundive and pre-nominal adjectival constructions (see Newman, 2000 and Jaggar (2001) for a detailed overview). I shall provide evidence that the bound genitive marker-n/-r is not simply an enclitic variant of the free form marker na/ta derived at a surface phonological level, but rather an affix attached in the morphology. Under the analysis proposed here, the free form is an instance of dependent marking, mainly used for possessive modifiers, whereas the bound form is an instance of head-marking, signalling the presence of an adjacent in-situ complement. The formal analysis, which is carried out in the framework of HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), will make crucial use of type-raising in the sense of Kim and Sag (1995) and Iida et al. (1994), in order to model head-marking of possessives and pre-nominal adjectives on a par with complement-taking strong verbal <b>nouns</b> (<b>gerunds).</b> Furthermore, the head-marking approach to the bound linker also connects the presence vs. absence of this marker to a more general property of the language, namely direct object marking (Crysmann, 2005). 1 Major functions of the Hausa genitive linker Genitival constructions in Hausa 1 are used to express a wide range of syntactic functions: apart from possessives and partitives, genitive linkers are also employed to mark pre-nominal adjectival modifiers and certain gerunds, when followed by a direct object complement. In principle, there are two distinct ways to effect genitive marking in this language: either by means of a free form marker na (masculine and plural) or ta (feminine) appearing on the dependent, or else by means of a suffixal (or enclitic) marker-n/-r attached to the head. 1 Hausa is an Afroasiatic language spoken mainly in Northern Nigeria and bordering areas of Niger. Both tone (high, low, falling) and length (long vs. short) are lexically and grammatically distinctive. Following common practice, I shall mark low tone with a grave accent and falling tone with a circumflex. Vowels unmarked for tone are high. Length distinctions are signalled by double vowels...|$|R
40|$|A {{central concern}} of western grammar {{has always been}} the proper characteriza-tion of what can be called non-finite verbal constructions: the infinitive, the gerund, and the participle. Under the aegis of {{generative}} grammar, progress toward this goal has been swift, in comparison to what went before; the principal clarifications will be outlined just below. Nonetheless, we still lack a complete and formalized understanding of what a "verbal <b>noun</b> " (<b>gerund)</b> or a "verbal adjective " (participle) is. We cannot be content with describing them loosely as "neutralized " categories, precisely because an English gerund phrase, for example, appears only in noun phrase positions (Emonds 1976, ch. 4) but has the internal structure of a verb phrase (Chomsky 1970). 1 The pre-theoretical term "neutralization " sheds no light on why the opposite properties don't hold: why not internal noun phrase structure and external verb phrase distribution? We can ask further questions: why are the modals and tense endings not available in "verbal nouns " and "verbal adjectives"? What determines the choices among in...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{have studied}} non-iconic {{reduplication}} in Eastern Gbe languages (viz., Fongbe and Gungbe) and Suriname creoles (viz., Sranan and Saramaccan). We {{have shown that}} in the Surinam Creoles, {{as well as in}} the Gbe languages, such non-iconic reduplication is conditioned by a unique syntactic structure which derives both verbal <b>nouns</b> (or <b>gerunds)</b> and (verbal) adjectives. Put another way, we analyze reduplication as a morphological process (i. e. affixation) conditioned by structural properties. We further show that the resulting reduplicated items correlate with a change in meaning that often varies from process/event to state/result, and can therefore not be accounted for in terms of iconicity. With regard to the issue of the emergence of reduplication in creoles, we show that the development of these non-iconic reduplications in the Surinam creoles derive partially from substrate influence from Eastern Gbe, while showing some properties of gerunds and past participles in English. Under this view therefore, reduplication, far from being a fast and cheap morphological operation available to a creole emerging from a pidgin state, represents a constrained morphosyntactic process...|$|R
40|$|English gerunds and infinitives {{are often}} treated as nearly {{equivalent}} ways of using verb phrases as syntactic subjects and objects, {{even though this}} assumption is falsified by the actual grammatical patterns. Gerunds are indeed verb phrases that appear in all positions of freely expandable noun phrases, but infinitives and finite clauses, termed 'verbal clauses' in this study, actually never occur in noun phrase positions. What is shown here is that (i) verbal clauses {{that appear to be}} 'objects' of verbs are in clause-final position, rather than in the position of object noun phrases, and that (ii) initial verbal clauses that appear to be 'subjects' are in a pre-subject position where they bind a null expletive subject. The hypothesis in (ii) is tested and confirmed by showing that initial verbal clauses, in contrast to lexical <b>noun</b> phrase and <b>gerunds,</b> never occur in embedded or inverted subject positions. In this way, initial verbal clauses have the same distribution as other well-known 'root' or 'focus' constructions, which in pre-subject position are limited to main clauses...|$|R
40|$|Non-finite verbs, also {{frequently}} called unmarked verbs, constitute a large field for variationist studies in linguistics, for typology and furthermore for Usage-Based Grammars. However, the descriptive approaches to participles, infinitive and gerund currently {{end up in}} arepresentation of these forms as defective, impersonal and atemporal. Consequently, participles, infinitives and gerunds, on account of their unmarkness, are analysed and commented on in many cases outsidethe question of temporality (to the advantage of aspect) and outside any capacity {{to have their own}} subject. On the other hand, several analyses have brought to light a categorial process leading observers to consider the participles as belonging to the class of adjectives, the infinitives as belonging to the class of <b>nouns,</b> and the <b>gerunds</b> to the class of adverbs. Even if this presentation allows us establish that participles readily behave as adjectives and that gerunds are often employed as circumstants, such a perspective is intermediate and cannot resume what truly characterizes non-finite verbs. In this paper, we apply the question of scalarity and this one of (more or less local) relationship appearing between non-finite verbs and other discourse components. From a philological and usage-based grammatical framework, this article analyses some attested examples (collected in the recent periodic press) focusing on the way that non-finite verbs are more or less adjunct/conjunct to other words and simultaneously more or less linked to local or non-local discursive elements...|$|R
40|$|The gerund in OE was a noun with no verbal {{function}} at all. According to OED，in OE -ing and -ung {{were used as}} a noun to indicate something abstract，and then they were admitted as plural. OED mentions that the gerund with a verbal function which is followed by adverb，object and predicative appeared in the 14 'th century. Mosse thinks that verbal noun -ing was confused with the participle -end(e) in late OE and the gerund gave the -ing form to the Participle which gave a verbal function to the gerund. There are some constructions which maintain both the substantival and verbal function during the developmnt of the gerund. Moreover，the gerund with a(-),i. e. lie a-bleeding was found in Shakespearean English. The a (-) ，on originally，is a preposition. It was weakened and was dropped in PE. Therefore，there are some constructions in which a (-) is dropped in Shakespearean English. It seems that the gerund，-ing in OE came {{to be regarded as}} a participle in PE. In short，the constructionis involved with the development of progressive form. The gerunds in all the constructions in Shakespearean English mentioned above correspond to the whole process of the development of the gerund. In Hamlet，the gerund may form the passive voice. The passive voice implies passive by the simple-ing construction in Shakespearean English，because <b>gerund</b> was a <b>noun</b> originally，soit does not matter whether it is passive or active at all. In addition，the corresponding placing of not before the gerund, i. e. suffer not thinking， begins in the time of Queen Elizabeth，Shakespeare's period. The construction implies the gerund came to have a verbal function. The perfect form of the gerund is found in The Tempest. There are many examples of gerund with substantival function. However，interestingly，its verbal function，passive and perfect form，is found in The Tempest. This means that it as gradually obtained a verbal function. In addition，there are three constructions which have both substantival and verbal characteristics during its development. The fact that the gerund was established in Shakespearean English {{can be seen from the}} research of HenryVI，Romeo and juliet，Hamlet，and The Tempest. When the gerund is followed by the object in Shakespearean English，there are four different constructions. This is because the gerund in Shakespearean English was on the point of transition from verbal <b>noun</b> to <b>gerund</b> in PE with substantival and verbal functions. In short，Shakespearean English was at the stage which gerund began to obtain the verbal function，passive and perfect，in the development of gerund. On the other hand，the gerund with a verbal function came to be established in Shakespearean English. Therefore，by examining into Shakespearean English，we can trace the development of gerund...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} rich agreement system in Bafut DPs. I {{argue that we}} need two structural configurations: Spec-Head and Head-Head to account for DP agreement. The Head-Head relation is needed to check agreement on lexical categories via covert raising of features of adjectives and genitives, in a head-to-head fashion, to the noun in Num 0. Features of functional categories (determiners and quantifiers) are checked via movement of NumP to Spec-DP through Spec-QP in the familiar way of Spec-Head agreement. This approach, which extends to Romance and Bantu DPs, extends Chomsky 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) proposals for checking Φ-features on arguments in clauses to the checking of non-argument agreement relations in the DP and suggests a {{way of dealing with}} a really rich agreement system without resorting to the projection of agreement phrases. ^ The account of agreement follows naturally from the internal syntax of Bafut DPs. I argue that variations in distribution and interpretation of constituents of the DP results from movement to positions that correlate with different interpretations. In the structure, NP is embedded inside four functional projections: FocP, DP, QP and NumP. N-raising to Num 0 and subsequent movement of NumP to Spec-QP and Spec-DP yield the unmarked noun-initial word order commonly attested in Bantu. Further raising of functional heads to Foc 0 produce the contrastive focus interpretation when functional heads exceptionally precede the noun. ^ To have a broader picture of DP structure in Bafut, the dissertation also examines the structure of derived nominals. I argue that deverbal nouns and type I negative nominals are formed in the lexicon and inserted into the structure as plain <b>nouns</b> while Poss-ing <b>gerunds</b> and type II negative nominals are syntactically derived from an embedded VP. This account of derived nominals supports both the lexicalist and syntactic views on nominalizations. ^ Although the dissertation does not draw explicit comparisons between DPs and clauses, intuitive parallels between them cannot be ignored. For instance, N 0 -to-Num 0 raising accounts for agreement in DPs just as V 0 -to-I 0 raising accounts for subject-verb agreement in clauses. To the extent that such intuitive parallels can be further documented, we may not need to posit a syntax of DPs distinct from that of clauses. ...|$|R
