5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E

A number of motor cars were <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E
