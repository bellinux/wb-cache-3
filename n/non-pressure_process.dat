50|$|There are {{two general}} methods for {{preserving}} wood. The pressure process method involves placing wood in a pressure-treating vessel {{where it is}} immersed in PCP and then subjected to applied pressure. In the <b>non-pressure</b> <b>process</b> method, PCP is applied by spraying, brushing, dipping, and soaking.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} <b>non-pressure</b> <b>processes</b> of treating wood which vary primarily in their procedure. The most common of these treatments involve {{the application of}} the preservative by means of brushing or spraying, dipping, soaking, steeping or by means of hot and cold bath. There is also a variety of additional methods involving charring, applying preservatives in bored holes, diffusion processes and sap displacement.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{the first}} {{attempts}} made to protect wood from decay and insect attack consisted of brushing or rubbing preservatives onto {{the surfaces of}} the treated wood. Through trial and error the most effective preservatives and application processes were slowly determined. In the Industrial Revolution, demands {{for such things as}} telegraph poles and railroad ties (UK: railway sleepers) helped to fuel an explosion of new techniques that emerged in the early 19th century. The sharpest rise in inventions took place between 1830 and 1840, when Bethell, Boucherie, Burnett and Kyan were making wood-preserving history. Since then, numerous processes have been introduced or existing processes improved. The goal of modern-day wood preservation is to ensure a deep, uniform penetration with reasonable cost, without endangering the environment. The most widespread application processes today are those using artificial pressure through which many woods are being effectively treated, but several species (such as spruce, Douglas-fir, larch, hemlock and fir) are very resistant to impregnation. With the use of incising, the treatment of these woods has been somewhat successful but with a higher cost and not always satisfactory results. One can divide the wood-preserving methods roughly into either <b>non-pressure</b> <b>processes</b> or pressure processes.|$|R
40|$|Glass bonded {{aluminum}} oxide with strengths {{as high as}} 700 MPa (105 kpsi) was made by a <b>non-pressure</b> assisted sintering <b>process</b> involving double firing with par-ticle size deduction between the two firing stages. Densi-ty studies show that this process produces a higher density body than observed in more conventional single firing processes or fired materials without the intermediate grin-ding step. These materials are contrasted with hot-pressed composites of similar composition. Hot-pressed glass-bonded alumina show that the strength increases with in-creasing volume fraction of alumina. Studies of fracture toughness indicated that both crack deflection and crack bowing are important contributions to increased fracture toughness. Studies of wear indicated that reducing the alumina particle size reduces the amount of wear but tha...|$|R
