40|$|While the short-run {{financial}} status of Social Security is secure, its long-run {{financial status}} is very uncertain. The retirement and disability {{part of the}} system (OASDI) is projected to be in long-run actuarial deficit under the Social Security Administration's intermediate economic and demographic f 9 recasts. Hospital Insurance (HI) is projected to run a large deficit, beginning in the 1990 s. OASDI is projected to accrue a very large surplus over the next thirty years, peaking at almost 30 % of GNP. Social Security has never accrued a surplus this large; it may well be dissipated for other purposes, such as to bail out HI, fund other programs, raise benefits, or cut taxes. These alternatives may affect <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving,</b> directly because Social Security surpluses or deficits are part of government sector saving and indirectly through effects on private saving or the non-Social Security part of the federal government budget. This paper documents how various systematic deviations from, or return to, pay-as-you-go finance of the Social Security system may affect <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving.</b> For example, under base case assumptions with respect to the non-Social Security deficit, a constant net private saving rate of 6 %, and long-run budget balance in the state and local government sector, the Social Security deficit offsets 40 % of other <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> over the Social Security Administration's 75 -year projection period. In the first 25 -year sub-period, the Social Security surplus adds one-sixth to other net national saving; in the second, it offsets almost one-half; and in the third, it offsets five-sixths of other <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving.</b> Of course, private saving may respond to changes in Social Security's funding as may the non-Social Security balance in the federal budget. The paper presents several alternative scenarios such as benefits increasing or taxes falling during the OASDI surplus period, various stylized rules concerning the non-Social Security budget deficit, and separate balancing of HI via outlay reductions or tax increases. The results indicate that OASDI may effect <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> substantially. For example, if benefits ratchet up during what would have been the period of the OASDI surplus, the OASDI system may subsequently offset virtually all of remaining <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving.</b> On the other hand, if HI is brought into balance and the OASDI surplus is allowed to accrue, Social Security will offset only about 4 % of other <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving.</b> Changes in private saving may accentuate or ameliorate the swings in the <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> rate generated by the future financing of OASDHI, but the alternative financing options will be important determinant of <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving,</b> and therefore of private domestic investment and international capital flows. ...|$|E

40|$|While democracy’s {{effect on}} {{economic}} growth {{has come under}} intense empirical scrutiny, its effect on economic sustainability has been noticeably neglected. We assess the effects of regime type and democratic institutional design on economic, or “weak ” sustainability. Sustainability requires that the total stock of aggregate capital does not depreciate in value over time. The World Bank gauges the rate of net investment in manufactured, human, and natural capital, a unified indicator of weak sustainability (the genuine savings rate). All four indicators of democracy we examine show that freer societies are more sustainable because they {{have higher levels of}} investment in human capital, create less CO 2 damage per economic unit produced, and extract fewer natural resources in production, even if they show lower net investment in manufactured capital. Democracies may trade off immediate material welfare gains for future pay-offs. This finding justifies why scholars should assess the effects of regime type on more than just immediate growth, or the rate of change of manufactured capital. Among democracies, we find that mixed presidential-parliamentary systems exhibit a lower genuine savings rate than either of the pure systems. Proportional representation electoral systems fare worse than plurality when it comes to genuine and <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>savings,</b> even though they do better on education spending.

For example, in 1986 and 1987, the NIPA <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> measure is 1. 8 % and 1. 9 %, respectively, whereas my corresponding estimates from FED data are 11. 5 % and 3. 3 %.

The second alternative points at technological change as a way to avoid economic collapse. This paper uses the data of Venezuela and Mexico to empirically test the first of these two hypotheses.

40|$|Excerpt] Saving is {{the portion}} of {{national}} output that is not consumed and represents resources {{that can be used}} to increase, replace, or improve the nation’s capital stock. The U. S. <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> rate reached a post-war peak of 12. 4 % in 1965 and has then trended downward since to a low of 0. 8 % in 2005. Many analysts claim that saving is too low. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the United States has the third lowest saving rate. Survey evidence suggests that people know why they should save, but many don’t save, especially lower-income individuals and families. Several reasons have been offered to explain the declining personal saving rate and the relatively high proportion of individuals and families that do not save. Economic reasons start from the premise that individuals and families are rational and make optimal decisions about consumption and saving throughout the life course. Low saving rates are then explained by economic disincentives induced by government policy or by life cycle changes in the propensity to save. Behavioral reasons start from the premise that individuals and families do not always make optimal decisions regarding consumption and saving...|$|E
40|$|Since 1980, the U. S. <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> {{rate has}} {{averaged}} {{less than half}} the rate observed in the 1950 s and 60 s. This paper develops a unique cohort data set to study the decline in U. S. national saving. It decomposes postwar changes in U.

Our findings are striking. The decline in U. S. saving can be traced to two factors: The redistribution of resources from young and unborn generations with low or zero propensities to consume toward older generations with high consumption propensities, and {{a significant increase in the}} consumption propensities of older Americans. Most of the redistribution to the elderly reflects the growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits. The increase in the elderly's consumption propensities may also reflect government policy, namely the fact that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits are paid in the form of annuities and that, in the case of Medicare and Medicaid, the annuities are in-kind and must, therefore, be consumed. ...|$|E
40|$|This lecture {{examines}} {{the effects of}} tax policy and social security retirement benefits on capital accumulation and economic welfare. The paper begins by examining how capital income taxes reduce the real return to savers and then discusses the welfare loss of capital income taxation relative to the alternatives of taxing consumption and labor income. The second part deals with social security retirement benefits. In 1994, older Americans will receive cash and medical benefits that cost the government $ 530 billion or $ 16, 000 per person over 65. A final section discusses the implications of international capital flows for this analysis. As capital flows become more important, the response of government policy may be to compete for foreign capital inflows and to tax domestic savers more heavily; leading to a smaller total volume of capital. The sharp decline in the <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> rate-from over 8 % of GDP in the U.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} that the interest rate on long-term Japanese government bonds is low in comparison with other industrialised countries for four main reasons: lower inflation, net savings surplus, institutional restrictions and home bias. Monetary policy and institutionalised purchases of government bonds by semi-government agencies keep the market demand for bonds high. We find that since the 1970 s Japanese interest rate movements are better explained by the current account balance than in other industrialised countries. This is caused by sizeable net oversavings and institutional reasons increased the impact of oversavings as such on the long-term interest rate for Japan. Hence, the institutional reasons increase the coefficient value of the savings-investment balance. A reason {{for the existence of}} the high <b>national</b> <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> surplus could be that unsustainable budgetary deficits in Japan called for a Ricardian response. We doubt whether Ricardian equivalence is here the driving factor: household savings have actually fallen over the nineties.
