25|$|For {{stays in}} the Schengen Area as a whole which exceed 90 days, a third-country {{national}} will need to hold either a long-stay visa for a period no longer than a year, or a residence permit for longer periods. A long-stay visa is a <b>national</b> <b>visa</b> but is issued in accordance with a uniform format. It entitles the holder to enter the Schengen Area and remain in the issuing state for a period longer than 90 days {{but no more than}} one year. If a Schengen state wishes to allow the holder of a long-stay visa to remain there for longer than a year, the state must issue him or her with a residence permit.|$|E
2500|$|Immigrant visa {{availability}} – in {{the second}} step, unless the applicant is an [...] "immediate relative", an immigrant visa number through the <b>National</b> <b>Visa</b> Center (NVC) of the United States Department of State (DOS) must be available. A visa number might not be immediately available even if the USCIS approves the petition, {{because the number of}} immigrant visa numbers is limited every year by quotas set in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). There are also certain additional limitations by country of chargeability. [...] Thus, most immigrants will be placed on lengthy waiting lists. Those immigrants who are immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen (spouses and children under 21 years of age, and parents of a U.S. citizen who is 21 years of age or older) are not subject to these quotas and may proceed to the next step immediately (since they qualify for the IR immigrant category).|$|E
