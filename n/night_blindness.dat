40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{developing}} countries such as India have been exhibiting rapid increase in human population and vehicles, and increase in road accidents. Inappropriate driving behaviour {{is considered one of}} the major causes of road accidents in India as compared to defective geometric design of pavement or mechanical defects in vehicles. Apart from the other factors causing accidents such as poor road design,vehicle conditions, driver characteristics of frequent traffic violations, increase in crashes due to self-centred driving, etc. it can also be resulted in conditions such as lack of psychophysical abilities e. g. poor eye sight, poor vision at <b>night</b> time, glare <b>blindness</b> etc. Hence, improved driver screening facilities accompanied by availability of good driving aids such as anti glare glasses can be an effective and preventive measure to inhibit crash risks. This article is based on a case study jointly done by CSIR-Central Road Research Institute and Institute of Driver Training & Research, Maruti, Loni Border, Delhi, India to highlight visual limitations among the learner drivers which can influence (as per the literature review) driving behaviour with crash chances, which can be reduced through improving safety accompanied with better driver screening, providing free visual aids and modifying present licensing procedures...|$|R
25|$|There can be {{symptoms}} of fat loss {{and a reduction}} of any weight gain that would be considered normal for an individual, especially developmental weight gains such as in infants which would occur if the infant was deprived of vitamin A in utero and/or if it was deprived postnatal for an extensive period of time. The deficiency can also cause conditions such as blindness or <b>night</b> <b>blindness,</b> also known as nyctalopia. <b>Night</b> <b>blindness</b> {{is due to the}} inability to regenerate rhodopsin in the rods which is needed in dim light in order to see properly.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} two to three decades, {{a large body of}} work has {{revealed}} the molecular basis of many human disorders, including retinal and vitreoretinal degenerations and dysfunctions. Although belonging to the group of orphan diseases, they affect probably more than two million people worldwide. Most excitingly, treatment of a particular form of congenital retinal degeneration is now possible. A major advantage for treatment is the unique structure and accessibility of the eye and its different components, including the vitreous and retina. Knowledge of the many different eye diseases affecting retinal structure and function (<b>night</b> and color <b>blindness,</b> retinitis pigmentosa, cone and cone rod dystrophies, photoreceptor dysfunctions, as well as vitreoretinal traits) is critical for future therapeutic development. We have attempted to present a comprehensive picture of these disorders, including clinical, genetic and molecular information. The structural organization of the review leads the reader through non-syndromic and syndromic forms of (i) rod dominated diseases, (ii) cone dominated diseases, (iii) generalized retinal degenerations and (iv) vitreoretinal disorders, caused by mutations in more than 165 genes. Clinical variability and genetic heterogeneity have an important impact on genetic testing and counselling of affected families. As phenotypes do not always correlate with the respective genotypes, it is of utmost importance that clinicians, geneticists, counsellors, diagnostic laboratories and basic researchers understand the relationships between phenotypic manifestations and specific genes, as well as mutations and pathophysiologic mechanisms. We discuss future perspectives...|$|R
40|$|Hereditary retinal dystrophies (HRDs) are {{degenerative}} {{diseases of}} the retina which have marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Common presentations among these disorders include <b>night</b> or colour <b>blindness,</b> tunnel vision, and subsequent progression to complete blindness. The known causative disease genes {{have a variety of}} developmental and functional roles, with mutations in more than 120 genes shown to be responsible for the phenotypes. In addition, mutations within the same gene have been shown to cause different disease phenotypes, even amongst affected individuals within the same family, highlighting further levels of complexity. The known disease genes encode proteins involved in retinal cellular structures, phototransduction, the visual cycle, and photoreceptor structure or gene regulation. Significant advancements have been made in understanding the genetic pathogenesis of ocular diseases, and gene replacement and gene silencing have been proposed as potentially efficacious therapies. Because of its favorable anatomical and immunological characteristics, the eye has {{been at the forefront of}} translational gene therapy. Recent improvements have been made in the safety and specificity of vector-based ocular gene transfer methods. Dozens of promising proofs of concept have been obtained in animal models of HRDs and some of them have been relayed to the clinic. The results from the first clinical trials for a congenital form of blindness have generated great interest and have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of intraocular administrations of viral vectors in humans.

25|$|The {{conclusion}} {{that can be}} drawn from the newer research is that fruits and vegetables are not as useful for obtaining vitamin A as was thought; in other words, the IUs that these foods were reported to contain were worth much less than the same number of IUs of fat-dissolved oils and (to some extent) supplements.

25|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) affects about 7% of Tollers with an {{estimated}} 40% being carriers. The type of PRA associated with the breed is known as progressive rod-cone degeneration. The disease causes cells in the retina to degenerate and die. This causes <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> at first and eventually complete blindness. Collie eye anomaly is estimated to have a carrier rate of 5% and an affected rate of 0.5%. It generally only causes mildly impaired vision, although in more severe cases {{it can lead to}} retinal hemorrhaging and detachments resulting in blindness.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{stationary}} <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> {{has been}} linked with the leopard complex since the 1970s. The presence of CSNB in non-leopard breeds and horses suggested that the two conditions might be located on close, but separate genes. However, one study used ERG findings to diagnose all the homozygous Lp subjects with CSNB, while all heterozygotes and non-Lp horses were free from the disorder. The gene to which Lp has now been localized encodes a protein that channels calcium ions, {{a key factor in}} the transmission of nerve impulses. This protein, which is found in the retina and the skin, existed in fractional percentages of the normal levels in homozygous Lp/Lp horses. A 2008 study theorizes that both CSNB and leopard complex spotting patterns are linked to the TRPM1 gene.|$|E
25|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{provided}} evidence that loss-of-function mutations in pre-synaptic proteins of the photoreceptor cells ribbon synapse can cause X-linked congenital stationary <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> (CSNB) through mutations in the CACNA1F gene, which codes for the Î±F1-subunit of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.4. The gene is expressed at the active zone of photoreceptor ribbon synapses. The mutation {{is characterized by a}} significant reduction in both night and variable perturbation of daylight vision. The mutations in CACNA1F and Cav1.4 have also been observed to co-localize with CaBP4, a photoreceptor-specific calcium-binding protein. CaBP4 has been theorized to modulate the activity of the Cav1.4 channel. It has been theorized {{to be associated with the}} proper establishment and maintenance of photoreceptor ribbon synapses. While no evidence has been published, the association between CaBP4 and Cav1.4 is an area of continued research.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{function}} of retinal as a visual chromophore, {{one of the earliest}} and specific manifestations of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision, particularly in reduced light â€“ <b>night</b> <b>blindness.</b> Persistent deficiency gives rise to a series of changes, the most devastating of which occur in the eyes. Some other ocular changes are referred to as xerophthalmia. First there is dryness of the conjunctiva (xerosis) as the normal lacrimal and mucus-secreting epithelium is replaced by a keratinized epithelium. This is followed by the build-up of keratin debris in small opaque plaques (Bitot's spots) and, eventually, erosion of the roughened corneal surface with softening and destruction of the cornea (keratomalacia) and leading to total blindness. Other changes include impaired immunity (increased risk of ear infections, urinary tract infections, Meningococcal disease), hyperkeratosis (white lumps at hair follicles), keratosis pilaris and squamous metaplasia of the epithelium lining the upper respiratory passages and urinary bladder to a keratinized epithelium. In relation to dentistry, a deficiency in vitamin A may lead to enamel hypoplasia.|$|E
500|$|Appaloosas {{that are}} {{homozygous}} for the leopard complex (LP) gene {{are also at}} risk for congenital stationary <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> (CSNB). [...] This form of <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> has been linked with the leopard complex since the 1970s, and in 2007 a [...] "significant association" [...] between LP and CSNB was identified. CSNB is a disorder that causes an affected animal to lack night vision, although day vision is normal. It is an inherited disorder, present from birth, and does not progress over time. Studies in 2008 and 2010 indicate that both CSNB and leopard complex spotting patterns are linked to TRPM1.|$|E
2500|$|The {{progressive}} blindness of Usher syndrome {{results from}} retinitis pigmentosa. The photoreceptor cells usually start to degenerate {{from the outer}} [...] {{to the center of}} the retina, including the macula. The degeneration is usually first noticed as <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> (nyctalopia); peripheral vision is gradually lost, restricting the visual field (tunnel vision), which generally progresses to complete blindness. The qualifier 'pigmentosa' reflects the fact that clumps of pigment may be visible by an ophthalmoscope in advanced stages of degeneration.|$|E
2500|$|The leopard complex, {{related to}} the Leopard (LP) gene, characterizes the Appaloosa and Knabstrupper breeds with their spotted coats. Leopard is genetically quite {{distinct}} from all other white and white-spotting patterns. The fewspot leopard pattern, however, can resemble white. Two factors influence the eventual appearance of a leopard complex coat: whether one copy (heterozygous LP/lp) or two copies (homozygous LP/LP) Leopard alleles are present, {{and the degree of}} dense white patterning present at birth. If a foal is homozygous for the LP allele and has extensive dense white patterning, they will appear nearly white at birth, and may continue to lighten with age. In other parts of the world, these horses are called [...] "white born." [...] "White born" [...] foals are less common among Appaloosa horses than Knabstruppers or Norikers, as the extensive dense white patterning is favored for producing dramatic full leopards. [...] Homozygous leopards have the LP/LP genotype, and may be varnish roan, fewspot leopard, or snowcap patterned. Homozygous leopards are substantially more prone to congenital stationary <b>night</b> <b>blindness.</b> Congenital stationary <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> is present at birth and is characterized by impaired vision in dark conditions.|$|E
2500|$|This {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} hearing loss and a gradual visual impairment. The hearing loss {{is caused by a}} defective inner ear, whereas the vision loss results from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degeneration of the retinal cells. Usually, the rod cells of the retina are affected first, leading to early <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> and the gradual loss of peripheral vision. In other cases, early degeneration of the cone cells in the macula occurs, leading to a loss of central acuity. In some cases, the foveal vision is spared, leading to [...] "doughnut vision"; central and peripheral vision are intact, but an annulus exists around the central region in which vision is impaired.|$|E
2500|$|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited, {{degenerative}} [...] {{eye disease}} that causes severe vision impairment {{due to the}} progressive degeneration of the rod photoreceptor cells in the retina. This form of retinal dystrophy manifests initial symptoms independent of age; thus, RP diagnosis occurs anywhere from early infancy to late adulthood. Patients {{in the early stages}} of RP first notice compromised peripheral and dim light vision due to the decline of the rod photoreceptors. The progressive rod degeneration is later followed by abnormalities in the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the deterioration of cone photoreceptor cells. As peripheral vision becomes increasingly compromised, patients experience progressive [...] "tunnel vision" [...] and eventual blindness. [...] Affected individuals may additionally experience defective light-dark adaptations, nyctalopia (<b>night</b> <b>blindness),</b> and the accumulation of bone spicules in the fundus.|$|E
2500|$|Congenital {{stationary}} <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> is an ophthalmologic {{disorder in}} horses which is present at birth (congenital), non-progressive (stationary) and affects the animal's vision in conditions of low lighting. Horses with CSNB may be hesitant to enter dimly-lit places - such as indoor arenas, dark stalls, or trailers - and be apprehensive when in such conditions, which {{may interfere with}} handling or riding. CSNB is usually diagnosed based on the owner's observations, but some horses have visibly abnormal eyes: poorly aligned eyes (dorsomedial strabismus) or involuntary eye movement (nystagmus). The condition can be confirmed using electroretinography, from which a [...] "negative ERG" [...] indicates CSNB. While the retina is a normal shape, the nerve signal triggered when light reaches rod cells does not reach the brain. Rod cells in the retina are connected to bipolar cells, which transmit the nerve impulse to {{the next set of}} neurons. It is thought that these cells fail to undergo the basic chemical reaction for nerve impulse transmission, which involves shuttling of calcium (Ca2+).|$|E
2500|$|Retinitis pigmentosa is an {{inherited}} disease {{which leads to}} progressive <b>night</b> <b>blindness</b> and loss of peripheral vision {{as a result of}} photoreceptor cell death. [...] Most people who suffer from RP are born with rod cells that are either dead or dysfunctional, so they are effectively blind at nighttime, since these are the cells responsible for vision in low levels of light. What follows often is the death of cone cells, responsible for color vision and acuity, at light levels present during the day. Loss of cones leads to full blindness as early as five years old, but may not onset until many years later. There have been multiple hypotheses about how the lack of rod cells can lead to the death of cone cells. Pinpointing a mechanism for RP is difficult because there are more than 39 genetic loci and genes correlated with this disease. In an effort to find the cause of RP, there have been different gene therapy techniques applied to address each of the hypotheses.|$|E
2500|$|The role {{of vitamin}} A {{in the visual}} cycle is {{specifically}} related to the retinal form. Within the eye, 11-cis-retinal is bound to the protein [...] "opsin" [...] to form rhodopsin in rods and iodopsin (cones) at conserved lysine residues. As light enters the eye, the 11-cis-retinal is isomerized to the all-"trans" [...] form. The all-"trans" [...] retinal dissociates from the opsin {{in a series of}} steps called photo-bleaching. This isomerization induces a nervous signal along the optic nerve to the visual center of the brain. After separating from opsin, the all-"trans"-retinal is recycled and converted back to the 11-"cis"-retinal form by a series of enzymatic reactions. In addition, some of the all-"trans" [...] retinal may be converted to all-"trans" [...] retinol form and then transported with an interphotoreceptor retinol-binding protein (IRBP) to the pigment epithelial cells. Further esterification into all-"trans" [...] retinyl esters allow for storage of all-trans-retinol within the pigment epithelial cells to be reused when needed. The final stage is conversion of 11-cis-retinal will rebind to opsin to reform rhodopsin (visual purple) in the retina. Rhodopsin is needed to see in low light (contrast) as well as for night vision. KÃ¼hne showed that rhodopsin in the retina is only regenerated when the retina is attached to retinal pigmented epithelium, which provides retinal. It {{is for this reason that}} a deficiency in vitamin A will inhibit the reformation of rhodopsin and lead to one of the first symptoms, <b>night</b> <b>blindness.</b>|$|E
