40|$|Non-human {{primates}} of South-East Asia remain under-studied concerning parasite {{epidemiology and}} co-infection patterns. Simultaneously, efforts in conservation demand knowledge of parasite abundance and biodiversity in threatened species. The Endangered proboscis monkey, <b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus,</b> a primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, {{was investigated in}} the present study. Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the greatest threats to bachelor and harem groups of this folivorous colobine. Designed as a follow-up study, prevalence and co-infection status of intestinal parasites from N.  larvatus in a protected area in Malaysian Borneo were analyzed from fecal samples using a flotation method. For the first time, the intestinal parasite co-infection patterns were examined using quantitative analyses. Overall, 92. 3 % of fecal samples (N =  652) were positive for helminth eggs. Five helminth groups were detected: (1) trichurids (82. 7 % prevalence) including Trichuris spp. (82. 1 %) and Anatrichosoma spp. (1. 4 %), (2) strongyles (58. 9 %) including Trichostrongylus spp. (48. 5 %) and Oesophagostomum/Ternidens spp. (22. 8 %), (3) Strongyloides fuelleborni (32. 7 %), (4) Ascaris lumbricoides (8. 6 %), and (5) Enterobius spp. (5. 5 %). On average, an individual was co-infected with two different groups. Significant positive associations were found for co-infections of trichurids with strongyles and S.  fuelleborni as well as S.  fuelleborni with A.  lumbricoides and strongyles. This study shows a high prevalence of various gastrointestinal helminths with potential transmission pathways primarily related to soil and with zoonotic relevance in wild proboscis monkeys in their remaining natural habitats. Observed positive associations of trichurids with strongyles and Strongyloides spp. may result from the high prevalence of trichurids. Similarly, positive associations between Strongyloides and Ascaris were found, both of which typically occur predominantly in juvenile hosts. These findings should be considered when proposing conservation actions in altered habitats nearby human settlements and when managing captive populations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Colobine {{phylogeny}} {{and evolution}} is little understood and poorly studied. We established C. guereza (2 n= 44) chromosome paint probes by flow sorting and reciprocally hybridized them to human chromosomes. The bivariate flow karyotype of Colobus guereza was resolved into 22 peaks. Paints of C. guereza were hybridized to human metaphases and 32 clear signals were detected. The reciprocal painting data {{allowed us to}} assign subchromosomal homologies between C. guereza and human chromosomes. A comparison of these data with previous chromosome painting and banding supported the monophyly of Colobinae and their division in an African and an Asian clade. Pygathrix nemaeus is karyologically the most conservative colobine species studied and it probably diverged early after the separation of Asian and African colobines. In contrast, chromosome painting shows that <b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus,</b> often considered the most primitive and isolated colobine, is karyologically derived and phylogenetically nested within Asian colobines. Both the painting and banding data support the taxonomic grouping of Trachypithecus, but would exclude the purple faced leaf monkey and align this species with the Hanuman langur in Semnopithecus...|$|R
40|$|The {{endangered}} {{proboscis monkey}} (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus)</b> is a sexually highly dimorphic Old World primate endemic {{to the island}} of Borneo. Previous studies focused mainly on its ecology and behavior, but knowledge of its vocalizations is limited. The present study provides quantified information on vocal rate and on the vocal acoustics of the prominent calls of this species. We audio-recorded vocal behavior of 10 groups over two 4 -month periods at the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in Sabah, Borneo. We observed monkeys and recorded calls in evening and morning sessions at sleeping trees along riverbanks. We found no differences in the vocal rate between evening and morning observation sessions. Based on multiparametric analysis, we identified acoustic features of the four common call-types “shrieks,” “honks,” “roars,” and “brays. ” “Chorus” events were also noted in which multiple callers produced a mix of vocalizations. The four call-types were distinguishable based {{on a combination of}} fundamental frequency variation, call duration, and degree of voicing. Three of the call-types can be considered as “loud calls” and are therefore deemed promising candidates for non-invasive, vocalization-based monitoring of proboscis monkeys for conservation purposes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{predation}} pressure put on primates by diurnal {{birds of}} prey differs greatly between continents. Africa and South America have specialist raptors (e. g. crowned hawk-eagle Stephanoaetus coronatus and harpy eagle Harpia harpyja) whereas in Asia the only such spe-cialist’s (Philippine eagle Pithecophaga jefferyi) distribu-tion is largely allopatric with primates. The almost universal absence of polyspecific groups in Asia (common in Africa and South America) may indicate reduced predation pres-sure. As such there is almost no information on predation pressures on primates in Asia by raptors. Here we report successful predation of a juvenile banded langur Presbytis femoralis (* 2 kg) by a changeable hawk-eagle Spizaetus cirrhatus. The troop that was attacked displayed no signs of being alarmed, and no calls were made before the event. We argue that in insular Southeast Asia, especially, large Spizaetus hawk-eagles (* 2 kg) are significant predators of arboreal colobines. Using data on the relative size of sym-patric Spizaetus hawk-eagles and colobines we make pre-dictions on where geographically we can expect the highest predation pressure (Thai–Malay Peninsula) and which col-obines are least (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus,</b> Trachypithecus auratus, P. thomasi) and most (P. femoralis, T. cristatus) affected...|$|R
40|$|Concentrating {{on their}} {{presence}} in Borneo, the ecology and conservation of two large Southeast Asian primates, the orangutan Pongo pymaeus and the proboscis monkey <b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus</b> are reviewed. The former species occurs only in Borneo and Sumatra and the latter only in Borneo. The comparative threats facing these two endangered primates and their approximate numbers in the wild are put into perspective. The long-term survival of both species is adversely affected by the degradation and conversion of their suitable forest habitat by logging and agriculture, the occurrence of hunting, poaching and forest fires. The effectiveness of measures to conserve these species are discussed and evaluated {{from the standpoint of}} economics. It is concluded that informed assessment of the opportunity costs of conserving these species and their habitat is required and better incentives for law enforcement must be created. Properly regulated ecotourism may draw the necessary attention to the plight of these species and may even help fund conservation research. Economics can help identify least, or low, cost opportunities for conserving species as is demonstrated in this article, even if it is not always possible to demonstrate their economic value convincingly.

40|$|Extract] The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the relationships between destination product, wildlife value, satisfaction, loyalty and wildlife conservation awareness in Sabah. Wildlife, as Harwood and Noske (Chapter 20) and Musinguzi, Tukamushaba, Katongole and Obua (Chapter 19) observed, is often a major pull factor for rainforest destinations. However, as Koichi points out in Chapter 18, feral wildlife may cause considerable damage to the environment and detract from the rainforest experience. Understanding issues related to visitor satisfaction are therefore important. Sabah has approximately 4. 4 million hectares of forests, ranging from coastal lowland forests to mountain-top montane forests. This large area of forest provides many opportunities for wildlife viewing (Empau and Ayim, 1994; Hutton, 2002). Located on the island of Borneo, Sabah is recognised as one of the world's 12 most important mega-diversity sites (Chan and Yeoh, 2001) and the only site that continues to contain all of Borneo's remaining larger mammals: the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus morio), the proboscis monkey (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus),</b> the Bornean elephant (Ekphas maximus borneensis), the Bornean banteng (Bos javanicus lowi), the Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinos sumatrensis harrissonz), the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) and the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) (Goossens and Ambu, 2012) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} herbivores, faecal {{particle size}} indicates chewing efficiency. Proboscis monkeys (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus)</b> are foregut fermenters in which regurgitation and remastication (i. e. rumination) {{was observed in}} the wild, {{but not with the}} same consistency as found in ruminants and camelids. To test whether this species has exceptional chewing efficiency among primates, as ruminants have among mammals, we compared faecal particle size in free-ranging specimens with those of 12 other primate species. The discrete mean faecal particle size (dMEAN) increased with body mass (M) as dMEAN (mm) = 0. 65 (95 % confidence interval 0. 49 – 0. 87) M 0. 33 (0. 23 – 0. 43) in simple-stomached species. At 0. 53 ± 0. 09 mm, dMEAN of proboscis monkeys was particularly small for their average M (15 kg) and significantly smaller than values of two other foregut fermenting primate species. While we cannot exclude other reasons for the exceptional chewing efficiency in proboscis monkeys, this represents circumstantial evidence for regular use of rumination in this species. Thus, proboscis monkeys might be a model for convergent evolution towards rumination in a non-ungulate taxon...|$|R
40|$|Free-living animals {{must make}} dietary choices {{in terms of}} {{chemical}} and physical properties, depending on their digestive physiology and availability of food resources. Here we comprehensively evaluated the dietary choices of proboscis monkeys (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus)</b> consuming young leaves. We analysed the data for leaf toughness and digestibility measured by an in vitro gas production method, in addition to previously reported data on nutrient composition. Leaf toughness, in general, negatively correlated with the crude protein content, {{one of the most}} important nutritional factors affecting food selection by leaf-eating primates. This result suggests that leaf toughness assessed by oral sensation might be a proximate cue for its protein content. We confirmed the importance of the leaf chemical properties in terms of preference shown by N. larvatus; leaves with high protein content and low neutral detergent fibre levels were preferred to those of the common plant species. We also found that these preferred leaves were less tough and more digestible than the alternatives. Our in vitro results also suggested that N. larvatus were little affected by secondary plant compounds. However, the spatial distribution pattern of plant species was the strongest factor explaining the selection of the preferred leaf species...|$|R
40|$|Although foregut {{fermentation}} {{is often}} equated with rumination in the literature, functional ruminants (ruminants, camelids) differ fundamentally from non-ruminant foregut fermenters (e. g. macropods, hippos, peccaries). They combine foregut fermentation with a sorting mechanism {{that allows them}} to remasticate large particles and clear their foregut quickly of digested particles; thus, they do not only achieve high degrees of particle size reduction but also comparatively high food intakes. Regurgitation and remastication of stomach contents have been described sporadically in several non-ruminant, non-primate herbivores. However, this so-called ‘merycism’ apparently does not occur as consistently as in ruminants. Here, to our knowledge we report, for the first time, regurgitation and remastication in 23 free-ranging individuals of a primate species, the foregut-fermenting proboscis monkey (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus).</b> In one male that was observed continuously during 169 days, the behaviour was observed on 11 different days occurring mostly in the morning, and was associated with significantly higher proportions of daily feeding time than on days when it was not observed. This observation is consistent with the concept that intensified mastication allows higher food intake without compromising digestive efficiency, and represents an expansion of the known physiological primate repertoire that converges with a strategy usually associated with ruminants only...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{sleeping}} site is crucial for primates and may influence their survival. In this study, we investigated several tree characteristics influencing the sleeping site selection by proboscis monkeys (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus)</b> along Kinabatangan River, in Sabah, Malaysia. We identified 81 sleeping trees used by one-male and all-male social groups from November 2011 to January 2012. We recorded 15 variables for each tree. Within sleeping sites, sleeping trees were taller, had a larger trunk, with larger and higher first branches than surrounding trees. The crown contained more mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits but had vines less often than surrounding trees. In addition, in this study, we also focused on a larger scale, considering sleeping and non-sleeping sites. Multivariate analyses highlighted a combination of 6 variables that revealed the significance of sleeping trees as well as surrounding trees in the selection process. During our boat surveys, we observed that adult females and young individuals stayed higher in the canopy than adult males. This pattern may be driven by their increased vulnerability to predation. Finally, we suggest that the selection of particular sleeping tree features (i. e. tall, high first branch) by proboscis monkeys is mostly influenced by antipredation strategies.

40|$|Diet of the {{proboscis}} monkey (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus</b> Wurmb) inhabiting rubber forests was poorly known. The research objectives were to identify plants or other organisms which functions as food sources, estimate {{the amount of}} food a day, and determine the content of food nutrition. Identification of food sources and estimation of {{the amount of food}} were conducted in the field, but the nutrition content was analyzed in the laboratory. Eighteen plant species belonging to at least ten families were found as food sources. The monkey was likely to be folivore. Based on IARF (individual activity records of feeding) method, most of food was consisted of leaves (80. 9 %) and others were flowers (11. 3 %), fruits (6. 77 %), and barks (0. 95 %). The monkey also fed grasshoppers and termites, although few occasions were found. However, the number of food plant species and the percentage of food composition could change, because on some locations, out of the research location, we found and also people reported other plant species consumed by the {{proboscis monkey}}. By sampling the feeding rate on leaves of three species, the amount of food ranged 919. 96 - 1537. 59 g wet weight or 168. 57 - 515. 94 g dry weight.

40|$|The {{proboscis}} monkey (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus)</b> {{is a large}} old world monkey, indigenous to Borneo. In the coastal areas of this island, groups of {{proboscis monkey}}s live together {{without a lot of}} territorial aggression. Studies conducted on the social organization of this monkey do not unanimously agree on its group composition. Phylogenetically it differs a lot from the other Colobines and might therefore show more resemblance to the Papio genus. Comparing the proboscis monkey to other Colobines shows that snub-nosed monkeys have a similar social structure. The multilevel society and fission-fusion behaviour of these monkeys make it a good example for the possible social structures of the proboscis monkey. While the baboons also exhibit these behaviours, the levels of its multilevel society are more extensive than observed for the proboscis monkey. Because of this a lot of influences on the social organization are added. This draws the conclusion that snub-nosed monkeys have the most similar social organization to the proboscis monkey. The combined literature in this thesis gives an overview of the monkey’s social behaviour in the wild and mentions new insights on how to successfully keep them in an artificial environment. With the knowledge on maintaining groups of proboscis monkeys in captivity, zoos can cooperate and work against the extinction of this species in the wild...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Conventional {{biodiversity}} surveys play {{an important}} role in ensuring good conservation friendly management in tropical forest regions but are demanding in terms of expertise, time, and budget. Can local people help? Here, we illustrate how local knowledge can support low cost conservation surveys. We worked in the Malinau watershed, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, an area currently at risk of extensive forest loss. We selected eight species of regional conservation interest: rafflesia (Rafflesia spp.), black orchid (Coelogyne pandurata), sun bear (Helarctos malayanus), tarsier (Tarsius bancanus), slow loris (Nyc-ticebus coucang), proboscis monkey (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus),</b> clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi/N. nebulosa), and orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus). We asked 52 informants in seven villages if, where and when they had observed these spe-cies. We used maps, based on both geo-referenced and sketched features, to record these observations. Verification concerns and related issues are discussed. Evaluations suggest our local information is reliable. Our study took 6 weeks and cost about USD 5000. Extensive expert based field surveys across the same region would cost one or two orders of magnitude more. The records extend the known distribution for sun bear, tarsier, slow loris, and clouded leopard. Reports of rafflesia, proboscis monkey, and orang-utan are of immediate conservation significance. While quality concerns should never be abandoned, we conclude that local people can help expand our knowledge of large areas in an effective, reliable, and low cost manner and thus contribute to improved management...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMultilevel {{social systems}} have evolved in {{several species of}} cercopithecoid {{primates}} and {{appear to be an}} effective means of changing group size amid variation in environmental conditions. Larger groupings of these species fission and fuse, making intraunit relationships essential to maintain the integrity of the smallest social units. We examine these intraunit relationships in four primates with multilevel social systems: proboscis monkeys (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus),</b> snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana), hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas), and geladas (Theropithecus gelada), using social network analysis. The proboscis monkeys and hamadryas baboons were wild and unprovisioned, whereas the snub-nosed monkeys and geladas were partly provisioned. Comparison of eigenvector centrality coefficients revealed a phylogenetic difference in the key individuals maintaining social networks between the colobines and the cercopithecines: females were more central in proboscis and snubnosed monkeys, with males generally peripheral to social interaction, whereas males were more central than females in geladas and hamadryas. A comparison of sex differences in clustering coefficients, however, revealed a significant difference only in geladas, suggesting that one-male-multifemale units in this species become more unstable when females, but not males, are removed from social networks. Taken together, our results reveal the strongest differences between geladas, characterized by female philopatry and male dispersal, and the three species with bisexual dispersal. These results demonstrate the potential for social network analysis to reveal the social bonds most important for maintaining cohesion of the smallest units of primate multilevel societies. This, in turn, can serve as a proxy, in the absence of long-term data, for underlying patterns of sex-biased dispersal and philopatry...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{observations}} and small fecal particles {{compared to other}} primates indicate that free-ranging proboscis monkeys (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus)</b> have a strategy of facultative merycism (rumination). In functional ruminants (ruminant and camelids), rumination is facilitated by a particle sorting mechanism in the forestomach that selectively retains larger particles and subjects them to repeated mastication. Using a set of a solute and three particle markers of different sizes (b 2, 5 and 8 mm), we displayed digesta passage kinetics and measured mean retention times (MRTs) in four captive proboscis monkeys (6 – 18 kg) and compared the marker excretion patterns to those in domestic cattle. In addition, we evaluated various methods of calculating and displaying passage characteristics. The mean ± SD dry matter intake was 98 ± 22 g kg− 0. 75 d− 1, 68 ± 7 % of which was browse. Accounting for sampling intervals in MRT calculation yielded results that were not affected by the sampling frequency. Displaying marker excretion patterns using fecal marker concentrations (rather than amounts) facilitated com- parisons with reactor theory outputs and indicated that both proboscis and cattle digestive tracts represent a se- ries of very few tank reactors. However, {{the separation of the}} solute and particle marker and the different-sized particle markers, evident in cattle, did not occur in proboscis monkeys, in which all markers moved together, at MRTs of approximately 40 h. The results indicate that the digestive physiology of proboscis monkeys does not show typical characteristics of ruminants, which may explain why merycism is only a facultative strategy in this species...|$|R
40|$|In {{non-human}} primates, {{the daily}} feeding rhythm, i. e., temporal fluctuation in feeding activity across the day, {{has been described}} but has rarely received much analytical interpretation, though it may play a crucial part in understanding the adaptive significance of primate foraging strategies. This study {{is the first to}} describe the detailed daily feeding rhythm in proboscis monkeys (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus)</b> based on data collected from both riverbank and inland habitats. From May 2005 to May 2006, data on feeding behavior in a group of proboscis monkeys consisting of an alpha-male, six adult females and immatures was collected via continuous focal animal sampling technique in a forest along the Menanggul River, Sabah, Malaysia. In both the male and females, the highest peak of feeding activity was in the late afternoon at 15 : 00 – 17 : 00, i. e., shortly before sleeping. The differences in the feeding rhythm among the seasons appeared to reflect the time spent eating fruit and/or the availability of fruit; clearer feeding peaks were detected when the monkeys spent a relevant amount of time eating fruit, but no clear peak was detected when fruit eating was less frequent. The daily feeding rhythm was not strongly influenced by daily temperature fluctuations. When comparing the daily feeding rhythm of proboscis monkeys to that of other primates, {{one of the most common}} temporal patterns detected across primates was a feeding peak in the late afternoon, although it was impossible to demonstrate this statistically because of methodological differences among studies...|$|R
2500|$|Among {{crustacean}} prey, large mud crabs of {{the genus}} Scylla are frequently consumed, especially in mangrove habitats. Ground-living birds, such as the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) and different kinds of water birds, especially the magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata), are the most commonly preyed upon birds, due to the increased chance of encounter. Even swift-flying birds and bats may be snatched if {{close to the surface}} of water, as well as wading birds while these are patrolling the shore looking for food, even down {{to the size of a}} common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos). Mammalian prey of juveniles and subadults are usually as large as the smaller species of ungulates, such as the greater mouse-deer (Tragulus napu) and hog deer (Hyelaphus porcinus). Various mammalian species including monkeys (i.e. crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis), long-tailed macaques (M. fascicularis) & proboscis monkeys (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus),),</b> gibbons, wallabies, mongoose, civets, jackals (Canis ssp.), turtles, flying foxes (Pteropus ssp.), hares (Lepus ssp.), rodents, badgers, otters, fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus) and chevrotains are readily taken when encountered. A rare incidence of an adult, 2.6 m Saltwater Crocodile preying on an Indian Porcupine (Hystrix indica) was reported from Sri Lanka. [...] Unlike fish, crabs and aquatic creatures, mammals and birds are usually found only sporadically in or next to water so crocodiles seem to search for places where such prey may be concentrated, i.e. the water under a tree holding a flying fox colony or spots where herds of water buffaloes feed, in order to capture small animals disturbed by the buffalo or (if a large adult crocodile is hunting) weaker members of the buffalo herd.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of GPS tags for tracking wildlife has revolutionised {{the study of}} home ranges, habitat use and behaviour. Concomitantly, there have been rapid developments in methods for estimating habitat use from GPS data. In combination, these changes can cause challenges in choosing the best methods for estimating home ranges. In primatology, this issue has received little attention, as {{there have been few}} GPS collar-based studies to date. However, as advancing technology is making collaring studies more feasible, {{there is a need for}} the analysis to advance alongside the technology. Here, using a high quality GPS collaring data set from 10 proboscis monkeys (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus),</b> we aimed to: 1) compare home range estimates from the most commonly used method in primatology, the grid-cell method, with three recent methods designed for large and/or temporally correlated GPS data sets; 2) evaluate how well these methods identify known physical barriers (e. g. rivers); and 3) test the robustness of the different methods to data containing either less frequent or random losses of GPS fixes. Biased random bridges had the best overall performance, combining a high level of agreement between the raw data and estimated utilisation distribution with a relatively low sensitivity to reduced fixed frequency or loss of data. It estimated the home range of proboscis monkeys to be 24 - 165 ha (mean 80. 89 ha). The grid-cell method and approaches based on local convex hulls had some advantages including simplicity and excellent barrier identification, respectively, but lower overall performance. With the most suitable model, or combination of models, it is possible to understand more fully the patterns, causes, and potential consequences that disturbances could have on an animal, and accordingly be used to assist in the management and restoration of degraded landscapes...|$|R
60|$|At {{this time}} I {{had the misfortune}} to slip among some fallen trees, and hurt my ankle; and, not being careful enough at first, it became a severe {{inflamed}} ulcer, which would not heal, and kept me a prisoner in the house the whole of July and part of August. When I could get out again, I determined to take a trip up {{a branch of the}} Simunjon River to Semabang, where there was said to be a large Dyak house, a mountain with abundance of fruit, and plenty of Orangs and fine birds. As the river was very narrow, and I was obliged to go in a very small boat with little luggage, I only took with me a Chinese boy as a servant. I carried a cask of medicated arrack to put Mias skins in, and stores and ammunition for a fortnight. After a few miles, the stream became very narrow and winding, and the whole country on each side was flooded. On the banks were an abundance of monkeys--the common Macacus cynomolgus, a black Semnopithecus, and the extraordinary long-nosed monkey (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus),</b> which is as large as a three-year old child, has a very long tail, and a fleshy nose longer than that of the biggest-nosed man. The further we went on the narrower and more winding the stream became; fallen trees sometimes blocked up our passage, and sometimes tangled branches and creepers met completely across it, and had to be cut away before we could get on. It took us two days to reach Semabang, and we hardly saw a bit of dry land all the way. In {{the latter part of the}} journey I could touch the bushes on each side for miles; and we were often delayed by the screw-pines (Pandanus), which grow abundantly in the water, falling across the stream. In other places dense rafts of floating grass completely filled up the channel, making our journey a constant succession of difficulties.|$|R
40|$|Research {{was aimed}} {{to study the}} {{behavior}} of Bekantan (<b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus)</b> in ex-situ conservation at PT Indocement Tarjun. The research of Bekantan’s behavior used several methodology. Firstly, it was observed several kinds and compositions of daily food which was consumed by Bekantan. Secondly, it was also observed the average daily behavior such as : the movement, the visual body condition and the growth in weight and height of Bekantan. The Observations were done for 2 months in 4 sample of the research. The results were compared to the Bekantan’s behavior which lived in its nature habitat. The results showed {{that there was no}} difference of its behavior in the study of food composition between the  Bekantan in ex-situ conservation compare to the Bekantan in its nature habitat. In average,  Bekantan in ex-situ conservation ate 76 % leaves’tip. It was also investigated that several kinds of food eaten by Bekantan in ex-situ conservation, such as : “balaran” leaf (Ipomea sp), “kacangan” leaf (Calopogonium caerulium), which are usually planted as cover crop, and “ketapang’s” tip of leaf (T. catappa). The daily activity of Bekantan’s behavior in ex-situ conservation was shown that there was no difference of its behavior compare to the Bekantan in its nature habitat. The Bekantan in its nature habit was mainly doing no activity, except resting and sleeping. The Bekantan in ex-situ conservation had more activity of movement. They moved, jumped, swinged, and walking using 2 or 4 feet. The conclusion of this research was found a similar eating habits of Bekantan in ex-situ conservation at PT Indocement Tarjun and Bekantan which lived in its habit. The investigation of food compositions showed that about 76 % of both Bekantan ate leaves. The leaves’s tip could get from both tips of tree leaf or vegetables. There was a changing of Bekantan’s behavior in term of its movement. Bekantan in ex-situ conservation moved with jumping, swinging, and walking with 2 or 4 feet, hanging, and propagation...|$|R
40|$|The {{other day}} I {{have been struck}} by the {{following}} phrase in a paper by Dr. G. Brandes, entitled: »Ueber die Nasenaffen”, Zeitschrift für Naturwissenschaften, 1901, p. 284 : »Es ist wohl zweifellos, dass der tibetanische und der »bornesische Nasenaffe zu einer Gattung zu vereinigen sind, »als deren wesentliche Charactere die mächtige Entwick»lung der Nasenmuskulatur und die schwach ausgebildeten »oder gar ganz fehlenden Nasenbeine zu gelten haben. Ich »werde danach von Rhinopithecus nasicus (Borneo) und roxellanae (Tibet) sprechen”. For reasons hereafter to explain the named monkeys cannot be united under the same generic title. We however will admit for a moment »they can”, than may be asked why Dr. Brandes did not accept the generic name » Nasalis having a priority of about sixty years over » Rhinopithecus”! Further may be asked why he excluded another Rhinopithecus, Rh. Bieti? The latter has been described and perfectly figured by A. Milne Edwards in »Bulletin du Museum d’Histoire naturelle, 1897 ” and »Nouvelles Archives du Museum d’Histoire naturelle, 1898 ”, as une nouvelle espèce du genre Rhinopithecus”, known as the »Singe des neiges” ou » Tchru tchra” by the inhabitants; it has been procured on tbe »versant occidental de la chaine séparant la vallée du Mékong de celle du fleuve Bleu dans les forêts”; it has a nose exactly like Roxellana 1) and like that species very short nasal bones. It seems that Rh. Bieti was an unknown species to Dr. Brandes. Further, the name nasicus is not correct, as another specific title larvatus was bestowed upon the Borneo-animal twenty years before, by its first describer; therefore the correct orthography should be: <b>Nasalis</b> <b>larvatus</b> from Borneo, <b>Nasalis</b> Roxellana from the continent and Nasalis Bieti too from the continent, if Dr. Brandes’ hypothesis could be accepted. The three species however cannot by any means be united in one genus, as the Bornean Proboscis-monkey differs from all other Semnopitheci by its having nasal bones much longer {{than in any other}} Semnopithecus! In the youngest skull of our Proboscis-monkeyseries the nasalia are a good deal longer than in the figures of the skulls of very old specimens of Roxellana and Bieti, figured in Milne Edwards’ papers; in the Bornean-species therefore the »Nasenbeine” are the inverse of »schwach ausgebildet”, as Dr. Brandes exhibited as base of his hypothesis; so that till now the Bornean-Monkey stands alone in the genus Nasalis, meanwhile the other two are to be united under the generic title Rhinopithecus...|$|R
