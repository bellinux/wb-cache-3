After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of blowbacking the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in bed with her mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. They sit {{on opposite sides of the}} door, and Naomi admits that she does <b>need</b> <b>somebody</b> to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's cat flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|E

[...] According to MSNBC, on July 17, 2007, Obama said, [...] "We <b>need</b> <b>somebody</b> who's got the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom.

2500|$|On 18 April 2008 the {{producer}} of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, Jon Naismith, announced that, owing to hospitalisation to repair an aortic aneurysm, Humphrey Lyttelton {{would be unable to}} record the scheduled shows and {{that they would have to}} be postponed. The final show of the 2008 Best of tour on 22 April would be presented by Rob Brydon. Following Lyttelton's death there was speculation that the series might be cancelled because replacing him would be extremely difficult if not impossible. In a eulogy in The Guardian Barry Cryer did not allude to the future of the programme but said that there's [...] "got to be an agonising reappraisal" [...] and that Lyttelton was the [...] "very hub of the show". Cryer, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden all ruled themselves out as hosts: Cryer did not think the programme would work if a panellist became chairman and it [...] "would <b>need</b> <b>somebody</b> of stature to be parachuted in". Jeremy Hardy also ruled himself out, saying [...] "Humph had big shoes to fill and I wouldn't do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Astley's {{relationship}} with British media deteriorated significantly {{after the release}} of Whenever You <b>Need</b> <b>Somebody,</b> with the media calling him a [...] "puppet" [...] of Stock Aitken Waterman, although [...] Astley had written five of his new album's tracks.
