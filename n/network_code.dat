When Unreal (the first {{installment}} of the Unreal series) was released in May 1998, it was well received by the press. However, it soon became apparent that the quality of the <b>network</b> <b>code</b> used for multiplayer matches was hampering the game's further success. In the months following Unreals release, improving the game's multiplayer part became the top priority of the development team. Epic Games started considering an official expansion pack intended to improve the <b>network</b> <b>code</b> while also featuring new maps and other gameplay elements.|$|E

The game was released publicly on July 7, 2015 for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows. Davis considered this serendipitous, as this moved the game out from a busy period of many major releases {{during the holiday season}} to the relatively quiet mid-year period, reducing the amount of competition from other titles. Further, the game on release was made part of Instant Game Collection on the PlayStation 4 and free to PlayStation Plus subscribers; within the week, Psyonix had seen more than 183,000 unique players, exceeding their server capacity and requiring them to improve on their <b>network</b> <b>code</b> to handle the influx of players. Davis estimated there were 6 million downloads of the game from this promotion, and considered this the [...] "best decision we ever made".|$|E

40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>coding</b> is a {{collection}} of techniques in which a node is allowed to combine, encode and send one or more packets as a single encoded packet instead of sending individually. It improves throughput, packet delivery ratio and efficiency of the system. The inherent broadcasting nature of wireless mediums helps us to adopt <b>network</b> <b>coding</b> very easily. At the same time, as it reduces the number of transmissions, it reduces the probability of various losses due to transmission impairments, channel contentions and route failures. This paper discusses various well known <b>network</b> <b>coding</b> schemes [...] <b>Network</b> <b>coding</b> is broadly classified into global and local <b>network</b> <b>coding.</b> <b>Network</b> <b>coding</b> is also classified into binary – Xor based and random linear <b>coding</b> based <b>network</b> <b>coding.</b> Further to these, based upon the applications, <b>Network</b> <b>coding</b> schemes are classified for unicast, multicast and broadcast applications.

40|$|Abstract—Cross-layer {{optimization}} including congestion con-trol, routing, {{and scheduling}} has shown dramatic throughput improvement over layered designs for wireless networks. In parallel, the paradigm-shifting <b>network</b> <b>coding</b> has empirically demonstrated substantial throughput improvement when coding operations are permitted at intermediate nodes and packets from different sessions are mixed. Designing <b>network</b> <b>codes</b> {{and the associated}} flow in <b>network</b> <b>coding</b> presents new challenges for cross-layer optimization for wireless multi-hop networks. This work shows that with a new flow-based characterization of pairwise intersession <b>network</b> <b>coding,</b> a joint optimal scheduling and rate-control algorithm can be implemented distributively. Optimal scheduling is computationally expensive to achieve even in a purely routing-based (without <b>network</b> <b>coding)</b> paradigm, let alone with <b>network</b> <b>coding.</b> Thus, in this paper, the impact of imperfect scheduling is studied, which shows that pairwise intersession <b>network</b> <b>coding</b> can improve the throughput of routing-based solutions regardless of whether perfect/imperfect scheduling is used. Both the deterministic and stochastic packet arrivals and departures are considered. This work shows {{for the first time}} a striking resemblance between pairwise intersession <b>network</b> <b>coding</b> and routing, and thus advocates extensions of routing-based wisdoms to their <b>network</b> <b>coding</b> counterpart.
