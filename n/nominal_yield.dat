40|$|During {{the past}} two decades of {{economic}} stagnation and persistent deflation in Japan, chronic fiscal deficits have led to elevated and rising ratios of government debt to nominal GDP. Nevertheless, long-term Japanese government bonds' (JGBs) <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> initially declined and have stayed remarkably low and stable since then. This is contrary to the received wisdom of the existing literature, which holds that higher government deficits and indebtedness shall exert upward pressures on government bonds' <b>nominal</b> <b>yields.</b> This paper seeks to understand the determinants of JGBs' <b>nominal</b> <b>yields.</b> It examines the relationship between JGBs' <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> and short-term interest rates and other relevant factors, such as low inflation and persistent deflationary pressures and tepid growth. Low short-term interest rates, induced by monetary policy, have been the main reason for JGBs' low <b>nominal</b> <b>yields.</b> It is also argued that Japan has monetary sovereignty, which gives the government of Japan the ability to meet its debt obligations. It enables the Bank of Japan to exert downward pressure on JGBs' <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> by allowing it to keep short-term interest rates low and to use other tools of monetary policy. The argument that current short-term interest rates and monetary policy are the primary drivers of long-term interest rates follows Keynes's (1930) insights...|$|R

In contrast to expected inflation, which mainly affects the wedge between real and <b>nominal</b> <b>yields,</b> inflation disagreement affects <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> predominantly through its impact on the real side of the economy. We show theoretically and empirically that inflation disagreement raises real and <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> and their volatilities. Inflation disagreement is positively related to consumers’ cross-sectional consumption growth volatility and trading in fixed income securities. Calibrating our model to disagreement, inflation, and yields reproduces the economically significant impact of inflation disagreement on yield curves...|$|R
40|$|I {{develop and}} {{estimate}} a {{general equilibrium model}} for the term structures of nominal and real interest rates in the UK that incorporates Markov-switching. The model allows for non-neutralities, nonlinear dynamics, and flexibility in {{the dynamics of the}} risk premia - features that are all present in the data. I use the model to assess how accurately the term structure reflects changing expectations of future yields and inflation. This analysis shows that the presence of time-varying risk premia make it very hard to accurately track changes in the expected path of real or <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> over horizons of less than five years. By contrast, variations in inflation expected over the next two to three years are very accurately reflected by changes in spread between real and <b>nominal</b> <b>yields,</b> or by changes in <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> alone. Over longer horizons, the term structures closely track changing expectations regarding future <b>nominal</b> and real <b>yields</b> but not future inflation.

Our favored model matches the quarterly inflation forecasts from surveys and uses the information in yields to produce the best monthly forecasts. Moreover, we restrict the distribution of the inflation Sharpe ratios to achieve economically reasonable estimates of the inflation risk premium and of the real rates. We find that the inflation risk premium (i) is positive on average, (ii) rises when the unemployment rate increases and (iii) when the level of interest rates decreases.

We use a one-factor model of the real term structure based on monthly observations on two-year, five-year and ten-year UK index-linked debt, and a two-factor model of the nominal term structure for the corresponding <b>nominal</b> <b>yields.</b> Our estimates show that the inflation risk premium contributes on average about 100 basis points to <b>nominal</b> <b>yields.</b> Since the exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) this has fallen to about 70 basis points.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} the term structures of nominal and real interest rates driven by state variables representing the short-term real interest rate, expected inflation, inflation’s central tendency, and four volatility factors that follow GARCH processes. We derive analytical solutions for <b>nominal</b> bond <b>yields,</b> yields on inflation-indexed bonds that have an indexation lag, and the term structure of expected inflation. Unlike prior studies, the model’s parameters are estimated using data on inflation swap rates, as well as <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> and survey forecasts of inflation. The volatility state variables fully determine bonds’ time-varying risk premia and allow for stochastic volatility and correlation between bond yields, yet they have small effects on the cross section of <b>nominal</b> <b>yields.</b> Allowing for time-varying volatility is particularly important for real interest rate and expected inflation processes, but long-horizon real and inflation risk premia are relatively stable.

This paper empirically investigates the determinants of changes in Indian government bonds' <b>nominal</b> <b>yields.</b> Changes in short-term interest rates, after controlling for other crucial variables such as changes in the rates of inflation and economic activity, take a lead role in driving changes in the <b>nominal</b> <b>yields</b> of Indian government bonds.

Specifically, the model accounts for deviations from the expectations hypothesis of interest rates, the upward sloping <b>nominal</b> <b>yield</b> curve, the downward sloping term structure of volatility and the predictive power of the yield spread. Real (nominal) rates are positively (negatively) correlated with consumption growth and the <b>nominal</b> <b>yield</b> spread predicts future real consumption growth, excess stock returns and inflation. The cyclical properties of nominal interest rates are shown to critically depend {{on the value of}} the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and on the correlation between consumption and inflation.
