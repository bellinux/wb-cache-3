40|$|Fissile {{materials}} {{in the form of}} aqueous homogeneous solutions are used during the chemical processing of nuclear fuel. In this form there exists the possibility of an accidental criticality of the solution. To determine the consequences of such accidents, computer models have been developed to simulate <b>nuclear</b> <b>excursions.</b> A one-region model and a multi-region model have been developed to simulate both power and pressure pulses. These models include a new radiolytic gas production model that tracks the number of radiolytic gas bubbles produced during an excursion. Also, an equation of state, which accounts for the production of inertial pressure due to a "lag" in thermal expansion and the creation of radiolytic gas bubbles, has been developed for both models. The multi-region model can account for the spatial distribution of the nuclear energy deposited in the solution and both axial and radial acceleration of the fuel material caused by the production of inertial pressure. Predicted power and pressure pulses have been compared with experimental data from the KEWB, CRAC, and SILENE experiments. The computer models have been very successful in predicting the magnitude of both power and pressure pulses.

40|$|The {{design of}} the {{gastight}} safety enclosure for {{a nuclear power plant}} depends on the estimate of the energy release during the warst credible accident postulated for the primary system. The potential sources of energy include <b>nuclear</b> <b>excursions,</b> chemical reactions of liquid·metal coolonts with oir, release of stored thermal energy from pressurized systems, and chemical reactions between reactor core materials and water. Same of the factors to be evaluated in designing a containment shell are: Vessel size and shape, static and dynamic loading, construction materials, supporting structure, protection of the shell from damage by effects of explosive energy releases, tightness requirements, and leakage testing procedures. In the majority of cases the vertical cylindrical steel shell is used as containment vessel for small (prototype-) plants and the spherical steel shell for large power plants. Representative examples are the cylindrical container enclosing the EBWR-plant and the spherical container enclosing the primary system of the Dresden nuclear power plant. - Alternatively, reactor systems can be enclosed in chambers loated in rock.

40|$|Since a {{fast reactor}} core with uranium-plutonium fuel {{is not in}} its most {{reactive}} configuration under operating conditions, redistribution of the core materials (fuel, steel, sodium) during a core disruptive accident (CDA) may lead to recriticalities {{and as a consequence}} to severe <b>nuclear</b> power <b>excursions.</b> The prevention, or at least the mitigation, of core disruption is therefore of the utmost importance. In the current paper, we analyze an innovative fast reactor concept developed within the CP-ESFR European project, focusing on the phenomena affecting the initiation and the transition phases of an unprotected loss of flow (ULOF) accident. Key phenomena for the initiation phase are coolant boiling onset and further voiding of the core that lead to a reactivity increase {{in the case of a}} positive void reactivity effect. Therefore, the first level of optimization involves the reduction, by design, of the positive void effect in order to avoid entering a severe accident. If the core disruption cannot be avoided, the accident enters into the transition phase, characterized by the progression of core melting and recriticalities due to fuel compaction. Dedicated features that enhance and guarantee a sufficient and timely fuel discharge are considered for the optimization of this phase...|$|R

All possible <b>nuclear</b> <b>excursions</b> are reviewed. The energy from any of these is insignificant compared to the stored energy in the water. The maximum credible accident is caused by the reactor running constantly at its maximum power of 10 Mw and through an extremely uniikely sequence of failures, csusing the temperature of the water in the primary and secondary systems to rise to saturation, whereupon a ruptare occurs releasing the stored energy of 7. 4 million Btu into the vapor container. If the reactor core melts during the accident, a maximum of 1. 5 x lO/sup 7 / c of activity is released into the vapor container. While it is highly improbable for a ruptare of the vapor container to occur except by sabotage or bombing, the hazards to the surrounding area are discussed in the event of such a rupture occurring simultaneously with the maximum credible accident. The SM- 1 has been in operation for about 3 years, during which time much operating experience was accumulated and nuclear and system data were obtained through both normal operations and the research and development programs conducted. These data are discussed in relation to their effect on the hazards evaluction of the SM- 1 and include core nuclear data, primary and secondary system thermal data, radiological safety, dose rates at various positions in the primary system both during operation and after shutdown and their effects on maintenance, experience with radioactive-waste disposal, area monitoring, experience with the use of trainees in plant operation, and plant modifications accomplished during this period. During 3 years of operation, SM- 1 has proved to be an extremely stable and safe system. No incidents occurred during this time that resulted in any significant injuries, radiation exposures or environmental contamination.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{consequences}} of a nuclear criticality accident in aqueous fissile solutions is necessary to design the processing equipment for such solutions. The data at the disposal of designers before 1967 was provided by actual critically accidents. In 1968, the Service d'Etudes de Criticite of the French Commissariat a L'Energie Atomique initiated a program of systematic experimental aqueous solution nuclear excursions which were initiated intentionally to obtain solution criticality accident data. This program was designated "Consequence Radiologiques d'un Accident de Criticite" (CRAC). Although not intended to study the evolution of a solution nuclear criticality accident, the Kinetic Experiment on Water Boiler (KEWB) demonstrated the dependence of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>excursion</b> on parameters such as solution temperature and radiolytic gas. Similarly, the CRAC program results indicated the excursion was governed by parameters such as the solution addition rate, initial neutron population, solute concentration, and thermal and radiolytic gas feedback. The energy deposited in a fissile solution is the sum of the energies contributed by the radiation sources. The majority of the energy is deposited by the fission fragments. One feature of the energy deposition is a commensurate increase in the system temperatures which affects the solution volume and thereby the neutron leakage probability. A second feature is the decomposition of the water molecule which results in release of H(, 2) and O(, 2) in the solution. Microbubbles are nucleated in the fissile solution by a localized thermal spike generated by a fission fragment. Initially, the microbubble contains a mixture of radiolytic gas and water vapor. Below the boiling point the vapor condenses quickly, leaving a gas microbubble. Unless the solution is supersaturated, the gas bubble will dissolve in a few microseconds. However, in a supersaturated solution the bubble will grow and produce negative feedback by increasing neutron leakage. The analysis for this study employs two mathematical models for the radiolytic gas feedback. One assumes the radiolytic gas concentration is a linear function of the energy release and the nucleation rate is a linear function of the power (Energy model). The other assumes a correlation between the system pressure and the radiolytic gas feedback (Pressure model). Both models have been incorporated into a space-independent kinetic computer code, MACKIN, while the pressure model was also incorporated into a space-dependent code, AZPAD, (Space-dependent model). The model incorporation provides a numerical tool with which to analyze a <b>nuclear</b> <b>excursion</b> in an aqueous fissile solution. The models have been successful in predicting the peak power, burst energy, and maximum system pressure for the first burst in both KEWB and CRAC experiments...|$|E
40|$|Five {{areas of}} {{potential}} accidents {{have been evaluated}} for the Argonaut-UTR reactors. They are: • insertion of excess reactivity • catastrophic rearrangement of the core • explosive chemical reaction • graphite fire • fuel-handling accident. A <b>nuclear</b> <b>excursion</b> resulting from the rapid insertion of the maximum available excess reactivity would produce only 12 MWs which is insufficient to cause fuel melting even with conservative assumptions. Although precise structural rearrangement of the core would create a potential hazard, {{it is simply not}} credible to assume that such an arrangement would result from the forces of an earthquake or other catastrophic event. Even damage to the fuel from falling debris or other objects is unlikely given the normal reactor structure. An explosion from a metal-water reaction could not occur because there is no credible source of sufficient energy to initiate the reaction. A graphite fire could conceivably create some damage to the reactor but not enough to melt any fuel or initiate a metal-water reaction. The only credible accident involving offsite doses was determined to be a fuel-handling accident which, given highly conservative assumptions, would produce a whole-body dose equivalent of 2 rem from noble gas immersion and a lifetime dose equivalent commitment to the thyroid of 43 rem from radioiodines...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} preliminary {{analysis of}} a volcanic tuff repository containing a combination of low enrichment commercial spent nuclear fuels (SNF) and DOE-owned SNF packages. These SNFs were analyzed {{with respect to their}} criticality risks. Disposal of SNF packages containing significant fissile mass within a geologic repository must comply with current regulations relative to criticality safety during transportation and handling within operational facilities. However, once the repository is closed, the double contingency credits for criticality safety are subject to unremediable degradation, (e. g., water intrusion, continued presence of neutron absorbers in proximity to fissile material, and fissile material reconfiguration). The work presented in this paper focused on two attributes of criticality in a volcanic tuff repository for near-field and far-field scenarios: (1) scenario conditions necessary to have a criticality, and (2) consequences of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>excursion</b> that are components of risk. All criticality consequences are dependent upon eventual water intrusion into the repository and subsequent breach of the disposal package. Key criticality parameters necessary for a critical assembly are: (1) adequate thermal fissile mass, (2) adequate concentration of fissile material, (3) separation of neutron poison from fissile materials, and (4) sufficient neutron moderation (expressed in units of moderator to fissile atom ratios). Key results from this study indicated that the total energies released during a single excursion are minimal (comparable to those released in previous solution accidents), and the maximum frequency of occurrence is bounded by the saturation and temperature recycle times, thus resulting in small criticality risks...|$|E

Phases of QCD Exploring the QCD phase diagram is undoubtedly one of the great challenges in the physics of strong interactions. At temperatures exceeding TC ≃ ΛQCD ∼ 0. 2 GeV, one expects a plasma of quarks and gluons released from their confining forces. At T < TC and at moderate baryon densities, the relevant QCD degrees of freedom are color-singlet hadrons. Chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. The vacuum is a condensate of scalar quark-antiquark pairs. Pions act as Goldstone bosons.

40|$|Experiments using a plastic-moderated {{assembly}} as a {{radiation source}} are described, and the hazards attendant to these experiments are evaluated. The critical assembly, designated Battelle's Plastic Reactor Facility, is {{constructed in the}} form of a cube. A portion of the plastic and fuel will be removed from the center of this reactor to provide a radiation environment for exposing fission-chamber devices. This central void region will approximate a flux trap in which a bigh neutron-to-gamma ratio is expected. The fuel-element assemblies are composed of strips of aluminum and Teflon-coated uranium sandwiched with plastic and encased in aluminum boxes. One portion of the core is on a movable table, while the other part is on a fixed table. The core is assembled remotely by driving the movable table against the fixed table. Primary control and safety of the assembly are achieved by insenting or withdrawing regulating and safety elements and by increasing or decreasing the distance between the two core halves. For safety, the maximum normal rate of reactivity addition has been limited to 0. 04 % DELTA k/k per sec for control-element withdrawal and table closure. The system is interlocked so that only one control element can be withdrawn at a time and so that the movable table and elements cannot be moved simultaneously. In addition, criticality cannot be reached by only moving the tables together. No experiments with the Plastic Reactor Facility are planned since it will serve only as a source of radiation operating at a constant power level. Consequently, the hazards of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>excursion</b> are minimized. However, the safety aspects of the operations and possible power excursions have been analyzed. The analysis indicates that these operations present no significant hazard to the public persons or operating staff. (auth...|$|E
