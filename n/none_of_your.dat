25|$|In 1988, Morrissey {{launched}} his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all {{did well in}} the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his subsequent albums, Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted, also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he embarked on a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, and World Peace Is <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Business. He released his autobiography in 2013, followed by his first novel in 2015. His eleventh solo album, Low in High School, is set {{to be released in}} November 2017.|$|E

The newspaper characterised the comments as [...] "extremist and offensive" [...] and noted that the forum contained many homophobic and racist statements from UKIP members.

500|$|Late in September, a British convoy {{consisting}} of 13 battered ships under Captain Sir James Saumarez appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, {{they were in}} urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege. Nevertheless, Saumarez met {{with representatives of the}} Maltese and on 25 September, sent an offer of truce to Vaubois on their behalf. Vaubois replied [...] "Vous avez, sans doute, oublié que des Français sont dans la place. Le sort des habitans [...] ne vous regarde pointe.

Unable to persuade the French to give in, Saumarez instead provided the Maltese forces with 1,200 muskets with which to continue the siege.

500|$|The Oxford English Dictionary {{defines the}} word cunt as [...] "The female {{external}} genital organs" [...] and notes [...] "Its currency is restricted {{in the manner}} of other taboo-words: see the small-type note s.v.

[...] In The Miller's Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer writes [...] "And prively he caughte hire by the queynte" [...] (and intimately he caught her by her crotch), and Philotus (1603) mentions [...] "put doun thy hand and graip hir cunt." [...] Gradually though the word became used more as the obscenity it is generally considered to be today. [...] In John Garfield's Wandring Whore II (1660) the word is applied to a woman, specifically a whore—"this is <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> pittiful Sneakesbyes and Raskalls that will offer a sturdy C— but eighteen pence or two shillings, and repent of the business afterwards". [...] Francis Grose's A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue (1785) lists the word as [...] "C**t.

2500|$|This {{statistic}} {{was somewhat}} disputed in a 2006 article about {{poverty in the}} slums of Haiti (written for the Red Cross), wherein ICRC officer Didier Revol wrote, [...] "Such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically {{because of the fact}} that the average Haitian and Haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily. The disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are; in the Haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question. For various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter. For some it is because 'it's <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> business', for others, they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them".|$|E

[...] Alia becomes possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who sets out to destroy the Atreides empire. [...] Recognizing this, Idaho remains loyal to the Atreides, and flees to the desert to protect the children. [...] In order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen {{opposition}} to Alia's rule, Duncan kills Javid, Alia's secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr.

[...] and [...] "You have no immortality! <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> descendents carry your blood!"

2500|$|During {{his radio}} show on March 22, 1994, Stern {{announced}} his candidacy for Governor of New York under the Libertarian Party ticket, challenging Mario Cuomo for re-election. Stern planned to reinstate the death penalty, remove highway tolls to improve traffic flow, and limit road work to graveyard shifts hours. Stern announced that once those three goals were accomplished, he would resign and pass the governorship to his lieutenant. At the party's nomination convention on April 23, Stern won the required two-thirds majority on the first ballot, receiving 287 of the 381 votes cast; James Ostrowski finished second with 34 votes. To place {{his name on the}} final ballot, Stern was obliged to state his home address and complete a financial disclosure form under the Ethics in Government Act. Stern applied for an injunction as he wished to avoid stating his income; the request was denied by a judge on August 2. Stern withdrew his candidacy in an on-air press conference two days later, saying: [...] "I spend 25 hours a week telling you all the most intimate details of my life ... One fact I've never revealed is how much I make and how much money I have ... it's <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> business." [...] In the gubernatorial election on November 8, Cuomo was defeated by George Pataki, whom Stern backed. In August 1995, Pataki signed a bill which limited construction on state roads to night hours in New York City and Long Island, which was named the [...] "Howard Stern Bill" [...] in honor of Stern originally proposing the plan. Stern has since felt [...] "firmly opposed" [...] to the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has made numerous brief {{returns to the}} serial as a guest character. In 1993, she was featured in a special week of episodes, filmed on-location in Paris, France, where Frank discovered, to his horror, that Diane was pregnant with an unknown foreign man's baby. In June 1994, Diane returned to Walford {{as part of a}} storyline involving her father's disappearance. In 1997, another week's worth of episodes set in Paris reunited Ricky and Diane. Shortly after, the character returned to the soap's setting of Walford, but Lawrence reportedly quit weeks after making her comeback. She had since commented on her reasons for quitting so soon: [...] "Going back to EastEnders was like going back to school and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> friends are there. I was [...] there with people like Nick Berry (Simon Wicks) and Letitia Dean (Sharon Watts) and they'd all gone. One of the young actors, who will remain nameless, made me a coffee and started telling me all about what it was like. He had no idea I'd been in the soap before." [...] In addition, Lawrence was suffering physically as she was still getting over injuries she sustained from a car accident and was forced to remove a neck brace for filming purposes. On-screen, the character departed to travel with her musician boyfriend, abandoning her young son in her brother's care. Bosses at EastEnders had reportedly been keen for Lawrence to remain on the show, as they were hoping for an on-screen reunion of the Butcher family; Mike Reid had agreed to reprise his role as Frank, though Diane departed before his reintroduction.|$|E
