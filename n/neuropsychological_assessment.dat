The aim is to diagnose and detect brain degenerative disorders {{as early as possible}} to help stroke survivors obtain early treatment benefits before significant mental impairment occurs. <b>Neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> are widely used to assess cognitive decline following a stroke diagnosis. This study reviews the function of the available <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> in the {{early detection}} of PSD, particularly vascular dementia (VaD). The review starts from cognitive impairment and dementia prevalence, followed by PSD types and the cognitive spectrum. Finally, the most usable <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> to detect VaD were identified. This study was performed through a PubMed and ScienceDirect database search spanning the last 10 years with the following keywords: “post-stroke”; “dementia”; “neuro-psychological”; and “assessments”. This study focuses on assessing VaD patients {{on the basis of their}} stroke risk factors and cognitive function within the first 3 months after stroke onset. The search strategy yielded 535 articles. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, only five articles were considered. A manual search was performed and yielded 14 articles. Twelve articles were included in the study design and seven articles were associated with early dementia detection.

[...] The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli. [...] If so, the next {{question is whether the}} patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands. [...] If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time.

In particular they bring a psychological viewpoint to treatment, to understand how such illness and injury may affect and be affected by psychological factors. They also can offer an opinion as to whether a person is demonstrating difficulties due to brain pathology or as a consequence of an emotional or another (potentially) reversible cause or both. [...] For example, a test might show that both patients X and Y are unable to name items that they have been previously exposed to within the past 20 minutes (indicating possible dementia). [...] If patient Y can name some of them with further prompting (e.g. given a categorical clue such as being told that the item they could not name is a fruit), this allows a more specific diagnosis than simply dementia (Y appears to have the vascular type which is due to brain pathology but is usually at least somewhat reversible).

40|$|Many {{theories}} {{addressing the}} complex anxiety-cognition interaction are built upon {{the notion that}} working memory is vulnerable {{to the effects of}} anxiety. However, most research has utilised studies of trait anxiety which does not allow direct inferences to be made between affect and cognitive performance, or exclude confounds such as pre-existing individual differences. As a result, a systematic review was undertaken to explore the neuropsychological consequences of experimentally-induced state anxiety on working memory. Twenty eight studies were included in the review grouped according to the nature of anxiety induced (anxious-apprehensionor anxious-arousal) and by working memory component (verbal, visuospatial, or executive). This review found evidence of anxiety adversely affecting working memory and support for specific theories. The review highlighted the potential impact of anxiety on <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> in clinical settings, as well as the need to test these theories using prolonged anxiety-induction procedures with standardised measures of anxiety and working memory. The empirical paper explored the effects of experimentally-induced anxiety on clinical <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> of working memory. Anxiety was induced using the inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO 2), which reliably elicits prolonged states of anxiety. Thirty participants were included in the study, undertaking neuropsychological tests during the inhalation of both normal air and CO 2 across two testing sessions using a counterbalanced design. The mood manipulation was successful and verified using psychological and physiological measures. Results suggested that anxiety negatively affected spatial and verbal working memory, although low load verbal tasks were unaffected. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed with regards to the effect of state anxiety on clinical <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> and the management of anxiety in light of these cognitive deficits. Future research should include a broader spectrum of working memory tasks of varying cognitive load to further elucidate how anxiety may interact with cognition...|$|R

Currently, efforts are being exerted to assess stroke effects on the brain, particularly in the early stages. Numerous <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> are being used to evaluate and differentiate cognitive {{impairment and}} dementia following stroke. This article focuses on the role of available <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> in detection of dementia and memory loss after stroke.

The proposed PSMA is expected to assess different types of memory functionalities that are related to different parts of the brain according to stroke location.

40|$|<b>Neuropsychological</b> <b>assessments</b> of {{cognitive}} dysfunction in cerebrovascular illness commonly target basic cognitive functions involving aspects of memory, attention, language, praxis, and number processing. Here, I highlight the clinical importance of often-neglected social cognition functions. These functions recruit a widely distributed neural network, making them vulnerable in most cerebrovascular diseases. Sociocognitive deficits underlie {{most of the}} problematic social conduct observed in patients and are associated with more negative clinical outcomes (compared to nonsocial cognitive deficits). In clinical settings, social cognition deficits are normally gleaned from collateral information from caregivers or from indirect inferences made from patients’ performance on standard nonsocial cognitive tests. Information from these sources is however inadequate. I discuss key social cognition functions, focusing initially on deficits in emotion perception and theory of mind, two areas that have gained sizeable attention in neuroscientific research, and then extend the discussion into relatively new, less covered but crucial functions involving empathic behaviour, social awareness, social judgements, and social decision making. These functions are frequently impaired following neurological change.
