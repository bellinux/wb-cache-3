500|$|Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from colitis-X, {{a disease}} of unknown origin that can kill rapidly and without warning. It {{infected}} many of Pollard's horses; of those affected only three survived. Heartbroken, Pollard sold his remaining stock and {{did not return to}} the Quarter Horse business for 15years. He said later that [...] "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> still feel the sadness of losing those horses." [...] Another time, Pollard remarked that [...] "Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse. I certainly had one in Lightning Bar." ...|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 2016, {{the day of}} the album's {{physical}} release, participating record shops {{around the}} world held a promotional event, [...] "Live From a Moon Shaped Pool". The event featured a [...] "day-long" [...] audio stream of playlists curated by Radiohead and a recording of their recent performance at the London Roundhouse, along with competitions, artwork, and other activities. A participating shop in Istanbul closed following an attack by a gang angered by customers drinking beer and playing music during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fast. Radiohead released a statement saying: [...] "Our hearts go out to those attacked tonight ... We hope that some day {{we will be able to}} look back on such acts of violent intolerance as things of the ancient past. For <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only offer our fans in Istanbul our love and support." ...|$|E

500|$|Machinima {{has been}} used in music videos, of which the first {{documented}} example is Ken Thain's 2002 [...] "Rebel vs. Thug", made in collaboration with Chuck D. For this, Thain used Quake2Max, a modification of Quake II that provided cel-shaded animation. The following year, Tommy Pallotta directed [...] "In the Waiting Line" [...] for the British group Zero 7. He told Computer Graphics World, [...] "It probably would have been quicker to do the film in a 3D animated program. But <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> reuse the assets in an improvisational way." [...] Scenes of the game Postal 2 {{can be seen in the}} music video of the Black Eyed Peas single [...] "Where Is the Love?". In television, MTV features video game characters on its show Video Mods. Among World of Warcraft players, dance and music videos became popular after dancing animations were discovered in the game.|$|E
500|$|Washington's loss at Philadelphia {{prompted}} {{some members}} of Congress to consider removing Washington from command. This movement termed the Conway Cabal, failed after Washington's supporters rallied behind him. Biographer Alden relates, [...] "it was inevitable that the defeats of Washington's forces and the concurrent victory of the forces in upper New York should be compared." [...] The zealous admiration of Washington indeed inevitably waned. John Adams was never {{a fan of the}} southern delegation to the Continental Congress, and he wrote that [...] "Congress will appoint a thanksgiving; and one cause of it ought to be that the glory of turning the tide of arms is not immediately due to the commander-in-chief nor to southern troops. If it had been, idolatry and adulation would have been unbounded.... <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> allow a certain citizen to be wise, virtuous, and good, without thinking him a deity or a savior." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the case, {{political}} commentator {{and columnist}} Arianna Huffington wrote, [...] "If {{you were to}} get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get back to real news. But we never do." [...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear {{to be focused on}} the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E

500|$|Early in the tour, Vicious {{wandered off}} from his Holiday Inn in Memphis, Tennessee, looking for drugs. He {{was found in a}} {{hospital}} with the words [...] "Gimme a fix" [...] on his chest; he had written them with a marker pen. During a concert in San Antonio, Texas, Vicious called the crowd [...] "a bunch of faggots", before striking an audience member across the head with his bass guitar. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he received simulated oral sex on stage, later declaring [...] "that's the kind of girl I like". Suffering from heroin withdrawal during a show in Dallas, Texas, he spat blood at a woman who had climbed onstage and punched him in the face. He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat various injuries. Offstage he is said to have kicked a female photographer, attacked a security guard, and eventually challenged one of his own bodyguards to a fight—beaten up, he is reported to have exclaimed, [...] "I like you. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be friends." ...|$|E
500|$|Kunzang Choden {{also made}} her Olympic debut at the 2012 games. She {{qualified}} for the 10 metre air rifle event after receiving a wild card from the Tripartite Commission. Before the games Choden said that, [...] "Bhutan is just a small country of just 700,000. There {{is a lot of}} pressure on us but we must be realistic about our chances. We just want to do well." [...] Choden spent time in Germany and Bangladesh preparing for the games. On July 28 Choden competed in the qualification round of her event. She finished 56th out of 56 athletes with a score of 381 points. She scored 18 points less the two equal highest scoring athlete, Sylwia Bogacka of Poland and Yi Siling of China. Choden scored 16 points less than Czech Kateřina Emmons who was the lowest scoring qualifier for the final and therefore her competition ended at the qualifying round. In an interview with Reuters after the games Choden said: [...] "I really enjoyed it. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> see how hard we need to work to be really good." ...|$|E

Pete congratulates Danny on his Juno Award nomination for his Canadian pump-up song for the National Hockey League team, the Ottawa Senators. Danny replies, [...] "It's an honor to be nominated in the same category as Sir Dave Coulier", the latter is an American actor. Liz imitates singer-songwriter Christopher Cross while singing [...] "All my days I've been waiting, for you to come back home. Moonlight of New York City", after revealing that she hoped to end up with Floyd one day and Cross would sing a romantic song about them. This song would be extended on the 30 Rock Original Television Soundtrack by Cross himself. Liz makes reference to the fact that once, on television, one could not say the word [...] "crap", but [...] "then they let that slide and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> say whatever we want." [...] She and Jack exchange the words, [...] "Douchebag", [...] "asswipe", and [...] "Anal rot", as examples. Later, Liz tells Jack, [...] "I don't care. I'll start my own group. Rejection from society is what created the X-Men", which references the comic book superhero team, the X-Men, who are rejected from society due to their mutant special powers.|$|E

500|$|On November 11, 2004, it was {{reported}} that a number of the inflatables had been stolen from Burger King roofs nationwide. Burger King chief marketing officer Russ Klein said, [...] "As to the motives behind these apparent 'spongenappings', we can only speculate. We did receive one ransom note related to an inflatable SpongeBob disappearance in Minnesota." [...] The chain offered a year's supply of Whopper sandwiches as a reward for information leading to the return of inflatables stolen in November. One was found attached to a railing at the football-field 50-yard line at an Iowa college, and another under a bed in Virginia. A ransom note was found for a third: [...] "We have SpongeBob. Give us 10 Krabby Patties, fries, and milkshakes." [...] Steven Simon and Conrad (C.J.) Mercure Jr. were arrested after stealing an inflatable from a Burger King in St. Mary's County, Maryland. While facing up to 18 months in jail and a $500 fine, Simon and Mercure said they were proud of what they did; Simon said, [...] "Once we got caught by the police, we were like, <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> tell everybody." [...] The following year Burger King took [...] "extra security precautions", when Stormtroopers from George Lucas' Star Wars guarded the delivery of Star Wars toys to a Burger King in North Hollywood.|$|E
