25|$|Smaragd: The ripest wines {{that must}} contain at least 12.5% APV. The maximum {{residual}} sugar level for these wines is 9 g/l. This designation {{was first used}} in 1986, right after the diethylene glycol scandal and was intended to denote the highest quality level of Wachau wines. All grapes destined for this designation must attain at least 18.5°KMW and all finished wine must be sealed with a long <b>natural</b> <b>cork</b> that is at least 49mm long and branded with vintage year, since 2007 also screwcaps are allowed. The wines have to be aged in bottle and not released till after May 1 following harvest though some producers will age their inventory longer. Smaragd wines {{tend to be the}} most sought after and critically acclaimed Wachau wines with well made examples from favorable vintages having the potential to age for more than 20 years. The symbol for this class is an emerald lizard that can found sunning itself on the stone terraces along the Danube.|$|E

40|$|International audienceData {{related to}} the {{comparison}} of the mechanical properties of the different stoppers used in the wine industry are scarce. This study aims at comparing the effect of hydration (from 0 to 100 % relative humidity at 25 A degrees C) on the mechanical properties of four widely used types of stoppers: <b>natural</b> <b>corks,</b> agglomerated corks, technical stoppers and synthetic (co-extruded) stoppers. For both <b>natural</b> and agglomerated <b>corks,</b> the Young's modulus was significantly and similarly affected by hydration, with a constant plateau value up to 50 % relative humidity (RH) and a mean value around 22 and 14 MPa, respectively. For higher RH, the increase in water content leads to {{a decrease in the}} material rigidity (Young's modulus < 10 MPa), which is attributed to water clusters formation between polymer chains. Technical stoppers revealed a similar profile, but with a much smaller impact of the water content and with overall lower Young's moduli values, around 5 MPa, throughout the RH range. The stiffness of synthetic closures was not affected by hydration, in agreement with the hydrophobic behavior of polyethylene. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis allowed us to identify a glass transition temperature (T (g)) in cork (around 0 A degrees C), and another one in agglomerated cork and technical stoppers (close to - 45 A degrees C, corresponding to additives). All together, {{for the first time the}} data highlight the comparative mechanical properties of such materials of the wine industry, and the progressive loss of the "cork-like" behavior of cork composites when other components are mixed with cork...|$|R

40|$|This review work is {{an update}} of a {{previous}} work reporting the new cork based materials and new applications of cork based materials. Cork is a material which {{has been used for}} multiple applications. The most known uses of cork are in stoppers (<b>natural</b> and agglomerated <b>cork)</b> for alcoholic beverages, classic floor covering with composite cork tiles (made by the binding of cork particles with different binders), and thermal/acoustic/vibration insulation with expanded corkboard in buildings and some other industrial fields. Many recent developments have been made leading to new cork based materials. Most of these newly developed cork materials are not yet on the market, but they represent new possibilities for engineers, architects, designers and other professionals which must be known and considered, potentially leading to their industrialization. This paper is a review covering the last five years of innovative cork materials and applications also mentioning previous work not reported before...|$|R

5000|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{a number}} of wine brands have {{switched}} to alternative wine closures such as plastic stoppers, screw caps, or other closures. During 1972 {{more than half of}} the Australian bottled wine went bad due to corking. A great deal of anger and suspicion was directed at Portuguese and Spanish cork suppliers who were suspected of deliberately supplying bad cork to non-EEC wine makers to help prevent cheap imports. Cheaper wine makers developed the aluminium [...] "Spelvin" [...] cap with a polypropylene stopper wad. More expensive wines and carbonated varieties continued to use cork, although much closer attention was paid to the quality. Even so, some high premium makers prefer the Spelvin as it is a guarantee that the wine will be good even after many decades of ageing. Some consumers may have conceptions about screw caps being representative of lower quality wines, due to their cheaper price; however, in Australia, for example, much of the non-sparkling wine production now uses these Spelvin caps as a cork alternative, although some have recently switched back to cork citing issues using screw caps. These alternatives to cork have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, screwtops are generally considered to offer a trichloroanisole (TCA) free seal, but they also reduce the oxygen transfer rate between the bottle and the atmosphere to almost zero, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the wine. TCA is the main documented cause of cork taint in wine. However, some in the wine industry say <b>natural</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers are important because they allow oxygen to interact with wine for proper aging, and are best suited for wines purchased with the intent to age. Stoppers which resemble <b>natural</b> <b>cork</b> very closely can be made by isolating the suberin component of the cork from the undesirable lignin, mixing it with the same substance used for contact lenses and an adhesive, and molding it into a standardized product, free of TCA or other undesirable substances. [...] Composite corks with real cork veneers are used in cheaper wines.|$|E
