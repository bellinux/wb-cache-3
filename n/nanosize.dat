The function of the CPPs are to deliver the cargo into cells, a process that commonly occurs through endocytosis with the cargo delivered to delivery vectors for use in research and medicine.

50|$|Through a mechanochemical {{reaction}} process, β-C3N4 can be synthesized. This {{method is}} achieved by ball milling high purity graphite powders down to an amorphous nanoscale size while under an argon atmosphere, then the argon is purged and the graphite powders are introduced to an NH3 gas atmosphere, which after high energy ball milling, {{has been found to}} form a nanosized flake-like structure of β-C3N4. During milling, fracture and welding of the reactants and graphite powder particles occur repeatedly from ball/powder collisions. Plastic deformation of the graphite powder particles occur due to the shear bands decomposing into sub-grains that are separated by low-angle grain boundaries, further milling decreases the sub-grain size until <b>nanosize</b> sub-grains form. The high pressure and intense motion promotes catalytic dissociation of NH3 molecules into monatomic nitrogen on the fractured surface of the carbon. Nanosized carbon powders act substantially different from its bulk material as a result of particle dimension and surface area, causing the nanosized carbon to easily react with the free nitrogen atoms, forming β-C3N4 powder.|$|E

50|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{is another}} type of nanomaterial which has attracted {{a lot of interest}} for its potential as being building blocks for bottom-up applications. They have excellent mechanical, electrical,and thermal properties and can be fabricated {{to a wide range of}} nanoscale diameters, making them attractive and appropriate for the developments of electronic and mechanical devices. They demonstrate metal-like properties and are able to act as remarkable conductors.However, there are several areas where peptides has advantages over CNTs. As mentioned in the background section, one advantage that peptides has over carbon as <b>nanosize</b> building blocks is that they have almost limitless chemical functionality compared with the very chemical interactions that carbons can perform due to their nonreactiveness. Furthermore, CNTs exhibits strong hydrophobicity which results in a tendency to clump in aqueous solutions and therefore has limited solubility; their electrical properties are also affected by humidity, and the presence of oxygen, N2O and NH3. It is also difficult for to produce CNTs with uniform properties and this pose serous drawbacks as for commercial purposes the reproducibility of precise structural properties is a key concern. Lastly, CNTs are expensive with prices in the range of hundreds of dollars per gram, rendering most applications of them commercially unviable.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{characteristic}} of SPS {{is that the}} pulsed DC current directly passes through the graphite die, {{as well as the}} powder compact, in case of conductive samples. Joule heating has been found to play a dominant role in the densification of powder compacts, which results in achieving near theoretical density at lower sintering temperature compared to conventional sintering techniques. The heat generation is internal, in contrast to the conventional hot pressing, where the heat is provided by external heating elements. This facilitates a very high heating or cooling rate (up to 1000 K/min), hence the sintering process generally is very fast (within a few minutes). The general speed of the process ensures it has the potential of densifying powders with <b>nanosize</b> or nanostructure while avoiding coarsening which accompanies standard densification routes. This has made SPS a good method for preparation of ceramics based on nanoparticles with enhanced piezoelectric, thermoelectric, optical [...] or biomedical [...] properties. SPS is also used for sintering of Carbon Nanotubes [...] for development of field electron emission electrodes. While the term [...] "spark plasma sintering" [...] is commonly used, the term is misleading since neither a spark nor a plasma is present in the process.

5000|$|VANTAs act as {{forests of}} {{molecular}} wires to allow electrical {{communication between the}} underlying electrode and a biological entity. The main advantages of VANTAs are the <b>nanosize</b> of the CNT-sensing element and the corresponding small amount of material required for a detectable response. The well-aligned CNT arrays have been employed to work as ribonucleic acid (RNA) sensors, enzymes sensors, DNA sensors, and even protein sensors. Similar VANTAs of MWNTs, grown on platinum substrates, are useful for amperometric electrodes where the oxygenated or functionalized open-ends of nanotubes are used for the immobilization of biological species, while the platinum substrate provides the signal transduction. To increase the selectivity and sensitivity of amperometric biosensors, artificial mediators and permselective coatings are often used in the biosensor fabrication. Artificial mediators are used to shuttle electrons between the enzyme and the electrode to allow operation at low potentials.Gooding et al. demonstrated that shortened SWNTs can be aligned normal to an electrode by self-assembly and act as molecular wires to allow electrical communication between the underlying electrode and redox proteins covalently attached {{to the ends of}} the SWNTs. [...] The high rate of electron transfer through the nanotubes to redox proteins is clearly demonstrated by the similarity in the rate constant for electron transfer to MP-11 regardless of whether SWNTs are present or not.|$|E
