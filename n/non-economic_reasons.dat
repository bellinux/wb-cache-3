50|$|While {{participation}} in the informal sector can be stigmatized, many workers engage in informal ventures by choice, for either economic or <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons.</b> Economic motivations include the ability to evade taxes, the freedom to circumvent regulations and licensing requirements, {{and the capacity to}} maintain certain government benefits. A study of informal workers in Costa Rica illustrated other economic reasons for staying in the informal sector, as well as non-economic factors. First, they felt they would earn more money through their informal sector work than at a job in the formal economy. Second, even if workers made less money, working in the informal sector offered them more independence, the chance to select their own hours, the opportunity to work outside and near friends, etc. While jobs in the formal economy might bring more security and regularity, or even pay better, the combination of monetary and psychological rewards from working in the informal sector proves appealing for many workers.|$|E
5000|$|Italians {{have been}} {{arriving}} in Australia {{in a limited}} number since before the first fleet. Two individuals of Italian descent served onboard the Endeavour when James Cook arrived in Australia in 1770. Giuseppe Tuzi was among the convicts transported to Australia by the British in the First Fleet. Another early notable arrival, for his participation in Australian politics, was Raffaello Carboni who in 1853 participated with other miners in the uprising of Eureka Stockade and wrote the only complete eye-witness account of the uprising. Nevertheless, it is only since 1869 that the country witnessed {{the arrival of a}} number of educated individuals who had left Italy for <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons,</b> such as missionaries, musicians, artists, professionals and businesspeople [...] This migration of northern Italian middle class professionals to Australia was spurred by the persecution from Austrian authorities - who controlled most of the northern regions of Italy until 1860 - especially after the failure of the revolts in many European cities in the 1840s and 1850s. As stated by D'Aprano in his work on the first Italian migrants in Victoria: We find some Italian artisans in Melbourne and other colonies already in the 1840s, many of whom had participated in the defeated revolts against the despotic rulers of Modena, Naples, Venice, Milan, Bologna, Rome and other cities. They came to Australia to seek a better and more efficient life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This study examined the migration patterns and motivations of recent graduates from Scottish higher education. Increasing the retention of these predominantly young people is important {{at a time when}} Scotland's population is both declining and ageing, and in light of the Scottish Executive's ambitions to attract and retain more highly qualified people. Scotland is very successful in retaining graduates who lived in Scotland prior to commencing their studies, but much less successful in retaining those who came to Scotland to study from elsewhere. Little is known, however, about graduates' motivations for making migration decisions. The study aimed to help fill this knowledge gap and inform future policy to improve the retention of these highly skilled people. One particular cohort was investigated: year 2000 first degree graduates from the University of Edinburgh. Two phases of primary research were conducted, generating quantitative and qualitative data. A postal survey, conducted in 2005, established basic information on respondents' background, employment and migration history, primary motivations for migration, and perspectives on possible future migration, together with demographic and educational data. A stratified sample of 80 survey respondents were then interviewed, divided into four groups determined by {{whether or not they were}} domiciled in Scotland prior to attending university, and whether or not they were currently domiciled in Scotland. These interviews aimed to give a more detailed understanding of the relative influence of, and interaction between, economic and <b>non-economic</b> factors as <b>reasons</b> behind graduate migration decisions. Overall, the research aimed to identify the kind of graduates who choose to stay in or leave Scotland, and the reasons which underlie these decisions. This dataset includes the quantitative survey data only; the qualitative interview data have not been deposited. Main Topics : Topics covered include respondents' migration history (primary place of residence during the three years before commencement of their undergraduate degree); their location at the time of the survey (summer 2005); their location approximately six months after graduation, in January 2001; any additional locations of residence (exceeding three months) between 2001 and 2005. Information concerning respondents' current employment status, and their status in 2001 was also collected, and on primary motivations for migration at the time of graduation, and the factors deemed important when making decisions about where to live and work at the time of the survey. For those not living in Scotland at the time of the survey, perspectives on possible future return migration to Scotland were recorded. In addition, demographic data (gender, age, marital status, dependent children, social class background, ethnicity) and educational data (type of school attended, subject area and class of degree, postgraduate qualifications obtained or being pursued) were also collected. <br...|$|R

The {{study has been}} conducted by taking landless (group I) and landed (group II) respondents. The Garatte ranking {{of the causes of}} migration has revealed that of the ten push factors and ten pull factors (both economic and non-economic), lack of continuous employment at place of origin is at the first rank with mean score of 77 and 78 per cent for group I and group II, respectively, followed by low wages at place of origin and economic condition of the family. On the pull side also, economic reasons, viz. availability of job at destination has achieved the first rank with mean score of 75 for group I and 74 for group II, followed by hope of getting a job and higher wages. In the case of <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons,</b> surplus labour availability at places of origin has received maximum scoring on the push side and skill development on the pull side. The study has concluded that though both economic and <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons</b> are responsible for migration of agricultural labourers, economic reasons are stronger. Not only that, push forces of migration have been identified more strong than pull forces in catalyzing migration.

The degree to which economic and non-economic objectives harmonise with one another without government interference, however, obviously varies a good deal according to time and place.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} assesses U. S. presidents' {{incentives for}} diversionary war. The political {{benefits of the}} use of force were measured and compared to the benefits of other dramatic foreign policy activities. Gains from force were modest, not unique, and discounted in many circumstances of political need. Statistical tests measured the changes in presidential approval ratings following uses of force, major diplomatic events, presidential speeches, and foreign travel by presidents, in the period 1953 - 2000. Historical sources and newspaper archives were used to identify and characterize uses of force and diplomatic events. Uses of force provide only modest and short-lived approval gains (average 6 % increase with 3 month half life for major uses). Approval changes were greater with more media coverage, Congressional support, or popular goals (e. g., protecting American lives, not humanitarian intervention). Approval gains were higher during recessions, but losses occurred when prior approval was low for <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons</b> (e. g., scandals). Diplomatic events produced slightly smaller benefits, conditioned by similar variables except for retaining their popularity during scandals. Foreign travel and speeches had little impact. The frequency of presidential activities changes in response to political variables, in ways that are consistent with maximization of political benefits. Uses of force became slightly more common during recessions, less common when approval was low for <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons.</b> (cont.) Elections reduced the rate of all activities. These results may explain previous negative findings for U. S. diversionary war: presidential incentives for diversionary force are weak because potential gains are small, other tools are available, and they are discounted during times of need.

30|$|Seasonal {{migration}} pattern and family relations have mutually constructed {{each other in}} a way that, instead of creating transnational familyhood, it may translate into defamilisation: estrangement or marginalisation of the migrants. It thus demonstrates how men’s recurring absence affects gender dynamics and their position within families. The way families have adapted to prolonging absence of the migrant and in fact living apart together can be viewed, as I argue, as the <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons</b> for the perpetuation of seasonal migration of Polish men to Germany. This paper also addresses modernisation of gender roles and points to the importance of the class dimension. Whilst the discourse on fathering or conjugal relationship usually builds on egalitarian gender roles, this paper, applying the intersectional lenses, brings in the perspective of the working class and rural migrant workers.|$|E

We further reveal that countries are social entities that seek legitimacy and have been influenced by international organizations (coercive isomorphism), uncertain situations (mimetic isomorphism), and their own cognitive base (normative isomorphism) to accept IFRS for <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons.</b> Finally, we offer a framework of IFRS diffusion by contrasting our proposed institutional perspectives with main stream neoclassical views of the west...|$|E
30|$|While the {{composition}} and drivers of migration from the Gondar region have changed significantly over time, it remains much the same in rural areas where the youth (mainly males) emigrate for economic reasons. The causes that initiate international movement and sustain it over time differ considerably, especially in areas where migration was initiated by <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons.</b> This claim, however, {{does not appear to}} work for areas associated with labor migration where economic reasons remain key drivers. This paper shows that social class, resources, gender and poverty are key variables along which migration from Ethiopia is being stratified, and there is also important sub-national variation. This has grown more visible since the late- 1990 s with an influx of both skilled and unskilled migrants from Ethiopia migrating to different destinations. Not all Ethiopian migrants have the same experiences, and this {{has a lot to do}} with the regional organisation of migration. Different histories locally, and transnationally, generate different outcomes.|$|E

We analyse whether personal contacts facilitate access to jobs for the middle or the working class. We do not treat informal ties as a homogeneous category, but distinguish work-related contacts from communal contacts such as family, friends, and acquaintances. Our analysis is based on a longitudinal survey of unemployed jobseekers in Switzerland that we match with administrative data. We find that work-related ties are disproportionately used by individuals with favourable employment prospects: middle-aged jobseekers with high prior earnings. In contrast, communal contacts chiefly help jobseekers with poor employability, notably the low-skilled working class and workers dismissed for <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons.</b> Communal contacts thus compensate for the difficulty of finding a job through other channels. However, the different search methods do not affect how wages evolve from pre- to post-unemployment jobs.

40|$|Using {{qualitative}} information, {{this paper}} studies the labour experiences {{of a group}} of skilled Spanish migrants in Mexico City. The paper identifies two types of migrants amongst the interviewed Spaniards: TNCs transferees and “migrants in the middle” (“those who are neither low-skilled migrants nor high-skilled migrants”; Conradson and Latham, 2005 a). This somehow challenges assumptions about skilled workers, by showing the multiple work trajectories and experiences of highly qualified and educated workers. The article also stresses that the labour mobility of those in the middle is more horizontal and less conventional than the more typical career-path mobility of TNCs transferees. Furthermore, it is argued that labour mobility is not only related to educational background or performance in Mexico’s labour markets, but also to <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons</b> (e. g. extensive use of social networks). Of special interest for this study are relations at the workplace as they represent a “contact zone” where “difference” is constantly encountered and negotiated (Yeoh and Willis, 2005 b).

These developments are presented in an association with the overall situation in the country. Due to economic and <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons,</b> B&H faces a general problem of a lack of international competitiveness. In a current situation, there are rare products to be internationally competitive and the country relies on imports of food and other products. During the post-civil-war emergency and reconstruction stage, the bulk of food and agricultural inputs, were donated or granted by different governments, humanitarian organizations, and donors to mitigate the effects of widespread poverty caused by the war destructions and economic declines. During a development stage, recovery in the agricultural sector is burdened by the considerable lack of international competitiveness in food processing and marketing as well as by several sectors, institutional, and general economic problems. The rate of unemployment in B&H is high, and agricultural households are the important units providing food security for rural populations and relatives living in towns. Nevertheless, around half of agricultural land resources are unutilised, and even more striking is the "illegally occupied" agricultural land, {{which is one of the}} most significant in the structure of land leasing arrangements. poverty, social buffer, land leasing, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Agribusiness, Q 15, Q 18, O 13, O 52,...|$|E

This study investigated two research questions: (1) What do landowners expect when they join these modern forestry co-ops? And, (2) what opportunities do the co-ops provide these members? This case study research explored two forestry co-ops in Wisconsin.

By examining the available research on Central American families that migrate to the United States, it seems plausible to argue that one of the main causes for migration is the lack of employment opportunities in their home country. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the relationship between the migration of Central American youth and low employment opportunities. The paper intends to address the following questions. Is lack of employment opportunities a cause for children to migrate to the US? Could children have other factors that motivate them to migrate to the US? To study the causes and effects of migration of Central American youth, a qualitative, secondary analysis of immigration court cases was used.

40|$|There {{are plenty}} of <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons</b> to care whether victims are {{compensated}} in class actions. The traditional law and economics view, however, is that when individual claim values are small, {{there is no reason}} to care whether victims are compensated. Deterring wrongdoing is tort law’s primary economic objective. And on this score, law and economics scholars contend that only the aggregate amount of money that a defendant expects to pay affects deterrence. They say that it does not matter for deterrence purposes how that money is split between victims, lawyers, and charities. This Article challenges that claim about achieving tort law’s primary objective and argues that there is an economic reason to care whether victims are compensated in class actions. It offers reason to think that compensating victims deters more wrongdoing than the same amount of relief in other forms, at least in damages class actions. Put a different way, this Article contends that the primary objectives of class actions — compensation and deterrence — are intertwined in ways that scholars have not previously recognized. Compensation affects the amount of reputational harm that class actions inflict on defendants, and anticipating that reputational harm provides a source of deterrence. Because the public values compensating victims in civil litigation, if class actions were frequently to slight compensation that would undermine public perception of the class device; class actions would come to seem more like plaintiffs’ lawyers’ extortion mechanisms than legitimate means of redressing harm. Diminished procedural legitimacy makes the class action a less powerful signal about the validity of the underlying claims, which undermines reputational deterrence...|$|E
40|$|FROM ITS INCEPTION, the National Park Service {{has been}} {{directed}} to “conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife ” within National Park units, and to manage the resources so as to “leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. ” Whether or not scenery in National Parks can be enjoyed is highly dependent on visibility—how clear the atmosphere is. Visibility can be significantly impaired by air pollution from electric utilities, cars and other mobile sources, and other industry. The pollution that affects visibility also impacts other park resources including plants, animals and entire ecosystems, as well as historic and cultural items and structures. In making policies that impact these park resources, lawmakers and stakeholders consider {{a variety of issues}} under a variety of disciplines, including economics. While there may be many <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons</b> for protecting park resources, economics provides a means to compare the potential benefits of a policy with its potential costs. Although costs of environmental regulations are generally easier to estimate and therefore often more accessible to policymakers than are benefits, economists have estimated benefits of air pollution control by looking at health problems and even deaths that scientists believe are caused by air pollution. Lost work time and healthcare costs translate into dollar amounts. It’s been shown that people would be “willing to pay ” to avoid illnesses. And, economists also have long estimated monetary worth for quality of life and life itself. Health benefits expected to result from meeting various interim goals (10 and 15 years out) of the Regional Haze Rule—which requires steady progress towards the national goal of eliminating man-made visibility impairment by 2064 —are estimated to be as much as $ 17, 726 millio...|$|E

The leadership of the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) is used as a case study because it is an organization that purports to represent the interest of students in post-secondary institutions in Canada. The study employed personal interviews as the main method of data collection. The interviews were semi-structured since certain questions were asked {{as a result of the}} responses given to questions in the interview schedule. The interviews enabled the researcher to probe into the minds of the respondents and also get a better understanding of their viewpoints and perspectives. Twelve executive members of the CFS were interviewed for this study. In order not to accept at face value the responses of the leadership of CFS, six representatives of the Ontario Undergraduates Students’ Alliance (OUSA) were also interviewed. As a rival organization, OUSA has been very critical of CFS. By interviewing OUSA representatives, the study aimed at critically examining the responses of CFS respondents. This enabled the researcher to get a balanced understanding of the factors that motivated the formation of student organizations. The study was designed to examine the role selective incentives and inducements play in the decision to be part of the leadership of CFS. In so doing, the study examined the evolution of student movements in Canada which resulted in CFS’ formation. Following the work of other researchers, this study categorized the incentives and motives for the participation of the CFS’ leadership into social, purposive and economic factors. Social incentives and motives include friendship, status, and prestige; purposive incentives and motives include the efforts to influence government policies to obtain broader goals; and economic incentives go to enhance job and career prospects. The findings of the study showed that although economic benefits and incentives are important in influencing the decision to join the leadership of CFS, <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons</b> should also be considered before any conclusion can be made about the decision-making process of individuals. It came to light that social and purposive incentives are important factors that motivate participation in CFS’ affairs. In this vein, any attempt at understanding the internal dynamics of interest groups and social movement organizations should adopt an integrative approach. Such an approach provides a better framework that enhances our understanding and perspective of the internal dynamics of interest groups and social movement organizations...|$|E
40|$|Small {{stock farming}} and {{production}} accounted for approximately 8. 4 % of total animal product based agricultural output in the 2011 / 2012 season in South Africa. Large scale commercial farming aside, small stock farming also takes on {{an important role}} in poorer and developing rural areas of South Africa, where small stock are kept for a combination of economic and <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons</b> including financial investment or security, food and resource production, as well as religious or traditional reasons. Blowflies are Dipterids with complex life cycles and complete metamorphoses, causing damage to hides and frequent death in their ovine hosts, as a result of cutaneous myiasis caused by the larval stages. All economically important blowfly species causing veterinary myiasis belong to the superfamily Oestroidea, which contains the three major families Oestridae, Calliphoridae and Sarcophidae. The two most significant blowfly genera in South Africa, Lucillia and Chrysomya, both belong to the family Calliphoridae. Chemical means of preventing and treating blowfly strike by topical application remains the most widely used method and appears to be indispensable at this stage. New molecules or formulations effective against blowfly strike are constantly being sought and form part of an active field of research. Bayer currently manufactures and markets Drastic Deadline Extreme ®, a pour-on formulation containing flumethrin and fluazuron for the control of blue ticks (Rhipicephalus decoloratus) in cattle; its possible action against blowflies in sheep was investigated in an in-vitro model, subsequent to a pilot pharmacokinetic study evaluating the kinetics of fluazuron when applied topically to sheep in this particular combination. The first objective of the project was to determine whether fluazuron has any effect at all on the development of blowfly larvae. An active ingredient from the same family of compounds, namely triflumeron, has been successfully used for several years to control blowfly strike in sheep in South Africa (Zapp ® Pour on - Bayer), but it was uncertain whether or not fluazuron would be effective. Raw fluazuron was applied to six pieces of beef according to a dose calculation based on the registered dose of the test product in cattle, while another six pieces were treated with saline in a similar fashion (n= 6). Each piece of beef was placed in its own container along with six late instar larvae and placed in the incubator at 35 °C for a further nine days. In this instance, the treated group demonstrated significant development defects with regard to pupation (uneclosed pupae) when analysed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric t-test (p = 0. 002).

40|$|The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Singapore Ministerial Conference in December, 1996, {{represented}} the first review {{of where the}} WTO was almost {{two years after the}} Marrakech signing. Unfortunately, neither in implementing Marrakech agreements nor in dealing with new issues is the post-Singapore state of the world trading system fundamentally better off than before. Nothing was done to correct the "sham liberalization" in the phasing out of market access restrictions in textiles and clothing. By backloading liberalization of the most sensitive clothing products to the latest possible time, an impasse is being created which could well cause but yet another delay in eliminating these quantitative restrictions, which are very costly in terms of allocative efficiency. The core of market access was seemingly brushed over to make room for an agreement on free trade in information technology products, which is flawed for two reasons. First, it excludes highly protected consumer electronics and second, it expanded the international marketing "cartel" for semiconductors to include the EU and Korea (plus founding members US and Japan). Anti-dumping measures (ADMs), the essence of so-called contingent protection, have continued {{to play a major role}} in trying to reduce competition, but the Ministerial widely ignored this fact. Though their use by industrialized countries has slowed down noticeably, developing countries pose a new threat by enacting ADMs all the more, particularly against other developing countries. The Singapore Ministerial failed to clearly set the stage for fulfilling the WTO's brief as a universal institution. No clear guidelines were established to quickly and effectively bring Russia and China into the WTO. Instead, the status quo of enforcing unilateral actions against a state-trading economy still appeals to industrialized countries, probably for mainly <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons.</b> In perhaps one of its most important decisions, the Singapore Ministerial set up a working group to examine competition policies. Yet the key question is whether trade liberalization and GATT/WTO discipline will be best served by adding to the trading system a global codex, harmonizing national competition policies ex ante, or by mutually recognizing well-functioning national competition policies. While sound economic arguments support the latter, prevailing country-of-destination principles conjure up concerns that the former will dictate the approach. Finally, it may be too early to extrapolate the current success of the dispute settlement mechanism (DSM). It still remains to be seen whether Contracting Parties will really accept decisions against their expressed interests in issues of critical importance, or where national security arguments are invoked. So far, however, the success of the DSM has exceeded expectations. [...] ...|$|E
40|$|D. Comm. (Economic and Management Sciences) The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} dynamics of Mexico's external economic relations during the period 1968 - 1995. Since the early seventies, the workings of the international monetary system has been governed Illore by implicit rules and conventions based on sound market principles than rules as were the case under the fixed exchange rate system of Bretton Woods. These "rules of the game" dictated that if a country {{wanted to be part of}} the global village and reap the benefits thereof, such a country should adhere to market forces and administer its monetary-fiscal policy in such a way as to ensure that the delicate balance between the domestic and international economic environment is maintained. In the event of a deviation from these rules, a country, in this instance Mexico, would fmd itself in a. position where it is heavily penalised for not playing according to the rules of the game. Starting in 1976, the Mexican economy was characterised by ongoing exchange rate crises, which seemed to be a recurring phenomenon repeating itself more or less every six years. Time and again a misalignment in Mexico's monetary-fiscal policy led to a build-up of pressures and tensions in the external accounts of the country, especially the balance of payments and eventually disruption of the economic growth process and relations with the external world. The Mexican economy was time and again subject to a rapidly growing current account deficit, rising external foreign debt, a rising overall fiscal deficit fuelled by - xiii - expansionary government expenditure policies and the slavish adherence to a fixed exchange rate regime. The growing fiscal deficit was in all instances financed by either increased short-term, highly volatile portfolio capital, or a depletion of the country's gold and foreign reserve holdings. The discovery of large oil reserves in 1978 lessened the need for structural adjustment and the following of more prudent policy measures. Rising domestic inflation and the fixed exchange rate gave rise to an ongoing real appreciation of the peso, which undermined the competitiveness of the domestic economy and distorted the balance between domestic savings and consumption. The appreciation of the peso and the high import propensity of the domestic households led to sharp increases in imports and rather static export earnings. The vulnerability of the domestic economy was exacerbated by developments in the country's external environment. These exogenous shocks took the form of either a decline in the international oil-prices and/or a more hostile international financing environment characterised by higher. interest rates and stricter borrowing requirements. The combination of domestic financial tensions and negative developments in the country's external environment were often, especially in 1994, accompanied by domestic political upheavals.. Time and again the apparent unsustainable domestic and external disparities and the heavy reliance on speculative foreign funding led to a change in investor views of the future of the Mexican peso. Capital flights and continued speculation eventually led to a situation where the authorities could no longer manage to maintain the parity of the peso. The market subsequently forced a devaluation and/or depreciation of the peso. The exchange rate crises of 1976, 1982, 1986 - 87 and 1994 appear to have been the result of a monetary-fiscal policy stance in which the government played a relatively central role. The role of the government and its hold over the Bank of Mexico led to a situation where the Mexican economy was out of touch with developments in its external economic and financial environment. Interesting though, is the way in which the government, especially the Salinas administration, refused to follow a more marketoriented macroeconomic policy with reference to the exchange rate regime and monetary-fiscal policy in general. As the events that led to the collapse of the peso in - XIV - 1994 unfolded, it became evident that the overvalued peso was maintained solely for <b>non-economic</b> <b>reasons.</b> The manner in which the new Zedillo administration reacted to the sharp depreciation of the peso in 1994 and 1995 greatly influenced the further deterioration of the peso and Mexico's international position. The main {{objective of}} the international assistance provided to Mexico by the United States, the International Monetary Fun~ and other international institutions during the course of 1995 was to underpin the continued deterioration of the peso and the overall well-being of the Mexican economy. Although the Mexican authorities are bound by the conditions tied to the foreign fmancial assistance provided and are at this stage following a more market-oriented, less regulated economic policy, it remains to be seen whether the authorities will in future adhere more closely to the rules of the game of the international monetary system as embodied in the conventions dictated by the global village market...|$|E
