40|$|Cut-elimination is {{the most}} {{prominent}} form of proof transformation in logic. The elimination of cuts in formal proofs corresponds to the removal of intermediate statements (lemmas) in mathematical proofs. The cut-elimination method CERES (cut-elimination by resolution) works by constructing a set of clauses from a proof with cuts. Any resolution refutation of this set can then serve as a skeleton of a proof with only atomic cuts. In this paper we present a systematic experiment {{with the implementation of}} CERES on a proof of reasonable size and complexity. It turns out that the proof with cuts can be transformed into two mathematically different proofs of the theorem. In particular, the application of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>hyperresolution</b> yield different mathematical arguments. As an unexpected side-effect the derived clauses of the resolution refutation proved particularly interesting as they can be considered as meaningful universal lemmas. Though the proof under investigation is intuitively simple, the experiment demonstrates that new (and relevant) mathematical information on proofs can be obtained by computational methods. It can be considered as a first step in the development of an experimental culture of computer-aided proof analysis in mathematics...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to give a better {{understanding}} of existing many-valued resolution procedures, and thus help to improve the efficiency of automated theorem proving in finitely-valued logics. First, we briefly present a method for translation to clause form in finitely-valued logics based on distributive lattices with operators, which uses the Priestley dual of the algebra of truth values. We show that the unsatisfiability of the set of signed clauses thus obtained can be checked by a version of signed <b>negative</b> <b>hyperresolution.</b> This extends the results established by HÃ¤hnle in the case of regular logics, where the set of truth values is linearly ordered. As in the case of regular hyperresolution, also our version of signed hyperresolution is surprisingly similar to the classical version. In the second part of the paper we explain why regular logics and the logics we consider are so well-behaved. We show that in both cases the translation to clause form is actually a translation to classical logic, and that soundness and completeness of various refinements of the (signed) resolution procedure follow as a consequence of results from first-order logic. Decidability and complexity results for signed clauses follow as well, by using results from first-order logic. This explains and extends earlier results on theorem proving in finitely-valued logics...|$|E
