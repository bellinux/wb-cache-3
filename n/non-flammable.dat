5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are <b>non-flammable.</b> Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E
5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is <b>non-flammable,</b> has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being <b>non-flammable,</b> and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} AS-204 fire in 1967, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Spaceflight, Dr. George Mueller, {{announced}} the mission would be officially designated as Apollo 1. The capsule underwent a significant redesign {{as a result}} of the mishap. The atmosphere in the cabin was changed from 100% oxygen to a 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen environment at launch. The astronauts' spacesuits, originally made of nylon, were changed to beta cloth, a <b>non-flammable,</b> highly melt-resistant fabric woven from fiberglass and coated with ]. There were other changes, including replacing flammable cabin materials with self extinguishing ones, and covering plumbing and wiring with protective insulation.|$|E
5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is <b>non-flammable</b> and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|Transportation of {{hazardous}} materials {{for commercial purposes}} in the USA is regulated by Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 - Transportation, (abbreviated 49 CFR). A cylinder containing 200kPa (29.0psig/43.8psia) or greater at 20°C (68°F) of <b>non-flammable,</b> nonpoisonous compressed gas, and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as HAZMAT (hazardous materials) in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400psi) by several manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} compound trichloroethylene is a halocarbon commonly {{used as an}} industrial solvent. It is a clear <b>non-flammable</b> liquid with a sweet smell. It {{should not be confused}} with the similar 1,1,1-trichloroethane, which is commonly known as chlorothene.|$|E
25|$|Although {{sulfuric acid}} is <b>non-flammable,</b> contact with metals {{in the event}} of a {{spillage}} can lead to the liberation of hydrogen gas. The dispersal of acid aerosols and gaseous sulfur dioxide is an additional hazard of fires involving sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|Dry ice is {{the solid}} form {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO2), a {{molecule}} consisting of a single carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. Dry ice is colorless, <b>non-flammable,</b> with a sour zesty odor, and can lower the pH of a solution when dissolved in water, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3).|$|E
25|$|The <b>non-flammable</b> Edo program {{driven by}} the shogunate was carried out {{under the rule of}} Tokugawa Yoshimune, though after his death in 1751 (Kan'ei 4), the shogunate became less active due to its troubled {{financial}} status. The program was never fully completed, which became the main cause of various great fires before the Meiji era.|$|E
25|$|FireAde, a {{foaming agent}} that emulsifies burning liquids and renders them <b>non-flammable.</b> It {{is able to}} cool heated {{material}} and surfaces similar to CAFS. Used on A and B (said to be effective on some class D hazards, although not recommended {{due to the fact}} that fireade still contains amounts of water which will react with some metal fires).|$|E
25|$|According {{to their}} {{material}} safety data sheets, CFCs and HCFCs are colorless, volatile, toxic liquids and gases with a faintly sweet ethereal odor. Overexposure at concentrations of 11% or more may cause dizziness, loss of concentration, {{central nervous system}} depression and/or cardiac arrhythmia. Vapors displace air and can cause asphyxiation in confined spaces. Although <b>non-flammable,</b> their combustion products include hydrofluoric acid, and related species.|$|E
25|$|After the Great Fire of Tenna, {{another wave}} of {{relocation}} involving daimyo residences, temples, and shrines, and allowed for new hiyokechi and extended hirokōji. Most temples and shrines were now located {{outside of the}} canals as a result. During the Kyōho Reforms, fire prevention was further strengthened starting with the institutionalization of the machibikeshi. In the light of Tokugawa Yoshimune's enthusiasm for a <b>non-flammable</b> Edo, new hiyokechi were set up in Kanda, Hatchōbori and Ichigaya.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} fluids {{have been tested}} to {{transport}} the sun's heat, including water, air, oil, and sodium, but Rockwell International selected molten salt as best. Molten salt is used in solar power tower systems because it is liquid at atmospheric pressure, provides a low-cost medium to store thermal energy, its operating temperatures are compatible with today's steam turbines, and it is <b>non-flammable</b> and nontoxic. Molten salt {{is used in the}} chemical and metals industries to transport heat, so industry has experience with it.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide Aeros {{was awarded}} a patent of their control of static {{heaviness}} system (COSH) internal buoyancy management system in May 2015. The COSH system internally ballasts the <b>non-flammable</b> helium into the aircraft’s helium pressure envelopes (HPEs), helping the vehicle manage buoyant lift. The HPE units contain and control the compressed helium and allow the overall helium volume envelope to be reduced or increased, enabling the air vehicle to become heavy or buoyant in a controlled manner. The compression of helium into the HPE’s creates a negative pressure within the Aeroscraft Aeroshell, permitting air-expansion chambers to fill with readily-available environmental ballast (air), which acts in concert with reduced Helium static lift to make the Aeroscraft heavier, when desired, to compensate for adjustments in payload.|$|E
25|$|The {{loss of the}} D-LZ 129 Hindenburg at Lakehurst on 6 May 1937 {{shattered}} public {{faith in}} the safety of hydrogen-filled airships making the continuation of their commercial passenger operations unsustainable unless the Graf Zeppelin and the still under construction LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II could convert to <b>non-flammable</b> helium, the only alternative lifting gas for airships. Unlike the relatively inexpensive and universally available hydrogen, however, {{the vast majority of the}} world's available supplies of the much more costly, less buoyant, and harder to produce helium (which is an extracted byproduct of mined natural gas) were controlled by the United States. Since 1925, the exportation of helium had also been tightly restricted by Congress, although there is no record that the German Government had ever applied for an export license for helium to use in its airships prior to the Hindenburg's crash and fire.|$|E
500|$|Coal {{balls are}} not made of coal; they are <b>non-flammable</b> and useless for fuel. Coal balls are calcium-rich permineralised life forms, mostly {{containing}} calcium and magnesium carbonates, pyrite, and quartz. Other minerals, including gypsum, illite, kaolinite, and lepidocrocite also appear in coal balls, albeit in lesser quantities. Although coal balls are usually {{about the size of}} a man's fist, their sizes vary greatly, ranging from that of a walnut up to [...] in diameter. Coal balls have been found that were smaller than a thimble.|$|E
500|$|This {{enabled the}} United States {{to become the}} world's leading {{supplier}} of helium. Following a suggestion by Sir Richard Threlfall, the United States Navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during World War I. The goal was to supply barrage balloons with the <b>non-flammable,</b> lighter-than-air gas. A total of [...] of 92% helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained. Some of this gas {{was used in the}} world's first helium-filled airship, the U.S. Navy's C-7, which flew its maiden voyage from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Bolling Field in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1921, nearly two years before the Navy's first rigid helium-filled airship, the Naval Aircraft Factory-built USS Shenandoah, flew in September 1923.|$|E
500|$|The first {{non-stop}} transatlantic crossing {{was made}} by the British airship R34 in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of helium reserves in the United States promised increased safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose. Therefore, H2 was used in the Hindenburg airship, which was destroyed in a midair fire over New Jersey on 6 May 1937. The incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed. Ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause, but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the aluminized fabric coating by static electricity. But the damage to hydrogen's reputation as a lifting gas was already done and commercial hydrogen airship travel ceased. [...] Hydrogen is still used, in preference to <b>non-flammable</b> but more expensive helium, as a lifting gas for weather balloons.|$|E
500|$|Lee and Ermann {{noted that}} NHTSA used a worst case test {{to justify the}} recall of the Pinto, rather than the regular 1977 rear impact crash test. A large [...] "bullet car" [...] was used instead of a {{standard}} moving barrier. Weights {{were placed in the}} nose of the car to help it slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. The vehicle headlights were turned on to provide a possible ignition source. The fuel tank was completely filled with gasoline rather than partially filled with <b>non-flammable</b> Stoddard fluid as was the normal test procedure. In a later interview the NHTSA engineer was asked why the NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing a 35mph test given that most small cars of the time would not have passed.

2500|$|In 1935, Monsanto Chemical Company (now Solutia Inc) {{took over}} {{commercial}} production of PCBs from Swann Chemical Company which {{had begun in}} 1929. PCBs, originally termed [...] "chlorinated diphenyls", were commercially produced as mixtures of isomers at different degrees of chlorination. The electric industry used PCBs as a <b>non-flammable</b> replacement for mineral oil to cool and insulate industrial transformers and capacitors. PCBs were also commonly used as heat stabilizer in cables and electronic components to enhance the heat and fire resistance of PVC.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>non-flammable</b> fire curtains; other {{openings}} in the proscenium wall required self-closing fire-resistant doors. Heat activated sprinkling systems were required for the fly space above the stage. At this time in New York City, uniformed fire department officers became permanent attendees of every theatrical production. These 'Theatre Detail Officers' were required {{to be in the}} theatre a half-hour before the performance, test the fire alarms, inspect fire wall doors and the fire curtain, and, during performances, ensure that aisles, passageways and fire exits remain clear and accessible.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is an [...] inorganic, colorless, odorless, <b>non-flammable,</b> {{extremely}} potent greenhouse gas, and {{an excellent}} electrical insulator. [...] has an octahedral geometry, consisting of six fluorine atoms attached to a central sulfur atom. It is a hypervalent molecule. Typical for a nonpolar gas, it is poorly soluble in water but quite soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. It is generally transported as a liquefied compressed gas. It has a density of 6.12g/L at sea level conditions, considerably higher than the density of air (1.225g/L).|$|E
2500|$|Dense {{distribution}} of buildings built from flammable materials {{was an important}} factor that allowed fires to evolve from small to great. Once one building caught fire, the neighboring ones would soon ignite before any firefighters could respond. For this reason, {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Fire of Meireki, structures made with <b>non-flammable</b> materials were promoted in Edo to enhance the city's defense against fires. Fire barrier zones called [...] and [...] were set up in various places in Edo. Adoption of fire-resistant materials including tiled roofs and earthen houses became mandatory.|$|E
2500|$|JLENS aerostats {{are filled}} with 590,000 cubic feet (17,000 cubic m) of <b>non-flammable</b> helium. [...] Given its {{operational}} altitude, the internal pressure of JLENS {{is about the same}} as the exterior pressure, which makes the system difficult to shoot down. [...] Airships can absorb multiple punctures before they lose altitude. [...] When they do, they would come down so slowly that they could be reeled in, easily repaired, and quickly redeployed. [...] Mooring stations for large systems would be relatively permanent; however, for short- or medium-range surveillance, the aerostats would likely be smaller and their mooring systems mobile.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Roebling bridge, {{with its}} iron superstructure, was {{generally}} believed <b>non-flammable,</b> it {{fell victim to}} fire on June 19, 1881. The bridge was not destroyed, but its floor system of white pine and white oak was severely damaged. John Harper, president of the Allegheny Bridge Company, which owned and operated the structure, stated that he believed the fire {{was the result of}} [...] "sparks and perhaps flame from the stacks" [...] of passing steamboats igniting bird nests located under the superstructure of the bridge. After heavy electric streetcars were introduced to the bridge in 1890, concern over its functional capacity grew, and in 1891 plans were begun to replace the suspension bridge with one that could better handle the steadily increasing traffic, as well as permit trolleys to cross without reducing their speed.|$|E
2500|$|... 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane is a <b>non-flammable</b> gas used {{primarily}} as a [...] "high-temperature" [...] refrigerant for domestic refrigeration and automobile air conditioners.
