500|$|In August 2011, Starkey {{appeared}} as a guest on the BBC's Newsnight programme together with Owen Jones and Dreda Say Mitchell, made during {{a discussion about the}} 2011 England riots. Starkey claimed that [...] "the whites have become black", and that [...] "a particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic, gangster culture has become the fashion". The leader of the Labour party, Ed Miliband, spoke about Starkey's remarks, saying [...] "they are racist comments, frankly". The author Toby Young, blogging in the Telegraph, defended Starkey by claiming that Starkey had been talking not about black culture in general. Rod Liddle argued in support of the remarks. Fellow panellist Owen Jones described the comments as [...] "one of the ugliest episodes of the backlash", claiming that [...] "multiculturalism and ethnic groups have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> happened".|$|E
500|$|On March 4, 2008, Favre {{formally}} {{announced his}} retirement. Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was {{based on the fact that}} he did not want to play anymore. He said during the conference, [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to." ...|$|E
