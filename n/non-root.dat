Induction of root organogenesis in regenerating cotton shoots is genotype-dependent and often unreliable. The resulting loss of regeneration potential due to failure to form roots can vary from 30 - 80 % according to genotype and represents a significant bottleneck in the overall recovery of plants from culture. If the <b>non-rooting</b> shoots are transgenic, the loss in regenerated plant material can be substantial. In vitro grafting of shoots to seedling rootstock proved to be a simple and reliable method that allowed recovery of <b>non-rooting</b> shoots from culture. Following shoot apex grafting, the survival and recovery of plants averaged 90 - 100 % under the final optimized conditions. Success of any given graft was directly related to scion size and age of the seedling rootstock; a scion of approximately 0. 8 - 1. 0 cm and a rootstock of 14 - 35 days was optimal. The method appeared to be genotype-independent, and varietal differences between rootstock and scion did not effect the rate of plant recovery from culture. Five TAES cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars were transformed using two vectors, pXBOP and pJMA 4, which contained genes associated with pathogen resistance (PR genes) : osmotin (PR- 5) and a basic PR- 1 in pXBOP, and lox 1 in pJMA 4. Plants were transformed using the shoot apex/Agrobacterium method (US Pat. # 5, 164, 310; Smith et al., 1992) developed earlier for cotton (Gould et al., 1991 a; 1991 b). After kanamycin selection, shoots (T?) were grafted onto in vitro grown seedling rootstocks (Luo and Gould, 1999). Grafted/regenerated plants were normal, fertile, and produced normal progeny.

The loss of transgenic shoots due to failure to form roots is genotype dependant and represents a significant limiting factor in the overall recovery of transgenic plants from cultures. Transgenic shoots following selection on antibiotic medium were efficiently rooted on MS containing different combinations of kinetin, IBA and IAA. Healthy and efficient rooting was achieved when the shoots with blackish and dead root portion were treated with 1. 0 mg/ml IBA and cultured on MS medium containing 2 % sucrose. This method for in vitro rooting of cotton shoots {{proved to be a}} simple and reliable allowing 98 % recovery of <b>non‐rooting</b> shoots from culture. All the rooted plants normally survived in soil and flowered. Cotton crop has been difficult to manipulate with high efficiency since the tissue culture methods used for regenerating transgenic plants by indirect transformation via callus.

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{in vitro}} rooting system was established {{for further studies}} on biochemical and molecular aspects during adventitious root formation in Pinus radiata hypocotyls. High root counts and rooting efficiency were observed in a medium comprising ½ strength of the Murashige & Skoog's basal medium (1962), 20 g/l sucrose, 9 mg/l IBA and solidified with 8 g/l agar. In this system, the first cell division, formation of root primordium initial (a cluster of meristematic cells), well-organized root primordium (a dome shaped structure) and root emergence were typically observed at around day 4, 7, 10 and 13, respectively. The increase of buffer soluble total proteins resulted in a peak at day 7 in the treatment with IBA (rooting treatment), but this peak was not observed in the other <b>non-rooting</b> treatments (including IBA+kinetin, kinetin alone and hormone-free control). Rooting related proteins were not observed using one-dimensional SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). However, 19 proteins associated with the IBA treatment were observed by two-dimensional PAGE although their magnitudes were very small {{so that it was}} difficult to quantify them and establish them as novel proteins. Changes of peroxidase (PO), IAA-oxidase (IAA-O), amylase (Amy) and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activities assayed using tissue extracts were not significantly different between the rooting and the <b>non-rooting</b> treatments during the experiment. By contrast, the increase of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity was more significant at day 7 in the rooting treatment than in the other treatments. Nevertheless, histochemical localization of PO, PPO and SDH indicated that these enzymes were somehow associated with adventitious root formation. In the IBA treatment, the increase of starch content in the rooting region reached its maximum at day 4 and 7. This increase coincided with the histological observation ofaccumulation of starch grains at the sites where root primordia initiated. To identify the molecular signals that initiate adventitious root formation, subtracted cDNA library was made from IBA-treated hypocotyls following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of subtracted single strand-cDNAs. Inserts of 5 bacterial clones (Rl- 72, R 2 - 7, R 2 - 22, R 2 - 35 and R 3 - 24) were digoxigenin-labelled and used to detect their corresponding transcripts using RNA dot blotting. Using RNA dot blotting analysis, Rl- 72 detected an equivalent level of transcript in the hypocotyls at day 0 and day 7 in the treatments with and without IBA; whereas the other 4 clones, especially R 2 - 7 and R 2 - 35, detected different levels of transcripts in the hypocotyls during adventitious root initiation. Southern blotting analysis indicated that the R 2 - 7 transcript is likely to be represented by a single gene or a member of a smaller gene family. Adventitious root formation in P. radiata was significantly improved using Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Compared with the strain A 4 T, strain LBA 9402 was very effective in increasing rooting percentage and root number. High rooting percentages and root numbers were obtained in the trials with hypocotyl segments, intact seedlings and adventitious shoots. The findings in this research can assist further studies to shed some light on why some clonal cuttings of radiata pine root more easily than others do, and why mature cuttings are difficult for adventitious root induction...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous {{levels of}} IAA, IAAsp and IBA were {{quantified}} {{during the first}} 8 days of in vitro rooting of the chestnut hybrid, clone M 3 by high performance liquid chromatography. Rooting was induced either by dipping the basal ends of the shoots into 1 gl- 1 IBA solution for 1 minute or by subculturing the shoots on agar rooting medium with 3 mgl- 1 IBA for 5 days. For root development the induced shoots were transferred to auxin-free agar medium. Auxins were measured in the apical and basal parts of the shoots by means of high performance liquid chromatography. Endogenous levels of IAA and IAAsp were higher in IBA-treated shoots than in control shoots. In extracts of the basal parts of the shoots, the concentration of free IAA showed a transient peak at day 2, in both root inductive methods, a subsequent gradual decrease {{for the remainder of}} the time course was observed. The concentration of IAAsp peaked at day 6 in extracts of the basal parts of shoots induced with 3 mgl- 1 IBA for 5 days, whereas shoots induced by dipping showed an initial increase until day 2, and then remained stable. In extracts from basal shoot portions induced by dipping and by IBA in the medium, IBA concentration showed a transient peak at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, remaining stable after day 4 for the dipping method, whilst showing a significant drop between day 4 and 6 for the other induction treatment. All quantified auxins remained at a relatively low level, virtually constant, in extracts from apical shoot portions, as well as in extracts from control of <b>non-rooting</b> shoots...|$|R
40|$|Adventitious roots (ARs) are {{induced by}} auxins. Jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) are also plant growth {{regulators}} with many effects on development, but their role on ARs needs investigation. To this aim, we analyzed AR formation in tobacco thin cell layers (TCLs) cultured with 0. 01 - 10 mu M MeJA, either under root-inductive conditions, i. e., on medium containing 10 mu M indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) and 0. 1 mu M kinetin, or without hormones. The explants were excised from the cultivars Samsun, Xanthii and Petite Havana, and from genotypes with altered AR-forming ability {{in response to}} auxin, namely the <b>non-rooting</b> rac mutant and the over-rooting Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolB transgenic line. Results show that NtRNR 1 (G 1 /S) and Ntcyc 29 (G 2 /M) gene activity, cell proliferation and meristemoid formation were stimulated in hormone-cultured TCLs by submicromolar MeJA concentrations. The meristemoids developed either into ARs and xylogenic nodules, or into xylogenic nodules only (rac TCLs). MeJA-induced meristemoid over-production characterized rolB TCLs. No rooting or xylogenesis occurred under hormone-free conditions, independently of MeJA and genotype. Endogenous JA progressively (days 1 - 4) increased in hormone-cultured TCLs {{in the absence of}} MeJA. JA levels were enhanced by 0. 1 mu M MeJA, on both days 1 and 4. Endogenous IBA was the only auxin detected, both in the free form and as IBA-glucose. Free IBA increased up to day 2, remaining constant thereafter (day 4). Its level was enhanced by 0. 1 mu M MeJA only on day 1, while IBA conjugation was not affected by MeJA. Taken together, these results show that an interplay between jasmonates and auxins regulates AR formation and xylogenesis in tobacco TCLs...|$|R

40|$|Vegetative {{reproduction}} {{is the most}} common form of propagation in aquatic macrophytes. Fragmentation and consecutive re-rooting of the fragments is one way in which new macrophyte colonies may establish. The success and frequency of this strategy depends on the species and the environment. This study tested how well six species are capable of colonising this way. Tested species are five of the most abundant species of Lake Balaton, where macrophyte recolonisation is still to take place after improving water quality and one potentially invasive species. Fragments of standardized length were examined for survival, rooting rates and length growth during five to six week experiments under laboratory conditions. Effects of species, shoot part (apical or mid-stem part) and seasonality on rooting probability were analysed with logistic regression. Effects on life-cycle were also examined, in terms of continuation of growth and of flowering or seed-set. Species differed significantly in rooting rates and growth, but not in survival rates. Egeria densa, Myriophyllum spicatum and Potamogeton perfoliatus showed the best colonisation properties (survival rates: 95 %, 84 % and 84 %; rooting rates: 88 %, 45 % and 65 %, respectively), while Potamogeton pectinatus colonised less successfully (survival rate: 91 %, rooting rate: 38 %). The annual Najas marina was the only species which frequently reached flowering (61 %), while fragmenting further, without much rooting (rooting rate: 5 %). The <b>non-rooting</b> Ceratophyllum demersum was least impacted by fragmentation and continued growth best, with survival rates of 100 %. Shoot part had a significant influence on rooting rate and length growth. Apical fragments had higher rooting rates and greater length growth than stem fragments, probably due to the action of their meristematic tissue. Differences in the three repetitions of the experiment may be attributable to seasonal changes in colonisation features. It is concluded that recolonisation by fragments might be an effective way for macrophyte populations to recover in Lake Balaton...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{prion protein}} (PrPC) is a glycoprotein with unknown function constitutively expressed in mammalian neurons. PrPC converts to a pathogenic misfolded isomer (PrPSc) through a poorly understood process, {{resulting in a}} group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or prion disease. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind prion conversion requires production of PrPC in recombinant systems. This study was designed to generate transgenic tobacco plants expressing recombinant mouse prion protein (mPrP). Using a synthetic gene encoding the mouse prion protein, plant expression vectors were constructed for constitutive mPrP expression in the apoplast (pGreen 35 SmPrP-Apo), cytosol (pGreen 35 SmPrP-Cyto) and endoplasmic reticulum (pGreen 35 SmPrP-ER). Putative transgenic plants transformed with either pGreen 35 SmPrP-Cyto or pGreen 35 SmPrP-ER were analysed by PCR, ELISA and immunoblot for transgene integration and expression. However, no viable plants were obtained from the pGreen 35 SmPrP-Apo transformants. ELISA analysis showed that recombinant mPrP accumulated up to 0. 0024 % of total soluble leaf protein in transgenic tobacco leaves transformed with the pGreen 35 SmPrP-Cyto construct and 0. 0016 % of total soluble leaf protein in plants designed to sequester recombinant mPrP to the ER. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis showed that ER-targeted recombinant mPrP was mainly unglycosylated, although a glycosylated mPrP isoform was observed indicating that transgenic tobacco plants process ER-targeted recombinant mPrP in a manner analogous to mammalian systems. The nutrient composition of several transgenic plants were analysed to determine the phenotypic effect of expressing recombinant mPrP in tobacco plants. The analysis revealed that transgenic lines expressing cytosolic-mPrP had elevated average levels of Mn 2 + and Fe 2 +. In addition, kanamycin-treated transgenic plants expressing cytosolic-mPrP developed a <b>non-rooting</b> phenotype. Conversely, the average Cu 2 + level was increased in analysed transgenic plants designed to sequester recombinant mPrP in the ER. Furthermore, the plants developed no visible phenotype upon kanamycin treatment. This result support studies that suggest that the PrPC has functional role in metal homeostasis and loss of its thermodynamic structure leads to metal dyshomeostasis which in turn has been linked to prion disease associated neurotoxicity. Finally, the recombinant mPrP was purified via affinity chromatography facilitated by the presence of a C-terminal polyhistidine tag on the synthetic gene constructs...|$|R
