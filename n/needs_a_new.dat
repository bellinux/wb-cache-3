Don chides Baxter and his staff for allowing Dow {{to be satisfied with}} a 50% market share when they should go after more - and SCDP is the agency that can help them do it.|$|E

When he arrives at the music shop next door, it has closed for the night. Dejected, Homer goes back to Moe's to find its owner. Moe convinces the man to re-open his store. By the time Homer reaches the school with the new reed, however, Lisa has already butchered her performance. Humiliated and upset, she completely ignores Homer, who, from watching old family videos, soon realizes how much he has neglected her.|$|E
5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E

[...] When she dies of a sudden illness, Hersh is infuriated, and accuses God of violating their contract. [...] He abandons his faith, shaves his beard, and lives a life as a miserly businessman in a penthouse with a gentile mistress. [...] He illicitly uses a synagogue's bonds that were entrusted to him to buy the tenement building in which he had lived when poor. [...] He becomes dissatisfied with his new way of life, and decides that he <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> contract with God to fill the emptiness he feels. [...] He has a group of rabbis draw up a new contract, but when he returns home with it, his heart fails and he dies. [...] A boy, Shloime, finds Hersh's old contract, and signs his own name to it.
