2500|$|Despite Clare {{showing a}} more [...] "vulnerable" [...] {{side in the}} weeks prior to her departure, in episodes that aired in July 2008, Bradley {{discovered}} her original plan to manipulate money from himself and other men in Walford, and subsequently shunned her, leaving Clare [...] "feeling isolated and unwanted by her closest friends and family". Bissix has discussed her character's departure and the [...] "softer side" [...] to Clare that emerged: [...] "she does genuinely care for [...] When he turns against her, {{it turns into a}} bit of a drunken mission for her and she wrecks Dot's house. When Dot comes back, she finds her {{in a bit of a}} state and hands her a Christianity leaflet. [...] actually sits and tries to pray". Kris Green from Digital Spy has suggested that the programme [...] "only really ever scratched the surface with [...] " [...] and that there was still a lot that was undiscovered about the character, which Bissix has agreed with. She comments, [...] "This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head. Someone like Clare doesn't stick around Walford unless there's a reason. I like to believe in what I do and believe in my characters. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in a job for no reason. Clare would definitely leave in this situation." [...] After one last [...] "huge row" [...] with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008. Discussing her exit, Bissix said, [...] "I leave Albert Square in the back of a Black Cab, of course! Which is how I left with Nigel 10 years ago so it feels kind of right. It’s better than going out in a [...] isn’t it? I don’t want to be killed off!" [...] She also revealed that she is hoping Clare Bates will return to EastEnders again one day, commenting, [...] "I don’t think it’s the end of Clare. I’m sure she’ll be back to cause trouble at some point." [...] In 2009, Bissix added that producers told her when she left in August 2008 that they were thinking of bringing her character back in a year or so. She added, [...] "but it's one of those things. I'll just have to wait and see." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study is to {{describe}} and understand whether, and if so, how social workers in school and in social services construct computer gaming adolescents as a social problem. We chose social workers who encounter adolescents with different problems. We have conducted qualitative interviews with vignettes to capture the social workers' reasoning about computer gaming adolescents and how they handle this in their work. The study shows that all social workers we interviewed had encountered adolescents with troubling computer gaming habits. In the study, all agree that computer gaming becomes a problem when it leads to deviant behaviour such as <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school, <b>staying</b> up all night and so on. Social workers have adapted their work with computer gaming adolescents after their workplace policies, resources and make efforts to make it manageable to work with. One example of how they make it manageable is that {{they look at the}} problem in a context and focus on other factors than the excessive computer gaming such as poor family relationships. In the process of being established as a social problem computer gaming addiction is weak...|$|R
