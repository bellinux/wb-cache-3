40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} extracellular sodium concentration (Na) o, osmolality and prostaglandin Ei(PGEi) on basal vascular tone and {{the response to the}} pressor agents, noradrenaline (NA) or angiotensin II (AT-II) using the pref used central artery of the isolated rabbit ear. The following results were obtained. 1) Both the basal vascular tone and the vasoconstrictor response of resistance vessels to <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> enhanced with a decreased extracellular osmolality induced by alteration in both sucrose concentration and(Na) o. 2) While the response to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> not affected by (Na) o under constant osmolality, the response to AT-II was augmented significantly when (<b>Na)</b> o <b>was</b> increased from 102 mM to 132 mM. 3) The inhibitory action of PGE 1 on the response to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> influenced by alteration of the extracellular calcium concentration (Ca) o, and was greater when (Ca) o was less than 2. 0 mM. 4) When 0. 1 μg and 1. 0 μg of <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> applied repeatedly and alternately, the responses were gradually enhanced. However, their enhancement was reduced under perfusion of PGE 1 (10 ng/ml), the responses finally being inhibited. From the results described above, it was concluded that the response of the resistance vessels to <b>NA</b> <b>was</b> affected by alteration not in external Na concentration, but in external osmolality and calcium concentration. Further, it may be considered that the inhibitory effect of PGE 1 on the response to <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> probably due to each antagonistic action on calcium ion mobility through the cell membrane or within smooth muscle cells at contraction due to NA...|$|R

5000|$|There is a {{substantial}} amount of empirical research on negative affect (NA) and its role in the tripartite model. For example, the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ) was administered to a sample of college students and a sample of psychiatric patients. The correlations between the specific anxiety scale (anxious arousal) in the MASQ and <b>NA</b> <b>were</b> moderate (rs= [...]41 and [...]47), supporting that <b>NA</b> <b>is</b> specific to anxiety disorders, congruent with the tripartite model. Another study consisted of a sample of children (ages 7-14) diagnosed with a principal anxiety disorder.

40|$|Naphthenic acids (<b>NAs)</b> <b>are</b> {{carboxylic}} acids {{found in}} crude oil and petroleum products. The {{objectives of the}} research presented here were to: a) assess the occurrence and fate of NAs in crude oil and refinery wastewater streams; b) evaluate the biotransformation potential and inhibitory effects of NAs under nitrifying, denitrifying and methanogenic/fermentative conditions; c) investigate the factors affecting NA biotransformation under aerobic conditions and the microbes involved; and d) assess the toxicity of individual model NAs using quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and {{examine the effect of}} structure on NA biotransformation potential. <b>NAs</b> <b>are</b> ubiquitous in refinery wastewater streams and the desalter brine was found to be the main source of NAs in refinery wastewater. A commercial <b>NA</b> mixture <b>was</b> not biodegraded under nitrate-reducing or methanogenic/fermentative conditions. <b>NAs</b> <b>were</b> degraded under aerobic conditions by an NA-enriched culture; however, a residual fraction was not degraded under all conditions studied. The results indicated that <b>NAs</b> <b>are</b> not inherently recalcitrant and the residual fraction was due to the individual NA concentrations being below the minimum substrate concentrations at which they are no longer degraded. A fraction of the <b>NA</b> mixture <b>was</b> completely mineralized to carbon dioxide, with the remaining portion biotransformed to more oxidized intermediates. Overall, the results indicated that <b>NAs</b> <b>were</b> degraded under aerobic conditions; however, biological treatment of NA-bearing wastewater will not completely remove NA concentrations and thus, biological treatment must be combined with physical/chemical treatment to achieve complete NA removal.
