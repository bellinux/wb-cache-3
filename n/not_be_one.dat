5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, {{following the death of}} Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed {{that it would not be}} her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated that it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of his characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con that it would not be Homer, although there is a scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask.|$|E

The language need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of those listed in the Eighth Schedule, and several states have adopted official languages which are not so listed. Examples include Kokborok in Tripura and Mizo in Mizoram.|$|E

25|$|It {{subsequently}} {{trained as}} a mountain warfare division in the Scottish Highlands under General Sir Neil Ritchie. As the invasion of Normandy approached, the 52nd (Lowland) Division were involved in an elaborate deception plan, Operation Fortitude, designed to deceive the Germans into believing that there would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> invasion area but several, and that the 52nd would have formed the nexus of a strong force {{that was to be}} landed in Norway. As a mountain warfare formation, it had little heavy equipment and transport, and therefore was optimal for conversion to operations as an Airborne force, being assigned to the First Allied Airborne Army. It was in this role that the division was anticipated to take part in Operation Market Garden. Instead the division was reassigned to the First Canadian Army, eventually landing at Ostend in October 1944, as part of the wider Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine.|$|E
500|$|According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Rodgers, Hammerstein and Fields {{had hoped}} to engage Yul Brynner as director. [...] Brynner, who had gained fame in the team's 1951 hit, The King and I, was an {{accomplished}} director. [...] However, he was busy starring in The Sound and the Fury, and they could not negotiate his release from Twentieth-Century Fox. [...] Instead, they hired actor and dancer Gene Kelly, who had never directed on stage before. [...] Kelly felt that the work would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best, but [...] "as long as I crammed the show brim-full of every joke and gimmick in the book, I could get it to work".|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the galactic}} {{habitable}} zone has been criticized by Nikos Prantzos, {{on the grounds that}} the parameters to create it are impossible to define even approximately, and that thus the galactic habitable zone may merely be a useful conceptual tool to enable a better understanding of the distribution of life, rather than an end to itself. For these reasons, Prantzos has suggested that the entire galaxy may be habitable, rather than habitability being restricted to a specific region in space and time. In addition, stars [...] "riding" [...] the galaxy's spiral arms may move tens of thousands of light years from their original orbits, thus supporting the notion that there may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> specific galactic habitable zone. A Monte Carlo simulation, improving on the mechanisms used by [...] Ćirković in 2006, was conducted in 2010 by Duncan Forgan [...] of Royal Observatory Edinburgh. The data collected from the experiments support Prantzos's notion that there is no solidly defined galactic habitable zone, indicating the possibility of hundreds of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, though further data will be required in order for a definitive determination to be made.|$|E

2500|$|The late 1850s saw {{the last}} groups of emigrants leaving for Liberia from West Virginia. Samson Caesar, a Liberian from West Virginia {{who had left}} Buckhannon in 1834, despaired {{for the future of}} Liberia, blaming the United States for the lack of {{education}} and training that had been denied the former slaves.

2500|$|Survival was a moral {{as well as}} a {{physical}} struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was [...] "not sure that I shall <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> by the time my letter reaches you." [...] The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.... At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much higher.|$|E

[...] He asked for compensation for his designs, but his claim was rejected on the basis that others also contributed to the design. Ross Biographer Marla Miller asserts that the question of Betsy Ross' involvement in the flag should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of design, but of production. Even so, history researchers must accept that the United States flag evolved, and did not have one designer. [...] "The flag, like the Revolution it represents, was the work of many hands." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra {{quotes a}} {{dialogue}} between Gautama Buddha and Manjushri on meat eating: Mañjuśrī asked, “Do Buddhas not eat meat because of the tathāgata-garbha ?”The Blessed One replied, “Mañjuśrī, that is so. There are no beings who have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>one’s</b> mother, who have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>one’s</b> sister through generations of wandering in beginningless and endless saṃsāra. Even <b>one</b> who <b>is</b> a dog has <b>been</b> <b>one’s</b> father, for the world of living beings is like a dancer. Therefore, one’s own flesh and the flesh of another are a single flesh, so Buddhas do not eat meat.“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, the dhātu of all beings is the dharmadhātu, so Buddhas do not eat meat because they would be eating the flesh of one single dhātu.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Mussolini stated that Fascism would never raise a [...] "Jewish Question" [...] {{and in an}} article he wrote he stated [...] "Italy knows no {{antisemitism}} {{and we believe that}} it will never know it." [...] and then elaborated [...] "let us hope that Italian Jews will continue to be sensible enough so as not to give rise to antisemitism in the only country where it has never existed." [...] In 1932, Mussolini during a conversation with Emil Ludwig described antisemitism as a [...] "German vice" [...] and stated that [...] "There was 'no Jewish Question' in Italy and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> in a country with a healthy system of government." [...] On several occasions, Mussolini spoke positively about Jews and the Zionist movement, although Fascism remained suspicious of Zionism after the Fascist Party gained power. Until 1938 Mussolini had denied any antisemitism within the Fascist Party.|$|E
2500|$|Dick {{was active}} as a {{publisher}} at the time, working with another minor publisher, C. Louis Rubsamen. [...] Only one volume bore {{his name as}} an imprint: a book of poems, The Serpent in the Wilderness, by Edgar Lee Masters, published in a fine-press limited edition in 1933. It was large (8½ by 12inches) and made with obvious attention to detail, but with some mistakes, the worst {{of which was the}} accidental binding of manuscript pages into some copies; the reception was mixed. [...] A positive review in The New York Times describes the physical book as [...] "an attractive piece of work." [...] The book sold slowly, despite a brief spike caused by the Times review, and made no profit, and a trade edition, which Dick and Masters had discussed, never materialized, partly because Dick had indicated in promotional material that there would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one.</b> [...] Masters biographer Herbert K. Russell blames the book's failure in part on Dick's [...] "poor judgment." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} [...] "Who {{made the}} first American flag?" [...] can only be given speculative answers. There are at least 17 flag makers and upholsterers who worked in Philadelphia during the time the flag was made. Margaret Manny {{is thought to have}} {{made the first}} Continental Colors (or Grand Union Flag), but {{there is no evidence to}} prove she also made the Stars and Stripes. Other flag makers of that period include Rebecca Young, Anne King, Cornelia Bridges, and flag painter William Barrett. Hugh Stewart sold a [...] "flag of the United Colonies" [...] to the Committee of Safety, and William Alliborne was one of the first to manufacture United States ensigns. Any flag maker in Philadelphia could have sewn the first American flag. According to Canby, there were other variations of the flag being made at the same time Ross was sewing the design that would carry her name. If true, there may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> [...] "first" [...] flag, but many.|$|E
2500|$|Until Mussolini's {{alliance}} with Adolf Hitler, {{he had always}} denied any antisemitism within the Fascist Party.

2500|$|Nevertheless, despite {{defining}} the concept so elegantly {{in his laws}} of motion, even Newton did not actually use the term [...] "inertia" [...] to refer to his First Law. [...] In fact, Newton originally viewed the phenomenon he described in his First Law of Motion as being caused by [...] "innate forces" [...] inherent in matter, which resisted any acceleration. Given this perspective, and borrowing from Kepler, Newton attributed the term [...] "inertia" [...] to mean [...] "the innate force possessed by an object which resists changes in motion"; thus, Newton defined [...] "inertia" [...] to mean {{the cause of the}} phenomenon, rather than the phenomenon itself. However, Newton's original ideas of [...] "innate resistive force" [...] were ultimately problematic for a variety of reasons, and thus most physicists no longer think in these terms. As no alternate mechanism has been readily accepted, and it is now generally accepted that there may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> which we can know, the term [...] "inertia" [...] has come to mean simply the phenomenon itself, rather than any inherent mechanism. Thus, ultimately, [...] "inertia" [...] in modern classical physics has come to be a name for the same phenomenon described by Newton's First Law of Motion, and the two concepts are now considered to be equivalent.|$|E

He won the title from Bradley on February 2 of that year. The title was held up in April 1987 after Warrior left the WCCW. He was reinstated as champion upon returning, but vacated it once more upon resigning from WCCW to join the World Wrestling Federation, where he adopted the ring name The Ultimate Warrior. Warrior began appearing on house shows in June and was initially billed as The Dingo Warrior in house card promos by Gene Okerlund, but soon had his name modified. There is dispute over who created the Ultimate Warrior name. Bruce Prichard stated that Vince McMahon {{did not know what}} a [...] "Dingo" [...] Warrior was, but because there was the [...] "Modern Day Warrior" [...] Kerry von Erich and The Road Warriors there should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> more simple warrior, but the ultimate warrior. Warrior claims after one of his first matches, McMahon had him do a pretaped promo. It was there Vince said we want you to do Warrior, but we don't want Dingo.
