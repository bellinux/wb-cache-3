40|$|Many {{consumers}} are {{conscious of the}} potential health problems incurred by the high consumption of fat. Consequently, they are discouraged from drinking whole milk due to its high fat content, despite its nutritional benefits, e. g. as a calcium source. A variety of low-fat milk products are currently available, with fat contents ranging from 0. 1 % to 1. 5 % fat. However, {{it is known that}} many consumers prefer the mouthfeel characteristics of high-fat milk. The consistency of low-fat milks was perceived as watery and the colour was often described as "green" or "grey". This identified a need for a low-fat milk product with mouthfeel characteristics and colour similar to high-fat milk. Attempts to improve the texture of low-fat milks have included the addition of <b>non-fat</b> milk <b>solids</b> to skim milk. Phillips et al. (1995) added 2 % non-fat dry milk powder to fluid skim milk. The addition of <b>non-fat</b> milk <b>solids</b> produced an objective measure of viscosity similar to milk with 2 % added fat. However, the colour and texture attributes of milk with 2 % added <b>non-fat</b> milk <b>solids</b> did not improve {{to such an extent that}} <b>non-fat</b> milk <b>solids</b> could be used as a substitute for fat...|$|R

In order to partialy increase <b>non-fat</b> <b>solid</b> content of fermented cream samples, skim milk powder and demineralized whey powder in two different rates (50 % and 70 %) were used. Samples were analyzed for changes in their biochemical and physicochemical properties (total solid, ash, fat, titratable acidity, pH value, total nitrogen, viscosity, tyrosine, acid number, peroxide and diacetyl values) during 29 -day of storage period. Samples tested consisted of 7 different groups; control group (without adding any powder), skim milk powder, 50 % demineralized whey powder and 70 % demineralized whey powder samples were in two different addition rate (2 % and 4 %). Also samples were analyzed for sensory properties. According to the results obtained, the addition of milk powder products affected titratable acidity and tyrosine values of fermented cream samples. Although powder addition and/or storage period didn&# 8217;t cause significant variations in total solid, ash, fat, pH value, viscosity, acid number, peroxide, tyrosine and diacetyl values; sensory properties of fermented cream samples were influenced by both powder addition and storage period.

40|$|The {{quality of}} milk {{consumed}} {{is a constant}} concern of dairy industry and healthcare-related authorities, technicians as well as consumers. The most serious problems are the various frauds which cause economic losses, risks to consumer health and, sometimes, problems for industries, such as the decrease in industrial output. Many foods are subject to fraud, but milk {{is one of the}} most commonly spoofed. The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of fraudulent substances and assess the physico-chemical properties of pasteurized milk produced in dairies from the North region of Paraná. Eighty samples were evaluated in the period from March to June 2014 and carried out specific methods for detection of restoratives: starch, alcohol, chloride and sucrose; neutralizers: bicarbonate and sodium hydroxide; preservatives: chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde. The evaluation of physico-chemical characteristics was carried out through the following analyses: density at 15 ° C, cryoscopic index, Dornic titratable acidity, 72 alizarol stability, pH, alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, fat, total solids, <b>non-fat</b> <b>solids,</b> urea, protein and lactose. Non-standard samples were observed for the following analyses: fat (12. 5 %), <b>non-fat</b> <b>solids</b> (5 %), density (1. 25 %), cryoscopy (3. 75 %), pH (48. 75 %), urea (1. 25 %). Frauds were observed by addition of water and sucrose (3. 75 %), presence of hypochlorite (5 %) and occurrence of skim milk (12. 5 %).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} {{attempted}} to identify individual milk proteins and other milk components {{that are associated}} with casein micelle size (CMS) and dry matter cheese yield (DMCY) using factor analysis. Here, we used 140 bulk tank milk samples from different farms. Milk composition was determined using a Fourier transform infrared equipament. The individual milk proteins were (αS-casein, β-casein, κ-casein, β-lactoglobulin and α-lactoalbumin) measured by their electrophoretic profile. The CMS was estimated by photon correlation spectroscopy, and the DMCY was determined using reduced laboratory-scale cheese production. Factor analysis partitioned the milk components into three groups that, taken together, explain 68. 3 % of the total variance. The first factor was defined as “CMS”, while the second as “DMCY” factor, based on their high loadings. The CMS was positively correlated with protein, casein, <b>non-fat</b> <b>solids</b> and αS-casein and negatively associated with κ-casein and β-lactoglubulin. DMCY was positively correlated with fat, protein, casein, total solids and negatively correlated with αs-casein.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was in {{theoretical}} part to summarise current knowledge about composition, physico-chemical, technological and sensory properties and cryostability of goat milk including a comparison of this characteristics for dairy goat breeds which are used for industrial and farm dairy production. Goat milk has high nutritional and therapeutic value. It is suitable for dairy industry processing as well as cow milk. In the Czech Republic, where is traditional cow milk consumption, the interest of consumers in goat milk products increased recently. The main Czech dairy goat breeds are White and Brown-Shorthaired Goats. In the practical part of diploma thesis were compared the 2 main Czech dairy goat breeds, White and Brown-Shorthaired Goats, with a rare breed Girgentana Goat. Cryostability of goat milk was observed for 16 weeks (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks) for White and Brown-Shorthaired breed. Characterized parameters were main components (total <b>solid,</b> <b>non-fat</b> <b>solid,</b> fat, lactose, crude proteins and casein), minor components (citric acid, urea, free fatty acids and fatty acid profile), physico-chemical properties (density, freezing point and titratable acidity), technological properties (cheeseability, fermentability and thermostability) and for fresh milk also sensory identity and acceptability. It was found that milk from Girgentana Goats contains the significantly (p < 0. 05) highest amount of total solid, fat and lactose. The highest amount of crude proteins (p < 0. 05) was on the contrary observed in Brown-Shorthaired Goat milk H 1. These two samples had also the best cheeseability (p < 0. 05) but the worst sensory acceptability because of their strong goat flavour and taste. During the storage test of White and Brown-Shorthaired Goat milk samples was found significantly (p < 0. 05) negative influence of storage in frozen state only on cheeseability.

50|$|White {{chocolate}} {{does not}} contain <b>non-fat</b> cocoa <b>solids,</b> the primary nutritional constituent of chocolate liquor—chocolate in its raw, unsweetened form. During the manufacturing process, the dark-colored solids of the cocoa bean are separated from its fatty content, as with milk, semi-sweet, and dark chocolate. But, unlike those other chocolate types, the cocoa solids are not recombined. As a result, this fat, cocoa butter, is the only cacao ingredient in white chocolate. Because it contains no cocoa solids, white chocolate contains only trace amounts of the stimulants theobromine and caffeine, while lacking the antioxidant properties or many characterizing ingredients of chocolate, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and phenylethylamine. Often, the cocoa butter is deodorized to remove its strong flavor. If prime pressed cocoa butter is used, it has natural anti-oxidant (vitamin E), but if deodorized it has none, as the deodorizing is a steam stripping step, often at 180 C.|$|R

Dairy farmers were categorized according to the daily milk production: small (lower than 150 L); medium (151 to 500 L); and large (higher than 501 L). Chi-square tests and identification of possible relative risks between financial aspects and current regulation standards (Normative Instruction No. 62 of December 29, 2011, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply) associated to TBC (higher 300, 000 CFU/mL) and SCC (higher than 500, 000 cells/mL) means from bulk tank milk among different milk scales productions were performed. Bulk tanks milk composition met the legislation standards and had not differ between scales of production; however, SCC means within all scales, and TBC of small farmers had not attended the legislation standards and differences were identified (P < 0. 05).

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi caracterizar a produção e a qualidade do leite em sistemas de produção da bacia leiteira de Pelotas. Entre setembro de 2001 e agosto de 2002, foram monitoradas, durante 11 meses, nove unidades produtoras de leite, classificadas nos seguintes sistemas de produção: especializado (ES), semi-especializado (SE) e não-especializado (NE). Em amostras coletadas no tanque resfriador, foram determinadas características físico-químicas do leite e contagem de células somáticas. O percentual de mastite e a e produção leiteira corrigida para 4 % de gordura foram avaliados. Adotou-se o delineamento completamente casualizado em parcelas subdivididas. A crioscopia, apesar de apresentar diferença estatística entre ES e NE (P This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} characterizing milk yield and quality of three production systems at Pelotas dairy region. From September 2001 up to August 2002, nine dairy production units were visited for 11 months. Production units were classified as specialized (S), partially specialized (PS) and non-specialized (NS). Bulk tank milk was sampled to analyze physical and chemical attributes and somatic cells count (SCC). Mastitis percentage and 4 % fat-corrected milk yield were evaluated. A completely randomized split-plot design was adopted. Cryoscopic index differed between specialized and non-specialized systems (P< 0. 10), but all values were within the normal range. Specialized system showed lower mastitis occurrence than partially specialized and non-specialized systems (P< 0. 10). Production systems did not differ for 4 % fat-corrected milk yield, contents of protein, casein, fat, lactose, <b>solids</b> <b>non-fat,</b> total <b>solids,</b> non-protein nitrogen, as well as titrable acidity and somatic cells count. Higher technology level application reduced mastitis occurrence, contributing to a better milk quality...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{variation}} in milk composition is essential for determining milk quality, which is defined by several organoleptic properties. This study evaluated the effect of lactation stage and calving order on the physicochemical composition and sensory characteristics of milk from primiparous and multiparous lactating dairy cows. Milk samples were collected monthly from December 2011 to May 2012. Data were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test (p < 0. 05). Milk production (PROD), somatic cell count (SCC), and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) were significantly higher in multiparous cows, whereas the casein to total protein ratio (C/TP) was significantly higher in primiparous cows. All milk components except for <b>non-fat</b> dry <b>solids</b> (NDE) were significantly affected by lactation stage. Body condition score (BCS) was not affected by calving order or lactation stage. Color was the only sensory attribute affected by calving order. In conclusion, the physicochemical properties and sensory attributes of milk were affected by calving order and lactation stage...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} market yoghurt for selected chemical and microbiological properties and to compare it with the international standards regarding those quality parameters. The experiment was done at the Laboratory of the Dairy Production Department, Faculty of Animal Production in University of Khartoum. One hundred and forty-four commercially produced yoghurt samples were obtained from retail outlets in Khartoum State {{during the period from}} September to November 2005. The samples included ninetysix plain yoghurt representing local modern manufacturers coded A, B and C beside traditional producers coded T, also forty- eight fruit yoghurt samples from two manufacturers coded AF and BF. All these samples were collected from three towns in Khartoum State (Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman) to assure that all manufacturers were well represented. Chemical measurements included total <b>solids,</b> <b>solids</b> <b>non-fat,</b> fat, protein, ash and pH. The microbiological parameters studied were total bacterial count, total coliform count and the yeast and moulds count. Results obtained revealed significant variations (P≤ 0. 001) between samples obtained from different manufacturers in their chemical composition (total <b>solids,</b> <b>solids</b> <b>non-fat,</b> fat, protein, ash and pH. One hundred and thirty eight of collected samples (96. 5 %) were found satisfied the international standard for <b>solids</b> <b>non-fat</b> content, and 73 yoghurt samples (50. 7 %) were found to have a lower fat content than the standard. In the microbiological parameters tested, the total bacterial count and yeast and moulds count were not significantly different between different manufacturers. The coliform count of samples varied significantly (P≤ 0. 001) between a manufacturer and another with a noticeable significance higher (P≤ 0. 05) coliform count in samples collected from traditional manufacturers than that collected from modern manufacturers. It is concluded that the commercially available yoghurt in Khartoum State has a good chemical quality when compared to the international standards. However the microbiological quality was lower than required by the international standards due to the presence of contaminants. From results obtained in this study it is recommended to assure better hygienic production of yoghurt through monitoring by the governmental organizations and to conduct detailed researches on the type of microbial hazard occurring – or could possibly occur – through the consumption of contaminated products...|$|R
