40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies show}} that the impact of an {{exogenous}} monetary policy shock on bank lending is different across bank sizes and across various levels of capitalization and liquidity. However, there is little evidence on the impact of other exogenous influences such as the shift from cash- to <b>non-cash</b> <b>payment</b> instruments on bank lending. The shift to electronic payments significantly alters bank balance sheets and consumer liquidity restrictions and, therefore, it is likely to affect bank lending decisions. This paper explores the effects of the increasing use of <b>non-cash</b> <b>payments</b> instruments on bank lending in Spain during 1992 - 2000. The results show that banks appear to have taken advantage of the non-cash instruments to adjust their loan supply when interest rates increase (120 words).

The determinants used in these models are: <b>non-cash</b> <b>payments,</b> tax and social burden, unemployment rate, and Index of Economic Freedom with its components.

Based on both exponential and Gompertz curves, the point of sale (POS) terminal has shown a higher diffusion rate than that of automatic teller machines (ATMs). This result is also robust when a time trend is interacted with rivals' precedence, network effects and market concentration. The diffusion rates of both ATM and POS terminals have accelerated after 2002, when UnionPay was established in China. The diffusion rate of ATMs {{is found to be}} mainly driven by rivals' adoption of them. Market concentration boosts the diffusion of POS terminals. In spite of the rising number of POS terminals and merchants, the volume of POS transactions is low. The diffusion rate of POS is, however, negatively affected by interchange fees...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>non-cash</b> <b>payment</b> schemes is {{particularly}} widespread in France where {{the number of}} non-cash transactions is in fact well above the European average. Though they have different features corresponding to users’ varying needs (payments may be face-to-face, remote or recurring, for instance), <b>non-cash</b> <b>payment</b> schemes generally consist of an instrument that generates a payment order combined with the technical and organisational arrangements that enable this order to be processed. Putting these arrangements in place requires close co-operation between all participants of the payment «network», i. e., naturally, credit institutions that hold accounts for debtors and beneficiaries, and also their technical service providers. The Everyday Security Act of 15 November 2001 entrusts the Banque de France with a specific task with regard to overseeing the security of <b>non-cash</b> means of <b>payment.</b> This task falls naturally within the purview of central banks, which guarantee both {{the value of the}} currency and the stability of payment systems. To carry out its task, the Banque de France analyses the potential threats associated with payment schemes and defines, in consultation with the parties involved, the minimum security objectives designed to prevent the occurrence of payment-specific risk events. To assess the security of a payment scheme, the Banque de France ensures that the parties involved comply with these objectives. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{social cost}} of a payment system {{comprises}} between 1 % to 1. 5 % of GDP. This cost can be reduced if <b>non-cash</b> <b>payments</b> shift from paper to electronics since the {{cost of a}}n electronic payment is estimated to be from one-third to one-half that of a paper-based transaction. We examine the use of cash and five <b>non-cash</b> <b>payment</b> instruments in 14 developed countries over 1987 - 1993. Our purpose is (1) to outline the current use of check, paper giro, electronic giro, credit card, and debit card payments and (2) to determine why some payment instruments are used more intensively than others, especially electronic versus paper-based payments. Standard demand theory influences (own price and incomes, institutional factors, and simple availability measures across countries are examined, as is the effect of habit formation. Payment substitution relationships are also estimated and indicate that checks will decline with further growth of electronic payments while the instruments that make up electronic payments will tend to expand together rather than replace one another.
