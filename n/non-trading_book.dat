40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first thorough {{analysis of the}} interest risk of German banks on an individual bank level. We develop a new method {{that is based on}} time series of accountingbased data to quantify the interest risk of banks and apply it to analyze the German banking system. We find evidence that our model yields a significantly better fit of banks' internally quantified interest rate risk than a standard approach that relies on one-point-in-time data, and that the interest rate risk differs between banks of different size and banking group. Additionally, we find structural differences between trading book and <b>non-trading</b> <b>book</b> institutions.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} quality of Hong Kong listed banks’ market risk Value-at-Risk (VaR) disclosure; of which the Hong Kong stock market {{contains}} the diversity of Chinese state-owned banks, international banks with English history, and some Hong Kong local banks. Therefore, focusing on the Hong Kong stock market allows the comparison on the disclosure quality between the three. While the banks usually do not provide the disclosed VaRs with details on their internal estimation model and the actual accuracy of the estimation; this paper aims to (1) replicate the banks’ Value-at-Risk and apply the backtesting on the estimated VaR; and (2) compare the estimated VaR under the selected model with the VaR disclosed in banks’ publicly disclosed information. In {{the first part of}} the research, twelve models are estimated with the variation of their volatility adjustment model, width of data rolling window, and simulation approaches. There are two ways of historical volatility forecast models applied, namely, the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (1, 1) (or GARCH(1, 1)); together with the case of no adjustment, they make up three different specification. 250 and 500 previous trading days are the two elected width of time window; and the Historical Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation are the two simulation methods that are tested. These variations generate the twelve estimation approaches. These methods are then tested with the Christoffersen’s (1998) three tests of conditional coverage, independence and unconditional coverage. Furthermore, the GMM based duration test suggested by Candelon (2011) is also applied to the VaR data. The results concluded that the EWMA model with a 250 days of rolling window is the best perform model under the Christoffersen’s (1998) tests. In the second part of the research, the estimated VaR from the best perform model is compared with the disclosed values. Four types of disclosed VaR are included in the comparison, they are the trading book year-end and year average VaRs, and the trading and <b>non-trading</b> <b>book</b> year-end and year average VaRs. The results suggest that the year average forms of VaRs can better reflect the risk and the trading and <b>non-trading</b> <b>book</b> VaR is better than the trading book ones. In the cross country analysis, the group international banks (HSBC and SCB) outperform the two groups with Chinese and Hong Kong banks, which suggests that the international banks have their VaR disclosed with better quality...|$|E

It {{is a unique}} book fair {{in the sense of}} not being a trade fair - the book fair is {{primarily}} for the general public rather than whole-sale distributors. It is the world's largest <b>non-trade</b> <b>book</b> fair, Asia's largest book fair and the most attended book fair in the world. It is the world's third largest annual conglomeration of books after the Frankfurt Book Fair and the London Book Fair. Many Kolkatans consider the book fair an inherent part of Kolkata, and instances of people visiting the fair every day during its duration are not uncommon. The fair offers a typical fairground experience with a book flavour - with picnickers, singer-songwriters, and candy floss vendors. With a total footfall of over 2 million people, it is world's largest book fair by attendance.The success of the Kolkata Book Fair has resulted in many book fairs in smaller cities in West Bengal like Siliguri, and was inspired, in turn, by the first World Book Fair at New Delhi in 1972.|$|R
5000|$|Scotland was {{selected}} the focal theme {{country for the}} 2009 Book Fair.The Kolkata Book Fair is the most awaited annual cultural event {{of the city of}} Calcutta. It is Asia's biggest and the world's largest <b>non-trade</b> <b>book</b> fair but there have been controversies regarding the venue of the event. The Publishers and Booksellers' Guild, organizers of the book fair, had to shift the venue from the Maidan to Salt Lake in 2007 after environmental activists won a legal battle to stop the event from being held in the city's green area. However the venue was slightly difficult to reach and so despite financial concerns of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild (PBG), the Kolkata Book Fair 2009 was held at Milan Mela Prangan, situated on the EM Bypass, the alternative venue developed by the communist West Bengal State Government for the event. This year, for the first time, the Publishers and Booksellers' Guild released a Calcutta Book Fair Theme Song [...] "Oi Daakchey Boi" [...] produced by Cozmik Harmony - a partner of Washington Bangla Radio pioneering the digital era of Bengali Songs. The lyrics of [...] "Oi Daakchey Boi" [...] are by Sugata Guha, music by the popular percussionist Bikram Ghosh, and performed by Pratik Chowdhury, Ruprekha, Rupam Islam, Lopamudra Mitra, Srikanta Acharya, Bikram Ghosh, Shubhamita, Pulak and Rupankar Bagchi.|$|R
