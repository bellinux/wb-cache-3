As long as this concept did not develop into the ideology of chauvinism and remained in the rather vague realm of national or even nationalistic pride, it frequently resulted in a high sense of responsibility for the welfare of backward people.|$|E

One is thedevelopment and the evolution of the University as both a <b>national</b> <b>concept</b> and an educational institution. It reconstructs the role of politicians in shaping higher education from the 1908 establishment of the Egyptian University to Anwar Sadat’s revolutionary expansion of the education system. The other dimension is the role of students in politics. The book analyses the influence of the higher education system on the creation of the students as an active sociopolitical class; it surveys the students’ role in major historic junctures, and describes the pivotal role of the educated youth in the making of the country’s modern politics.|$|E

In addition the pace of change necessary to implement a carbon market approach is too slow to be effective at most international and national policy levels.|$|E
40|$|Recognising {{global health}} as a rapidly {{emerging}} policy field, the German federal government recently released a <b>national</b> <b>concept</b> note for global health politics (July 10, 2013). As the German government {{could have a}} significant impact on health globally by making a coherent, evidence-informed, and long-term commitment in this field, we offer an initial appraisal of the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for development recognised in this document. We conclude that the <b>national</b> <b>concept</b> is an important first step towards the implementation of a coherent global health policy. However, important gaps were identified in the areas of intellectual property rights and access to medicines. In addition, global health determinants such as trade, economic crises, and liberalisation as well as European Union issues such as the health of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers are not adequately addressed. Furthermore, little information is provided about the establishment of instruments to ensure an effective inter-ministerial cooperation. Finally, because implementation aspects for the <b>national</b> <b>concept</b> are critical for the success of this initiative, we call upon the newly elected 2013 German government to formulate a global health strategy, which includes a concrete pla...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—under the {{background}} of globalization, Chinese traditional culture suffered serious tests.

But "a home under the sun " traditional state concept still plays a role all the time in today's Chinese society. Therefore, in this paper, through the analysis of the traditional <b>national</b> <b>concept</b> of home and state isomorphic, and the profound comparison between western traditional <b>national</b> <b>concept</b> and Chinese traditional national, I finally give a brief comment on the influence of traditional Chinese national idea on modern society.
