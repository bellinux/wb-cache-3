We {{present the}} results of an {{excavation}} in a rock carvings site called A Ferradura, at Amoeiro (Ourense, Spain) where a bell beaker fragment has been documented in a rock art context. Even though the association between archaeological material and rock art has always been treated as "problematic", this exceptional finding allows a reflection on rock art sites as long term, <b>non-domestic</b> <b>activities</b> areas. Unluckly, it is also impossible to establish any direct association in the present case study at A Ferradura petroglyph site. Nonetheless, one of the ascertained activities is referred to the moment of use of the bell beaker. Other examples of the same knotty findings in the region will be finally reported in order to highlight the interest of this kind of cases in rock art studies.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} bridge {{a gap in}} feminist {{critique}} of gender and empire {{with regard to the}} founding of the Girl Guide movement in 1909. In contrast with previous studies of the Boy Scouts, which have briefly considered Guides as a mere derivative organisation, it suggests that the formation of the Guides, and printed material such as the first handbook How Girls Can Help Build Up the Empire (1912), were grounded in notions of the part which women, and girls specifically, could play in the imperial project. This paper proposes that, although tempered by an emphasis on raising children in order to prevent the “degeneration” of the British race, the Guide handbook permits increased <b>non-domestic</b> <b>activity</b> for Edwardian girls, which is justified by aims of preparing for home defence in case of foreign attack and for life in the colonies. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine the development of safety management in case company Production division. The emphasis is on the present situation and the purpose was to give a general view of safety management. The idea was also to create practical implications as development focuses for the future. The theoretical background of this research is based on organizations, management and leadership, safety culture, safety management systems and risk management. The safety management systems and methods and the historical background were reviewed. The case description is based on ten interviews made in four production sites of the case organisation. The interviews were used to create a description of the historical development and the applications of different sectors of safety management. The most important strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are summarized by applying SWOT analysis. The present situation of the corporate safety and security was assessed by means of an applied version of Capability Maturity Model Integration. The future development focuses were created on the basis of theory, interviews, SWOT analysis and CMMI model. Personnel safety, crime prevention, security of premises and safety in case of <b>non-domestic</b> <b>activity</b> are on a low level. Occupational and Environmental safety are on a highest level. Safety actions should be more proactive and systematic...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{distribution}} of Late Postclassic (a. d. 1250 – 1500) architecture and associated artifacts of the Maya site of Caye Coco, Belize. Artifact density and distribution suggest that different buildings served different functions and reflect a range of domestic and <b>non-domestic</b> <b>activities</b> at the island. An assessment of the labor investment required to build the seventeen structures at Caye Coco provides evidence {{of the degree of}} social hierarchy at this site, as many more people would have been required to build its elite residences than could have lived in them. The shift in the focus of architectural construction to the island at Progresso Lagoon in the Late Postclassic contrasts with the predominance of construction on the west shore during the Terminal Classic period. This trend reflects {{the emergence of a new}} political center among the lagoon settlements. It also may suggest an increased concern with aquatic transportation of trade goods during the Postclassic period, as Caye Coco is the most prominent island of the lagoon, which connects directly to the Caribbean Sea. The architecture at Caye Coco suggests that Late Postclassic political organization of northeastern Belize was more hierarchical than has been previously documented. This paper is the first systematic effort to quantify architectural labor investment and size distribution at a southern lowland Postclassic Maya site in order to address the issue of sociopolitical hierarchy. In this paper we present evidence of recently documented Maya mounded architecture from the island site of Caye Coco in northeaster...|$|E
40|$|This book {{deals with}} the {{distribution}} of criminal victimization across social groups and spatial areas. Why do certain kinds of people run higher risk of victimization than others? Why do spatial units, such as neighborhoods, cities and countries, differ in their rates of victimization? The present study shows that an individual’s risk of becoming {{the victim of a}} crime is not only determined by personal characteristics, but also depends on the type of neighborhood, city and even the country where the individual lives. Integrating insights from three criminological theories strain/anomie theory (Merton 1957), routine activity theory (Cohen & Felson 1979) and social disorganization theory (Shaw & McKay 1942), this study argues that crime rates will be higher the more motivated offenders, suitable targets and the absence of local guardians converge in time and space. Using multilevel methods of analysis, hypotheses deduced from these insights were simultaneously tested in explanatory models of crime victimization. High risks and rates of victimization were therefore expected, and indeed found, in countries with high income inequality, cities with low levels of police efficacy, and neighborhoods with high levels of residential mobility and ethnic heterogeneity. Furthermore, at the individual level, higher risks were found for youngsters, affluent households and people performing many <b>non-domestic</b> <b>activities.</b> These findings are in accordance with previous ecological and multilevel studies on victimization. New insights were derived from multilevel analyses that examined the impact of socioeconomic neighborhood change on victimization risk. From Dutch victimization data, it appeared that the chance to become the victim of theft, violence or vandalism was not only high in disadvantaged neighborhoods, but also in neighborhoods that were improving between 1994 and 1998. These gentrifying neighborhoods are characterized by a strong influx of new residents, which possibly results in a low potential for collective social control. This finding suggests that the gentrification of disadvantaged neighborhoods may not have the intended consequences within a short term. Furthermore, controlling for additional crime-inducing characteristics, prevention efforts of citizens to control risks of burglary victimization were found to exert varying effects at different levels of observation. For individual households, prevention measures reduce burglary victimization risk, while, simultaneously, high city levels of prevention measures increase risk. Previous research on crime displacement has suggested that criminals stay close to the original target when they move to different geographic areas in response to situational crime prevention. The findings in the present research are however more in line with Brantingham and Brantingham’s (1993) pattern theory, which suggest that criminals will commit crimes in the area they are acquainted with through routine activities. Likewise, burglars may displace their actions within this ‘awareness space’. Sometimes, this is close to the original target, while at other times burglars may search alternative targets further away within their awareness space. As a consequence, the prevention efforts of households across the crime target’s city of residence are important to understand differentiation in victimization. ...|$|E
