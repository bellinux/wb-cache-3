In 2010, the Cavalier was the 23rd most popular breed, {{according}} to registration figures collected by the American Kennel Club, while the English Toy Spaniel was the 126th. In the UK, according to the Kennel Club, the Cavalier {{is the most popular}} breed in the Toy Group, with 8,154 puppies registered in 2010, compared to 199 registrations for King Charles Spaniels. Due to the low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>registrations,</b> the King Charles was identified as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club in 2003 in an effort to help promote the breed.|$|E
25|$|Robert Van Niel in {{his book}} The Emergence of the Modern Indonesian Elite wrote that {{many members of the}} Sarekat Islam were former members of the Jamiat Kheir. Although, as stated in the Budi Utomos {{resolution}} in 1911, a decision was made to no longer accept non-native Indonesians as members, many Arabs remained members of or actively collaborated with Sarekat Islam. In Batavia, the overwhelming <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>registrations</b> from people to become members of Sarekat Islam made the Sarekat Islam in March 1913 decided to stop admitting new members. The intention was to avoid the administration become chaotic and out of control.|$|E

25|$|Queensland, after {{initially}} skipping the O-series (as a capital-O {{was often}} confused {{for a number}} 0), were left with too few combinations for a growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>registrations.</b> The Q series plates were reserved for Queensland government use. In 1978, having exhausted Naa-nnn to Paa-nnn combinations Queensland reversed the format, starting at 000-NAA continuing through to 999-PZZ in 1987, when plates commencing at 000-AAA were issued. Colours were white reflective background and green lettering (later maroon). There are still a number of vehicles in Queensland with the old white-on-black Q and six black on white digits at this time. Only one of these was issued, for display at the rear.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, ACORN has {{conducted}} large-scale voter registration drives, focusing primarily on registering poor and minority citizens. During the 2008 election season, ACORN gathered over 1.3 million voter registration forms in 21 states. Some of these registration forms were flagged by ACORN's internal auditors for review by election officials. Project Vote estimated that 400,000 registrations collected by ACORN were ultimately rejected, {{the vast majority}} for being duplicate registrations submitted by citizens. (This is also a common problem at government voter registration services, according to reports on the National Voter Registration Act by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission). An unknown <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>registrations</b> were fraudulent, but Project Vote estimated {{that only a few}} percent were, based on past years and samples from some drives in 2008. No official in states where voter registration drives were conducted has documented substantial numbers of fraudulent registrations. Project Vote estimated that 450,000 of the registrations collected by ACORN represented first-time voters, while the remainder were address changes submitted by citizens updating their addresses.|$|E

South Australia did similar, overflowing from SZZ-999 to UAA-000 etc. (having reserved the Taa-nnn series for trailer registrations).|$|E

Although the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>registrations</b> has topped 100,000, a design flaw in the counting process means that it counts users who abandoned the signup process mid way; the actual number of posters is smaller, at around 38,700 as of October 2008.|$|E

40|$|A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> {{techniques}} rely on manually selected landmark points.

The combination of landmark types and positional information form the landmark set, which can then be used for automated registration.
