25|$|Bolivia has {{traditionally}} undertaken different {{water resources management}} approaches aimed at alleviating political and institutional instability in the water sector. The so-called water wars of 2000 and 2006 in Cochabamba and El Alto, respectively, added social unrest and conflict into the difficulties of managing water resources in Bolivia. Evo Morales’ administration is currently developing an institutional and legal framework aimed at increasing participation, especially for rural and indigenous communities, and separating the sector from previous privatization policies. In 2009, the <b>new</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>and</b> Water Resources Ministry was created absorbing the responsibilities previously under the Water Ministry.

25|$|From the {{research}} that has been conducted on TCKs, {{it has been found}} that subjects are generally more tolerant of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home country who are not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally feel that they are better able to adapt to new cultures and understand how to behave appropriately in these new environments. Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either fluent in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's <b>new</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> culture.|$|E
25|$|The flower corolla {{consists}} of solitary actinomorphic, white flowers with five petals that most resemble the flowers of Forstera and Phyllachne (both also in Stylidiaceae). Like all Stylidium species, O. subulatum also possesses a column, {{which is the}} fused stamens and stigma. But unlike Stylidium species, it is insensitive or non-mobile and does not move in response to physical stimuli. It {{has been suggested that}} Oreostylidium be merged into the genus Stylidium, but the morphological characteristics of the two genera are dissimilar. Researchers have suggested that the floral form O. subulatum had developed by an extreme example of paedomorphosis or reduction. This process may have begun as a result of O. subulatums isolation on the islands of New Zealand. Researchers believe that this species has its origins in Australia and was established in New Zealand by a very small population and perhaps from a single seed. Faced with survival in a <b>new</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> possessing a flower designed for specific Australian pollinators, the species underwent rapid changes to its morphology. The hypothesis presented in these studies suggests this is how O. subulatum evolved from a common ancestry lineage with Stylidium graminifolium into the pollinator-generalist it is today. There is also a shift from the Stylidium-like flower designed for cross-pollination to obligate autogamous pollination. This allowed the plant to perform sexual reproduction in its morphologically immature state because the complicated Stylidium-like flowers were not required for pollination.|$|E

In an interview, Khan called his step-father, Raj Zutshi, as the father figure during his growing years. He was enrolled at Bombay Scottish School, where he developed a stammer due to corporal punishments such as caning. According to Khan, his grades fell and his academic career went into a [...] "strong decline" [...] due to his inability to cope with his <b>new</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> radically changed family situation; he became nervous and developed facial tics. Meanwhile, his mother married again and found it convenient to send him to a boarding school, choosing Blue Mountain School in distant Coonoor, Tamil Nadu. After a period of depression in Coonoor, Khan adjusted and grew into the environment; he later described his experience there as [...] "phenomenal," [...] although his grades remained poor. When the principal of that school left to start his own school, Khan and several other students followed him to a Gurukul in the jungles of Ooty. The new school had no electricity, the students were required to wash their clothes in a creek and they even grew some of the food they ate. Khan later admitted that frequently changing schools made him independent but also a loner.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there are}} states in Mexico where judges {{have a better}} {{understanding}} of the Convention and have ordered returns under the Convention, the USCA continues to note an overall pattern of noncompliance in Mexico’s judicial system. In the few cases that led to the return of the child to the United States, the LBP retained a private attorney with a greater understanding of the Convention’s principles than Mexican public prosecutors have tended to exhibit. Mexican courts delay Convention cases and often improperly treat them as custody decisions. See Convention, art. 16. In these instances, Mexican judges determine children to be well settled in the <b>new</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> deny the application for return to the child’s country of habitual residence. This determination could be avoided by handling Convention cases more expeditiously and adhering more closely to the Convention’s requirements.

2500|$|I shall {{investigate}} the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation.

It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the <b>new</b> <b>environment,</b> <b>and</b> its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection.

60|$|The {{words were}} no sooner {{out of his}} mouth than he {{realised}} that he had ceased to do so. It took his breath away like a plunge into cold water. He looked at Weeks with startled eyes. Suddenly he felt afraid. He left Weeks as quickly as he could. He wanted to be alone. It was the most startling experience that he had ever had. He tried to think it all out; it was very exciting, since his whole life seemed concerned (he thought his decision on this matter must profoundly affect its course) and a mistake might lead to eternal damnation; but the more he reflected the more convinced he was; and though during the next few weeks he read books, aids to scepticism, with eager interest it was only to confirm him in what he felt instinctively. The fact was that he had ceased to believe not for this reason or the other, but because he had not the religious temperament. Faith had been forced upon him from the outside. It was a matter of environment and example. A <b>new</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> a new example gave him the opportunity to find himself. He put off the faith of his childhood quite simply, like a cloak that he no longer needed. At first life seemed strange and lonely without the belief which, though he never realised it, had been an unfailing support. He felt like a man who has leaned on a stick and finds himself forced suddenly to walk without assistance. It really seemed as though the days were colder and the nights more solitary. But he was upheld by the excitement; it seemed to make life a more thrilling adventure; and in a little while the stick which he had thrown aside, the cloak which had fallen from his shoulders, seemed an intolerable burden of which he had been eased. The religious exercises which for so many years had been forced upon him were part and parcel of religion to him. He thought of the collects and epistles which he had been made to learn by heart, and the long services at the Cathedral through which he had sat when every limb itched with the desire for movement; and he remembered those walks at night through muddy roads to the parish church at Blackstable, and the coldness of that bleak building; he sat with his feet like ice, his fingers numb and heavy, and all around was the sickly odour of pomatum. Oh, he had been so bored! His heart leaped when he saw he was free from all that.|$|E
