40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2015, {{a series of three}} {{full-scale}} crash tests were performed at the Landing and Impact Research Facility located at NASA Langley Research Center of Cessna 172 aircraft. The first test (Test 1) represented a flare-to-stall emergency or hard landing onto a rigid surface. The second test (Test 2) represented a controlled-flight- into-terrain (CFIT) with a <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> pitch <b>attitude</b> of the aircraft, which impacted onto soft soil. The third test (Test 3) also represented a CFIT with a nose up pitch attitude of the aircraft, which resulted in a tail strike condition. Test 3 was also conducted onto soft soil. These crash tests were performed for the purpose of evaluating the performance of Emergency Locator Transmitters and to generate impact test data for model calibration. Finite element models were generated and impact analyses were conducted to simulate the three impact conditions using the commercial nonlinear, transient dynamic finite element code, LS-DYNA. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize test-analysis results for the three full-scale crash tests...|$|R
2500|$|The second crash {{occurred}} on July 18, 2002 near Estes Park, Colorado, {{also as a}} result of structural failure, in this case in the wing's spar adjacent to {{the left side of the}} fuselage.

At the time of the accident, it was in a left turn from downwind to final approach for its eighth drop of the day on the Big Elk fire.

5000|$|On April 18, 1979, Sikorsky S-61L (N618PA), {{while on}} {{departure}} climbout from Newark International Airport, experienced a fracture {{of one of}} the tail rotor blades, resulting in severe vibrations and an immediate return and descent to the airport. At about 150 feet altitude, the entire tail rotor gearbox was torn from the aircraft, resulting in an immediate and radical center of gravity change to the aircraft. This caused a severe <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> <b>attitude</b> and uncontrolled contact with the ground. Compounding the accident was the failure of both hydraulic systems due to the loss of the tail rotor gear box, which rendered the aircraft virtually uncontrollable.

5000|$|On August 10, 1968, Piedmont Airlines Flight 230 {{was on an}} ILS localizer-only {{approach}} to runway 23 when it struck trees 360 feet from the runway threshold. The aircraft continued and struck up-sloping terrain short of the runway in a <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> <b>attitude.</b> The aircraft continued {{up the hill and}} onto the airport, coming to rest 6 feet beyond the threshold and 50 feet from the right edge of the runway. A layer of dense fog was obscuring the runway threshold and about half of the approach lights. Visual conditions existed outside the fog area. All three crew members and thirty-two of the thirty-four passengers perished. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the accident on an [...] "unrecognized loss of altitude orientation during the final portion of an approach into shallow, dense fog." [...] The disorientation was caused by a rapid reduction in the ground guidance segment available to the pilot at a point beyond which a go-around could be successfully effected.|$|E
50|$|The {{stall warning}} system {{utilizes}} a stall warning vane {{on each side}} of the nose. The vanes provide regulated voltage input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a stall warning bias box to compensate for flap position. The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above stall, the stall warning energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> <b>attitude.</b> The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the stall point, the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the stall warning system into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.|$|E
