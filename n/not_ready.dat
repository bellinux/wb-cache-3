5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets behaving in such a mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E

5|$|In the {{six years}} after Beulah, no {{seedings}} were conducted for several different reasons. In 1964, measurement and observation equipment was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to be used. The year after that, all flights were used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane clouds.|$|E
5|$|Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates {{are also}} {{released}} as previews and for testing before final releases. Although {{there is a}} rough schedule for each release, this is often pushed back, if the code is <b>not</b> <b>ready.</b> The development team monitors {{the state of the}} code by running the large unit test suite during development, and using the BuildBot continuous integration system.|$|E
5|$|Required {{power was}} put up {{by a pair of}} {{afterburning}} Westinghouse XJ46-WE-02 turbojets, fed from intakes mounted high above the wings to avoid ingesting spray. When these engines were <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for the prototypes, twin Westinghouse J34-WE-32 engines of just over half the power were installed.|$|E

5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast {{to be placed in}} the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was <b>not</b> <b>ready,</b> and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E

5|$|Amelia visits Meredith to {{apologize}} for her prior behavior and discuss her sobriety. Amelia confides in Meredith that she is scared to lose her, but Meredith responds that she is <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to forgive her. Webber takes Meredith out for some fresh air, and gives her a talk {{about the power of}} forgiveness. He encourages her to forgive Amelia, Penny, Derek, and most importantly herself. She agrees to meet Lou. He introduces his wife and two daughters and then offers a sincere apology for what happened. Meredith, still unable to speak, takes his hand as a way of conveying her forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{preparations}} for another resupply convoy for Malta (Operation Pedestal), Argus returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft, including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron, for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the Clyde on 2 August for Gibraltar. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5 August for a three-day training exercise to work out coordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for combat. It was ordered {{to return to the}} UK aboard Argus.|$|E
5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{character}} and the program were announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for use at that time. Despite the announcement generating {{a considerable amount of}} attention, little was heard regarding the project in subsequent months. The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
5|$|During her trials, UB-7 {{developed}} a leak which {{took some time}} to repair. In the meantime, she was assigned the Austrian number of U-7 and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for UB-7 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still <b>not</b> <b>ready,</b> and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E

5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining B.subg. Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} not. They were <b>not</b> <b>ready,</b> however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Richard {{underwent}} a rehabilitation {{program with the}} aim of recovering from the effects of the stroke. He trained with the Astros and the Texas Southern University team, participating regularly in pitching and batting practice with both {{towards the end of the}} baseball season. After pitching in a few simulated games, Richard was placed on the 40-man active roster on September 1, 1981. Astros manager Bill Virdon thought Richard was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.|$|E
