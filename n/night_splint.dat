40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{examined}} whether {{the addition of}} a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> to eccentric exercises is beneficial for functional outcome in chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. DESIGN: One-year follow-up of a randomised controlled single blinded clinical trial. SETTING: Sports medicine department in a general hospital. PATIENTS: 58 patients (70 tendons) were included. INTERVENTIONS: All patients completed a 12 -week heavy load eccentric training programme. One group received a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> in addition to eccentric exercises. Main outcome measurements: Outcome scores were: Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment - Achilles (VISA-A) score, subjective patient satisfaction and neovascularisation score measured with Power Doppler Ultrasonography. RESULTS: For both groups the VISA-A score increased significantly (from 50 to 76 (P < 0. 01) in the eccentric group and from 49 to 78 (P < 0. 01) in the <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> group). No significant differences in VISA-A score were found between the groups from baseline to one year (P = 0. 32). Presence of neovessels at baseline did not predict change in VISA-A score after one year in the whole group (P = 0. 71). CONCLUSION: Eccentric exercises with or without a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> improved functional outcome at one-year follow-up. At follow-up {{there was no significant difference}} in clinical outcome when a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> was used in addition to an eccentric exercise program. Between three months and one year follow-up, a continuing increase in VISA-A score was found. Assessment of the neovascularisation score with PDU at baseline has no prognostic value on long-term clinical outcome...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is {{a common}} {{entrapment}} syndrome which lowers {{quality of life and}} is a reason for high costs for health care systems. The algorithm presented in this study may be helpful for surgeons’ decision-making for treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in terms of correct timing and treatment option. Here, the treatment algorithm for carpal tunnel syndrome and its preliminary results are discussed. Material and Methods: Decision-making for treatment of all Carpal Tunnel Syndrome patients enrolled in this study was performed according to the algorithm presented here, which is based on no thenar atrophy of patients and ability of median nerve innervated thenar muscles. Fifty one hands out of 88 were offered <b>night</b> <b>splinting</b> initially for three weeks while the rest thirty seven hands were operated as an emergent or urgent case without offering <b>night</b> <b>splinting.</b> Results: Quality of life of all the patients who were operated was improved except one and, awakening at night was disappeared in the postoperative period. 20 hands out of fifty one who were offered <b>night</b> <b>splinting</b> for three weeks were operated for carpal tunnel release since patients felt no improvement in their complaints after three weeks of <b>night</b> <b>splinting.</b> Conclusion: We believe that, this algorithm will help surgeons in decision-making process, determining the correct timing for surgery, improve patient satisfaction and provide the opportunity for explanation of the need for whichever treatment option is required. The algorithmic approach we use in our cases is based on the examination of no thenar atrophy and ability of median nerve innervated thenar muscles. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Plantar {{fasciitis}} is an overuse injury causing inflammation at {{the origin}} of the plantar fascia and is characterized by plantar heel pain that is provoked by taking the first few steps in the morning and by prolonged standing. Dorsiflexion night splints are used to address early morning pain by preventing contracture of the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon overnight. Medial arch supports, on the other hand, address {{the end of the day}} pain by preventing overstretch of the plantar fascia during prolonged weight bearing. Therefore, both night splints and arch supports may be necessary to treat plantar fasciitis as they complement each other by both controlling nocturnal contracture of the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon and reducing stresses imposed on the plantar fascia during the day, respectively. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that the <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> and arch support together would be more effective in the treatment of plantar fasciitis than a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> or arch support alone in terms of increasing the range of pain-free passive ankle dorsiflexion, relieving heel tenderness and pain, and reducing disability imposed by the heel pain/plantar fasciitis. A secondary hypothesis of this study was that those with less passive dorsiflexion of the ankle would benefit from a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> more than those with greater passive dorsiflexion of the ankle and those with a lower medial longitudinal arch would benefit from an arch support more than those with a higher medial longitudinal arch in terms of the previously mentioned outcome measures. Methodology: Subjects of this study were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Group I was treated with night splints, group II with arch supports, and group III with a combination of night splints and arch supports. Range of motion was measured with a goniometer; heel tenderness was measured with a pressure algometer; and pain and disability were measured by the Foot Function Index before and after six weeks of treatment. Results: Ninety patients with plantar fasciitis (23 men and 67 women) were enrolled in the study, 30 in each group. Demographic, compliance and baseline evaluation data showed no significant differences between the groups. Analysis of the post-intervention evaluation data demonstrated significant differences between group I and III and group II and III, but not between group I and II, for all outcome measures. The range of pain-free passive ankle joint dorsiflexion and medial longitudinal arch height were not useful predictors of the success of treatment with a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> and arch support for all outcome measures. Discussion: Using night splints and arch supports together may speed time to recovery by accelerating the healing process. Limitations of the study include observer's bias, subjects' bias, and short follow-up period. Conclusion: It was concluded that a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> and arch support together may be more effective in the treatment of plantar fasciitis than either a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> or arch support alone. Patients with plantar fasciitis who have less passive dorsiflexion of the ankle joint do not benefit from a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> more than those with greater passive dorsiflexion of the ankle joint. Patients with plantar fasciitis who have a lower medial longitudinal arch do not benefit from an arch support more than those with a higher medial longitudinal arch...|$|E

Participants 30 patients undergoing rehabilitation who were not yet walking and within three weeks of their first stroke. InterventionFor four weeks, one group wore a splint with the affected ankle at plantargrade, 7 nights per week, while the other group stood on a tilt table for 30 min with the ankle at maximum dorsiflexion, 5 times per week.

40|$|Hallux Abducto Valgus (HAV) is {{a common}} cause of foot pain causing {{deformity}} and often disability. The female population is more frequently affected by HAV than the male population with the two main causative factors being congenital and inappropriate footwear.

The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the efficacy of the Brantingham protocol versus the HAV <b>Night</b> <b>Splint</b> in the treatment of painful HAV. Thirty participants were selected to participate in the study and certain criteria had to be met. Participants were randomly divided into two groups, Group 1 was treated using a chiropractic protocol. The Brantingham Protocol that consisted of mobilization and specific adjustment of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was used. Group 2 was treated by the use of a HAV <b>Night</b> <b>Splint.</b> Patients were treated over a 2 -week period, twice a week with a 1 -week follow up and a 1 -month follow up. The lasting effect of the individual treatments was determined by the follow-up periods. Objective and subjective measurements were taken at each visit. Subjective measurements consisted of the McGill pain questionnaire (Melzack, 1975) (Appendix D), visual analogue scale (Masarsky and Todres-Masarsky, 2001) (Appendix B) and the foot function index pain scale (Saag et al., 1996) (Appendix C). Objective measurements consisted of passive Plantar and Dorsiflexion of the First metatarsophalangeal joint. The results indicated a statistical and numerical significance within and between each group both subjectively and objectively. Group 1 proved to be superior to Group 2 in the treatment of painful HAV.

40|$|Achilles {{tendinopathy}} {{is common}} and treatment with eccentric exercises seems promising. We designed a prospective randomized clinical trial {{to test the}} hypothesis that eccentric calf muscle exercises reduce pain and improve function in patients with Achilles tendinopathy. Forty-four patients were recruited from primary care (mean age: 45 years; 23 women; 65 % active in sports) and randomized to three treatment groups for 12 weeks: eccentric exercises, a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> or a combination of both treatments. Pain and function were evaluated at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks by the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score. At 6 weeks, the eccentric group reported a significant pain reduction (27 % compared with baseline, P= 0. 007) which lasted for 1 year (42 %, P= 0. 001). The two groups treated with a <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> also reported significant but less pain reduction than the eccentric group. Differences between all the three groups were not significant. At 12 weeks, the eccentric group reported significantly less pain than the splint-only group (P= 0. 04). More patients in the eccentric group than in the splint group returned to sport after 12 weeks. We conclude that eccentric exercises seem to reduce pain and improve function in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.

40|$|Overall Clinical Bottom Line: It is {{difficult}} to determine the effectiveness of stretching, orthoses, or <b>night</b> <b>splinting</b> in the treatment of plantar fasciitis, but none of these treatments appear to make plantar fasciitis symptoms worse. We still consider the use of these treatments because plantar fasciitis has been determined to be self limiting with conservative treatment. Since there is little evidence supporting one treatment over the other, we would first consider use of stretching and orthoses and later consider <b>night</b> <b>splinting</b> and custom orthoses due to their differing costs. There is a need for more quality and standardized research on conservative treatments of plantar fasciitis. Clinical Scenario: A middle aged, female patient was seeking help for plantar fasciitis during one of our clinical internships.

40|$|We {{assessed}} the therapeutic efficiency of ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) {{treatment of the}} median nerve in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded study. Forty-four patients with CTS were randomized into intervention or control groups. Patients in the intervention group were treated with PRF and <b>night</b> <b>splint,</b> and the control group was prescribed <b>night</b> <b>splint</b> alone. Primary outcome was the onset time of significant pain relief assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), and secondary outcomes included evaluation of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) results, cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. All outcome measurements were performed at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. Thirty-six patients completed the study. The onset time of pain relief in the intervention group was significantly shorter (median onset time of 2 days vs. 14 days; hazard ratio = 7. 37; 95 % CI, 3. 04 - 17. 87) compared to the control group (p < 0. 001). Significant improvement in VAS and BCTQ scores (p < 0. 05) was detected in the intervention group at all follow-up periods compared to the controls (except for the severity subscale of BCTQ at week 1). Ultrasound-guided PRF treatment resulted in a lower VAS score and stronger finger pinch compared to the control group over the entire study.

40|$|Background: Dupuytren's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} fibroproliferative disorder which can result in fixed flexion contractures of digits and impaired hand function. Standard treatment involves surgical release or excision followed by post-operative hand therapy and splinting, however the evidence supporting <b>night</b> <b>splinting</b> is of low quality and equivocal. Methods: A multi-centre, pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of <b>night</b> <b>splinting</b> on self-reported function, finger extension and satisfaction in patients undergoing fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy. 154 patients from 5 regional hospitals were randomised after surgery to receive hand therapy only (n = 77) or hand therapy with night-splinting (n = 77). Primary outcome was self-reported function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were finger range of motion and patient satisfaction. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. Results: 148 (96 %) patients completed follow-up at 12 months. No statistically significant differences were observed on the DASH questionnaire (0 - 100 scale: adjusted mean diff. 0. 66, 95 %CI - 2. 79 to 4. 11, p = 0. 703), total extension deficit of operated digits (degrees: adjusted mean diff 5. 11, 95 %CI - 2. 33 to 12. 55, p = 0. 172) or patient satisfaction (0 - 10 numerical rating scale: adjusted mean diff - 0. 35, 95 %CI - 1. 04 to 0. 34, p = 0. 315) at 1 year post surgery. Similarly, in a secondary per protocol analysis {{no statistically significant differences}} were observed between the groups in any of the outcomes. Conclusions: No differences were observed in self-reported upper limb disability or active range of motion between a group of patients who were all routinely splinted after surgery and a group of patients receiving hand therapy and only splinted if and when contractures occurred. Given the added expense of therapists' time, thermoplastic materials and the potential inconvenience to patients having to wear a device, the routine addition of night-time splinting for all patients after fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy is not recommended except where extension deficits reoccur...|$|R

Hallux valgus is 3 times more common in females that may cause uncomfortable deformity of foot, problem with wearing unsuitable and narrow-toed box shoes and pain {{on the inside of}} the big toe over the metatarsal joint, therefore patients may refer to physician. Untreated Hallux valgus may cause hamer toe deformity of the second toe. Materials and Methods: This study was a cohort study carried out on the patients referred to orthopedic clinic of Ashayer hospital with complaint of Hallux valgus. Two groups of 30 cases were ramdomly selected and then the splints designed by us were given to case group and <b>Night</b> <b>splint</b> and interdigital pad were given to the control group. The patients were followed for one year as every three months and in every time weight bearing antroposterior radiography of both foot were taken and Hallux valgus and inter metatarsal angles were measured, and data were analyzed using SPSS and repeated measure test. Results: In the patients who used our splints regularly Hallux valgus angles decresed more considerably than those who used splints available on the market (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: This study showed that despite the contraversies in nonoperative treatment of Hallux valgus, if the Hallux valgus angle of patients are mild to moderate, this splints can be used to treat it...|$|E
40|$|Context Hallux abducto valgus (HAV) is a {{frequent}} cause of great toe pain and disability, yet common treatments are only supported by mixed or equivocal research findings. Surgery often only provides modest improvement and post-surgery complications may significantly hamper outcomes, implying the need for trials testing conservative treatment, such as manual and manipulative therapy, particularly in cases where surgery may be contraindicated or premature. The purpose of this exploratory trial was to test an innovative protocol of manual and manipulative therapy (MMT) and compare it to standard care of a night splint(s) for symptomatic mild to moderate HAV, with a view gather insight into the effectiveness of MMT and inform {{the design of a}} definitive trial. Design Parallel-group randomised trial set in an out-patient teaching clinic. Participants A convenience sample of 75 patients was assessed for eligibility, with 30 participants (15 per group) being consented and randomly allocated to either the control group (standard care with a <b>night</b> <b>splint)</b> or the experimental group (MMT). Intervention Participants in the control group used a night splint(s) and those in the experimental group (MMT) received a structured protocol of MMT, with the participants in the experimental group receiving 4 treatments over a 2 -week period. Outcome measures Visual analogue scale (HAV-related pain), foot function index (HAV-related disability) and hallux dorsiflexion (goniometry). Results There were no participant dropouts and no data was missing. There were no statistical (p < 0. 05) or clinically meaningful differences (MCID < 20...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Despite {{numerous}} {{publications and}} clinical trials, {{the results of}} treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis with extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) still remain equivocal {{as to whether or}} not this treatment reduce pain and improve functional disabilities associated with chronic plantar fasciitis compared to placebo group. The purpose of this study was to clarify the value of low-energy radial extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (rESWT) for plantar fasciitis. Subjects: This study was randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical study. Forty six adult subjects with unilateral plantar fasciitis were classified randomly into two equal groups. Methods: The active treatment group received a total 3 treatments (3 x 2000 impulses) with 0. 16 mJ/mm 2, 2. 5 bars and frequency of 8 Hz given at weekly interval and the placebo group received the identical treatment procedures but shame exposed to shock-wave therapy. All patients were allowed to use previously described <b>night</b> <b>splint.</b> Pain and limitation of foot function were measured at baseline, after 3 weeks of treatment and after 6 weeks of follow up by visual analog scale (V AS) and ankle-hind foot scale (AHFS) respectively. Results: The results revealed significant reduction of pain in both treated and placebo groups after 3 weeks of treatment P<. O. 0001 and p=O. 0050 respectively, while after 3 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks of follow up the percentage of improvement with respect to baseline was (- 32. 11 % versus - 63. 63 %) in contrast to (- 10. 17 % versus - 8. 48 %) for placebo group. On other hand there was significant improvement in foot function only in treated group both after 3 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks of follow up (23. 71 % versus 36. 84 %;P<O. 0001) and (- 2. 6 % versus - 1. 44 %;P=O. 3087) respectively. Conclusion: Despite the small number of patients in this study, low-energy rESWT was an effective non-invasive treatment method for chronic plantar fasciitis and may help the patients to avoid surgery...|$|E
40|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{the most}} common cause of inferior heel pain. The pain and discomfort associated with this condition can have a dramatic impact on physical mobility. The etiology of this condition is not clearly understood and is probably multi-factorial in nature. Weight gain, occupation-related activity, anatomical variations, poor biomechanics, overexertion, and inadequate footwear are contributing factors. Although plantar fasciitis is generally regarded as a self-limited condition, it can take months to years to resolve, presenting a challenge for clinicians. Many treatment options are available that demonstrate variable levels of efficacy. Conservative therapies include rest and avoidance of potentially aggravating activities, stretching and strengthening exercises, orthotics, arch supports, and <b>night</b> <b>splinting.</b> Other considerations include use of anti-inflammatory agents, ultrasonic Shockwave therapy, and, in the most extreme cases, surgery. This article reviews plantar fasciitis, presents the most effective treatment options currently available, and proposes nutritional considerations that may be beneficial in the management of this condition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Dupuytren's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} fibroproliferative disorder which can result in fixed flexion contractures of digits and impaired hand function. Standard treatment involves surgical release or excision followed by post-operative hand therapy and splinting, however the evidence supporting <b>night</b> <b>splinting</b> is of low quality and equivocal. Methods A multi-centre, pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of <b>night</b> <b>splinting</b> on self-reported function, finger extension and satisfaction in patients undergoing fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy. 154 patients from 5 regional hospitals were randomised after surgery to receive hand therapy only (n = 77) or hand therapy with night-splinting (n = 77). Primary outcome was self-reported function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were finger range of motion and patient satisfaction. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. Results 148 (96 %) patients completed follow-up at 12 months. No statistically significant differences were observed on the DASH questionnaire (0 - 100 scale: adjusted mean diff. 0. 66, 95 %CI - 2. 79 to 4. 11, p = 0. 703), total extension deficit of operated digits (degrees: adjusted mean diff 5. 11, 95 %CI - 2. 33 to 12. 55, p = 0. 172) or patient satisfaction (0 - 10 numerical rating scale: adjusted mean diff - 0. 35, 95 %CI - 1. 04 to 0. 34, p = 0. 315) at 1 year post surgery. Similarly, in a secondary per protocol analysis {{no statistically significant differences}} were observed between the groups in any of the outcomes. Conclusions No differences were observed in self-reported upper limb disability or active range of motion between a group of patients who were all routinely splinted after surgery and a group of patients receiving hand therapy and only splinted if and when contractures occurred. Given the added expense of therapists' time, thermoplastic materials and the potential inconvenience to patients having to wear a device, the routine addition of night-time splinting for all patients after fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy is not recommended except where extension deficits reoccur.

40|$|Clinical Bottom Line: Research {{shows that}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is a syndrome {{resulting from a}} multitude of factors that cannot be addressed by any single treatment currently available. Rather, each contributing factor should be independently identified and addressed {{as part of a}} comprehensive treatment regimen that is individualized to each patient’s clinical presentation. That being said, the majority of our patients are likely to benefit from the inclusion of off-the-shelf orthotics, as well as Achilles and plantar fascia-specific stretches. <b>Night</b> <b>splints,</b> custom orthotics, manipulation and taping would be recommended only under circumstances where conditions such as aberrant foot/ankle joint mobility or biomechanical defects are present, or if there has been poor responsiveness to first-line treatments. Clinical Scenario: Heel pain, particularly when associated with the plantar aponeurosis, {{is one of the most}} commonly reported foot problems in adults. Through our clinical experience it seems that there is little agreement on standardization of conservative therapy options in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. Although many of these treatments have reputedly provided some level of relief, the final long-term outcomes, as well as the financial and personal burden imposed by each treatment, appear inconsistent throughout the literature. We plan to learn which conservative measures within the scope of physical therapy practice are efficacious in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. Our Clinically Answerable Question: P: Population is to include adult subjects aged 18 - 65 years old who present to an outpatient physical therapy clinic with chronic plantar fasciitis persisting for at least 6 months. I: Intervention of conservative physical therapy treatments including: <b>night</b> <b>splints,</b> Achilles stretching, plantar fascia stretching, customized orthotics, over-the-counter orthotics (heel lifts or cups, arch supports, padding), manual therapy mobilizations. Treatment options may be prescribed in combination or individually. C: Comparison group is a control group that received sham/placebo, or no treatment. O: Outcomes should demonstrate improvement of symptoms as measured by a decrease of pain score on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and/or increased functional outcomes as measured by functional outcome surveys and questionnaires that ideally address one or more of the following: 1) tolerance for general activity, 2) ability to participate in sports, 3) tolerance for prolonged standing/walking, and 4) satisfaction...|$|R
