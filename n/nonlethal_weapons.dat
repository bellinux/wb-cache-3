40|$|The TASER X 26 {{electronic}} control device (ECD) is a handgun-shaped device that uses compressed nitrogen to fire darts ranging from 9 to 14 mm in length that impale the clothes or skin {{of an individual}} up to a distance of 35 ft. Wires connect the darts to the device. The TASER X 26 functions as a constant current generator and delivers an initial 50 000 -V to begin an arcing shock (the actual voltage delivered to the body is {{in the range of}} 1400 – 2520 V), followed by electric pulses of 105 - to 155 -microsecond duration, at a frequency of ≈ 19 Hz (≈ 1140 times per minute), and 80 - to 125 -microcoulomb delivered charge. 1 A single trigger pull discharges a 5 -second cycle that can be shortened by a safety switch to deactivate the device or prolonged if the trigger pull is held. The trigger can be activated multiple times. The X 26 data port stores the time and date of use and number and duration of trigger pulls. If effective, the shock elicits neuromuscular inhibition, allowing law enforcement to gain control of a suspect (see www. you-tube. com/watch?v=ACUjnJBHIZc for a TASER demonstra-tion). The device can also be applied in a “drive-stun ” mode by directly pressing the X 26 ECD against the skin to achieve pain compliance without neuromuscular inhibition. The TASER X 26 is the most widely sold ECD. Called a less lethal or <b>nonlethal</b> <b>weapon</b> because {{it is supposed to be}} deployed to temporarily incapacitate, not to kill the subject, the X 26 is not considered a firearm and therefore is not regulated by th...|$|R

5000|$|In 2005, Igor Kanterov, a {{professor}} of the Moscow State University, wrote that psychiatrists and psychologists were actually being involved in a very unattractive occupation, stigmatizing [...] "alien" [...] religions and their followers, who were about 1 million first-class citizens of the Russian Federation, and putting them [...] "on {{the basis of a}} list of them" [...] in the category of [...] "psychic terrorists." [...] While reviewing Sidorov's article [...] "Psychic terrorism is <b>nonlethal</b> <b>weapon</b> of mass destruction" [...] published by the Rossiyskiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal in its issue 3 of 2005, Kanterov notes that, according to it, religious behavior is regarded as inherently deviant from the [...] "norm", that similar type of behavior is always dependent and imposed by recruiting and manipulative influence and that, thus, the possibility to be initiated into religious organizations due to free choice of religious belief guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation is outright rejected. In his 2010 article, Kanterov writes about the works by P.I. Sidorov and V.E. Pashkovskiy and points out that inspired by the desire to expose the malicious actions of [...] "totalitarian cults," [...] P.I. Sidorov and V.E. Pashkovskiy at the same time never resort to Russian laws regulating activity of religious associations, and it can hardly be considered accidental, since all the original sets of the authors are in flagrant contravention of current legislation. The Federal Law of the Russian Federation [...] "On Freedom of Conscience and on Religious Associations" [...] contains the following types of associations of believers: religious groups, religious organizations, local and centralized religious associations, and its legislator mentions about no [...] "sects," [...] "cults," [...] especially with the frightening adjectives [...] "destructive" [...] or [...] "totalitarian." [...] However, in Kanterov's words, peer-reviewed publications use the term [...] "totalitarian sects" [...] as a key concept that naturally generates psychiatric disorders and produces horror stories about [...] "psychic terrorism," [...] "non-lethal weapon of mass destruction," [...] "usurpation of belongings and savings of followers," [...] "recruitment," [...] etc. P.I. Sidorov presents a list of [...] "totalitarian cults" [...] with the names of over twenty religious organizations, and many of them have status of registered centralized organizations that successfully passed registration and re-registration provided for by the Law [...] "On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations" [...] after the Expert Council for Religious Examination under the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation made for each of these organizations expert reports, in which the detailed assessment of the religious doctrine, rituals, attitude of the religious organizations to society, family, and individual were given, but no violations were found.|$|R

5000|$|A {{major factor}} in SWAT 4 is {{selecting}} appropriate equipment to use for the mission. Several firearms are available for use. For most guns, {{it is possible to}} choose between standard hollow point ammunition (which is better suited for those enemies in light armor or with no armor as it has good stopping power and can cause the most damage to unarmored targets), and full metal jacket ammunition, which provides better penetration and is advised for use against heavily armored targets. In addition, the player can choose a loadout of less-than-lethal weapons, which do not have the capacity to incapacitate or kill but instead force compliance, and other pieces of tactical equipment. There are two primary weapons that are non-lethal and one secondary. The primary ones are the non-lethal shotgun, which fires beanbags at a high muzzle velocity, which causes disorientation and intense pain, and the [...] "pepperball" [...] gun, which is essentially a heavy duty paintball gun that fires paintballs filled with a chemical irritant. The only available secondary weapon that is not lethal is the Taser. The other piece of non-lethal tactical equipment is pepper spray, which can be carried alongside other tactical equipment: stingers, flashbangs, CS gas, door wedges and the Opti-wand. In the Stetchkov Syndicate, two additional <b>nonlethal</b> <b>weapons</b> are introduced: the less-lethal grenade launcher, which can fire batons, flashbangs, CS gas, and stingers; and the Cobra stun gun, which fires either one or two Taser shots at once or {{can be used as a}} contact stun gun.|$|E

40|$|Asymmetric warfare is {{creating}} a new frontierfor bioethics as military organizations rushto develop nonlethal, medicalized weapons. Faced with small but increasingly sophisticated guer-rilla organizations that intermingle at will with the civilian population, the United States {{and many of its}} allies are searching for ways to disable insurgents while minimizing harm to civilians. One avenue is to build increasingly sophisticated “precision-guided munitions”—“smart, ” high-explosive bombs that, in theory, zero in on and destroy their targets without widespread collateral damage. However, these weapons—the purview of electronics and ballistic experts—can only go so far. Very often, there are no clearly defined guerrilla targets, or, as often happens, the targets are destroyed early on. <b>Nonlethal</b> <b>weapons</b> are an increasingly attractive option for rooting out insurgents without bringing catastrophic harm to civilians. Rather than disabling or killing enemy forces by causing traumatic injury, <b>nonlethal</b> <b>weapons</b> temporarily incapacitate their targets by causing physical distress, disorientation, or unconsciousness.

40|$|On Sunday, Apr. 19, 2015, {{an article}} in the daily {{newspaper}} in Athens announced that Athens-Clarke County Police have already received a shipment of 145 tasers and will soon begin using them on the citizenry of this county.

Use of a nonlethal weapon may and sometimes does result in death or serious injury. In recent years, at least 600 Americans, perhaps as many as 1, 000, have died suddenly, unexpectedly, or shortly after being shocked by tasers deployed by police. An even larger number of Americans have gone into cardiac arrest, stopped breathing, been rendered comatose or have been otherwise seriously or permanently injured by police deploying this supposedly nonlethal electrical shock device that inflicts excruciating pain.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, Western {{military}} forces became frequently involved in missions to stabilize conflicts around the world. In those conflicts, the {{military forces}} increasingly found themselves operating among the people. The emerging need in military interventions to prevent casualties translated into a range of value-driven military technological developments, such as military robots and <b>nonlethal</b> <b>weapons</b> (NLW). NLWs are characterized by a certain technological and operational design 2 ̆ 2 window 2 ̆ 2 of permissible physiological effect, defined at each end by values: one value is a controlled physiological impact to enforce compliance by targeted individuals and the other value is the prevention of inflicting serious harm of fatality. Robot drones, mine detectors, and sensing devices are employed on the battlefield but are operated at a safe distance by humans. Their deployment serves to decrease casualties and traumatic stress among own military personnel and seeks to enhance efficiency and tactical and operational superiority. This chapter points out that societal and political implications of designing for values in the military domain are governed by a fundamentally different scheme than is the case in the civil domain. The practical cases examined illustrate how values incorporated in military concept and system designs are exposed to counteraction and annihilation when deployed in real-world operational missions...|$|E
