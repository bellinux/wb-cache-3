5|$|This three Test series saw the West Indies re-establish {{themselves}} as the superior team. They won the first Test at The Oval by 158 runs, with Clive Lloyd's 132 with the bat and Keith Boyce's bowling (147/11 in the match) being the main contributions to the win. The drawn match at Edgbaston was {{at risk of being}} abandoned when umpire Arthur Fagg threatened to withdraw after Kanhai disputed one of his decisions. The final Test match at Lord's was dominated by the West Indies, with the team posting a huge total of 652/8 before declaring, Kanhai, Sobers and Bernard Julien all getting centuries. England <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> liked matching this total, and were dismissed for 233 in the first innings and 193 in the second, losing by an innings and 226 runs. This was England's second biggest defeat in Test cricket. The series finished 2–0 to the West Indies, who regained the Wisden Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{traveling}} without {{key players}} Marion Motley and Bill Willis because of Florida's segregation laws, Cleveland beat Miami in a shutout {{for the second}} time in the season, winning 34–0. Fueled by the ire the entire team felt because of leaving friends behind, Otto Graham opened the scoring with a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown and the Browns <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back. Three other Browns players – Edgar Jones, Gaylon Smith and Gene Fekete – ran for touchdowns. Fekete's touchdown was the only one of his short professional career. Groza kicked two field goals, giving him 12 on the season and tying the all-time professional record set in 1926 by Paddy Driscoll. Cleveland led Miami in all phases of the game, amassing 159 yards rushing to Miami's eight and 233 yards of total offense. Miami gained a total of 46 yards rushing and passing. As the Browns prepared to face the Dodgers in the last game of the regular season, they looked ahead to a matchup in the AAFC championship in Cleveland on December 22 with the New York Yankees, the winners the eastern division.|$|E
5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in the new home stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy trotted out to a slot receiver position. Chiles <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> to pass; he ran up the middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On that drive, Chiles line up in the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how much playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly shook English {{confidence}} in the Third Test, played on a placid surface at Old Trafford, by taking three wickets in four balls. Cyril Walters, who {{up to that point}} had been untroubled, failed to pick the bosie and thus inside edged the ball to short leg. Bob Wyatt came in and was clean bowled for a golden duck, bringing Hammond in to face the hat-trick ball. The new batsman inside edged the ball past the stumps and through the legs of wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, but the next delivery clean bowled him. This left England at 3/72, and O'Reilly removed Sutcliffe soon after, but the batsmen settled down and the next wicket did not come until Hendren fell just {{before the end of the}} first day's play. England were 5/355 and O'Reilly had taken each wicket. The next day, the hosts ended on 9/627, despite a relentless 59 overs from O'Reilly, who ended with 7/189 and was the only bowler to challenge the batsmen. The high-scoring match <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> likely to produce a result, except when Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on. They were 55 runs away from the follow on mark of 478 at the end of the third day with two wickets in hand, and O'Reilly was on one. The next day Arthur Chipperfield fell with 24 runs still needed and O'Reilly and Wall saw them to 491 before the latter fell. O'Reilly ended with 30 not out after an innings in which he was lucky not to be caught off an edge multiple times.|$|E

The West Indies <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> competitive, with only Runako Morton getting past fifty, going on to make 110 not out off 155.

25|$|Australia {{declared}} on 239 for {{the loss}} of eight wickets in the second innings, riding on the backs of Greg Blewett's 88 and Adam Gilchrist's quick 43. India needed 396 to win in the last innings and <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> to make match of it, as they collapsed for 110 in just 39 overs. Australia won by 285 runs and Steve Waugh was Man of the Match for his 150 in the first innings.|$|E
25|$|Sunline then ventured {{north to}} Sydney {{to tackle the}} Doncaster Handicap (1,600 metres). Despite taking on older horses for the first time, and {{starting}} from a wide starting gate, Sunline was sent {{out one of the}} shortest-priced favourites in the race's long history, at 10/9 (approximately $2.10). Sunline went straight to the front and <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back to score by one-and-three-quarter lengths. She became just the fourth filly to win in the modern history of the race.|$|E
25|$|The World XI <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> like {{challenging}} this total.

Only Sangakkara's innings gave any hope, {{but when he}} was out for 65 to leave the World XI on 6 for 101, needing 7 runs an over off the last 22 overs, the game was over. Australia eventually wrapped up the World XI's innings for 162 to record a comprehensive 93-run victory.|$|E
