25|$|The <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> is attested in the Fuzhou dialect, as well {{as being}} found in the Southern Min group and in {{varieties}} of Mandarin Chinese, including Beijing-based Standard Mandarin. It is commonly found in some modal particles, aspect markers, and some question-forming negative particles that come after units made up of one tone sandhi domain, and in some adverbs, aspect markers, conjunctions etc. that come before such units. These two types, the post-nucleus and the pre-nucleus <b>neutral</b> <b>tone,</b> exhibit different tone sandhi behavior. Disyllabic <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> words are also attested, as are some inter-nuclei neutral tones, mainly connected to the use of 蜀 siŏh // in verbal reduplication.|$|E
25|$|Tongyong uses tone marks like Zhuyin, {{not like}} Hanyu Pinyin. Tongyong Pinyin has no mark {{for the first}} tone but a dot for the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> (optional on computers).|$|E
25|$|Zvi Baras, {{in a book}} {{edited by}} Feldman, also assumes that Origen had seen {{a version of the}} Testimonium that {{included}} no interpolations. Baras asserts that a Testimonium seen by Origen must have had a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone,</b> and included no derogatory references towards Christians, and hence required no reaction from Origen. Baras claims that the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> of the Testimonium was then modified between the time of Origen and Eusebius, though Baras gives no arguments why this should be more likely than the hypothesis that the Testimonium originated in the Eusebius passage where it first appears.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> in Urumqi Chinese from the instrumental and theoretical perspectives. Our major finding contradicts a popular view in that <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> are primarily cued by shorter phonetic length. In this language, tonal neutralization is thus also attributable to difficulties in maintaining contrasts in a durationally diminished syllable. An OT analysis is subsequently provided {{to account for}} the phenomena found in the Urumqi Chinese data. In particular, we argue {{that there is a need}} for the notion of Kenstowicz’s (1996) UNIFORM EXPONENCE in analyzing phonetic realization of underlying tonal targets. 1...|$|R
50|$|Very rarely, a tone letter {{consists}} {{of more than}} three elements (peaking or dipping tones), but occasionally, double-peaking or double-dipping tones are encountered. Reversed tone letters {{may be used for}} tone sandhi, and dot-plus-bar <b>tone</b> letters for <b>neutral</b> <b>tones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mandarin dialects {{frequently}} employ <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> in {{the second}} syllables of words, creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light {{that it is difficult}} or impossible to discriminate. These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.|$|R
25|$|Taiwanese is a tonal language, so {{the pitch}} (tone) of a spoken word affects its meaning, {{same as the}} written words. However, in non-tonal languages, a word's pitch {{constantly}} conveys emotion but often does not influence its meaning. In Taiwanese, which has nine tones and two extra tones, <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> and nasal vowel.|$|E
25|$|As {{shown in}} the {{following}} table, tone marks for the second, third, and fourth tones are shared between bopomofo and pinyin. In bopomofo, {{the lack of a}} marker is used to indicate the first tone while a dot above indicates the fifth tone (also known as the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone).</b> In pinyin, a macron indicates the first tone and the lack of a marker indicates the fifth tone.|$|E
25|$|Claudia Setzer {{states that}} few have {{questioned}} {{the authenticity of the}} James passage, partly based on the observation that a Christian interpolator would have provided more praise for James. Setzer states that the passage indicates that Josephus, a Jewish historian writing {{towards the end of the}} first century, could use a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> towards Christians, with some tones of sympathy, implying that they may be worthy of Roman protection.|$|E
50|$|More {{often than}} not, {{character}} colorisations tend {{to represent the}} character in some way. A more subdued character will be coloured with lighter tones, while a flamboyant character will be done in bright tones. Similarly, villains are often coloured in darker tones, while colder characters will be given <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> (black, white, grey, etc.).|$|R
2500|$|Distinctive {{features}} of the Beijing dialect are the use of erhua, a final [...] "er" [...] (...) sound, often as a diminutive, in vocabulary items that are left unadorned in descriptions of the standard such as the Xiandai Hanyu Cidian, {{as well as more}} <b>neutral</b> <b>tones.</b> An example of standard versus Beijing dialect would be the standard men (door) and Beijing menr.|$|R

The reports try to appear <b>neutral,</b> <b>toning</b> down the jihadist language and sectarian slurs ISIL uses in its official releases.|$|R
25|$|The Zoozoos are small-bodied, thin women {{covered in}} layers of white fabric. Each facial {{expression}} {{is made of}} rubber and pasted on the actors {{to cut down on}} the time and cost for shoot. The effect was achieved by a variety of methods including choosing the right material for the body suits to ensure that there were no wrinkles when the characters moved, shooting the footage at lower framerates and keeping backgrounds simple in terms of details and the use of a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> of grey. The sets were made larger than life to make the characters look small as the producers could not take children as the schedule of shooting was odd.|$|E
500|$|A single hyphen {{is used to}} {{indicate}} a compound. What constitutes a compound is controversial, with some authors equating it to a [...] "word" [...] in English, and others not willing to limit it to the English concept of a word. Examples from POJ include [...] "forty", [...] "circus", and [...] "recover (from illness)". The rule-based sandhi behaviour of tones in compounds {{has not yet been}} clearly defined by linguists. A double hyphen [...] is used when POJ is deployed as an orthography (rather than as a transcription system) {{to indicate}} that the following syllable should be pronounced in the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone.</b> It also marks to the reader that the preceding syllable does not undergo tone sandhi, as it would were the following syllable non-neutral. Morphemes following a double hyphen are often (but not always) grammatical function words.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more <b>neutral</b> <b>tone,</b> stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E

5000|$|Wang's {{research}} applied phonological {{theories to}} the analysis of Chinese phonological phenomena. His main research was in phonology with a special focus on [...] "neutral tone", i.e. syllables without or losing lexical tone. At the time of his death, he was near the completion of his project on the analysis of <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> across Chinese dialects (National Social Science Foundation of China).|$|R
2500|$|A dot (usually {{written as}} a period or full stop) may be placed before <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> (unstressed) syllables, which appear in their {{original}} tonal spelling: perng.yeou, dih.fang (péngyou, dìfang). [...] Y.R. Chao used this device in the first eight chapters of the Mandarin Primer, restricting it thereafter to new words on their first appearance. In A Grammar of Spoken Chinese he introduced a subscript circle (o) to indicate an optional <b>neutral</b> <b>tone,</b> as in bujyodaw, [...] "don't know" [...] (Pinyin pronunciation bùzhīdào or bùzhīdao).|$|E
2500|$|Most Standard Chinese as spoken on Taiwan differs {{mostly in}} the tones of some words {{as well as some}} vocabulary. Minimal use of the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> and erhua (final [...] "er"; [...] ), and {{technical}} vocabulary constitute the greatest divergences between the two forms.|$|E
2500|$|Examples {{for these}} tones: ciūⁿ (elephant), bâ (leopard), bhè (horse), di (pig), zŭa (snake), āh (duck), lok (deer).

2500|$|Reports that explosive-packed {{terrorist}} {{dogs were}} being released in London by the IRA. These [...] "bomb dogs" [...] wreak havoc, and prompt the British police to begin executing any dog on sight. This story {{is accompanied by}} a clip of Steve Coogan impersonating a Gerry Adams-esque Sinn Féin leader, spouting rhetoric while inhaling helium to subtract credibility from his statement. This was a satirical comment on broadcasters' responses to the law at the time, which prevented any Sinn Féin spokesperson from being heard in radio and television; their words would instead be dubbed by an actor speaking in a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> of voice.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} other speeches shared much of the anti-American rhetoric. Journalist Francoise Bondy noted that the Soviet {{delegation}} was particularly unfriendly and aggressive towards many of the Western delegates, and their actions sowed much discord into the conference, ruining the attempts by Polish delegates to salvage the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> of the event. The final act of the conference was a resolution to defend world peace. The resolution applauded democracy which saved the world from fascism, and criticized the governments (but explicitly, not the people) of United States and United Kingdom, arguing that {{a small group of}} greed-motivated individuals in America and Europe [...] "inherited" [...] the evils of fascism, and are planning a coup d'état against the world's peace. Only 11 delegates voted against (7 out of 32 from the US, and 4 out of 32 from the UK). Another source notes that 371 out of 391 delegates voted in support.|$|E
2500|$|The {{forces of}} the East India Company in India were forced by {{casualties}} to dye their white summer tunics to <b>neutral</b> <b>tones,</b> initially a tan called khaki (from the Hindi word for [...] "dusty"). This was a temporary measure which became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the Second Boer War in 1902, did the entire British Army standardise on dun for Service Dress. The Indian Army uniform standardises on dun for khaki.|$|R
50|$|Lear {{wanted to}} shoot {{in black and}} white as Till Death Us Do Part had been. While CBS insisted on color, Lear had the set {{furnished}} in <b>neutral</b> <b>tones,</b> keeping everything relatively devoid of color. As costume designer Rita Riggs described in her 2001 Archive of American Television interview, Lear's idea was to create the feeling of sepia tones, in an attempt to make viewers feel as if they were looking at an old family album.|$|R
50|$|The New Nakeds {{embraced a}} radically {{different}} aesthetic than the norm of the time: foundations that featured a yellow undertone, instead of pink or peach; eyeshadows, lipstick and blushes were brown-based, <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> that were free of the pastel, vivid, or sparkly colors cosmetics companies knew sold better. Although Ultima II (and all of Revlon's beauty divisions) were in a decline at the time, the New Nakeds resuscitated interest in the brand and help re-establish Ultima II as a viable competitor in the prestige arena.|$|R
2500|$|Robert Van Voorst {{states that}} most modern {{scholars}} {{believe that the}} Testimonium is partially authentic, and has a reference to Jesus. However, he states that scholars are divided on {{the tone of the}} original reference and while some scholars believe that it had a negative tone which was softened by Christian interpolators, others believe that it had a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone,</b> in keeping with the style and approach of Josephus regarding the issue. According to Van Voorst, scholars who support the negative reconstruction contend that the reference read something like [...] "source of further trouble in Jesus a wise man" [...] and that it stated [...] "he was the so-called Christ". Van Voorst states that most scholars support a neutral reconstruction which states [...] "Around this time lived Jesus, a wise man" [...] and includes no reference to [...] "he was the Christ". Van Voorst states that if the original references to Jesus had had a negative tone, the Christian scribes would have likely deleted it entirely. Van Voorst also states that the neutral reconstruction fits better with the Arabic Testimonium discovered by Pines in the 1970s. Van Voorst states that the neutral reconstruction is supported by the majority of scholars because it involves far less conjectural wording and fits better with the style of Josephus.|$|E

5000|$|The subtle {{form and}} natural, subdued colors of Hagi ware are highly regarded.
