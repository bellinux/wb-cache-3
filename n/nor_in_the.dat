5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even some cities had their own system of measurement.

30|$|Therefore, {{nucleolus}} and NOR counts play {{an important}} role in determining polyploidy using chromosome counting and flow cytometry in a cytogenetic study. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> chromosome metaphase of Korean rose bitterling, there were 2 <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diploid, while the tetraploids contained 4 (arrows <b>in</b> Fig.  3). <b>The</b> nucleolus <b>in</b> cells had 1 or 2 diploids; however, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> induced tetraploid, 1, 2, 3, and 4 NORs were observed (Fig.  4). Similar to the current results, the triploid induction study of far eastern catfish, Silurus asotus, showed 1, 2, and 3 <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> triploid. This was not considered a chromosome aberration, but the exact result directed from triploid (Kim et al. 2001). <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> tetraploidy induction study of salmon embryos using hydrostatic pressure shock was reported by inducing polyploid mosaics with 4 or more nucleoli. Therefore, <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> induced tetraploid bitterling supported induced tetraploid polyploidization, and not an aneuploid result from chromosome aberration. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> tendency that tetraploid fries of bitterling, appeared small compared with diploid fries, supported a similar result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study of induced tetraploid mud loach (Fig.  1; Nam et al. 2001 a).|$|R

5|$|Chamberlain and {{the entire}} {{subsequent}} government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared.

5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, <b>nor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the other}} kings of the Fifth Dynasty, Shepseskare's name appears neither in the {{personal}} names of people of the time <b>nor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> names of funerary estates.

For example, the stela of the Fifth Dynasty official Khau-Ptah lists an uninterrupted sequence of kings whom he served under, namely Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre. The omission of Shepseskare, be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign {{must have been very}} short. Since Manetho's Aegyptiaca dates to the 3rd century BC, Khau-Ptah's contemporary account can be regarded as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E

30|$|The {{pattern of}} the NORs {{distribution}} is rather uniform among populations of mole rats with varying chromosomal numbers.

5|$|University of Iowa student Kineke Alexander {{qualified}} for the 400m sprint, an event in which she earned eight all-American honors during college competitions. Her participation in the Beijing Olympics marked her Olympic debut. At the Games Alexander competed {{in the first round}} of the event on 16 August. She was placed in Heat 6 and ranked fourth, completing the race in 52.87seconds. She was 0.01 seconds faster than Grenada's Trish Bartholomew (5th place), 0.10 seconds slower than Sudan's Nawal El Jack (3rd place), and 1.35 seconds slower than heat leader Novelene Williams of Jamaica. Overall, in the first round, Alexander ranked 32 out of 50 competitors, finishing just ahead of Bartholomew and India's Mandeep Kaur and just behind Poland's Monika Bejnar. The overall round one leader, the United States' Sanya Richards, ran 2.33seconds faster than Alexander. Alexander did not advance to the semifinal round, as she was neither in the top three places in her given heat <b>nor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top three fastest of those who did fall below third place in their heats.|$|E
5|$|When {{viewed in}} mass, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear to be white. Viewed with a light microscope, the basidiospores are 8–10.5 by 4.5–5.5µm, , smooth, and {{yellowish}} in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored and measure 48–65 long by 6–8µm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species. The pileipellis (cap cuticle) is made of a broad (175–350µm) gelatinous zone, composed of loosely interwoven, slender (1.5–4µm) hyphae; the surface hyphae are a —a dark brownish-gray color. This hyphal arrangement is called an , in which the hyphal walls swell up and gelatinize, giving a translucence to the layer that stands out {{in contrast to the}} underlying flesh. The layer of gelatizined hyphae is tenacious, and may be peeled off the cap as a film. Although clamp connections are found on the hyphae that make up the flesh of the gill, none are found in the cap flesh <b>nor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pileipellis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this investigation, {{patterns}} of variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nucleolus organizer regions (<b>NORs)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chromosomes of Spalax leucodon and Spalax ehrenbergi were studied. The chromosomal {{location of the}} Ag-NORs was determined in two mole rat species. S. leucodon has 3 pairs of nucleolar chromosomes, but S. ehrenbergi has only 2 pairs of nucleolar chromosomes in their whole chromosome sets. In both mole rat species, the chromosomal locations of Ag-NORs were determined {{to be on the}} terminal of the short arms of the subtelocentrics. The possibilty of Robertsonian translocation and the loss of paracentric <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> S. ehrenbergi were discussed from an evolutionary point of view...|$|R
