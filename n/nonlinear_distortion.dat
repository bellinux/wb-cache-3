40|$|Abstract: Recently, a {{measurement}} set-up {{was presented to}} detect small <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortions</b> in the vibration of acoustically driven mechanical systems. A speaker generates a specially designed multisine excitation signal that drives the vibration of a test object. The generated sound pressure is measured with a probe microphone {{in front of the}} test object, and an heterodyne vibrometer measures the corresponding vibration. Due to the high degree of linearity of the heterodyne technique, very small <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortions</b> can be detected. In this paper the set-up is used to verify whether small <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortions</b> are present in the vibration of the middle ear system, which is classically considered to be a completely linear system. In vitro measurements on the right ear of an adult male gerbil proved that <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortions</b> are present in the vibration of the tympanic membrane. Similar results were seen in measurements on the left ear. The influence of post-mortem changes on the nonlinear behaviour of the middle ear was verified in a number of successive measurements. These indicated that the nonlinear behaviour of the middle ear decreases in time...|$|R

5000|$|The word {{distortion}} {{refers to}} any modification of wave {{form of a}} signal, but in music {{it is used to}} refer to <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortion</b> (excluding filters) and particularly to the introduction of new frequencies by memoryless nonlinearities. In music the different forms of linear distortion have specific names describing them. The simplest of these is a distortion process known as [...] "volume adjustment", which involves distorting the amplitude of a sound wave in a proportional (or ‘linear’) way in order to increase or decrease the volume of the sound without affecting the tone quality. In the context of music, the most common source of (<b>nonlinear)</b> <b>distortion</b> is clipping in amplifier circuits and is most commonly known as overdrive.|$|E

First, the principle of FOT-measurements and nonlinear variance analysis is explained. Two methods are considered to detect nonlinear effects: a robust method and a fast method. These methods are employed to compare the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortions</b> in a prototype device and a commercial device, respectively.

50|$|Isolation {{transformers}} are transformers for {{low frequency}} analog and digital audio connections or rarely for high-frequencies in antenna cables between TV outlets and devices (tuner, VCR, TV, etc.). This filter then suppresses low-frequency ground loop currents on the sheath and core of coaxial cables, which {{can result from}} multiple grounds at different potentials. They affect the signal because of their upper and lower frequency limits and therefore can not transmit DC. In addition, analog signals can suffer from <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortion,</b> especially near the frequency limits of the device.|$|E
50|$|Coupling {{capacitors}} {{can also}} introduce <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortion</b> at low frequencies. This {{is not an}} issue at high frequencies because the voltage across the capacitor stays very close to zero. However, if a signal is allowed to pass through the coupling that is low relative to the RC cutoff frequency, voltages can develop across the capacitor, which for some capacitor types results in changes of capacitance, leading to distortion. This is avoided by choosing capacitor types that have low voltage coefficient, and by using large values that put the cutoff frequency far lower than the frequencies of the signal.|$|E

5000|$|Some audiophiles {{believe that}} the {{clipping}} behavior of vacuum tubes {{with little or no}} negative feedback is superior to that of transistors, in that vacuum tubes clip more gradually than transistors (i.e. soft clipping, and mostly even harmonics), resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable. In general though, the distortion associated with clipping is unwanted, and is visible on an oscilloscope even if it is inaudible. Even in a transistorised amplifier with hard clipping, the gain of the transistor will be reducing (leading to <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortion)</b> as the output current increases and the voltage across the transistor reduces close to the saturation voltage (for bipolar transistors), and so [...] "full power" [...] for the purposes of measuring distortion in amplifiers is usually taken as a few percent below clipping.|$|E
50|$|In his experiment, {{he set up}} a room {{which was}} divided diagonally by a {{visually}} opaque but acoustically transparent screen. The screen incorporated a concealed low-pass acoustical filter having an upper frequency cutoff of 5000 Hz. This filter could be opened or closed, allowing either the full range of frequencies to pass or the range only below 5000 Hz. At first, a small orchestra sat and performed {{on one side of the}} screen, while a group of test subjects sat on the other and listened. The listeners were asked to select their preference between two conditions: full bandwidth or restricted bandwidth. There was overwhelming preference in favor of the full bandwidth. Next, the orchestra was replaced with a sound-reproduction system with loudspeakers positioned behind the screen instead. When the sound system was free of distortion, the listeners preferred the full bandwidth. But when he introduced small amounts of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortion,</b> the subjects preferred a restricted bandwidth, thus demonstrating clearly the importance of high quality in audio systems.|$|E
5000|$|Sample rate {{reduction}} (also called down-sampling) intentionally reduces the sample rate to degrade {{the quality of}} the audio. As the sample rate is reduced, high frequencies are aliased or, if the digital signal is first low-pass filtered, they are lost. If a primitive step-wave DAC is used, or if the DAC filter cutoff frequency is not adjustable to track with the sample rate, but instead is fixed at half the Nyquist frequency for the maximum supported sample rate, then waveforms also become more [...] "coarse" [...] sounding. At extreme reductions, the waveform becomes metallic sounding as a result of severe aliasing and perhaps <b>nonlinear</b> <b>distortion</b> from poorly tuned digital-to-analog conversion. (Note that all of these effects are avoidable if the signal is low-pass filtered before being downsampled and if the DAC parameters for playback are proper to the reduced sample rate; then the waveform just sounds band-limited like a telephone, an AM radio with clear reception, or a magnetic tape recorder at a slow tape speed.) ...|$|E
