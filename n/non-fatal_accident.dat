The latter was written off in a <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accident</b> in 1969 and replaced the following year by the airline's first jet airliner, a Sud Aviation Caravelle.

[...] Rolls was a pioneer aviator, being {{the first man to}} fly across the English Channel in both directions. On 12 July 1910 Calthrop accompanied him to the Bournemouth International Aviation Meeting, and was present when Rolls died after he lost control of his biplane and crashed. That and a similar, <b>non-fatal,</b> <b>accident</b> involving his son Tev, led Calthrop to believe that a parachute could be used to save pilots in similar circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accident</b> {{occurred}} on 5 August 1956. The aircraft, a Handley Page HP.81 Hermes 4A (registration: G-ALDK), [...] undershot the runway {{while attempting to}} land on runway 08 at the Drigh Road Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Base in heavy rain, which the pilot in command mistook for Karachi International Airport's runway 07. Although the accident destroyed the aircraft, all 72 occupants (seven crew members and 65 passengers) survived. The subsequent accident investigation established {{the failure of the}} aircraft's left windscreen wiper as the primary cause. It furthermore identified the pilot's mistake in confusing runway 08 at Drigh Road PAF Base with runway 07 at Karachi International Airport when landing in meteorological conditions below those recommended as minima by the Pakistan Department of Civil Aviation as a secondary cause.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accident</b> {{occurred}} on 28 September 1964. A Douglas DC-7C (registration: G-ASID) operating Caledonian's flight 355 from London Gatwick via Istanbul Yeşilköy to Singapore crash-landed [...] {{short of the}} threshold of Yeşilköy's runway 24 when the aircraft's left main gear struck the ground {{in line with the}} runway. This had caused the aircraft to bounce and touch down again 14m further on, which in turn resulted in the nose gear collapsing and engines no. 1 and 2 breaking off, followed by the separation of the entire port wing. The fuselage, which skidded [...] down the runway, caught fire. Although the aircraft was completely destroyed, all 97 occupants (eight crew and 89 passengers) miraculously survived. The crash-landing followed an abandoned approach to Yeşilköy's runway 24 in heavy rain. The approach was abandoned because the pilot-in-command could not see the runway lights. During the second approach VHF communications were lost for a short time due to the tower transmitter's failure. When transmission resumed, the plane's flightdeck crew reported lightning and heavy turbulence during its descent, and sighting the runway while descending to [...] This was followed by a slight correction to the right when the pilot-in-command ordered the deployment of full flaps and a reduction in power. It resulted in the plane sinking too quickly just short of the runway. Ordering an immediate increase in power did not prevent the plane from touching the ground short of the runway threshold. The subsequent accident investigation concluded that the probable cause was threefold: ...|$|E

30|$|In total we {{succeeded in}} finding data on 51 fatal and 62 <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> The fact that nearly 33  % of the fatal and 79  % of the <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> were only {{found in a}} single source {{indicates}} that the accidents were not greatly publicised. Grossmann noted in 1933 that of 26 (fatal and <b>non-fatal)</b> <b>accidents</b> known to him, 13 were mentioned in scientific journals and only five in newspapers. He blamed “a certain shyness for publicity” {{in the case of}} more severe incidents [38].

2500|$|Sky Screamer, a first-generation Intamin Freefall ride, was {{constructed}} in the Plaza de Fiesta section and opened in 1983. Consisting of a tower reaching [...] in height and a horizontal braking runout, Sky Screamer had an L-shaped appearance. It featured eight uniquely designed gondolas, each holding four riders. The gondolas used one set of wheels to go up the lift and down the drop (4 large wheels at each back corner), but used a different set in the transfer and loading and unloading area of the ride (smaller rollers located {{on the bottom of}} the gondola). Gondolas were lifted upward through a shaft in the tower's center by a lift chain. Once at the top, the gondola was disengaged from the lift chain and pushed forward into the drop position. The gondola was released into freefall following the sounding of a loud klaxon (which was audible throughout sections of the park and often lured visitors to the ride). A pair of guide rails ran downward along the outside of the tower before curving into the horizontal braking runout. The freefall drop into the horizontal curve applied a g-force of 4.5 on the riders. In late 1983, 50% more anti-rollback devices were installed. The additional anti-rollbacks were staggered on each side of the lift. These modifications were intended to improve stopping ability in wet conditions and were a response to a <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accident</b> on a similar ride at another park. In 1986, the ride's [...] "G-Block" [...] was moved farther down the horizontal braking runout. The end of [...] "H-Block" [...] was extended to the beginning of the station conveyors in 1994. Sky Screamer was dismantled on November 2, 1997.|$|E

40|$|Marriage {{may reduce}} the risk of {{accidents}} and assaults by promoting social control of health behavior. This study examines the impact of marital status on <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and assaults in young British women. Data is drawn from a large cohort study of the people born in 1958. Rate ratios of overall and specific incidence of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and assaults are determined by negative binomial regression, with adjustment for socio-economic and behavioral confounders. The null hypothesis of no association between marital status and incidence of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and assaults is rejected. It is suggested that, independent of parental status, more exposure to marriage and less exposure to marital dissolution may reduce accidents and assaults. accidents assaults social control marital status Britain...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the incidence and nature of fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> from falling objects from elevated construction sites in Bangkok, and to ascertain possible contributing factors, if any. Press records were examined for reports of fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> Between November 1997 and July 1998, three deaths and 11 injuries were reported. One of the deaths and eight of the injuries involved tourists. No near misses were reported. All of the incidents were involved {{with the construction of}} elevated freeways or railways. The study shows that accidents and near misses do occur around elevated construction sites in a large city like Bangkok, although injuries and death are relatively uncommon from such incidents. However; better reporting mechanisms and accident investigations are needed to help eliminate their occurrence. Tourists and the general public should be Vigilant around elevated construction sites and avoid these areas wherever possible...|$|R

50|$|The first <b>non-fatal</b> <b>accident</b> {{occurred}} on 23 July 1952. It involved a Handley Page HP.81 Hermes 4A (registration: G-ALDB) operating a trooping flight from Blackbushe to the RAF station in Fayid, Egypt. While the aircraft was overflying France, the flightdeck crew noticed a {{defect in the}} no. 4 engine and decided to make an emergency landing at the nearest diversion airfield. This resulted in a crash landing at Pithiviers. Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair, there were no fatalities among the 70 occupants (six crew and 64 passengers). The evidence at the crash site seemed to suggest that an internal failure occurred inside the no. 4 engine, which caused over-speeding and subsequent disintegration of the reduction gear pinion bearing.|$|E
