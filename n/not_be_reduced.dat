5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} group 17 elements, tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior {{common to the}} halogens. For example, the extant {{members of the group}} routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable electronic configuration of a noble gas, one having eight electrons (octet) in its valence shell. This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; tennessine would be the least willing to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it is predicted to form, −1 {{is expected to be the}} least common. The standard reduction potential of the Ts/Ts− couple is predicted to be −0.25V; this value is negative and thus tennessine should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to the −1 oxidation state under standard conditions, unlike all {{the previous}} halogens.|$|E

As the {{president}} of the King's College Old Boy's Association, he wrote that the government was cutting back the opportunity for upward social mobility of students from grassroots families. Michael Suen, the Secretary for Education, replied that the chances would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> as the total number of students were on a decreasing trend.|$|E
25|$|A survey {{carried out}} by the American Obesity Association into parental attitudes towards their children's weight showed the {{majority}} of parents think that recess should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> or replaced. Almost 30% said that they were concerned with their child's weight. 35% of parents thought that their child's school was not teaching them enough about childhood obesity, and over 5% thought that childhood obesity was the greatest risk to their child's long term health.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{investigations}} on electron- and hole-trapping {{demonstrated that}} impurities {{also can be}} a significant trapping system. Consequently, interstitial silver ions may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced.</b> Therefore, these traps are actually loss mechanisms, and are considered trapping inefficiencies. For example, atmospheric oxygen can interact with photoelectrons to form an O2− species, which can interact with a hole to reverse the complex and undergo recombination. Metal ion impurities such as copper(I), iron(II), and cadmium(II) have demonstrated hole-trapping in silver bromide.|$|E
25|$|Reinforced by {{elements}} of the 10th SS Panzer Division, the German troops in the Gambsheim Bridgehead held their own against U.S. and French counterattacks during January 1945, manhandling the U.S. 12th Armored Division at Herrlisheim. The German successes of January, however, marked the high point for the Upper Rhine High Command. The Gambsheim Bridgehead, and further to the south, the Colmar Pocket, would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> by Allied forces until well into February 1945, but {{the operations of the}} Upper Rhine High Command after mid-January were defensive in nature.|$|E
25|$|The Speaker must {{be elected}} when Parliament first meets after any general election, before it {{proceeds}} {{to deal with}} any other business. Similarly, whenever the office of Speaker is vacant for some reason other than a dissolution of Parliament, no business must be transacted other than {{the election of a}} person to fill that office. The Speaker may be elected from among the MPs who are not Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, but even a person who is not an MP can be chosen. Nonetheless, a candidate who is not an MP must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP. The Speaker's salary may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> while he is in office.|$|E
50|$|The winglessness of {{the genus}} is {{probably}} attributable {{to the fact that}} at sub-freezing temperatures, {{it is very hard to}} generate enough energy for maintaining flight muscles. Also, the space normally taken by flight muscles is used to store eggs. However, the halteres have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> and <b>are</b> innervated, thus probably serving as sensory organs (Schrock, 1992).|$|R
25|$|As the {{distance}} had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> {{after an hour}} of pursuit, the Italian cruisers broke off the chase, turning to the north-west on a course to rejoin Vittorio Veneto. The Allied ships changed course in turn, following the Italian cruisers at extreme range. Iachino let them come on in hopes of luring the British cruisers into the range of Vittorio Venetos guns.|$|R
50|$|Transferring {{risks to}} other {{alternatives}} when those risks have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> to acceptable levels. The two primary methods of accomplishing risk transfer are {{to insure the}} assets or raise prices to cover the loss {{in the event of}} a criminal act. Generally speaking, when the first three steps have been properly applied, the cost of transferring risks is much lower.|$|R
25|$|To {{safeguard}} judicial independence, Singapore law {{lays down}} special procedures {{to be followed}} before the conduct of Supreme Court judges may be discussed in Parliament and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases {{in which they are}} personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges. Both the State Courts and Supreme Court have power to punish for contempt of court, though only the Supreme Court may convict persons of the offence of scandalizing the court.|$|E
25|$|By Lee's estimation, {{the fort}} could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> by {{bombardment}} or direct assault, only by starvation. As long as supplies {{could be built}} up, they would be. The last Confederate supply ship to Fort Pulaski was the small workhorse steamboat Ida. On February 13, {{it was on a}} routine run to the fort down the North Channel. The new battery of Federal heavy guns on the north bank opened up for the first time. The old side-wheeler ran for Pulaski and the battery got off nine shots before the guns recoiled off their platforms. Union troops went back to work modifying platform construction and resetting the cannon. Two days later Ida ran up the South Channel under the extinguished lighthouse and returned to Savannah through Tybee Creek.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of NOC governance, the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented. The NEP aimed to {{eradicate}} poverty irrespective of race by expanding the economic pie so that the Chinese share of the economy would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> in absolute terms but only relatively. The aim was for the Malays to have a 30% equity share of the economy, {{as opposed to the}} 4% they held in 1970. Foreigners and Chinese held much of the rest. The NEP appeared to be derived from Article 153 and could be viewed as being in line with its wording. Although Article 153 would have been up for review in 1972, fifteen years after Malaysia's independence in 1957, due to the May 13 Incident it remained unreviewed. A new expiration date of 1991 for the NEP was set, twenty years after its implementation.|$|E

25|$|A major {{penalty is}} a {{stronger}} degree of penalty {{for a more}} severe infraction of the rules than a minor. Most infractions which incur a major penalty are more severe instances of minor penalty infractions; one exception is fighting, which always draws a major. A player who receives a major penalty will remain off the ice for five minutes of play during which his team will be short-handed. A major penalty cannot end early even if a goal is scored against the short-handed team, unless the goal is scored during an overtime period (which ends the game). If major penalties are assessed to one player on each team at the same time, they may be substituted for, and teams will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> by one player on the ice. The penalized players {{will remain in the}} penalty box until the first stoppage of play following the end of the penalties. This commonly occurs with majors for fighting.|$|E

500|$|The third {{decision}} {{made with the}} objective achieving a safer racial ratio in the army was the [...] "einforcement of the occupation corps' troops by three white battalions: one Foreign Legion battalion, [...] two Colonial Infantry battalions". It was reasoned that if European troops were placed next to Vietnamese ones, then despite the reduction in Vietnamese troops by two battalions, more European troops would be needed. Since {{it was decided that}} the overall level of troops in Indochina could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> for external defence reasons, this necessitated the replacement of at least the two disbanded Vietnamese battalions.|$|E

The figures were only 14,787 in 2008 due to the bankruptcy of the airline Nordic Regional.|$|R

500|$|The {{origin of}} three Burger King-themed Xbox Games, {{including}} Sneak King, began when [...] senior executives from Microsoft and Burger King met at Cannes to accept awards for their I Love Bees and Subservient Chicken advertising campaigns. Microsoft and Burger King's executives decided to produce Xbox games {{that would take}} place in Burger King-themed context that would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to blatant advertisements. [...] Blitz Games Studios would {{become involved in the}} project after Blitz Games Studios' co-founder, Philip Oliver, discussed an interest in producing Xbox Live games with Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade portfolio manager, Ross Erickson. Oliver's interest was hampered by a lack of funding, but Erickson agreed to notify Oliver of any leads on advertisers looking for product placement. A week or two after that, Oliver received a call from Erickson about Burger King's interest in creating three games. In the fall of 2005, Blitz Games entered into talks with Burger King and the development began in February 2006.|$|E
500|$|For the 2011/2012 model years, {{the battery}} pack stores [...] of energy {{but it is}} {{controlled}} or buffered via the energy management system to use only [...] of this capacity to maximize {{the life of the}} pack. For this reason the battery pack never fully charges or depletes, as the software only allows the battery to operate within a state of charge (SOC) window of 65%, after which the engine kicks in and maintains the charge near the lower level. The minimum SOC varies depending on operating conditions. When more power is required, such as mountain mode, the lower limit of the SOC will rise to 45% to ensure there is enough power available. The battery capacity was increased to [...] for the 2013 model year, the SOC window will be increased to use [...] of the total battery energy, and the buffer to ensure battery life will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced.</b> These changes will increase the Volt's all-electric range but charging will take slightly longer.
