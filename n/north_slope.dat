5|$|Common ravens are {{omnivorous}} {{and highly}} opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic <b>North</b> <b>Slope</b> of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.|$|E
5|$|The Great Salt Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the <b>north</b> <b>slope</b> of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on the <b>north</b> <b>slope</b> of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is found {{throughout}} North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico. River otters also currently inhabit coastal regions throughout the United States and Canada. North American river otters also inhabit the forested {{regions of the}} Pacific coast in North America. The species is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, and the <b>north</b> <b>slope</b> of the Brooks Range.|$|E

5|$|At Valdez, {{construction}} was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried {{to complete the}} marine terminal. Because of loose soil found at the job site, enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure the ground below some of the 58 structures that were completed {{by the end of}} the year. During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to Pump Station 2 on the <b>North</b> <b>Slope.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made it across the ocean, but crashed and perished in the woods of Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the <b>north</b> <b>slope</b> of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 1980, a major {{volcanic}} eruption occurred at Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Skamania County, {{in the state}} of Washington, United States. The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the most significant {{volcanic eruption}} to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California. It has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in United States history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's <b>north</b> <b>slope.</b>|$|E

50|$|Deformation {{outside the}} core has mostly taken {{place on the}} {{southern}} slopes of the mountains; however, there is some deformation on the <b>North</b> <b>slopes.</b> This deformation is differentiated on the <b>north</b> <b>slopes</b> from East to West. In the west, some thrusting to the North of the Crest has taken place into the Kuban Basin. When the thrusting die out the <b>north</b> <b>slopes</b> of the central Greater Caucasus form a basement uplift, forming a monocline dipping North. Dagestan to the Eastern end of the range is the where most thrusting to the North occurs and has formed a folded zone of sediments, overlying some of the Terek Basin.|$|R

5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As <b>North</b> <b>Slope</b> oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's <b>North</b> <b>Slope.</b> Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E

25|$|Though a {{pipeline}} from the <b>North</b> <b>Slope</b> {{to the nearest}} ice-free port, almost 800 miles (1,300km) to the south, {{was the only way}} to get Alaska's oil to market, significant engineering challenges lay ahead. Between the <b>North</b> <b>Slope</b> and Valdez, there were active fault lines, three mountain ranges, miles of unstable, boggy ground underlain with frost, and migration paths of caribou and moose. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was ultimately completed in 1977 at a total cost of $8 billion.|$|E
