Subsequent research extended the DUET to echoic conditions {{with the use of the}} estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) method to form the DUET-ESPRIT algorithm [8, 9].

50|$|The second {{programme}} priority concerns accessibility and connectivity. The Alpine Space {{is both a}} centre of a dynamic economy and a transit area in a sensitive environment.

With this priority the programme aims to improve the quality of transport of passengers and goods while mitigating the negative effects of traffic. Moreover, sustainable solutions should be found to help the local population to be better connected to wider networks. Therefore, the programme promotes joint actions which take into consideration integrated planning of transport and mobility, or ICT-based innovative public services for citizens and economy.|$|E
5000|$|Attractiveness {{principle}} {{is a concept}} that incorporates the fact that any product or kind of business cannot ever be “all things to all people” [...] though companies very often strive to follow this way. One needs to make necessary decisions on the characteristics of the product as it cannot be perfect in all dimensions. If she doesn’t, the product {{is not going to be}} successful as of the <b>natural</b> <b>constraints</b> (limited resources) it will have to face - sooner or later. It is a fact of life that (assuming we know the relationships among the system’s elements) we can influence, inhibit or remove some of these limits through making expert changes in the system. The archetype can help us to get the insight into the system behavior so we could identify and decide which limiting factors to inhibit before they inhibit the results we want to achieve. But there will always be some limits we are not able to reduce and simply “we have to learn to live with them” and make compromises between our goals.|$|E
50|$|A {{changing}} climate thus {{affects the}} prerequisites of population health: {{clean air and}} water, sufficient food, <b>natural</b> <b>constraints</b> on infectious disease agents, and the adequacy and security of shelter. A warmer and more variable climate leads {{to higher levels of}} some air pollutants. It increases the rates and ranges of transmission of infectious diseases through unclean water and contaminated food, and by affecting vector organisms (such as mosquitoes) and intermediate or reservoir host species that harbour the infectious agent (such as cattle, bats and rodents). Changes in temperature, rainfall and seasonality compromise agricultural production in many regions, including some of the least developed countries, thus jeopardising child health and growth and the overall health and functional capacity of adults. As warming proceeds, the severity (and perhaps frequency) of weather-related disasters will increase - and appears to have done so in a number of regions of the world over the past several decades. Therefore, in summary, global warming, together with resultant changes in food and water supplies, can indirectly cause increases in a range of adverse health outcomes, including malnutrition, diarrhea, injuries, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and water-borne and insect-transmitted diseases.|$|E

50|$|Biometric research. For {{thousands}} of years, humans have used visually perceived body {{characteristics such as}} face and gait to recognize each other. This remarkable ability of human visual system has led Professor Venetsanopoulos to build automated systems to recognize individuals from digitally captured facial images and gait sequences. Face and gait recognition belong {{to the field of}} biometrics, a very active area of research in the computer vision and pattern recognition society, mainly motivated by government and security-related applications. Face and gait are two typical physiological and behavioral biometrics respectively. Venetsanopoulos has contributed to both areas and his research was cited extensively. There are two general approaches: the model-based approach and the appearance-based approach. Appearance-based face recognition approach processes a 2-D facial image as 2-D holistic patterns. The whole face region is the raw input to a recognition system and each face image is commonly represented by a high-dimensional vector consisting of the pixel intensity values in the image. Thus, face recognition is transformed to a multivariate statistical pattern recognition problem. Although the embedding is high-dimensional, the <b>natural</b> <b>constraints</b> of the face data indicate that the face vectors lie in a lower-dimensional subspace (manifold). The popular subspace learning is such a method to identify, represent, and parameterize this subspace with some optimality criteria. Similar to appearance-based face recognition, appearance-based gait recognition approach considers gait as a holistic pattern and uses a full-body representation of a human subject as silhouettes or contours. Gait video sequences are naturally three-dimensional objects, formally named tensor objects, and they are very difficult to deal with using traditional vector-based learning algorithms. In order to deal with these tensor objects effectively, Venetsanopoulos and his research team developed a framework of multilinear subspace learning, so that computation and memory demands are reduced, natural structure and correlation in the original data are preserved, and more compact and useful features can be obtained. Model-based gait recognition approach considers a human subject as an articulated object, represented by various body poses. Professor Venetsanopoulos proposed a full-body layered deformable model (LDM) inspired by the manually labeled body-part-level silhouettes. The LDM has a layered structure to model self-occlusion between body parts and it is deformable, so simple limb deformation is taken into consideration. In addition, it also models shoulder swing. The LDM parameters can be recovered from automatically extracted silhouettes and then used for recognition.|$|E
