25|$|Using Figure 3 and {{knowledge}} of the upstream and downstream conditions and the depth values {{on either side of the}} gate, a general estimate of the profiles upstream and downstream of the gate can be generated. Upstream, the water surface must rise from a <b>normal</b> <b>depth</b> of 0.97 m to 9.21 m at the gate. The only way to do this on a mild reach is to follow an M1 profile. The same logic applies downstream to determine that the water surface follows an M3 profile from the gate until the depth reaches the conjugate depth of the <b>normal</b> <b>depth</b> at which point a hydraulic jump forms to raise the water surface to the <b>normal</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} use this technique, it is {{important}} to note you must have some understanding of the system you are modeling. [...] For each gradually varied flow transition, you must know both boundary conditions and you must also calculate length of that transition. [...] (e.g. For an M1 Profile, you must find the rise at the downstream boundary condition, the <b>normal</b> <b>depth</b> at the upstream boundary condition, and also the length of the transition.) [...] To find the length of the gradually varied flow transitions, iterate the “step length”, instead of height, at the boundary condition height until equations 4 and 5 agree.

2500|$|The {{first two}} figures below are the {{upstream}} and downstream water surface profiles modeled by HEC-RAS. There is also a table provided comparing {{the differences between the}} profiles estimated by the two different methods at different stations to show consistency between the two methods. [...] While the two different methods modeled similar water surface shapes, the standard step method predicted that the flow would take a greater distance to reach <b>normal</b> <b>depth</b> {{upstream and downstream}} of the gate. This stretching is caused by the errors associated with assuming average gradients between two stations of interest during our calculations. Smaller dx values would reduce this error and produce more accurate surface profiles.|$|E

2500|$|Under {{steady state}} flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), {{open channel flow}} can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as <b>normal</b> <b>depth</b> (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. [...] Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E

5|$|The η ring has zero orbital {{eccentricity}} and inclination. Like the δ ring, {{it consists of}} two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward shoulder with low optical depth.

40|$|In this study, FLUENT {{software}} {{was employed to}} simulate the flow pattern and water depth changes in a 120 ° sharp bend at four discharge rates. To verify the numerical model, a 90 ° sharp bend was first modeled with a three-dimensional numerical model, {{and the results were}} compared with available experimental results. Based on the numerical model validation, a 120 ° bend was simulated.

Moreover, with increasing <b>normal</b> water <b>depth,</b> the dimensionless water depth change decreases at all cross-sections. At the interior cross-sections of the bend, the transverse water depth slope of the inner half-width is always greater than that of the outer half-width of the channel.
