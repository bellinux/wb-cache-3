This remark is peculiarly applicable to land titles. <b>Nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> retards the growth and prosperity of a country as insecurity of titles to real estate. Labor is paralysed where the enjoyment of its fruits is uncertain; and litigation without limit produces ruinous consequences to individuals.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{takeover}} was impossible in the Medici Bank. The essential structure {{was that of}} a single partnership based in Florence, which immutably held the lion's share of shares in each branch (and the three textile factories in Florence), which were themselves incorporated as independent partnerships. At {{the end of the year}} on March 24 (by the then used calendar), each partnership would be dissolved, although the Medici could dissolve a partnership at any time with six months' notice. The books were thoroughly gone through and checked, and a reckoning of profits would be made. Indeed, the structure of the Medici Bank resembles <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as the modern holding company.|$|E

Writing for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne called it [...] "ludicrously derivative" [...] of Spears' debut single [...] "...Baby One More Time", and commented that it [...] "amounts to <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as a jailbait manifesto". Lennat Mak of the Asian division of MTV complimented the song as [...] "a perfect 10 on the [...] "wow" [...] scale, with the wacky [...] "Jack-Rose" [...] dialogue", referencing the Titanic spoken lyrics.|$|E

500|$|Leng {{describes}} the critical reception to Extra Texture as [...] "only slightly less vituperative {{than the one}} Dark Horse had received". In Rolling Stone, Dave Marsh dismissed most of the album's first side as [...] "padded subterfuges" [...] and concluded of the collection as a whole: [...] "Finally, {{we are faced with}} the fact that Harrison's records are <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as boring. They drone, and while chants and mantras may be paths to glory in other realms, in pop music they are only routes to tedium." [...] Ray Coleman of Melody Maker admired the words to [...] "World of Stone", which he said was [...] "an insistently strong track" [...] with [...] "the sort of lyric and 'read between-the-lines' melody John Lennon would write".|$|E
500|$|Hoppus wrote lyrics {{dealing with}} {{breakdowns}} in communication and trust and tackled with themes {{of isolation and}} confusion, but these lyrics were not specific {{to any of the}} band's history. Hoppus struggled with writing upbeat, happy songs for the album and attributed to dark lyricism to the heavy events occurring shortly before the reunion. MTV News called Neighborhoods the [...] "bleakest thing Blink have ever done, haunted by specters both real — depression, addiction, loss — and imagined," [...] noting the constant lyrical mention of death in many tracks. The album mixes the electronic flourishes of +44 and the [...] "laser-light grandeur" [...] of Angels & Airwaves into what MTV News called [...] "a sound that recalls <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as dark streets and black expanses, mostly of the suburban variety." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Tchaikovsky's {{music has}} also varied but also improved over time. Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect {{for not being}} nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason. There {{might have been a}} grain of truth in the latter, according to musicologist and conductor Leon Botstein, as German critics especially wrote of the [...] "indeterminacy of [...] artistic character ... being truly at home in the non-Russian." [...] Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music, Eduard Hanslick lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition [...] "whose stink one can hear" [...] and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, [...] "The furious peroration sounds like <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker.

The New York Times called it a [...] "zany, lively, uninhibited, sexual odyssey that manages to mix a bit of Walter Mitty and a touch of Woody Allen with some of the innocence of Walt Disney [...] urban smarts of Ralph Bakshi". Charles Solomon of The Los Angeles Times gave the film an extremely negative review, calling [...] "a sprawling undisciplined piece of sniggering vulgarity that resembles <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as animated bathroom graffiti. [...] degrading to women, blacks, Chicanos, gays, cops, lesbians, and anyone with an IQ of more than 45". Variety commented that the film [...] "has little to recommend." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the summer}} siege, illness {{spread through the}} British camps. [...] In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops. With many men in camp hospitals, British {{fighting}} numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed {{by the end of}} September, or Britain's opportunity would be lost. In addition, his frustration with Montcalm's defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, [...] "The Marquis of Montcalm is {{at the head of a}} great number of bad soldiers, and I am at the head of a small number of good ones that wish for <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as to fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army." [...] Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.|$|E
500|$|By 1982, fantasy {{films such}} as The Beastmaster and Conan the Barbarian had proven {{successful}} at the box office, and Bakshi {{wanted to work with}} his long-time friend, the fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. Fire and Ice was financed by some of American Pops investors for $1.2 million, while 20th Century Fox agreed to distribute. Fire and Ice was the most action-oriented story Bakshi had directed, so he again used rotoscoping; the realism of the design and rotoscoped animation replicated Frazetta's artwork. Bakshi and Frazetta were heavily involved in the production of the live-action sequences, from casting sessions to the final shoot. The film's crew included background artists James Gurney and Thomas Kinkade, layout artist Peter Chung, and established Bakshi Productions artists Sparey, Steve Gordon, Bell and Banks. Chung greatly admired Bakshi's and Frazetta's work, and animated his sequences while working for The Walt Disney Company. The film was given a limited release, and was financially unsuccessful. Andrew Leal wrote, [...] "The plot is standard [...] recalling <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as a more graphic episode of Filmation's He-Man series. [...] Fire and Ice essentially stands as a footnote to the spate of barbarian films that followed in the wake of Arnold Schwarzenegger's appearance as Conan." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{blend of}} various movie genres such as martial arts, mystery, costume drama and horror {{attracted}} certain amounts of criticism.

Eastman reported Blue Horse was his “first caller” at the Pine Ridge Agency and Chief Emeritus of the Wágluȟe Band. “He softly opened the door and stepped in without knocking, in characteristic Indian fashion. After greeting me in Sioux, he promptly produced his credentials, which consisted of well-worn papers that had been given him by various high military officers, from General William Selby Harney to General George Crook, and were dated 1854 to 1877. The old man wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as an audience, and the tales of his exploits served to pass the evening."
