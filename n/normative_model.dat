40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal methodology that supports large organizations' investments in energy retrofit of buildings. The methodology is a scalable modeling approach based on <b>normative</b> <b>models</b> and Bayesian calibration. <b>Normative</b> <b>models</b> are a light- weight quasi-steady state energy models, {{which makes them}} scalable to large sets of buildings due to highly enhanced modeling efficiency. Then, Bayesian approach calibrates <b>normative</b> <b>models</b> such that calibrated models quantify uncertainty in the model while representing a building as operated. Calibrated models can further incorporate additional uncertainty from ECMs, and provide information about underperforming risks of ECMs. This paper illustrates the proposed retrofit analysis process through a case study, and demonstrates its feasibility to support large-scale retrofit decisions under uncertainty {{in the context of}} the ESCO industry...|$|R

40|$|S. Schäfer The {{public sphere}} and {{particularly}} the mass media have become increasingly important for the legitimation of science. Many publications on the issue explic-itly or implicitly deal {{with the question of}} how science should be treated in the mass media, putting forward <b>normative</b> <b>models</b> of an ideal “scientific public sphere. ” In this article, we first present two ideal types of <b>normative</b> <b>models</b> iden-tified in the literature: the “science-dominated scientific public sphere ” and the “contextualized scientific public sphere. ” Whereas the first model calls for scien-tific dominance in mass media debates, the second model argues that science should be contextualized also with non-scientific actors and arguments. The sec-ond part of the article outlines how these two models translate into specific demands for mass media debates and proposes how to measure whether concrete cases of science coverage correspond with one of the <b>normative</b> <b>models.</b> We con-front the two <b>normative</b> <b>models</b> with the example of media coverage on human genome research in Germany and in the United States in the third part of the arti-cle. Our findings show that the mass media debate on this issue is dominated by bio-scientists, affirmative positions, and scientific and medical frames in both countries. Hence, human genome research as an empirical case corresponds {{to the demands of the}} scientific dominance model, while failing to meet the demands for more contextualized mass media coverage...|$|R

40|$|Why are {{you reading}} this abstract? In some sense, your answer will cast the {{exercise}} as valuable – {{but what is}} value? In what follows, we suggest that value is evidence or, more exactly, log Bayesian evidence. This implies that a sufficient explanation for valuable behaviour is the accumulation of evidence for internal models of our world. This contrasts with <b>normative</b> <b>models</b> of optimal control and reinforcement learning, which assume {{the existence of a}} value function that explains behaviour, where (somewhat tautologically) behaviour maximises value. In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation – active inference – that replaces policies in <b>normative</b> <b>models</b> with prior beliefs about (future) states agents should occupy. This enables optimal behaviour to be cast purely in terms of inference: where agents sample their sensorium to maximise the evidence for their generative model of hidden states in the world – and minimise their uncertainty about those states. Crucially, this formulation resolves the tautology inherent in <b>normative</b> <b>models</b> and allows one to consider how prior beliefs are themselves optimised in a hierarchical setting. We illustrate these points by showing that any optimal policy can be specified with prior beliefs in the context of Bayesian inference. We then show how these prior beliefs are themselves prescribed by an imperative to minimise uncertainty. This formulation explains the saccadic eye movements required to read this text and defines the value of the visual sensations you are soliciting...|$|R

In contrast to this classical economic perspective, behavioral models derived from research in psychology and consumer behavior assert that preferences are not guided by an internal, stable utility function but are constructed during the choice process. The current paper {{is based on}} a session on constructed choice processes (CCP) at the 2004 Choice Symposium that focused on how the standard CCP model can be enriched by bringing theories and tools from modern research in social cognition to bear on choice phenomenon. The richer conceptual framework presented by new, currently unpublished empirical work provides a novel perspective on choice construction by integrating the roles of subjective construal, experiential information, attribution, goals, and satisfaction in understanding preference construction processes in choice.
