50|$|<b>Nilestriol</b> (INN) (brand name Wei Ni An; {{developmental}} {{code name}} LY-49825), {{also known as}} nylestriol (USAN, BAN), is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen that was patented in 1971 and is marketed in China. It is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinylestriol, and {{is also known as}} ethinylestriol cyclopentyl ether (EE3CPE). <b>Nilestriol</b> is a prodrug of ethinylestriol, and is a more potent estrogen in comparison. It is described as a slowly-metabolized, long-acting estrogen and derivative of estriol. <b>Nilestriol</b> was assessed in combination with levonorgestrel for the potential treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, but this formulation ultimately was not marketed.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} analogues of estriol are known, {{including}} both naturally occurring isomers and synthetic substituted derivatives and esters. 16β-Epiestriol, 17α-epiestriol, and 16β,17α-epiestriol are isomers of estriol that are endogenous weak estrogens. Mytatrienediol (16α-methyl-16β-epiestriol 3-methyl ether) is a synthetic derivative of 16β-epiestriol {{that was never}} marketed. Estriol diacetate benzoate, estriol succinate, estriol sodium succinate, and estriol tripropionate are synthetic esters of estriol that have been marketed for medical use, whereas estriol triacetate has not been introduced. Quinestradol is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of estriol and has also been marketed. These esters and ethers are prodrugs of estriol. Ethinylestriol and <b>nilestriol</b> are synthetic C17α ethynylated derivatives of estriol.

40|$|Genistein, a major {{phytoestrogen}} of soy, {{is considered}} a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Mounting evidence suggested {{a positive correlation between}} genistein consumption and bone health both in vivo and in vitro. Earlier studies have revealed that genistein acted as a natural estrogen analogue which activated estrogen receptor and exerted anti-osteoporotic effect. However, it remains unclear whether PTH, the most crucial hormone that regulates mineral homeostasis, participates in the process of genistein-mediated bone protection. In the present study, we compared the therapeutic effects between genistein and <b>nilestriol</b> and investigated whether PTH and its specific receptor PTHR 1 altered in response to genistein-containing diet in the animal model of ovariectomy. Our results showed that genistein administration significantly improved femoral mechanical properties and alleviates femoral turnover. Genistein at all doses (4. 5 mg/kg, 9. 0 mg/kg and 18. 0 mg/kg per day, respectively) exerted improved bending strength and b-ALP limiting effects than <b>nilestriol</b> in the present study. However, genistein administration did not exert superior effects on bone protection than <b>nilestriol.</b> We also observed circulating PTH restoration in ovariectomized rats receiving genistein at the dose of 18 mg/kg per day. Meanwhile, PTHR 1 abnormalities were attenuated in the presence of genistein as confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. These findings strongly support the idea that besides serving as an estrogen, genistein could interact with PTH/PTHR 1, causing a superior mineral restoring effect than <b>nilestriol</b> on certain circumstance. In conclusion, our study reported {{for the first time that}} the anti-osteoporotic effect of genistein is partly PTH/PTHR 1 -dependent. Genistein might be a potential option in the prevention and treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis with good tolerance, more clinical benefits and few undesirable side effects...|$|E

40|$|Objective 　To {{study the}} {{protection}} effect of clinoptilolite (Cp) against radiation injury. Methods 　Fortyeight male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 6 groups, namely normal control group (distilled water + sham irradiation), radiation control group (distilled water + irradiation), 300 mg/kg 523 group (200 mg/kg <b>nilestriol</b> 24 h before irradiation and 100 mg/ kg <b>nilestriol</b> 4 h after irradiation), 56 mg/kg Cp group (56 mg/kg Cp + irradiation), 167 mg/kg Cp group (167 mg/kg Cp + irradiation) and 500 mg/kg Cp group (500 mg/kg Cp + irradiation). Seven {{days after the}} administration of the drug, all the mice but those from the normal control group were irradiated with γ-ray irradiation of 137 Cs in the dose of 4. 0 Gy, at the rate of 0. 75 Gy/min. All the mice were given the drug for 14 days after irradiation. RBC, WBC and PLT counts in peripheral blood, superoxide dismutases (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) level in blood serum, the content of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow were determined. Results 　Compared with radiation control group, on 10 th day after irradiation, RBC counts in peripheral blood of 56 mg/kg Cp group and 167 mg/kg Cp group were significantly higher (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01), and WBC counts in peripheral blood of 56 mg/kg Cp group and 500 mg/kg Cp group were significantly higher (P< 0. 01). On 14 th day after irradiation, compared with radiation control group, the SOD activities in blood serum of three Cp groups were elevated (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01), the GSH-Px levels were elevated in blood serum of 167 mg/kg Cp group and 500 mg/kg Cp group (P< 0. 01), the DNA contents were significantly higher in 56 mg/kg Cp group and 500 mg/kg Cp group (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01), the hematopoietic stem cells were significantly increased in number in bone marrow of three Cp groups (P< 0. 01). Conclusion 　The clinoptilolite possesses protective effect against injury induced by 137 Cs γ-irradiation in mice. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2016. 01. 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the radioprotective effect of polysaccharide extract from Sipunculus nudus (SNP). Beagle dogs were randomly divided into the following six groups. Group- 1 : Un-treated and un-irradiated controls. Group- 2 : Exposed to a single acute dose of 2 Gy γ-radiation alone. Groups- 3, 4 and 5 : Oral administration of SNP at 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight once a day for 7 days followed by a single acute whole body exposure to 2 Gy γ-radiation. The same doses of SNP were administered for further 27 days. Group- 6 : Positive controls treated with 1. 6 mg/kg <b>Nilestriol</b> by gavage after radiation. Blood parameters including white/red cells and platelet counts, as well as hemoglobin level, were assessed every other day for 34 days (7 days before and 27 days of experiment). Serum separated from aliquots of the same blood sample was used to estimate enzyme activity of antioxidant superoxide-dismutase, and to determine levels of free radical, nitric oxide, hydroxyl and superoxide anion. At the end of the experiment, all dogs were euthanized to weigh the organs for organ co-efficient calculation. Pathological changes were assessed in the bone marrow. The results showed that the dogs exposed to γ-radiation alone exhibited a typical hematopoietic syndrome. In contrast, at the end of 27 days experiment, dogs received oral administration of SNP+γ-radiation showed: (i) a much improved blood picture as indicated by shorter duration of leucopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia (platelet counts), as well as hemoglobin levels, (ii) significantly improved hematopoietic activity in the bone marrow, (iii) substantial decrease in nitric oxide levels, and notable increase in activity of antioxidant superoxide dismutase. The results suggested that oral administration of SNP in Beagle dogs was effective in facilitating the recovery of hematopoietic bone marrow damage induced by γ-radiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} impact of post-surgical hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) on life quality and prognosis in women with ovarian malignancy. HRT (Premarin, <b>Nilestriol</b> and medroxyprogesterone) was administered following surgery in 31 patients with ovarian cancer. A total of 44 ovarian cancer patients of similar age, clinical stage and pathological features did not receive HRT following surgery. The expression of estrogen receptor (ER) -α, ERβ and progesterone receptor (PR) in cancer tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Serum levels of calcitonin (CT) and transforming growth factor (TGF) -α were determined by radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, a log-rank test and a Cox scale risk model. Quality of life was assessed in the patient groups and in healthy post-menopausal women (control) based on a questionnaire developed by the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC-C 30), as well as our own specific questionnaire. A log-rank test revealed no difference in survival between the patients with and without HRT (p> 0. 05), and a Cox model showed that HRT was not an independent prognostic factor. The accumulated survival rate did not differ significantly based on the expression of ERα, ERβ or PR in patients with or without HRT (p> 0. 05). The serum TGFα levels prior to and following surgery were not significantly different in either of the two patient groups (p> 0. 05). Serum CT levels were higher in patients without HRT at 1. 5 years following surgery (p< 0. 05), but no significant difference was found in the serum CT levels of patients receiving HRT. The HRT and non-HRT groups differed significantly with regard to the body and emotional functional sub-scales of the EORTC-C 30 (p< 0. 05) and the sex quality and autonomic nerve maladjustment categories of our specific questionnaire (p< 0. 05). Findings of this study showed that HRT administered following surgery exhibited no apparent negative effect on prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer, regardless of ERα, ERβ or PR expression in cancer tissues, and had no effect on serum transforming growth factor (TGF) -α levels. Post-surgical HRT aided in the stabilization of serum CT levels and improved the quality of life in these patients...|$|E
