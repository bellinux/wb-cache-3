40|$|The nuclear renaissance {{promises}} significant {{benefits to}} the international community, but also raises security challenges, particularly relating to the trade of nuclear materials and equipment. The objective {{of this paper is}} to examine how supply-side non-proliferation efforts can be strengthened by developing a best practices model for national nuclear export control implementation. In order to achieve this goal, nuclear export control measures identified by the 1540 Committee will be used as a framework from which a best practices model can be formed. Such a model concentrates specifically on <b>national</b> legislation and <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> delineated by the Committee in order to bring countries in accordance with international law. Developing a best practices model seeks to deliver an ideal process for national export control law actualization in order to encourage the peaceful development of nuclear energy and develop the infrastructure and framework for precluding nuclear proliferation...|$|R

30|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina, I constructed an <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (logarithm {{of the number of}} inspected firms per hundred formal firms) with variation at the province, sector, and time level. The econometric strategy linked indicators of compliance with labor regulations and other labor outcomes with the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> and with a rich set of individual characteristics, and economic, institutional and development characteristics of Argentine provinces. To deal with the possible endogeneity of the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> in this setting, I instrumented it using a measure of the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms.|$|R

The initiation of <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> in the regulation brought by the new Civil Procedure Code seems a complex activity of a mixed nature, which has both a jurisdictional side, represented by the activity of the court of law, and an administrative side, consisting in the enforcement activity of the bailiff. </p...|$|R

30|$|Of {{particular}} {{relevance to}} the use of the enforcement approach is Almeida and Aterido (2008) which developed a proxy for locally varying enforcement, again based on the Enterprise Surveys. The main <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> used were the numbers of visits by labor or tax inspectors. In their empirical model, they include both their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (visits by inspectors) and in one specification also its interaction with the country-level rigidity of labor regulations. Their results show that enforcement by itself has a negative effect on the probability of formal training but that its interaction with labor law rigidity has a positive and significant effect. Two possible shortcomings, however, would seem to be (1) that no allowance is given to a direct effect of labor law rigidity on training (or the firm’s perceived severity of these regulations as in the “obstacles approach) and (2) the possible endogeneity or selection bias in their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|R

40|$|Cooperative Spectrum sharing can {{be thought}} of as a {{reorganization}} of rights between stakeholders [2]. The principal stakeholders are the Primary User (PU), who holds the spectrum license, and the Secondary User(s) who uses the spectrum temporarily. Any rights management system requires a set of strategies and technologies to enforce the rights [3]; the timing of the enforcement action (ex-ante and ex-post) also plays a significant role [4]. The cooperative spectrum sharing approaches that have been proposed by the NTIA emphasize ex-ante actions, which are designed to prevent a PU’s signal from harmful interference that could occur by the SU [1, 5]. A comprehensive enforcement framework would include protecting the rights of the SU in addition to having an ex post component that can efficiently and effectively adjudicate claims of interference. Determining the role of ex-post enforcement in a spectrum sharing scheme is of significant importance since cooperative spectrum sharing will without doubt result in interference events. To evaluate the role of the ex-post enforcement approach, a hypothetical scenario of using the recommended protection zones and the involved entities will be used to analyze the current <b>enforcement</b> timing <b>measures</b> and to evaluate the usage of ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> The hypothetical scenario concerns about the behaviors of the SUs, if SU-mobile devices transmitting near PU-base station or transmitting with high power signal within the protection zone. This behavior will cause harmful interference to the PU signal and data received by the PU will be lost. To guarantee SU behavior the suggested ex-ante and ex-post <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be explained and analyzed. Then, ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be applied to this scenario and analyzed. The purpose of analyzing the ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> is to evaluate how these measures might work, and what the limits are on their effectiveness...|$|R
