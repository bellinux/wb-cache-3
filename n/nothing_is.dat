5|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> {{harder to}} bear than {{a sense of}} {{injustice}} that finds no vent in expression.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} Cumanus {{before he was}} {{appointed}} procurator of Iudaea in 48, in succession to Tiberius Julius Alexander.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
60|$|The second {{expedition}} was as fruitless as the first. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> seen, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be heard, of Lady Lundie and Blanche.|$|R
60|$|When {{he reached}} the river he paused and looked round {{for a moment to}} make sure that the strange feeling of some one {{watching}} him was fancy, and he was really alone. But the moon shone brightly on every tree, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be seen but his own shadow; <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be heard but the sound of the rippling stream.|$|R
25|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> violated.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets of other species of porpoises. A {{dissection}} of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids. A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts. <b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> known about the diet of the spectacled porpoise.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} {{behavior}} or diet. P.simplex has frequently {{been found in}} pellets of the barn owl (Tyto alba) and also in those of the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). It is a preferred prey of the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus).|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{was married}} twice; <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> known about his first wife's name or fate. Zenobia was the king's second wife whom he {{married in the}} late 250s when she was 17 or 18 years old.|$|E
60|$|Everything {{interested}} us. The {{business section}} so sordid to others was grandly terrifying to us. The self-absorption of the men, the calm glances {{of the women}} humbled our simple souls. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> commonplace, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> ugly to us.|$|R
60|$|She had {{proceeded}} {{thus far}} with breathless curiosity and interest, when her attention suddenly failed her. Something--she was too deeply absorbed to know what--had got {{between her and}} the letter. Was it a sound in the Banqueting-Hall again? She looked over her shoulder at the door behind her, and listened. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> heard, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be seen. She returned to the letter.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he raised}} his head, feeling {{that he had been}} through strange places, where he could never wander any more; and he held himself erect and strong, and looked about him. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be seen but the shining of the river, and the dark shadows of the trees; <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be heard but the hum of the insects, as they darted through the night.|$|R
5|$|The {{band was}} formed by Scogin shortly after he left his {{position}} of vocalist in Norma Jean. In 2004, a record deal was signed with Solid State Records and a debut album was released, titled Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, <b>Nothing</b> <b>Is</b> Dead, and <b>Nothing</b> <b>Is</b> Bleeding. The band toured constantly after that. The Chariot released the Unsung EP in 2005, which was then followed by three successful studio albums: The Fiancée in 2007, Wars and Rumors of Wars in 2009, and Long Live in 2010. The band entered the studio in May 2012 to record their fifth full-length album titled One Wing which was released August 28, 2012. The Chariot disbanded following a farewell tour in late 2013.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{echolocation}} {{was once}} used to separate Aerodramus {{from the other}} non-echolocating cave swiftlet genera Collocalia and Hydrochous (virtually <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> known about Schoutedenapus). However, recently, the pygmy swiftlet, Collocalia troglodytes, was discovered making similar clicking noises {{both inside and outside}} its roosting cave.|$|E
5|$|A Wing Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where pairs of riders sit on either side of a roller coaster track in which <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> above or below the riders. Development of the Wing Coaster began between 2007 and 2008 leading to the opening of Raptor at Gardaland, the world's first Wing Coaster, on 1 April 2011. There are currently eight Wing Coasters operating worldwide.|$|E

5000|$|Hill {{was quoted}} {{to have said}} that {{thirteen}} episodes of the series were produced. However, after only six episodes, {{a repeat of the}} first episode was shown on 2 December 2005, and from then <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> broadcast. The official website <b>was</b> removed, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be found on the official website of CITV.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in his lifetime.|$|R
5|$|A major {{corrective}} opportunity {{this year}} involved the rerelease {{of one of}} the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science by Georgine Milmine. Dating from the yellow journalism period, this book was published in an attempt to discredit her. The current publisher, after much correspondence with our office, instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The book has received almost no attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't spoken, <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> said.|$|E
5|$|According to the 19th-century Anglesey {{historian}} Angharad Llwyd, {{the first}} {{church in the}} area was established by St Edwen in 640. <b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> known of Edwen's life, {{but according to the}} manuscript sources, she was the daughter – perhaps the illegitimate daughter – or the niece of Edwin of Northumbria, a king who converted to Christianity in 627 and who was venerated as a saint after his death in 633. The 12th-century writer Geoffrey of Monmouth said that Edwin was born whilst his mother was taking refuge in north Wales with Cadfan ap Iago.|$|E
5|$|Almost <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} the {{childhood}} of Marco Polo until he was fifteen years old, excepting that he probably spent part of his childhood in Venice. Meanwhile, Marco Polo's mother died, and an aunt and uncle raised him. He received a good education, learning mercantile subjects including foreign currency, appraising, and the handling of cargo ships; he learned little or no Latin. His father later married Floradise Polo (née Trevisan).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{five different}} {{uses of the}} word ‘nothing’ {{in the work of}} Meister Eckhart. These senses of <b>nothing</b> <b>are</b> understood to function within an ontological hierarchy, beginning with the understanding that all <b>nothings</b> <b>are</b> things, and moving in ascending order to the assertions that all things <b>are</b> <b>nothing,</b> that things <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> but God, nothing but God, and finally God as Nothing. This scale of degrees is ultimately understood to mean that the <b>nothings</b> <b>are</b> nothinged by the nothinger nothinged. The mystical, theological, and philosophical implications of this are then discussed. Accordingly, the metaphysical significance of the word ‘nothing’ as relative rejection, rather than absolute denial, is seen to point to a grammatical ground as opposed to a grammatical fiction...|$|R
60|$|Here {{the subject}} dropped, and <b>nothing</b> more <b>was</b> said, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> done, and Elizabeth still passed as Miss Newson, {{and not by}} her legal name.|$|R
5|$|Almost <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} {{the natural history of}} the Borneo shark. It is {{viviparous}} like other requiem sharks; the females bear litters of six pups, which are provisioned through gestation by a placental connection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered, at which time it had not been seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters.|$|E
5|$|Almost <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> {{left of the}} Bastille except some {{remains of}} its stone {{foundation}} that were relocated {{to the side of}} Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered institution, but deeply implicated in the system of French policing and political control during the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> {{happening}} in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E
60|$|As <b>nothing</b> could <b>be</b> {{added to}} this, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> said; and Mr Pecksniff, exulting, {{it may be}} presumed, in his moral utility, went to sleep again.|$|R
60|$|At {{the barn}} where the {{things had been}} stored he found Giant and Shep, but <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be seen of Whopper.|$|R
60|$|Poor Eden {{herself was}} in the hall, and <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> to be heard but 'Oh, my lady!' and another tempest of sobs.|$|R
5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been able to recover enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E
5|$|First {{collected}} in 1964, it was formally described in 2009. The species {{may be most}} closely related to O.concolor and O.mamorae, which are distributed further north and south in South America. Among other characters, the three share a particular arrangement of the arteries of the head. Virtually <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> known of its biology.|$|E
5|$|He was {{transferred}} to Lublin {{in the summer of}} 1942, where he joined the staff of SS-Brigadeführer Odilo Globočnik, the SS and Police Leader of the Kraków area, as part of Operation Reinhard, the code name given to the establishment of the three extermination camps at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. <b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> known of his activities in the six months he served with Operation Reinhard; participants were sworn to secrecy. But according to the transcripts of his later trial, Göth was responsible for rounding up and transporting victims to these camps to be murdered.|$|E
