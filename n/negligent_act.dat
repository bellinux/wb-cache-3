5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a <b>negligent</b> <b>act.</b> He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
500|$|William S. Andrews of Syracuse was a 69-year-old judge, {{noted for}} his scholarship, {{who had been}} on the Court of Appeals since 1917. The son of Charles Andrews, a former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, William Andrews is best remembered today because he wrote an opinion in Palsgraf. In that dissent, he was joined by Judges Frederick E. Crane and John F. O'Brien. Andrews began with a brief recitation of facts: that a {{railroad}} employee had negligently dislodged the package, the contents of which the trainman was unaware, and the subsequent explosion broke the scale and injured the plaintiff, [...] "an intending passenger". Andrews noted the fundamental difference among the judges concerning the law of negligence: whether there must be a duty to the plaintiff, the breach of which injured her, and whether, when there is an act that is a threat to the safety of others, the doer of it should be [...] "liable for all its proximate consequences, even where they result in injury to one who would generally be thought to be outside the radius of danger". Andrews believed that if there was a <b>negligent</b> <b>act,</b> the proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff, that should establish liability.|$|E
2500|$|Section 111 modifies the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 {{and allows}} the Magistrates' Court, Crown Court or Court of Appeal to order a legal {{representative}} in a criminal trial to pay for any [...] "wasted costs" [...] (costs to a party {{as a result of}} [...] "an improper, unreasonable or <b>negligent</b> <b>act</b> or omission" [...] from the other party).

This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes. These are [...] "concurrent actual causes". In such cases, courts have held both defendants liable for their <b>negligent</b> <b>acts.</b> Example: A leaves truck parked {{in the middle of}} the road at night with its lights off. B fails to notice it in time and plows into it, where it could have been avoided, except for want of negligence, causing damage to both vehicles. Both parties were negligent. (Hill v.

The relevant section of the Penal Code creates two separate offences: causing death by a rash act, and causing death by a <b>negligent</b> <b>act,</b> the former being the more serious offence. Persons who cause deaths {{in the course of}} traffic accidents are often charged with one of these offences.|$|E

50|$|Causation {{in the law}} of delict {{gives rise}} to two {{distinct}} problems. The first is a factual one, relating {{to the question of}} whether or not the <b>negligent</b> <b>act</b> or omission in question caused or materially contributed to the harm which gave rise to the claim. If it did not, no legal liability can arise and cadit quaestio; if it did, the second problem becomes relevant: whether the <b>negligent</b> <b>act</b> or omission is linked to the harm sufficiently closely or directly for legal liability to ensue, or whether, as it is said, the harm is too remote.|$|E
