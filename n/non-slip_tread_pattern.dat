5000|$|Besides the {{different}} <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> available on some mountain bike tires mentioned above, {{front and rear}} tire sets are available for road bikes with different <b>tread</b> <b>patterns,</b> <b>tread</b> compounds, and sizes for {{the front and rear}} wheels. [...] Other scenarios involve replacing a damaged tire, and leaving the other one unchanged.|$|R
40|$|The regular tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> {{design process}} is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of tyre-road noise is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of tyre-road noise. The three most important tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on smooth roads, the tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise. From these tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> noise. The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of tyre tread patternn noise. The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94). The coupled source - human perception model can be used to speed up and improve the current tyre tread patter design process...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects that different basketball shoe outsole <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> have on the amount of slip and therefore the performance of the individual while undergoing normal basketball transitions. Tread grooves and therefore patterns must exist on the outsole of a basketball shoe because the chances of contamination and for practical durability. With the existence of so many basketball shoes with varying <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> and characteristics it presents the question of whether or not varying patterns affect traction, slip, and therefore athletic performance. This study evaluated the amount of slips of two pairs of basketball shoes with human participants running basketball drills on a hardwood basketball floor at Wartburg College. The results indicated that one shoe with a much more unique <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> performed better with fewer slips, and fewer severe slips, especially when considering lateral movements than the other shoe which had a <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> with similar <b>tread</b> characteristics to many other currently available market shoes...|$|R

50|$|Clinchers do {{have their}} advantages. Changing tires is much quicker since {{it does not}} involve a lengthy glueing and curing process so a rider can have a large {{selection}} of tires at their disposal. Until recently, clinchers also generally had more cutting edge <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> than the more traditional tubulars. Some enthusiasts even {{went as far as}} to send Michelin Mud tires (a popular clincher tire) to Dugast (a manufacturer of high end tubular tires) to have a modern <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> incorporated into a traditional tubular. However, since 2005 several tubular manufacturers have designed more modern style <b>tread</b> <b>patterns,</b> namely Dugast with its Rhino, Tufo with its Flexus and Challenge with its Grifo and Fango. Lastly, clincher tires generally cost less than tubulars.|$|R
50|$|Bar grip tyres, or 'NDT' (Non-Directional Tire) in US {{military}} parlance, are {{an early}} tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> developed for off-road use.|$|R
50|$|Treads fall {{somewhere along}} the {{spectrum}} from smooth or slick to knobby. Smooth treads are intended for on-road use, where a <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> offers no improvement in traction. However, many otherwise slick tires have a light <b>tread</b> <b>pattern,</b> due to the common belief that a slick tire will be slippery in wet conditions. Knobby treads are intended for off-road use, where the tread texture can help improve traction on soft surfaces. Many treads are omnidirectional—the tire can be installed in either orientation—but some are unidirectional and designed to be oriented a certain way. Some tires, especially for mountain bikes, have a tread which is intended either for the front wheel or the rear wheel. A special <b>tread</b> <b>pattern,</b> with small dimples, has been developed to reduce air drag.|$|R
50|$|The rain groove is {{a design}} {{element of the}} <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> {{specifically}} arranged to channel water away from the footprint. Rain grooves are circumferential in most truck tires. Many high-performance passenger tires feature rain grooves that are angled from the center toward {{the sides of the}} tire. Some tire manufacturers claim that their <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> is designed to actively pump water out from under the tire by the action of the tread flexing. This results in a smoother ride in different types of weather.|$|R
50|$|Dunlop {{exported}} {{on average}} over 120,000 pairs of KT26 shoes to Papua New Guinea per year. Dunlop KT26s have become ubiquitous fashion items within rugged countries {{where they are}} prized for their low cost, wide fit, sturdy construction and superior <b>tread</b> <b>pattern.</b> The shoe's <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> is particularly useful in muddy conditions, which has helped it to become the footwear of choice for competitors in the Kokoda Challenge, a race over {{the length of the}} Kokoda Track. It is reported that there are over 23 counterfeit versions of KT26 on sale in Papua New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|Tires {{may also}} be directional, where the <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> favors {{operation}} in one direction. This usually {{takes the form of}} v-shaped grooves that help to disperse water from the center {{to the edge of the}} tread. Symmetric directional tires can be used on both sides, but once mounted on a rim cannot be moved to the other side, since the <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> will be in the wrong direction. This restricts tire rotation. Some directional tires are also asymmetric, in which case there will be specific left and right-handed versions.|$|R
40|$|The characteristics, {{which include}} the cornering-force and drag-force {{friction}} coefficients and self-alining torque, were obtained on dry, damp, and flooded runway surfaces over a range of yaw angles from 0 deg to 12 deg and at ground speeds from approximately 5 to 90 knots. The results indicate that a <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> with pinholes in the ribs reduces the tire cornering capability at high yaw angles on a damp surface but improves cornering on a dry surface. A <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> which has transverse grooves across the entire width of the tread improves the tire cornering performance slightly at high speeds on the flooded runway surface. The cornering capability of all the tires is degraded at high ground speeds by thin film lubrication and/or tire hydroplaning effects. Alterations to the conventional <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> provide only marginal improvements in the tire cornering capability which suggests that runway surface treatments {{may be a more}} effective way of improving aircraft ground performance during wet operations...|$|R
50|$|An {{asymmetric}} tire may {{refer to}} a tire whose <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> does not form in line symmetry or point symmetry vis-à-vis its central line, thus having a distinct inside and outside edge. They may be mounted {{on either side of}} the vehicle. Since the <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> of many ordinary tires do not form symmetry in relation to design or pattern noise, the method of mounting tires is specially prescribed. This type of tires is used in many cases to promote tire performance, braking performance, and turning performance, since tread contact changes according to the change in alignment during travel.|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> design for optimum wet grip performance. A mathematical model of tyre behaviour on wet roads has been developed. This utilizes the finite element method in the representation of <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> geometry. The performance of a particular <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> is found {{in terms of the}} fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing within the contact patch, under wet conditions. Many modern <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> are based on 'blocks', and a computer model has been developed specifically to assist the tyre designer in the design of these blocks for improved wet grip. Numerical results are presented both for complete contact patches and for individual tread blocks. To allow the use of the computer models by the tyre designer, with no specialist knowledge of the finite element method, special purpose mesh generation and plotting programs have been developed. Experiments have been undertaken whereby the fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing in the tyre contact patch have been measured under high speed conditions in the wet. These measure- ments were made on an indoor testing machine, and the techniques developed can be used in the routine evaluation of tyre wet grip performance. Some results of experiments performed on plain and simple patterned tyres are presented. The main purpose of this work was the development of the mathematical models which can be used for future research into, and design of, tyres for improved wet grip. However, some conclusions are made as to possible features which could be utilized in future tyre designs...|$|R

40|$|Good slip {{resistant}} <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> of outer-sole of military boot {{are vital to}} minimize the risk or severity of slip in combat and physical training situations. A series of non-linear, three-dimensional finite element analyses of footwear and ground interaction based upon the Drucker-Prager elastic-perfectly plastic material model was investigated. This study was aimed at how plastic failure of soil mass develops between the relative rigid boot outer-sole (cleats) and soft soil surfaces. The solid interaction models between rigid outersole of boot with five different typical <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> and soft soil surfaces have been modelled in ANSYS finite element code.

50|$|The {{train is}} {{propelled}} by drive tires {{because of the}} short distance of the two lifts. These tires vary in <b>tread</b> <b>pattern.</b> The main <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> is recycled rubber diamond cut. Some tires appear to not be spinning, but rather are speed monitors, which track how fast the train is being propelled, and depending on how fast the train is going, tells the other motors how fast to spin. If the train is going too fast, a fault will occur and the train will stop at the next possible stopping point. Each lift is 65 feet high; the first lift is a 20 degree incline, while the second lift is a 25 degree incline.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In general, when {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} a sedan vehicle’s tire <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> design on the noise generated, the noise is measured by first carving the tires and then using expensive laboratory equipment to perform the measurements. The advantages of using this method are that the experimental results and the noise level produced from the tires (that go into mass production) feature minimal differences and that reliable tested data are produced. The disadvantages of this method are that molds must be created to produce slicks, and that substantial time is invested in the process of artificial carving and performing subsequent experiments, all of which increase the tire development time and cost. Therefore, {{the effect of a}} sedan vehicle’s tire <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> design on rolling noise was predicted in this study by employing the numerical calculation methods used in calculating fluid mechanics. The experimental results obtained by the Automotive Research & Testing Center (ARTC) were used to test the improved <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> designs to validate the reliability of the method proposed in this study and that the tire development time can be effectively shortene...|$|R
