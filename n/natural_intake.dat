Effort to change the behavior of farmers who are accustomed to using inorganic material to organic farming was not easy. This study aimed to determine (1) the costs and benefit of local varieties cultivation of paddy, Cicih Gondrong, with semi-organic pattern; and (2) the farmer perception toward Cicih Gondrong semi-organic pattern cultivation. This research used plot demonstration (demplots) and survey methods. The results showed that semi-organic cultivation of paddy Cicih Gondrong, economically profitable. There are significant changes in the perception of farmers on the management of local varieties of rice before and after the demonstration carried out.

40|$|Resveratrol is a {{naturally}} occurring polyphenol {{that is often}} used as a food supplement. Many positive health effects, including cardio protection, tumor suppression, and immune modulation, {{are associated with the}} intake of resveratrol. Resveratrol is well tolerated in healthy subjects without any comedication. However, supplemental doses of resveratrol in the range of 1 g/day or above by far exceed the <b>natural</b> <b>intake</b> through food. Whether resveratrol-drug interactions can be harmful in patients taking additional medications remains unknown. Recent in vivo studies and clinical trials indicate a possible drug-drug interaction potential using high-dosage formulations. In this review, the known in vitro and in vivo effects of resveratrol on various cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isoenzymes are summarized. They are discussed in relation to clinically relevant plasma concentrations in humans. We conclude that resveratrol may lead to interactions with various CYPs, especially when taken in high doses. Aside from systemic CYP inhibition, intestinal interactions must also be considered. They can potentially lead to reduced first-pass metabolism, resulting in higher systemic exposure to certain coadministrated CYP substrates. Therefore, patients who ingest high doses of this food supplement combined with additional medications may be at risk of experiencing clinically relevant drug-drug interactions...|$|E
40|$|When man started {{producing}} his food-supply {{the long}} way of deteration in quality began and still continues in the genetic manipulation of our food resources. The preneolithic tribes had a natural diet, which contained all the necessary minerals. By reducing the food supply towards breeded cattle and cultivated plants this <b>natural</b> <b>intake</b> was not given any more. One of the first signs was certainly the reduced intake of minerals, especially of salt (NaCl). The minimum survival intake for the salt intake is only 0, 025 g per day and the offer scarcely wasn not below that level. On the other hand the optimum rate of the daily intake {{is said to be}} 5 - 6 g (HEUBERGER 1994, p. 65) 1. It seems to be quite obvious that the physical competitiveness increases with a well balanced food intake. Consequently man started looking for an artificial substitute, which was found in salt springs and the sea. Hence the first salt-works we know belong to the neolithic period (DUMITROAIA 1994, p. 7 - 82). The prehistoric salt works present large layers of ashes and, briquetage called, pottery. In Bad Nauheim these relicts were discovered in 1837 (LUDWIG 1865, p. 48). During the 1960 ´s a number of exavations were carried out and gave a fairly good impression of the prehistoric salt production. 2 Besides an early middleaged salt works there was a large latèneperiod industry. Unfortunatelly these excavations are still not published comprehensively yet. Eventhough the premallary reports give a good impression of the site(SÜß 1973, p. 167 - 180). It was 20 years later when construction works forced excavation in Bad Nauheim again. This time it was possible to excavate a well preserved kiln. Unfortunatelly it was damaged at both ends (WEISSHAAR 1985, 1 This rate even will increase enourmously considering the use for conservation, use i...|$|E

40|$|Folate {{is found}} {{naturally}} in foods or as synthetic folic acid in dietary supplements and fortified foods. Adequate periconceptional folic acid intake can prevent neural tube defects. Folate intake impacts blood folate concentration; however, the dose-response between natural food folate and blood folate concentrations {{has not been}} well described. We estimated this association among healthy females. A systematic literature review identified studies (1 1992 – 3 2014) with both <b>natural</b> food folate <b>intake</b> alone and blood folate concentration among females aged 12 – 49 years. Bayesian methods were used to estimate regression model parameters describing the association between <b>natural</b> food folate <b>intake</b> and subsequent blood folate concentration. Seven controlled trials and 29 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. For the six studies using microbiologic assay (MA) included in the meta-analysis, we estimate that a 6 % (95 % Credible Interval (CrI) : 4 %, 9 %) increase in red blood cell (RBC) folate concentration and a 7 % (95 % CrI: 1 %, 12 %) increase in serum/plasma folate concentration can occur for every 10 % increase in <b>natural</b> food folate <b>intake.</b> Using modeled results, we estimate that a <b>natural</b> food folate <b>intake</b> of ≥ 450 μg dietary folate equivalents (DFE) /day could achieve the lower bound of an RBC folate concentration (~ 1050 nmol/L) associated with the lowest risk of a neural tube defect. <b>Natural</b> food folate <b>intake</b> affects blood folate concentration and adequate intakes could help women achieve a RBC folate concentration associated with a risk of 6 neural tube defects/ 10, 000 live births...|$|R

We analyzed the relationships among four datasets on different components of the pond food web (water quality, food availability, <b>natural</b> food <b>intake,</b> and fish growth and production) with the aim {{to examine the effects}} of the addition of common carp and/or artificial feed on the different components of the pond food web, and to analyze the nature and strength of the interactions between these components. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to investigate these effects and interactions. We found that the addition of common carp increased bio-available N and P in the water column. Artificial feed addition increased N and P only in the presence of common carp. N and P increases were more pronounced in the presence of 0. 5 than in the presence of 1 common carp m¿ 2. Plankton availability was strongly positively correlated with bio-available N and P. Phytoplankton availability correlated strongest with PO 4 ¿P, and zooplankton availability correlated strongest with PO 4 ¿P and DO. <b>Natural</b> food <b>intake</b> in rohu was positively correlated with plankton availability in the pond water and rohu growth was also positively correlated with <b>natural</b> food <b>intake.</b> Rohu preferred plankton over artificial feed, which acted as a fertilizer for rohu growth.

40|$|Abstract Background Lithium as a {{substance}} occurring naturally in food and drinking water may exert positive effects on mental health. In therapeutic doses, which are more than 100 times higher than <b>natural</b> daily <b>intakes,</b> lithium has been {{proven to be a}} mood-stabilizer and suicide preventive. This study examined whether natural lithium content in drinking water is regionally associated with lower suicide rates. Methods Previous statistical approaches were challenged by global and local spatial regression models taking spatial autocorrelation as well as non-stationarity into account. A Geographically Weighted Regression model was applied with significant independent variables as indicated by a spatial autoregressive model. Results The association between lithium levels in drinking water and suicide mortality can be confirmed by the global spatial regression model. In addition, the local spatial regression model showed that the association was mainly driven by the eastern parts of Austria. Conclusions According to old anecdotic reports {{the results of this study}} support the hypothesis of positive effects of <b>natural</b> lithium <b>intake</b> on mental health. Both, the new methodological approach and the results relevant for health may open new avenues in the collaboration between Geographic Information Science, medicine, and even criminology, such as exploring the spatial association between violent or impulsive crime and lithium content in drinking water. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Europe, dietary {{management}} of isovaleric acidemia (IVA) may vary widely. There is limited collective information about dietetic management. AIM: To describe European practice regarding the dietary {{management of}} IVA, {{prior to the}} availability of the E-IMD IVA guidelines (E-IMD 2014). METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire was sent to all European dietitians who were either members of the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism Dietitians Group (SSIEM-DG) or whom had responded to previous questionnaires on dietetic practice (n = 53). The questionnaire comprised 27 questions about the dietary management of IVA. RESULTS: Information on 140 patients with IVA from 39 centres was reported. 133 patients (38 centres) were given a protein restricted diet. Leucine-free amino acid supplements (LFAA) were routinely used to supplement protein intake in 58 % of centres. The median total protein intake prescribed achieved the WHO/FAO/UNU [2007] safe levels of protein intake in all age groups. Centres that prescribed LFAA had lower <b>natural</b> protein <b>intakes</b> in most age groups except 1 to 10 y. In contrast, when centres were not using LFAA, the median <b>natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> met WHO/FAO/UNU [2007] safe levels of protein intake in all age groups. Enteral tube feeding was rarely prescribed. CONCLUSIONS: This survey demonstrates wide differences in dietary practice in the management of IVA across European centres.

AIM: A comparison of dietetic management practices of patients with B 6 non-responsive HCU in European centres. METHODS: A cross-sectional audit by questionnaire was completed by 29 inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) centres: (14 UK, 5 Germany, 3 Netherlands, 2 Switzerland, 2 Portugal, 1 France, 1 Norway, 1 Belgium). RESULTS: 181 patients (73 % > 16 years of age) with HCU were identified. The majority (66 %; n= 119) were on dietary treatment (1 - 10 years, 90 %; 11 - 16 years, 82 %; and > 16 years, 58 %) with or without betaine and 34 % (n= 62) were on betaine alone. The median <b>natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> (g/day) on diet only was, by age: 1 - 10 years, 12 g; 11 - 16 years, 11 g; and > 16 years, 45 g. With diet and betaine, median <b>natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> (g/day) by age was: 1 - 10 years, 13 g; 11 - 16 years, 20 g; and > 16 years, 38 g. Fifty-two percent (n= 15) of centres allocated natural protein by calculating methionine rather than a protein exchange system. A methionine-free l-amino acid supplement was prescribed for 86 % of diet treated patients. Fifty-two percent of centres recommended cystine supplements for low plasma concentrations. Target treatment concentrations for homocystine/homocysteine (free/total) and frequency of biochemical monitoring varied. CONCLUSION: In B 6 non-responsive HCU the prescription of dietary restriction by IMD centres declined with age, potentially associated with poor adherence in older patients. Inconsistencies in biochemical monitoring and treatment indicate the need for international consensus guidelines...|$|R

40|$|The optimal dietary {{management}} {{of children with}} phenylketonuria (PKU) has rarely been rigorously explored. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess longitudinally the effects of three factors thought to influence plasma phenylalanine concentrations in PKU: total energy intake; protein <b>intake</b> from <b>natural</b> foods allowed freely in addition to allocated phenylalanine exchanges; and the distribution of protein substitute throughout the day. Nineteen subjects, 15 girls and four boys aged 1 - 16 years, were enrolled. Food intake was weighed, and twice daily plasma phenylalanine concentrations measured during either 3 -day or 4 -day periods, for a total of 21 days throughout six months. There was a negative correlation between the percentage of protein substitute eaten by the time of the evening meal and the fall in plasma phenylalanine concentration during the day (r = - 0. 941; p < 0. 0001). On average, 49 % of pre-evening meal plasma phenylalanine concentrations were less than 100 mumol/l in children who had taken at least 65 % of their protein substitute by the time of their evening meal. There was no correlation between excess <b>natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> from freely allowed foods and (a) pre-breakfast or pre-evening meal plasma phenylalanine concentrations or (b) the daily change between pre-breakfast and pre-evening meal concentrations. Nor was there any correlation between excess <b>natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> on the previous day and plasma phenylalanine concentration on the following morning. Energy intake was not correlated with plasma phenylalanine concentrations. It is therefore preferable to distribute the protein substitute evenly through the day in order to achieve stable phenylalanine concentrations, rather than to carry out further fine manipulation of the phenylalanine intake, which would make {{management of}} the diet even more difficult...|$|R

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This community-based cross-sectional study included 1160 men and 2780 women aged 31 - 75 years. Dietary intakes were assessed using a food-frequency questionnaire. The IMTs at the common, bifurcation and {{internal carotid artery}} segments, and fasting serum total (TC), LDL (LDLc) and HDL (HDLc) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG) were determined. After adjusting for potential covariates, multivariate analysis showed a dose-dependent inverse association of total PS intake with serum TC, LDLc, non-HDLc in women (P 0. 05) in men. Although the IMTs tended to be lower with greater intake of dietary PS, only small differences in the left internal IMT between the highest and lowest groups were observed among men (- 7. 6 %) and women (- 5. 1 %) (P 0. 05).

Since these three amino acids occur in all natural protein, and most natural foods contain some protein, any food intake must be closely monitored, and day-to-day protein intake calculated on a cumulative basis, to ensure individual tolerance levels are not exceeded at any time. As the MSUD diet is so protein-restricted, and adequate protein is a requirement for all humans, tailored metabolic formula containing all the other essential amino acids, as well as any vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and trace elements (which may be lacking due to the limited range of permissible foods), are an essential aspect of MSUD management. These complement the MSUD patient's <b>natural</b> food <b>intake</b> to meet normal nutritional requirements without causing harm.

Knowledge of the effects of such rigorous diet therapy on feeding behaviour is also important. In a series of studies, the effect of a number of dietary factors on plasma phenylalanine control and of diet on feeding behaviour was systematically investigated. The key findings were: 1) there is wide variability in plasma phenylalanine concentrations which were not reflected in a single early morning phenylalanine measurement; 2) plasma phenylalanine concentrations were more influenced by the timing and dosage of protein substitute than by total energy or excess <b>natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> from ‘freely’ allowed foods; 3) repeated 4 hourly administration of protein substitute throughout 24 -hours markedly reduced phenylalanine variability and led to lower phenylalanine concentrations; 4) ‘free’ use of fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine between 51 - 100 mg/ 100 g did not adversely affect plasma phenylalanine control; and 5) feeding problems were common, with almost 50 % of young children with PKU exhibiting at least 3 feeding problems. These findings in PKU are important in the {{understanding of}} feeding behaviour; the interpretation of plasma phenylalanine concentrations; they increase and rationalise the range of ‘free’ foods; and will reduce 24 -hour plasma phenylalanine variability, and thus, possibly increase dietary phenylalanine tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Phytosterols are cholesterol-like {{molecules}} {{found in}} all plant foods, with the highest concentrationsoccurring in vegetable oils.

Attempts to measure biological effects in feedingstudies have been impeded by limited solubility in both water and fat. Esterification of phytosterols withlong-chain fatty acids increases fat solubility by 10 -fold and allows delivery of several grams daily in fattyfoods such as margarine. A dose of 2 g/day as the ester reduces low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 10 %,and little difference is observed between Delta(5) -sterols and 5 alpha-reduced sterols (stanols). Phytosterolscan also be dispersed in water after emulsification with lecithin and reduce cholesterol absorption whenadded to nonfat foods. In contrast to these supplementation studies, much less {{is known about the}} effect oflow phytosterol levels in the natural diet. However, reduction of cholesterol absorption can be measured at adose of only 150 mg during otherwise sterol-free test meals, suggesting that natural food phytosterols maybe clinically important.

The main sources of industrial TFA were fast food, white bread and processed baked goods. Milk, red and processed meat and processed baked goods were the main sources of natural TFA. Having parents from countries other than Spain was significantly associated with higher natural TFA (in mg/day) intake (β 45. 5) and television viewing was significantly associated with higher industrial TFA intake (β 18. 3). Higher fruits and vegetables intake was significantly associated with lower intakes of all TFAs, whereas higher sweetened beverages intake was significantly associated with lower total and <b>natural</b> TFA <b>intake.</b> Thus, total and industrial TFA intake was associated with less healthy food patterns and lifestyles in Spanish preschool children...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{from the}} first half of this century report concern for {{toxicity}} from topical use of boric acid, but assessment of percutaneous absorption has been impaired by lack of analyti-cal sensitivity. Analytical methods in this study included induc-tively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry which now allows quantitation of percutaneous absorption of 10 B in 10 B-enriched boric acid, borax, and disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) in biological matrices. This made it possible, in the presence of comparatively large <b>natural</b> dietary boron <b>intakes</b> for the in vivo segment of this study, to quantify the boron passing through skin. Human volunteers were dosed with 10 B-enriched boric acid, 5. 0 %, borax, 5. 0 %, or disodium octaborate tetrahy-drate, 10 %, in aqueous solutions. Urinalysis, for boron and changes in boron isotope ratios, was used to measure absorp-tion. Boric acid in vivo percutaneous absorption was 0. 22...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{that higher}} <b>natural</b> {{antioxidants}} (NA) <b>intake</b> provides cardiovascular protection is contradictory. The endothelium plays {{a pivotal role}} in cardiovascular homeostasis, and for this reason, the molecular events resulting from the interaction of NA with endothelial cells (ECs) are actively investigated. Here, we show that moderately high doses of coumaric acid (CA) induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ECs death. Treatment of ECs with cyclosporine A, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, prevented the oxidative-mediated cell damage indicating mitochondrial involvement in CA-induced ECs impairment. CA-induced intracellular ROS generation was counteracted by the specific cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 C 9 inhibitor sulfaphenazole (SPZ). SPZ also prevented CA-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ECs death, implicating CYP 2 C 9 in mediating the cellular response upon CA treatment. Our results indicate that moderately high doses of CA can promote CYP 2 C 9 -mediated oxidative stress eliciting mitochondrial-dependent ECs death and may pave the way toward mechanistic insight into NA effects on cardiovascular cells...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Phenylketonuria is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} of metabolism of amino acid phenylalanine, {{which results in}} the absence of phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Screening for phenylketonuria in Voivodina started in 2003. Screening data are shown in this paper. Treatment of phenylketonuria is based on a strict, life long, low protein diet with the controlled phenylalanine intake. Diet must start early, in the first weeks of life. The aim of the diet is to reduce <b>natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> and to cover protein needs by special phenylalanine free protein products. There is a big variety of formulas found available on the market for treatment of phenylketonuria. All of them are free of phenylalanine and very expensive. Discussion. Till May 2005 there was no refunding for these products in our country. According to the decision made by the Provincial Secretariat for Health, providing all children with protein supplement in their first year of life started at the Institute for Child and Youth Healthcare. In September 2007 the Republic Fund for Health Insurance started to refund protein supplement and low protein products for all children up to the age of 18 years. Conclusion. Besides all technical and organizational difficulties associated with this work, this paper also shows how, by good prevention of phenylketonuria complications, much more money can be saved than it has been invested, even in countries with low amounts of money allocated for this purpose (in absolute figures) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recessive LARS {{mutations}} {{were recently}} reported {{to cause a}} novel syndrome, infantile liver failure syndrome type 1 (ILFS 1), in six Irish Travellers. We have since identified four additional patients, including one of Ashkenazi origin, representing the largest ILFS 1 cohort to date. Our study aims to define the ILFS 1 clinical phenotype to help guide diagnosis and patient management. Methods: We clinically evaluated and reviewed the medical records of ten ILFS 1 patients. Clinical features, histopathology and natural histories were compared and patient management strategies reviewed. Results: Early failure to thrive, recurrent liver dysfunction, anemia, hypoalbuminemia and seizures were present in all patients. Most patients (90 %) had developmental delay. Encephalopathic episodes triggered by febrile illness have occurred in 80 % and were fatal in two children. Two patients are currently > 28 years old and clinically well. Leucine supplementation had no appreciable impact on patient well-being. However, we suggest that the traditional management of reducing/stopping protein intake in patients with metabolic hepatopathies may not be appropriate for ILFS 1. We currently recommend ensuring sufficient <b>natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> when unwell. Conclusions: We report the first non-Irish ILFS 1 patient, suggesting ILFS 1 may be more extensive than anticipated. Low birth weight, early failure to thrive, anemia and hypoalbuminemia are amongst the first presenting features, with liver dysfunction before age 1. Episodic hepatic dysfunction is typically triggered by febrile illness, and becomes less severe with increasing age. While difficult to anticipate, two patients are currently > 28 years old, suggesting that survival beyond childhood {{may be associated with}} a favourable long-term prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Early {{developmental}} {{conditions have}} major implications for an individual's fitness. In species where offspring are born simultaneously, {{the level of}} sibling competition for food access is intense. In birds, high sibling competition may subject nestlings to decreased growth rate {{as a result of}} limited food and increased levels of oxidative stress through high metabolic activity induced by begging behaviors. We manipulated the level of sibling competition in a natural population of great tits and assessed the consequences for nestling body condition and resistance to oxidative stress. In a full factorial design, we both augmented brood size to increase sibling competition and supplemented the male parents with physiological doses of carotenoids thereby doubling the <b>natural</b> carotenoid <b>intake,</b> aiming at increasing the males' investment in current reproduction and thereby decreasing sibling competition. Nestling body mass was reduced by the brood enlargement and enhanced by the carotenoid supplementation of fathers. Nestling resistance to oxidative stress, measured as total antioxidant defenses in whole blood, was not influenced by the treatments. Because nestlings experience high metabolic activities, an absence of an effect of sibling competition on free radicals production seems unlikely. Nestling body mass decreased and resistance to oxidative stress tended to increase with initial brood size, and hence these correlational effects suggest a trade-off between morphological growth and development of the antioxidant system. However, the result of the experimental treatment did not support this trade-off hypothesis. Alternatively, it suggests that nestling developed compensatory mechanisms that were not detected by our antioxidant capacity measur...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{association}} between vascular disease and elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations is caused, in part, by inadequate intakes of dietary folate. Increasing folate intake either through supplements or foods naturally rich in folates {{has been shown}} to decrease tHcy concentrations. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether a similar reduction in tHcy was possible in free-living persons receiving dietary counseling. DESIGN: The study included a 4 -wk placebo-controlled dietary intervention trial in which participants consumed either unfortified breakfast cereal (control group) or an extra 350 micro g folate derived from food/d (dietary group). Serum folate and tHcy concentrations in both groups were measured before and after the intervention period, and the concentrations in the dietary group were also measured 17 wk after the intervention period. RESULTS: During the 4 -wk intervention, mean dietary folate intake in the dietary group increased from 263 (95 % CI: 225, 307) to 618 micro g/d (535, 714), resulting in a mean increase in serum folate of 37 % (15 %, 63 %) and a decrease in tHcy from 12. 0 (10. 9, 13. 3) to 11. 3 micro mol/L (10. 2, 12. 5). A further decrease in tHcy occurred in the dietary group during follow-up, with a final tHcy concentration of 9. 7 micro mol/L (8. 8, 10. 8). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing <b>natural</b> folate <b>intake</b> improved folate status and decreased tHcy concentrations to an extent that may significantly reduce the risk of vascular disease. Dietary modification may have advantages over folic acid fortification because the altered food-consumption patterns lead to increased intakes of several vitamins and minerals and decreased intakes of saturated fatty acids. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Children with {{inherited}} metabolic disorders (IMD) who {{are dependent}} on tube feeding and require a protein restriction are commonly fed by ‘modular tube feeds’ consisting of several ingredients. A longitudinal, prospective two-phase study, conducted over 18  months assessed the long-term efficacy of a pre-measured protein-free composite feed. This was specifically {{designed to meet the}} non-protein nutritional requirements of children (aged over 1  year) with organic acidaemias on low protein enteral feeds and {{to be used as a}} supplement with an enteral feeding protein source. Methodology: All non-protein individual feed ingredients were replaced with one protein-free composite feed supplying fat, carbohydrate, and micronutrients. Thirteen subjects, median age 7. 4 y (3 – 15. 5 y), all nutritionally tube dependent (supplying nutritional intake: ≥  90 %, n =  12; 75 %, n =  1), and diagnosed with organic acidaemias (Propionic acidaemia, n =  6; Vitamin B 12 non-responsive methyl malonic acidaemia, n =  4; Isovaleric acidaemia, n =  2; Glutaric aciduria type 1, n =  1); were studied. Nutritional intake, biochemistry and anthropometry were monitored at week − 8, 0, 12, 26 and 79. Results: Energy intake remained unchanged, providing 76 % of estimated energy requirements. Dietary intakes of vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids significantly increased from week 0 to week 79, but sodium, potassium, magnesium, decosahexanoic acid and fibre did not meet suggested requirements. Plasma zinc, selenium, haemoglobin and MCV significantly improved, and growth remained satisfactory. <b>Natural</b> protein <b>intake</b> met WHO/FAO/UNU 2007 recommendations. Conclusions: A protein-free composite feed formulated to meet the non-protein nutritional requirements of children aged over 1  year improved nutritional intake, biochemical nutritional status, and simplified enteral tube feeding regimens in children with organic acidaemias...|$|R
