50|$|MARSEC (MARitime SECurity) is the three-tiered United States Coast Guard Maritime Security system (alert state) {{designed}} to easily communicate to the Coast Guard and the maritime industry pre-planned scalable responses for credible threats. Its {{objective is to}} provide an assessment of possible terrorist activity within the maritime sectors of transportation, including threats to <b>nautical</b> <b>facilities</b> and vessels falling within {{the jurisdiction of the}} United States that could be targets of attack.|$|E
50|$|It was {{activated}} {{again during}} the Second World War, whereupon the Portuguese remained neutral, in agreement with Britain, which {{did not want to}} bring the war into the Iberian Peninsula, until 1943, when it was fully reactivated by the National Government of Winston Churchill and Portugal. Britain, after three months' negotiations, was accorded aerodrome and <b>nautical</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Portuguese Azores to help combat the U-boat threat. The British also cited the treaty during the 1982 Falklands War.|$|E
40|$|New {{legislation}} in the Valencian Community (Decree 36 / 2002, 5 th of March) has allowed {{the expansion of the}} existent marinas in this region of the SE of Spain, affecting in a significant way the Alicante province that possesses over thirty <b>nautical</b> <b>facilities</b> of this type. Of particular importance are the effects that expansion of these ports would have on marine ecosystems, especially on Posidonia oceanica beds. This species is of a great ecological and biological importance, and is very sensitive to human activities along the coastline. The present study focuses on the current impacts and potential impacts of port extension of the Port of Altea and the Marina Luis Campomanes (NE Alicante) on the existing P. oceanica meadows near them. Density, cover, morphology and phenology of P. oceanica growing close to the ports were compared with adjacent control sites. The present ports have caused the destruction of at least 11 Ha of Posidonia meadow and the degradation of another 14 Ha where it has been detected an important reduction of its cover and density, and an increase in rhizome growth, the herbivore rate and the load of epiphytes of its leaves. Furthermore the analysis of all these data have also allowed to determine that the outer expansion of both ports would cause the disappearance of 64 Ha and the regression of 18 Ha of P. oceanica meadows...|$|E
40|$|The {{study area}} is a marina named Veleiros da Ilha, a <b>nautical</b> <b>facility</b> of medium size, located in the South Bay of Santa Catarina Island. The main {{objective}} of the research was to test some physical and chemical parameters with potential use {{for the analysis of}} projects related to the location and implementation of marinas. Therefore, oxygen, copper, bottom sediment and fauna were collected and analyzed. Climatic data such as temperature and wind speed were obtained in parallel to the field work. The potential sediments revealed that there is little difference between external and internal circulation of the marina. The same occurs regarding the dissolved oxygen that indicates little influence of the marina’s structure on the internal circulation. The concentration of dissolved oxygen tends to be higher with lower temperature and higher wind intensity. The high levels of coliforms might be associated with sewage located in the surrounding area, as the marina has its own sewage treatment system. With regard to copper, the results suggest that this element’s concentration is below the limits defined by current legislation. The entrance of the marina is not in the best position, but the effects are minimized by its project, which allows good water circulation in the area...|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} from Istanbul to Marmara Island is 76 <b>nautical</b> miles. Transport <b>facilities</b> {{vary depending on}} the season. During the summer season many tourists visit the islands. Avşa and Marmara have daily connections from Istanbul from May to October. Connections are available everyday from Tekirdağ and Erdek. Paşalimanı has daily transport from Erdek District only. Ekinlik Island has connections through Erdek District and Avşa Island.|$|R

40|$|Foraminiferal living assemblages from a {{brackish}} {{tidal marsh}} were studied across three sampling transects, under Spring and Autumn conditions. Foraminiferal analysis was also {{extended to the}} dead assemblages of Spring samples. Altimetric control of each sampling point was acquired through the connection to the national datum by GPS differential positioning combined with a regional geoid model. The influence of the geochemical characteristics on the assemblages including chemical composition of the estuarine and marsh surface sediments, in addition to salinity, pH and calcite saturation of estuarine and marsh interstitial waters was evaluated. A high affinity was found between Spring and Autumn living assemblages, probably related to the low number of representative species. The affinity also found between living and dead assemblage {{was seen as a}} consequence of low pH and calcite undersaturation that prevent the accumulation effect of several generations of foraminifera. Salinity appears as a clear constraint to the foraminiferal assemblages composition that is enhanced by calcite undersaturation in brackish marshes interstitial waters and sediments. Generally abundant marsh species like Trochammina inflata, Jadammina macrescens and the calcareous foraminifera are limited to an episodic presence. Foraminiferal assemblages distribution across brackish tidal marsh can be assumed as an elevation proxy. The high marsh IB sub-zone is dominated by Haplophragmoides sp. and Haplophragmoides manilaensis. Low marsh zone II is characterised by the dominance of Miliammina fusca but can be subdivided in an IIA upper part, where is followed by Pseudothurammina limnetis, and in a IIB lower part defined by a subsidiary presence of Psammosphaera sp. Haplophragmoides manilaensis dominance between 1. 55 m and 1. 67 m, at living as well as dead assemblages, suggests this species as a potential sea-level indicator for the brackish tidal marshes.

40|$|Existing {{beaches in}} Badung (Kuta, Legian, Nusa Dua, Jimbaran, Tanjung Benoa and Canggu) is a beach full of tourism {{activities}} (hotel, restaurant and <b>nautical</b> sports <b>facilities)</b> and other activities. The presence of waste {{that is not}} managed well will greatly contribute to {{the decline in the}} quality of waters. Results of analysis by in-situ and laboratory in the wet season and dry in 2008 and 2009 ie from 19 parameters analyzed physic, chemical and microbiological, there is 8 parameters has exceeded the maximum threshold for designation as a marine tourism in accordance with Governorâ€™s Rule of Bali No. 7 in 2007. Seawater quality parameters that exceed the Environmental Quality Standards is DO, BOD 5, NO 3, NH 3, phenol, phosphate, cadmium (Cd) and Plumbum (Pb). The results on the quality of coastal waters are four beaches (Kuta, Legian, Nusa Dua and Jimbaran) are classified as low polluted, and two beaches (Tanjung Benoa and Canggu) is classified as middle polluted. The research concluded that in general the water quality at six beaches in Badung in 2008 and 2009 is still worth utilized for the purposes of maritime tourism...|$|R
