40|$|A three-dimensional, {{high-resolution}} {{numerical model}} {{is used to}} investigate processes and dynamics of an intensified upwelling that is induced by a coastal promontory over the East China Sea (ECS) shelf. The center of the intensified upwelling around the promontory has been constantly observed, but, so far, it has been dynamically unexplained. Forced by an idealized southeasterly wind stress, the model results well capture the observed upwelling at the lee of the coastal promontory. The intensified upwelling is formed by a strengthened shoreward transport downstream of the promontory as the upwelling jet veers shoreward. The jet is mainly controlled by a cross-shore geostrophic balance and is largely modulated by both centrifugal acceleration associated with nonlinear advection and by bottom stress. The strengthened shoreward transport is mainly attributed to the cross-shore geostrophic current that is induced by a countercurrent (negative) pressure gradient force (PGF) and partly attributed to the bottom Ekman transport. Based on the analyses of the momentum balance and depth-integrated vorticity dynamics, the authors provide a new explanation for the origin of negative PGF. It is found that the countercurrent PGF is generated by negative bottom stress curl and strengthened by <b>negative</b> <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> downstream of the promontory. While the negative bottom stress curl arises from bottom shear vorticity, the source of negative advection downstream of the promontory is the negative shear vorticity on the seaside of the shoreward-bent jet.

40|$|This study investigates {{three types}} of {{atmospheric}} forcing across the summertime subtropics that are shown to contribute in various ways to the occurrence of dry and wet climates in the subtropics. To explain the formation of desert over the western parts of continents and monsoon over the eastern parts, we propose a new mechanism of positive feedback between diabatic heating and vorticity generation that occurs via meridional <b>advection</b> of planetary <b>vorticity</b> and temperature. Monsoon and desert are demonstrated to coexist as twin features of multi-scale forcing, as follows. First, continent-scale heating over land and cooling over ocean induce the ascent of air over the eastern parts of continents and western parts of oceans, and descent over eastern parts of oceans and western parts of continents. Second, local-scale sea-breeze forcing along coastal regions enhances air descent over eastern parts of oceans and ascent over eastern parts of continents. This leads {{to the formation of}} the well-defined summertime subtropical LOSECOD quadruplet-heating pattern across each continent and adjacent oceans, with long-wave radiative cooling (LO) over eastern parts of oceans, sensible heating (SE) over western parts of continents, condensation heating (CO) over eastern parts of continents, and double dominant heating (D: LO+CO) over western parts of oceans. Such a quadruplet heating pattern corresponds to a dry climate over the western parts of continents and a wet climate over eastern parts. Third, regional-scale orographic-uplift-heating generates poleward ascending flow to the east of orography and equatorward descending flow to the west. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is located over the eastern Eurasian continent. The TP-forced circulation pattern is in phase with that produced by continental-scale forcing, and the strongest monsoon and largest deserts are formed over the Afro-Eurasian Continent. In contrast, the Rockies and the Andes are located over the western parts of their respective continents, and orography-induced ascent is separated from ascent due to continental-scale forcing. Accordingly, the deserts and monsoon climate over these continents are not as strongly developed as those over the Eurasian Continent. A new mechanism of positive feedback between diabatic heating and vorticity generation, which occurs via meridional transfer of heat and planetary vorticity, is proposed as a means of explaining the formation of subtropical desert and monsoon. Strong low-level longwave radiative cooling over eastern parts of oceans and strong surface sensible heating on western parts of continents generate <b>negative</b> <b>vorticity</b> that is balanced by positive planetary <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> from high latitudes. The equatorward flow generated over eastern parts of oceans produces cold sea-surface temperature and stable stratification, leading in turn to the formation of low stratus clouds and the maintenance of strong in situ longwave radiative cooling. The equatorward flow over western parts of continents carries cold, dry air, thereby enhancing local sensible heating as well as moisture release from the underlying soil. These factors result in a dry desert climate. Over the eastern parts of continents, condensation heating generates positive vorticity in the lower troposphere, which is balanced by <b>negative</b> planetary <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> of the meridional flow from low latitudes. The flow brings warm and moist air, thereby enhancing local convective instability and condensation heating associated with rainfall. These factors produce a wet monsoonal climate.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} northward and northwestward {{propagation}} of 30 - 60 day oscillation over the western North Pacific (WNP) at upper and low levels with a three-dimensional streamfunction tendency equation. In the tropical WNP, the surface frictional effect {{associated with the}} cyclonic circulation enhances the low-level convergence at the cyclonic vorticity center to the northwest of the convection, causing the 30 - 60 day convection to develop northwestward. The <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> induces the 30 - 60 day circulation at upper and low levels to propagate northwestward with a baroclinic structure. The combined effect of surface frictional-diabatic heating and <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> causes the 30 - 60 day convection and circulation to develop and propagate simultaneously northwestward. After the convection fully develops, increased static stability associated with adiabatic cooling, reduced solar radiation due to the cloud-radiation effect, and negative land-surface feedbacks on moisture availability restrict any further development of the 30 - 60 day convection. A wave train emanating from the South China Sea/western North Pacific (SCS/WNP) into the extratropical North Pacific is well established 15 -days after the convection reached maximum intensity over the SCS/WNP.

40|$|Several {{cases of}} western North Pacific {{tropical}} cyclogenesis from the 1991 season are studied, with {{special emphasis on}} the antecedent conditions in the upper troposphere. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that tropical cyclogenesis takes place through an interaction between a pre-existing lower-tropospheric disturbance (ITCZ or easterly wave disturbance) and an independent upper-level trough.

40|$|Effects of {{landfall}} {{location and}} approach angle on track deflection {{associated with a}} tropical cyclone (TC) passing over an idealized and Central Appalachian Mountain is investigated {{by a series of}} idealized numerical experiments. When the TC landfalls on the central portion of the mountain range, it is deflected to the south upstream, passes over the mountain anticyclonically, and then moves westward downstream. The TC motion is steered by the positive vorticity tendency (VT) which is dominated by horizontal <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> upstream and downstream, but with additional influence from the stretching and residual terms, which are mainly associated with diabatic heating and frictional effects. The track deflection mechanism upstream and downstream is similar to the dry flow in previous study, but is very different {{in the vicinity of the}} mountain. When the TC landfalls near the northern (southern) tip, it experiences less (more) southward deflection due to stronger (weaker) <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> around the tip. When the TC approaches the mountain range from the southeast and landfalls on the northern tip, center, or southern tip, the track deflections are similar to those embedded in an easterly flow but with weaker orographic blocking. These results are similar to the cases simulated in the dry flow in previous study, except that there is no track discontinuity due to the weaker orographic blocking associated with strong TC convection. When a TC moves along the north-south mountain range from the south, it tends to deflect toward the mountain and then crosses over to the other side at later time. In these cases, the positive VT is influenced by all horizontal <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection,</b> <b>vorticity</b> stretching (diabatic heating) and residual (friction) terms due to longer and stronger interaction with the mountain range.

40|$|The {{formation}} of a blocking anticyclone over the North Atlantic has been examined over its entire life-cycle using the Zwack-Okossi (Z-O) equation as the diagnostic tool. This blocking anticyclone occurred in late October and early November of 1985. The data used were provided by the NASA Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres on a global 2. 0 ° latitude by 2. 5 ° longitude grid. The horizontal distribution of the atmospheric forcing mechanisms that were important to 500 mb block formation, maintenance and decay were examined. A scale-partitioned form of the Z-O equation was then {{used to examine the}} relative importance of forcing on the planetary and synoptic scales, and their interactions. As seen in previous studies, the results presented here show that upper tropospheric anticyclonic <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> was the most important contributor to block formation and maintenance. However, adiabatic warming, and vorticity tilting were also important at various times during the block lifetime. In association with precursor surface cyclogenesis, the 300 mb jet streak in the downstream (upstream) from a long-wave trough (ridge) amplified significantly. This strengthening of the jet streak enhanced the anticyclonic <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> field that aided the amplification of a 500 mb short- wave ridge. The partitioned height tendency results demonstrate that the interactions between the planetary and synoptic-scale through <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> was the most important contributor to block formation.

Next, the 3 D simulations were compared to 2 D simulations using different parallel closures; namely, the sheath dissipation closure, which neglects parallel gradients, and the <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> closure, which neglects the influence of parallel currents. The <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> closure was found to not replicate the 3 D perpendicular dynamics and overestimated the initial radial acceleration of all the filaments studied. In contrast, a more satisfactory comparison with the sheath dissipation closure was obtained, even in the presence of significant parallel gradients, where the closure is no longer valid. Specifically it captured the contrasting dynamics of filaments with different perpen- dicular sizes that were observed in the 3 D simulations which the <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> closure failed to replicate. However, neither closure successfully replicated the Boltzmann spinning effects and associated poloidal drift of the blob that was observed in the 3 D simulations. Although the sheath dissipation closure was concluded to be more successful in replicating the 3 D dynamics, it is emphasised that the vorticity closure may still be relevant for situations where the parallel current is inhibited from closing through the sheath due to effects such as increased resistivity near the targets.

40|$|The {{orographic}} {{effects of}} landfall location, approach angle, and their combination on track deflection during {{the passage of}} a cyclone vortex over a mesoscale mountain range are investigated using idealized model simulations. For an elongated mesoscale mountain range, the local vorticity generation, driving the cyclone vortex track deflection, is more dominated by <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> upstream of the mountain range, by vorticity stretching over the lee side and its immediate downstream area, and by <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> again far downstream of the mountain as it steers the vortex back to its original direction of movement. The <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> upstream of the mountain range is caused by the flow splitting associated with orographic blocking. It is found that the ideally simulated cyclone vortex tracks compare reasonably well with observed tracks of typhoons over Taiwan’s Central Mountain Range (CMR). In analyzing the relative vorticity budget, the authors found that jumps in the vortex path are largely governed by stretching on the lee side of the mountain. Based on the vorticity equation, this stretching occurs where fluid columns descend the lee slope so that the rate of stretching is governed mostly by the flow speed and the terrain slope. In other words, the maximum stretching and associated track jump are located on the faster side of the vortex. In the type E andN landfalling tracks, the faster winds are well north of themountain crest, and the vortex track has very little change across the mountain. For the S case, however, the stronger winds are {{near the center of the}} ridge, and the track jump is much larger. For the NE case, the jump in the vortex track occurs once the vortex center shifts south of the ridge. For the SE case, there is considerable stretching, but it is aligned with the original track, so there is no jump in track. 1...|$|R

Each of the jet and advection factors were then ana-lyzed in terms of these four classifications. The principal results from this study are as follows: The 850 - 300 -mb jet streak analysis primarily revealed that the right-rear (RR), and secondarily the left-front (LF), quad-rants of the 300 -mb speed maximum are the most favored for severe weather (i. e., 73 % of all events), consistent with divergence considerations, unless cyclonic curvature is pres-ent upstream. At 850 mb the only determination which can clearly be made is that the severe weather tends to occur {{to the left of the}} 850 -mb jet axis (72 % of all events). A verage wind speeds in the speed maxima at 850 mb and 300 mb were 40 kt and 95 kt respectively, which are thought to be considerably larger than those of the non-SELS envi-ronment of summer, when most SELS events studied here occurred.

The geostrophic current vorticities of the southern Adriatic and northern Ionian seas are correlated with a time lag of 14 months, which approximately corresponds to an advection speed of [*]∼[*]  1  cm s − 1. The different wind patterns observed during two NAO phases in the winter revealed a stronger positive <b>vorticity</b> during the <b>negative</b> NAO phase. Conversely, during the wintertime positive NAO phase the wind vorticity is characterized by lower positive or slightly negative values. Despite a statistically significant negative correlation between the NAO index and the wind vorticity, no unequivocal relationship between large climatic system and the interannual {{variability of}} the South Adriatic Gyre intensity was found due to additional effects of the <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> from the Ionian. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that the Ionian circulation mode does not depend on the NAO variations. Therefore, the main result of this study is that the interannual variability of the southern Adriatic cyclonic circulation is a result of the combined influence of the <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> from the Ionian and the local wind-curl effect...|$|R

Applying the relatively new methodology of the Zwack-Okossi equation, results show that anticyclonic <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> and cold-air advection acted to develop the anticyclone, while adiabatic warming in the descending air opposed development.
