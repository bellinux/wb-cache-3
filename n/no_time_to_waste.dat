They are joined by August, who shows them a drawing of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, who {{might be able to help}} them. Hook remembers the Apprentice from when he and Gold trapped him in the sorcerer's hat. With the help of the Blue Fairy, they release the Apprentice, who immediately says that there’s <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste.</b> He tells them that they must find the storybook page depicting the door, as well as the door's key, for only then will they be able to lock Isaac back into the book where he belongs. The group splits up, with Henry, Hook, David and Mary Margaret heading back to the loft for the book and key, while Emma, Regina and the Apprentice head to Gold's pawnshop.|$|E
500|$|Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone {{said that}} [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{features}} Lee [...] "sobbing hysterically over a grand piano". According to the IGN reviewer, Ed Thompson, the song [...] "takes the trademark Evanescence sound - Lee's celestial voice, and adds her brooding lyrics 'I can't change who I am, not this time, I won't lie {{to keep you}} near me and in this short life, there's <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> on giving up. My love wasn't enough'.". Danielle Baudhuin from The Oshkosh West Index noted that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] was musically similar to [...] "Haunted" [...] from the band's debut studio album Fallen, noting how [...] "creepy background choir vocals and violins send listeners into a gothic Cathedral-like setting". Jim Farber from the Daily News said that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] will remind older listeners of the 1970s art rock horror band Renaissance. Andree Farias from Christianity Today observed that the song had no connection with the movie Narnia whatsoever classifying it as [...] "just another bitter break-up anthem".|$|E

2500|$|While most press {{coverage}} {{continued to be}} positive, with criticism only from leftist publications like The Nation and The New Republic, one attorney raised the first noteworthy protest. Francis Fisher Kane, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, resigned in protest. In his letter of resignation to the President and the Attorney General he wrote: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} the policy of raids against large numbers of individuals is generally unwise and very apt to result in injustice. People not really guilty are likely to be arrested and railroaded through their hearings....We appear to be attempting to repress a political party....By such methods we drive underground and make dangerous what was not dangerous before." [...] Palmer replied that he could not use individual arrests to treat an [...] "epidemic" [...] and asserted his own fidelity to constitutional principles. He added: [...] "The Government should encourage free political thinking and political action, but it certainly has the right for its own preservation to discourage and prevent the use of force and violence to accomplish that which ought to be accomplished, if at all, by parliamentary or political methods." [...] The Washington Post endorsed Palmer's claim for urgency over legal process: [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> on hairsplitting over infringement of liberties." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} is entitled “The Representation of a Child Worldview in Emma Donoghue’s Room”. It attempts {{to analyze the}} main character’s worldview which appears in the novel. Firstly, the writer finds out the plot of this novel {{and the second is}} to find out the main character’s worldview. The context {{of this paper is to}} represent the worldview of the main character in Emma Donoghue’s novel by using factual structure. The writer uses a descriptive qualitative method to answer the research question. The writer finds that the main character’s worldview is representing his mother’s view. Moreover, during the last 5 years, he spent the time in the room with his mother. Through Jack, Emma Donoghue told us an expansive eye on the world in which we live. The world is the outer space which has many same things, anything will hurt, and people who live in the world have <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>wasting</b> their <b>time</b> because it runs so fast. The worldview of the main character is found in resolution and denouement part of Freytag’s pyramid. The conclusion of this {{research is}} someone’s worldview cannot be separated from experiences; the set of beliefs about fundamental aspects of reality that ground and influence all the perceiving, thinking, knowing, and doing.

No doubt, to save himself, the other man will turn against you. In addition, if it's necessary, which I hardly think possible, I have even more damaging testimony.

That ought to be sufficient, and I have <b>no</b> more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked puzzled}} and finally gave it up. [...] "I do not know," [...] he admitted. [...] "It {{is the way}} in Caspak. If we do not kill, we shall be killed, {{therefore}} it is wise to kill first whomever does not belong to one's own people. This morning I hid in my cave till the others were gone upon the hunt, for I knew that they would know at once that I had become a Kro-lu and would kill me. They will kill me if they find me in the coslupak; so will the Kro-lu if they come upon me before I have won my Kro-lu weapons and jerkin. You would kill me if you could, and that is the reason I know that you speak lies when you say that your weapons will kill at a great distance. Would they, you would long since have killed me. Come! I have <b>no</b> more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> in words. I will spare the woman and take her with me to the Kro-lu, for she is comely."

60|$|As {{soon as the}} Trackless found {{how things}} were going, he and Jumper {{prepared}} for the conflict, as coolly as any of us. Our arrangements were very simple, and were soon made. We were to deliver a single fire from the spot where we stood, shout, and charge with the knife and tomahawk. <b>No</b> <b>time</b> was <b>to</b> be <b>wasted,</b> however; and, instead of remaining near the light, small as it was, we were to push for {{the mouth of the}} ravine, and thence make the best of our way, singly or in company, as chance should offer, to the gate of Ravensnest.

6000|$|The {{first thing}} a pilot {{did when he}} reached New Orleans or St. Louis was to take his final and {{elaborate}} report to the association parlors and hang it up there,--after which {{he was free to}} visit his family. In these parlors a crowd was always gathered together, discussing changes in the channel, and the moment there was a fresh arrival, everybody stopped talking till this witness had told the newest news and settled the latest uncertainty. Other craftsmen can 'sink the shop,' sometimes, and interest themselves in other matters. Not so with a pilot; he must devote himself wholly to his profession and talk of nothing else; for it would be small gain to be perfect one day and imperfect the next.

60|$|It is {{scarcely}} necessary to say, that when our young mate discovered {{the proximity of}} this dangerous animal, situated as he was, he gave himself up for lost. He possessed his knife, however, and {{had heard of the}} manner in which even sharks were overcome, and that too in their own element, by the skilful and resolute. At first, he was resolved to make one desperate effort for life, before he submitted to a fate as horrible as that which now menaced him; but the movements of his dangerous neighbour induced him to wait. It did not approach any nearer, but continued swimming back and fro, {{on the surface of the}} water, according to the known habits of the fish, as if watching his own movements. There being <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be <b>wasted,</b> our young mate turned on his face, and began again to swim in the direction of the setting star, though nearly chilled by despair. For ten minutes longer did he struggle on, beginning to feel exhaustion, however, and always accompanied by those two dark, sharp and gliding fins. There was no difficulty in knowing the position of the animal, and Mulford's eyes were oftener on those fins than on the beacon before him. Strange as it may appear, he actually became accustomed to the vicinity of this formidable creature, and soon felt his presence a sort of relief against the dreadful solitude of his situation. He had been told by seamen of instances, and had once witnessed a case himself, in which a shark had attended a swimming man for a long distance, either forbearing to do him harm, from repletion, or influenced by that awe which nature has instilled into all of the inferior, for the highest animal of the creation. He began to think that he was thus favoured, and really regarded the shark as a friendly neighbour, rather than as a voracious foe. In this manner did the two proceed, nearly another third of a mile, the fins sometimes in sight ahead, gliding hither and thither, and sometimes out of view behind the swimmer, leaving him in dreadful doubts as to the movements of the fish, when Mulford suddenly felt something hard hit his foot. Believing it to be the shark, dipping for his prey, a slight exclamation escaped him. At the next instant both feet hit the unknown substance again, and he stood erect, the water no higher than his waist! Quick, and comprehending everything connected with the sea, the young man at once understood that he was on a part of the reef where the water was so shallow as to admit of his wading.|$|R
