5|$|Glycerophospholipids, usually {{referred}} to as phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, {{as well as being}} involved in metabolism and cell signaling. <b>Neural</b> <b>tissue</b> (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based {{on the nature of the}} polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of TBR1 {{has been studied}} in amphioxi, also known as lancelets. A T-box-containing cDNA was isolated in the lancelet Branchiostoma belcheri and found to possess a T-domain orthologous {{to that of the}} T-Brain subfamily of T-box genes, specifically TBR1. However, lancelets lack a true brain and no TBR1 transcripts were found in the <b>neural</b> <b>tissue</b> of the lancelet. This suggests that the neuronal role of TBR1 evolved in vertebrates after the lancelet lineage had already diverged from that of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals {{the fact that most}} of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of <b>neural</b> <b>tissue</b> about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E

40|$|Neuroprosthetic {{interventions}} are strategies aimed at treating {{a wide range}} of neurological disorders, long-term neuroprosthetic treatments traditionally require the implantation of hard metallic electrodes that must sustain their electrical connection with <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> for prolonged periods of time. However, surgical introduction of these electrodes and their mechanical mismatch with <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> results in inflammation, which disrupts their electrical interface. Our aim was to develop soft, injectable, and conducting hydrogel-based electrode materials and characterize their sustained mechanical and electrical properties before and after sterilization and injection. These gels were made from poly (3 - 4, ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) (a conductive polymer) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAAc) and were polymerized at subfreezing temperatures to generate soft 3 D macroporous structures.

25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be non-degradable or degradable. For {{the purpose}} of <b>neural</b> <b>tissue</b> engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The degradation rate {{is dependent on the}} molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid subunits. Because of a methyl group, lactic acid is more hydrophobic than glycolic acid causing its hydrolysis to be slower. Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity. There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in <b>neural</b> <b>tissue</b> engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity, which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. Synthetic conduits have only been clinically successful for the repair of very short nerve lesion gaps less than 1–2cm. Furthermore, nerve regeneration with these conduits has yet to reach the level of functional recovery seen with nerve autografts.|$|E

25|$|While {{maternal}} {{stores of}} choline are depleted during pregnancy and lactation, the placenta accumulates choline by pumping choline against the concentration gradient into the tissue, {{where it is}} then stored in various forms, most interestingly as acetylcholine, (an uncommon occurrence outside of <b>neural</b> <b>tissue).</b> The fetus itself is exposed to a very high choline environment as a result, and choline concentrations in amniotic fluid can be ten times higher than in maternal blood. This high concentration is assumed to allow choline to be abundantly available to tissues and cross the blood-brain barrier effectively.|$|E

40|$|Neural {{diseases}} including injury by endogenous factors, {{traumatic brain}} injury, and degenerative neural injury are eventually due to {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS). Thus ROS generation in <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> is a hallmark feature of numerous forms of neural diseases. Neural degeneration and the neural damage process is complex, involving {{a vast array of}} tissue structure, transcriptional/translational, electrochemical, metabolic, and functional events within the intact neighbors surrounding injured <b>neural</b> <b>tissues.</b> During aging, multiple changes involving physical, chemical, and biochemical processes occur from the molecular to the morphological levels in <b>neural</b> <b>tissues.</b> Among many recommended therapeutic candidates, melatonin also plays a role in protecting the nervous system from anti-inflammation and efficiently safeguards neuronal cells via antioxidants and other endogenous/exogenous beneficial factors. Therefore, given the wide range of mechanisms responsible for neuronal damage, multi-action drugs or therapies for the treatment of neural injury that make use of two or more agents and target several pathways may have greater efficacy in promoting functional recovery than a single therapy alone...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} a human-derived {{material}} with potent inductive activity that selectively converts ES cells into <b>neural</b> <b>tissues.</b> Both mouse and human ES cells efficiently differentiate into neural precursors when cultured on the matrix {{components of the}} human amniotic membrane in serum-free medium [amniotic membrane matrix-based ES cell differentiation (AMED) ]. AMED-induced <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> have regional characteristics (brainstem) similar to those induced by coculture with mouse PA 6 stromal cells [a common method called stromal cell-derived inducing activity (SDIA) culture]. Like the SDIA culture, the AMED system is applicable to the in vitro generation of various CNS tissues, including dopaminergic neurons, motor neurons, and retinal pigment epithelium. In contrast to the SDIA method, which uses animal cells, the AMED culture uses a noncellular inductive material derived from an easily available human tissue; therefore, AMED should provide a more suitable and versatile system for generating a variety of <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> for clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|The soluble gas {{neurotransmitter}} {{nitric oxide}} (NO) serves many important metabolic and neuroregulatory {{functions in the}} retina and brain. Although {{it is necessary for}} normal neural function, NO can {{play a significant role in}} neurotoxicity. This is often seen in disease states that involve oxidative stress and inflammation of <b>neural</b> <b>tissues,</b> such as age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimer’s disease. The dietary xanthophyll carotenoid lutein (L) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that, if consumed in sufficient amounts, is deposited in <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> that require substantial metabolic demand. Some of these specific tissues, such as the central retina and frontal lobes of the brain, are impacted by age-related diseases such as those noted above. The conspicuous correspondence between metabolic demand, NO, and L is suggestive of a homeostatic relationship that serves to facilitate normal function, enhance performance, and protect vulnerable <b>neural</b> <b>tissues.</b> The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on these points...|$|R

These compounds contain iodine, but not in the iodide form. However, since they may be ultimately metabolized or break down to radioactive iodide, it is common to administer non-radioactive potassium iodide to ensure that iodide from these radiopharmaceuticals is not sequestered by the normal affinity of the thyroid for iodide.|$|E
25|$|Some {{complications}} of arachnoid cysts can occur when a cyst is damaged because of minor head trauma. Trauma {{can cause the}} fluid within a cyst to leak into other areas (e.g., subarachnoid space). Blood vessels {{on the surface of}} a cyst may tear and bleed into the cyst (intracystic hemorrhage), increasing its size. If a blood vessel bleeds on the outside of a cyst, a collection of blood (hematoma) may result. In the cases of intracystic hemorrhage and hematoma, the individual may have symptoms of increased pressure within the cranium and signs of compression of nearby nerve (<b>neural)</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E
25|$|The role of {{folic acid}} during {{pregnancy}} {{is vital to}} normal development {{of the nervous system}} in the fetus. A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in neural tube disorder, a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely. NTDs are {{not to be confused with}} spina bifida, which does not involve neural elements. Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube. The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes encephalocele, craniorachischisis, and anencephaly. In addition, these defects can also be classified as open, if <b>neural</b> <b>tissue</b> is exposed or covered only by membrane, or can be classified as closed, if the tissue is covered by normal skin.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that invertebrate <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> contain mammalian-like neurotransmitters, which activate specific cellular functions.

We show dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine genes and their corresponding receptors are significantly expressed in lobster and shrimp <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> with a signal to noise value greater than 2. These signal molecules are directly related to previously discovered molecules in invertebrates, suggesting that they first appeared earlier in evolution and are necessary for an animal’s survival...|$|R
40|$|The {{injection}} {{into the}} cerebrospinal fluid of cats of 52 to 208 gamma of copper {{in the form}} of an albumin complex or as cupric sulfate, was followed by small elevations in the content of metal in the <b>neural</b> <b>tissues,</b> but regularly and promptly produced persistent quadriplegia and conspicuous histologic changes. Smaller amounts of copper caused less, or no, neurologic manifestations or histologic alterations. The earliest lesions were essentially unaccompanied by inflammation and were initially characterized by hydropic swelling of the myelin sheaths. They progressed rapidly to focal necrosis of all parenchymal components with marked degeneration of myelin and axis cylinders in the peripheral margins of the spinal cord, brain stem, mid-brain, and cerebrum. These histologic changes did not occur in <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> incubated in vitro in solutions of the copper-albumin complex. They did not appear in animals injected intraventricularly with ferric sulfate or saccharated iron. Considered together, the findings make it clear that copper in concentrations comparable to those present in the <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> of patients with Wilson's disease has the property of profoundly altering neural function and causing conspicuous morphologic alterations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhile Wnt {{signaling}} {{is known}} to be involved in early steps of neural crest development, the mechanism remains unclear. Because Wnt signaling is able to posteriorize anterior <b>neural</b> <b>tissues,</b> <b>neural</b> crest induction by Wnts has been proposed to be an indirect consequence of posteriorization of <b>neural</b> <b>tissues</b> rather than a direct effect of Wnt signaling. To address the relationship between posteriorization and neural crest induction by Wnt signaling, we have used gain of function and loss of function approaches in Xenopus to modulate the level of Wnt signaling at multiple points in the pathway. We find that modulating the level of Wnt signaling allows separation of neural crest induction from the effects of Wnts on anterior–posterior neural patterning. We also find that activation of Wnt signaling induces ectopic neural crest in the anterior region without posteriorizing anterior <b>neural</b> <b>tissues.</b> In addition, Wnt signaling induces neural crest when its posteriorizing activity is blocked by inhibition of FGF signaling in neuralized explants. Finally, depletion of β-catenin confirms that the canonical Wnt pathway is required for initial neural crest induction. While these observations do not exclude a role for posteriorizing signals in neural crest induction, our data, together with previous observations, strongly suggest that canonical Wnt signaling plays an essential and direct role in neural crest induction...|$|R
25|$|The {{expression}} of Class III β-tubulin is regulated {{at both the}} transcriptional and translational levels. In <b>neural</b> <b>tissue,</b> constitutive expression is driven by Sox4 and Sox11. In non-neural tissues, regulation is dependent on an E-box site in the 3' flanking region at +168 nucleotides. This site binds basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) hypoxia induced transcription factors Hif-1α and Hif-2α and is epigenetically modified in cancer cells with constitutive TUBB3 expression. Translational regulation of TUBB3 occurs in the 3`flanking region with {{the interaction of the}} miR-200c family of micro-RNA. MiR-200c is in turn modulated by the protein HuR (encoded by ELAVL1). When HuR is predominantly in the nucleus, a phenomenon typically occurring in low stage carcinomas, miR-200c suppresses class III β-tubulin translation. By contrast, cytoplasmic HuR and miR-200c enhance class III β-tubulin translation by facilitating the entry of the mRNA into the ribosome.|$|E
25|$|Schwann cells (SC) {{are crucial}} to {{peripheral}} nerve regeneration; they play both structural and functional roles. Schwann cells are responsible for taking part in both Wallerian degeneration and bands of Bungner. When a peripheral nerve is damaged, Schwann cells alter their morphology, behavior and proliferation {{to become involved in}} Wallerian degeneration and Bungner bands. In Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of Bungner (boB) that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Additionally, they release neurotrophic factors that enhance regrowth in conjunction with macrophages. There are some disadvantages to using Schwann cells in <b>neural</b> <b>tissue</b> engineering; for example, it is difficult to selectively isolate Schwann cells and they show poor proliferation once isolated. One way to overcome this difficulty is to artificially induce other cells such as stem cells into SC-like phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|A nerve {{guidance}} conduit (also {{referred to}} as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft, {{as opposed to an}} autograft) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries. When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting. Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting, <b>neural</b> <b>tissue</b> engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects. Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.|$|E

40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) are {{prevalent}} neurotropic herpesviruses that cause various nervous system diseases. Similar to other enveloped viruses, membrane fusion is an essential process for viral entry.

Here, we demonstrate that myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), mainly distributed in <b>neural</b> <b>tissues,</b> associates with VZV glycoprotein B (gB) and promotes cell-cell fusion when coexpressed with VZV gB and gH/gL.

But when male rats were castrated neonatally, their MPON was significantly smaller than male rats that were castrated after their brains were sexually differentiated. Despite both groups of males being castrated, the timing of the castration affected MPON size, indicating that organizational effects occur prior to maturation of <b>neural</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
