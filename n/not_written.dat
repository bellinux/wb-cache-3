These new concept songs were recorded in two days.|$|E
5|$|Against Neaera is {{preserved}} as Demosthenes' fifty-ninth speech, {{though it has}} been thought inauthentic since antiquity. Dionysius of Hallicarnassus, for instance, questioned its authorship. Modern scholars from the nineteenth century to the present have generally accepted that the speech was <b>not</b> <b>written</b> by Demosthenes, and today it is often grouped {{with the rest of}} the speeches concerning Apollodoros as being the work of a single Pseudo-Demosthenes. This author has been identified as Apollodoros himself by various scholars, including Kapparis in his commentary on the speech.|$|E

5|$|Building on Champollion's grammar, {{his student}} Karl Richard Lepsius {{continued}} {{to develop the}} decipherment, realizing in contrast to Champollion that vowels were <b>not</b> <b>written.</b> Lepsius became the most important champion of Champollion's work.

5|$|Gaiman {{described}} {{writing the}} series as odd, {{since he had}} <b>not</b> <b>written</b> comics in half a decade; the story was trimmed down significantly as the size went from six 36-page chapters to eight 22-page segments.

The profits of the series went to help fund his Marvels and Miracles LLC company, which is fighting for the rights to Marvelman.|$|E

5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is <b>not</b> <b>written</b> in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{this move}} to the Vanilla Studios {{rehearsal}} space, the Clash's songwriters Mick Jones and Joe Strummer had experienced a period of writer's block. They had <b>not</b> <b>written</b> a new song from scratch in over a year, with the material on their recently released Cost of Living EP, composed of a cover song and three songs that had all been written over twelve months earlier. The Clash arrived at Vanilla in May 1979 without a single new song prepared for their third album.|$|E
5|$|The film {{score was}} {{composed}} by Hans Zimmer, with additional music from John Powell. The album {{was nominated for}} Best Dramatic Score at the 71st Academy Awards. It was Hans Zimmer's fifth Oscar nomination as a composer, but he lost out to Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful (music by Nicola Piovani). The album was released by RCA Victor and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Among the music <b>not</b> <b>written</b> by Zimmer which appears in the film is In Paradisum from Requiem by Gabriel Fauré and the opening minutes of The Unanswered Question by Charles Ives.|$|E

5|$|The first scenes {{depicting}} Tyrion descending with Bronn {{from the}} Mountains of the Moon and encountering the clansmen were <b>not</b> <b>written</b> by Martin.

As often happens in TV production, the scene was moved from one episode to another during editing.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of copies of Ashen were sent to various people. Marty Rytkonen, of Bindrune Recordings, {{was the only person}} {{attached}} to a record label to receive one, and Celestiial was then taken on by Bindrune. Anderson was very happy with this, as he had been an avid reader of Worm Gear (a magazine attached to the label) when he was younger. Despite the fact that Anderson had <b>not</b> <b>written</b> Desolate North with the intention of it ever being released, in 2006, it was released by Bindrune Recordings. The CD version released by Bindrune Recordings is now out of print. However, in 2011, the album was rereleased in vinyl LP format by Handmade Birds, and the album remains available in digital format.|$|E
5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had <b>not</b> <b>written.</b> Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E

5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work which showed the full {{power of his}} genius. This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1842, he also wrote {{incidental}} music for the play, including the famous Wedding March.) The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece <b>not</b> <b>written</b> deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was <b>not</b> <b>written</b> for one instrument or another, {{but rather}} was written {{to be played}} on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period {{is the same as}} that of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E
5|$|Gates McFadden {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Doctor Beverly Crusher in the third season, the character had been written out for season two and replaced with Diana Muldaur playing Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Roddenberry had ensured that Crusher was <b>not</b> <b>written</b> out permanently to allow for her return in the future. Keith DeCandido blamed her departure on Maurice Hurley. After he left the series, McFadden returned. Fans started a letter-writing campaign to reinstate McFadden throughout the second season. Both Roddenberry and Berman decided {{that it would be better}} to bring back McFadden than to look for a third doctor in three years as they agreed that the Pulaski character was not working.|$|E
