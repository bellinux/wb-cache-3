25|$|There is no legally adopted term in Russia for artisanal fisheries. Artisanal or {{subsistence}} fishing usually refers to fishing mainly with traditional gear, with production {{delivered to the}} market but also used for subsistence. In Russia, the term covers also several kinds of fisheries classified as industrial, such as salmon, chars, whitefish, <b>navaga,</b> flounders and greenling fisheries in the Baltic, the Arctic and the Far Eastern Seas. Subsistence fishing by indigenous groups is also an issue. Indigenous fishers mainly work estuaries, lagoons and rivers (for anadromous fish). Legally, they are bound to use their catch for local consumption only. They {{are not allowed to}} sell their catch, but in reality, this is not always the case.|$|E

50|$|The <b>navaga</b> (Eleginus nawaga) is a {{relatively}} small species of fish in the cod family Gadidae. It inhabits the European arctic and subarctic waters of the Barents, White, and Kara Seas, from the Kola Bay to the Ob River estuary.|$|E
50|$|<b>Navaga</b> fish usually {{occur at}} shallow depths, along shores with soft bottoms, {{close to the}} ice and on the {{continental}} shelf. In winter, they live in nearshore waters, where spawning takes place. They are often found in estuaries and can enter fresh water in rivers. In summer, they return to open waters. They feed on crustaceans, benthic animals, and small fish. Adult size is usually 25-35 cm, but White Sea fish are smaller, 15-25 cm.|$|E

50|$|The fishing {{industry}} is the region's only food sector and {{is second in}} importance after mining. The 600000 km2 area of the Sea of Okhotsk that borders on Magadan Oblast {{is one of the}} most productive regions of the world's oceans. Magadan Oblast has more than 15900 km of coastline and 29016 km of rivers of commercial importance. The catching vessels of the oblast's fishing companies operate mainly in Russia's economic zone, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, and to some extent in the Sea of Japan. Most of the catch comes from coastal waters. Fishing industry companies are concentrated in Magadan, Ola, Yamsk, and Evensk. The most important commercial fish are pollock, herring, cod, <b>navaga</b> (a member of the cod family), flounder, and various kinds of salmon. Crabs, squid, shrimp, and whelks are also caught.|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{studies of}} navagа of the White Sea were {{initiated}} {{in the late}} 1960 -ies. Data sets on dimensional indicators, age composition of populations of <b>navaga</b> of the Onega, Dvina, Mezen Bays and Voronka of the White Sea have been accumulated during 45 years of observations. The aim of this work is to identify {{the causes of the}} interannual and long-term changes of biological population parameters of <b>navaga.</b> As investigated interannual changes reflecting fish growth, the length and mass of 2 and 3 years old specimens have been chosen. It has been proved that interannual fluctuations in length and weight may depend on the length of the feeding season, as well as the number of populations. Climate warming has resulted that over the past 45 years since the beginning of observations the water temperature in the White Sea in April on average has increased by one degree, and some years – even more. Due to lengthening of the feeding period the seasonal growth of <b>navaga</b> has increased, respectively the annual rates of its length and weight have increased as well. The increase in the growth rate of <b>navaga</b> in the Onega and Dvina Bays has led to its mass mature and joining the fishing (commercial) herd at the age of two years. In the Mezen Bay and Voronka the trend on the increase in annual average length and weight <b>navaga</b> of only younger age groups has kept. Growth rate of large size <b>navaga</b> has decreased due to the almost complete cessation of fishing and the increase of older fish number. The revealed regularities in the change of the <b>navaga</b> population parameters of the White Sea should be used for preparing the forecast data on the state of its reserves...|$|E

A model study of the seasonal variability and spatial distribution of these groups has been carried out. The simulation complex consists of blocks which represent complete program algorithms of separate processes: the large-scale water circulation in the Okhotsk Sea, the formation of salinity, temperature conditions, patial-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton, and the dynamics of macroplankton a d mesoplankton. There are enormous biological resources in the Okhotsk Sea including such valuable fishing objectives as pollack, salmon, herring, flat-fish, <b>navaga,</b> bullheads, halibut, Japanese crab, shrimps, molluscs, trepangs, seals, white whales, laminaria, etc. This fact is supported by research in the north region of the Okhotsk Sea shelf made b...|$|E
