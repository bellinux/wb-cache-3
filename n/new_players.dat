5|$|An NBA player {{playing in}} Europe could earn {{as little as}} $50,000–$75,000 per month, while the average NBA annual salary was $5.8 million with the minimum around $500,000. The large {{contracts}} signed by Williams and Martin were extreme exceptions. In October after the cancellation of regular season games, it was not anticipated that many additional NBA players would be signed overseas; leagues had started playing, their rosters were full, and <b>new</b> <b>players</b> could disrupt the teams.|$|E
5|$|April brought further roster {{changes for}} the Hershey Bears, with Joel Rechlicz rejoining the team in {{exchange}} for Matt Clackson, and Stafford being traded for winger Dane Byers. Forward Michael Latta was also traded to Hershey, meaning the team had added seven <b>new</b> <b>players</b> to the roster via trades since January 31. The April trades were intended to add forward speed and depth to the team, but a late NHL trade deadline resulting from the lockout left only nine james to meld the <b>new</b> <b>players</b> into the line-up. After beating Syracuse 4–1 on April 5, Hershey fell into a four-game losing slump that briefly knocked them out of playoff contention. The first of those games, a 2-1 loss against Syracuse at home, drew a season-high attendance of 10,943. However, by April 12, a loss against Providence knocked them into ninth place, and last place in the East Division. Another loss {{the next day to}} Manchester left them tied with the Monarchs for last place at 75 points, a full four points behind Connecticut and Norfolk {{to get back into the}} running for the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive.

This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth, after winning four, and losing six of their eleven matches.|$|E

5|$|O'Neill's tenure lasted {{just six}} months; he {{resigned}} after {{a dispute with}} chairman Robert Chase over Chase's refusal to permit O'Neill to spend significant sums on strengthening the squad. According to O'Neill, the tipping point was the refusal of Chase to permit the purchase of Dean Windass. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in <b>new</b> <b>players</b> and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E

5|$|According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, {{the series}} {{had become too}} grueling and {{complicated}} for modern gamers, and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit <b>new</b> <b>players,</b> crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E
5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, {{with the staff}} of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for <b>new</b> <b>players,</b> Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal sold {{a number}} of fringe players {{throughout}} the season so Graham could freshen the squad with <b>new</b> <b>players.</b> Having already signed Lee Dixon and Steve Bould from Stoke City, defender Kenny Sansom became surplus to requirement and eventually joined Newcastle United. Steve Williams was sold to Luton Town for £300,000 in June 1988. as the player felt first-team opportunities were scarce; the fee Luton paid was £100,000 less than Arsenal originally wanted. Graham Rix went to Caen on a free transfer. Other transfers saw Rhys Wilmot leave the club he joined as a trainee in 1977 after failing to usurp John Lukic as first choice, and Andy Marriott left to join Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest in a deal worth £50,000.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{tentatively}} appointed club physiotherapist Bertie Mee {{as acting}} manager in 1966. With new assistant Don Howe and <b>new</b> <b>players</b> such as Bob McNab and George Graham, Mee led Arsenal {{to their first}} League Cup finals, in 1967–68 and 1968–69. Next season saw a breakthrough: Arsenal's first competitive European trophy, the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. And the season after, an even greater triumph: Arsenal's first League and FA Cup double, and a new champions of England record. This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up {{and the rest of}} the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in 1972–73.|$|E
