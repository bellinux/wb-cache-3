Prosocial here is not just support of the existing social order. If the social order is lower and you are adjusted to it, then you also reflect the lower (<b>negative</b> <b>adjustment</b> in Dąbrowski's terms, a Level I feature). Here, prosocial is a genuine cultivation of social interactions based on higher values. These positions often conflict with the status quo of a lower society (positive maladjustment).

5000|$|Dąbrowski also {{described}} {{a group of}} people who display a different course: an individualized developmental pathway. These people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which Dąbrowski called <b>negative</b> <b>adjustment)</b> and move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. Dąbrowski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our status quo and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc. If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated hierarchical value structure (called positive adjustment). This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for Dąbrowski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One's talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be—how the world ought to be. The person expresses his or her [...] "new" [...] autonomous personality energetically through action, art, social change and so on.|$|E

The results of the regression analyses after controlling for the caregivers’ demographics showed that perceived stress, coping strategies, and social support were all significant predictors of both positive and negative affect in the expected directions.

The analyzed period for this paper is 2004 - 2013. Live animals trade in Romania is one of the three sectors with positive balance of trade and the rhythm of growth for the exports increased faster than for the imports. The analyze of the seasonality, made by two methods, suggested that the trade in live animals has had <b>negative</b> <b>adjustments</b> due to seasonal factors, at least on the first quarter and the trade with agro food products has had <b>negative</b> <b>adjustments</b> on the first and second quarter.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that {{stressful life events}} are strongly linked with <b>negative</b> <b>adjustment</b> indices in adolescence (e. g., Compas & Phares, 1991; Kim, Conger, Elder, & Lorenz, 2003; Waaktaar, Borge, Fundingsrud, Christie, & Torgersen, 2004). Less is known about how different types of life stressors (i. e., dependent versus independent) impact adjustment over time for normative populations of adolescents. An important area for exploration is that of protective/vulnerability factors in adolescents who have endured stressful life events. A promising area of exploration is the moderating role of the adolescent-mother attachment relationship as a protective factor against stressful life events. Relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to distinguishing between negative and positive adjustment outcomes in exploring these associations. The purpose of this short-term longitudinal study was to investigate the role of attachment quality in the associations between stressful life events (dependent and independent) and adjustment outcomes (positive and negative) with a normative population of adolescents. Multilevel modeling was used to examine these interrelationships and adjustment growth curves. A total of 183 adolescents (n = 96 girls; M age (entire sample) at T 1 = 13. 0 years, SD = 0. 72; M age at T 3 = 14. 8 years, SD = 0. 66) completed an attachment questionnaire, a stressful life events scale, and <b>negative</b> <b>adjustment</b> (depressive symptoms, delinquency) and positive adjustment (responsive caregiving, positive affect) questionnaires. Results indicated that both types of life stressors were important predictors of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>adjustment</b> outcomes. Consistent with previous findings, dependent life events were more strongly linked with depressive symptoms than independent life events. Independent life stress in interaction with attachment was significantly associated with changes in adjustment over time. Protective combinations of attachment with life stressors included lower attachment anxiety with higher independent life stress, which was associated with higher positive affect. More vulnerable combinations included higher attachment avoidance with higher attachment anxiety which was associated with the highest increase in delinquency over time. Results support the importance of specificity of life stressors and specificity of types of adjustment outcomes. Implications for adolescent intervention and prevention programs are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This study {{examined}} benefit finding in MS carers including the dimensionality of benefit finding, relations between carer and care recipient benefit finding, {{and the effects}} of carer benefit finding on carer positive and <b>negative</b> <b>adjustment</b> domains. Method. A total of 267 carers and their care recipients completed questionnaires at Time 1 and 3 months later, Time 2 (n= 155). Illness data were collected at Time 1, and number of problems, stress appraisal, benefit finding, negative (global distress, negative affect) and positive (life satisfaction, positive affect, dyadic adjustment) adjustment domains were measured at Time 2. Results. Qualitative data revealed seven benefit finding themes, two of which were adequately represented by the Benefit Finding Scale (BFS) [1] (Mohr et al. Health Psychology 1999; 18 : 376). Factor analyses indicated two factors (Personal Growth, Family Relations Growth) which were psychometrically sound and showed differential relations with illness and adjustment domains. Although care recipients reported higher levels of benefit finding than carers, their benefit finding reports regarding personal growth were correlated. The carer BFS factors were positively related to carer and care recipient dyadic adjustment. Care recipient benefit finding was unrelated to carer adjustment domains. After controlling for the effects of demographics, care recipient characteristics, problems and appraisal, carer benefit finding was related to carer positive adjustment domains and unrelated to carer <b>negative</b> <b>adjustment</b> domains. Conclusion. Findings support the role of benefit finding in sustaining positive psychological states and the communal search for meaning within carer-care recipient dyads...|$|E

Specifically, we assess how investors respond to variations in net income resulting from fair value adjustments in trading assets and how the reliability of the fair value estimates affects their decision. We find that investment decreases as a result of transitions from the first to the third level and we even observe lower investments in case of positive changes in income. Investment decreases most if <b>negative</b> valuation <b>adjustments</b> are based on level 1 estimates suggesting that down pricing by the market is considered as a worse signal than model-based decreases in net income. For larger positive and <b>negative</b> <b>adjustments</b> the impact of valuation levels on investment turns out to be limited.
