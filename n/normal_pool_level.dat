50|$|Bluestone Lake is a {{flood control}} {{reservoir}} {{located on the}} New River near Hinton, West Virginia. At its <b>normal</b> <b>pool</b> <b>level,</b> Bluestone Dam impounds a 10.7 mi stretch of the New and its tributary, the Bluestone River. Normally approximately 2040 acre in size, the lake can grow to over 36 mi long at flood control pool. At higher water levels, the lake extends into Giles County, Virginia.|$|E
50|$|The dam was {{completed}} in 2004 {{at a cost of}} RM360 million and is used to regulate the flow of water along the Muda River basin to augment water available for irrigation of paddy or upland crops, for domestic and industrial water supply and other uses. The reservoir at its <b>normal</b> <b>pool</b> <b>level</b> covers an area of 13.7 km square whilst at maximum pool level inundates an area of 16.1 km square. It has a gross storage capacity of 122.4 million cubic metres with an effective storage of 144 million cubic metres.|$|E
50|$|The <b>normal</b> <b>pool</b> <b>level</b> of {{the lake}} is 963 ft, at which a 1000 acre {{reservoir}} is formed. During times of excessive rain and snow melt, the corps of engineers can impound more water, up to a maximum possible level of 977.5 ft with 1470 acre. The highest pool of record is 970.77 ft on 03-17-2011. Levels above normal can cause road closures near the lake. In November of each year the lake is lowered to winter pool of 958 ft to allow more flood capacity, and to freeze and kill the roots of aquatic weeds. Levels are returned to summer pool in the spring.|$|E

5000|$|Bull Shoals Lake impounds the White River for {{the last}} time as water travels toward its mouth on the Mississippi River. Bull Shoals is thus the lake {{farthest}} downstream in a chain of four artificial lakes that include (from upstream to downstream) Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake and Lake Taneycomo. The lake is controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers and has the primary purpose of flood control. The level of the lake fluctuates regularly with a <b>normal</b> <b>pool</b> <b>level</b> elevation of 654 feet above sea level, which is locally known as powerpool. However, the lake regularly fluctuates between an elevation of 630 to 680 feet. The upper part of the lake, below nearby Powersite Dam, is known as the [...] "Pothole".|$|E
5000|$|Lake Spivey is a 600 acre (550 acre, 600 acre) private lake {{located in}} Clayton County and Henry County, Georgia near Jonesboro. The lake {{was created by}} Dr. Walter Boone Spivey, a {{prominent}} Buckhead dentist, and his wife Emilie. The lake formed following the completion of construction on an earthen dam on Rum Creek in September 1957. [...] The lake was built on land, formerly known as Betts Farm, which was purchased by the Spiveys in September 1943. [...] The dam formed what was promoted as the largest privately owned lake {{in the state of}} Georgia. Lake Arrowhead in Waleska, Georgia is also promoted as the largest private lake in Georgia. Georgia Department of Natural Resources records indicate that Lake Spivey is 600 acres and Lake Arrowhead is 450 acres at <b>normal</b> <b>pool</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
40|$|Saturated {{for most}} of the year, {{wetlands}} accumulate large amounts of biomass in thick organic soil horizons with slow rates of decomposition due to anaerobic conditions. Wetland soils thereby sequester large amounts of organic carbon in relative long-term storage. Municipal water demands in west-central Florida are largely met through extensive groundwater pumping. These withdrawals can impact ecosystems dependent on surface water levels that are ultimately linked to confined aquifers. Soils in a subset of cypress swamps that are monitored by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) were sampled and analyzed to ascertain the health of the wetlands impacted by groundwater pumping. Soil water content, bulk density, and carbon and nitrogen content were systematically measured on replicate samples from three elevations in transects through the wetlands. 2 ̆ 2 Healthy 2 ̆ 2 wetlands were found to have higher soil water retention and consequently higher soil organic carbon (SOC) content in the top 30 cm of soil than 2 ̆ 2 harmed 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 significantly harmed 2 ̆ 2 cypress domes. However this trend was only significant at the lowest, central elevation of the wetland, at an elevation of the <b>normal</b> <b>pool</b> <b>level</b> minus 12 inches. These results provide quantitative evidence to support the notion that saturation of soils during most of the year is required to maintain the conditions that are conducive to the accumulation of soil organic matter. Conversely, unsaturated soils appear to be mineralizing large quantities of their stores of organic carbon. Since soil moisture and organic carbon contents are well correlated in the wetlands that were sampled, monitoring of soil water content may prove a convenient proxy for determining the organic carbon stores and thus the relative health of the wetland...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} an {{experimental}} human immunoglobulin preparation for intravenous use, containing <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> IgM (IVIgM), have shown its beneficial therapeutic effect in experimental autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms of its immunomodulatory activity remain however, poorly understood. In the experiments reported here, IVIgM inhibited {{the proliferation of}} various autonomously growing human lymphoid cell lines in vitro, {{as well as of}} MLR- and of PHA-stimulated human T-lymphocytes. These effects of IVIgM were observed at non-apoptotic concentrations and were stronger on a molar basis than those of <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> IgG for intravenous use (IVIg). Both preparations, when administered to SCID mice, repopulated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, delayed the expression of the early activation marker CD 69 on both human CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocytes, activated by the mouse antigenic environment. The data obtained show that <b>normal</b> <b>pooled</b> human IgM exerts a powerful antiproliferative effect on T-cells that is qualitatively similar but quantitatively superior to that of therapeutic IVIg. Our results suggest that infusions with IVIgM might have a significant beneficial immunomodulating activity in patients with selected autoimmune diseases...|$|R
