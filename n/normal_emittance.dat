40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work {{is to determine the}} representative elementary volumes (REVs) required to accurately characterize the <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittances</b> of SiC open-cell foams and their dependency on the textural features. Because the REVs determined for porosity are often used as radiative REVs, these REVs are also investigated through a parallel study. For this purpose, several numerical tools have been combined. First, a numerical foam generator that provides realistic textures and that enables control over textural parameters such as the porosity and the cell size distribution is presented. Second, a Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) code that considers the 3 D geometry of a foam and its intrinsic optical properties facilitates the computation of their <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittances.</b> Both numerical tools are validated through comparison with the textural and radiative properties experimentally measured on a real reference alpha-SiC foam sample using X-ray mu-tomography and infrared spectroscopic measurements, respectively. Then, a set of 3 D virtual alpha-SiC open-cell foams with prescribed textural features (porosity in the range of 0. 4 - 0. 9 and cell sizes in the range of 0. 5 - 1. 7 mm) were investigated, and a large number of MCRT simulations were performed to determine their respective REVs for both porosity and emittance. The findings indicate that the minimal REV for porosity cannot be directly used for determining the <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittance.</b> Some practical considerations are then proposed to characterize the <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittance</b> of alpha-SiC open-cell foams. Finally, a linear relationship that links the <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittance</b> to the porosity and the intrinsic optical properties of an alpha-SiC open-cell foam is presented. The results indicate that this relationship is independent of the cell size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The <b>normal</b> {{spectral}} <b>emittance</b> of Inconel {{and type}} 321 stainless steel with different surface treatments was measured at temperatures of 900, 1, 200, 1, 500, and 1, 800 F over a wavelength range of 1. 5 to 15 microns. The measurements involved {{comparison of the}} radiant energy emitted by the heated specimen with that emitted by a comparison standard at the same temperature {{by means of a}} recording double-beam infrared spectrophotometer. The silicon carbide comparison standard had previously been calibrated against a laboratory black-body furnace. Surface treatments included electropolishing, sandblasting, electro-polishing followed by oxidation in air for 1 / 2 hour at 1, 800 F, sandblasting followed by oxidation in air for 1 / 2 hour at 1, 800 F, application of National Bureau of Standards coating A- 418, and application of NBS ceramic coating N- 143. The <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittance</b> of both alloys in the electropolished condition was low and decreased very slightly with increasing wavelength while in the sandblasted condition it was somewhat higher and did not vary appreciably with wavelength. The oxidation treatment greatly increased the <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittance</b> of both the electropolished and sandblasted type 321 stainless steel specimens and of the electropolished Inconel specimens and introduced some spectral selectivity into the curves. The oxidation increased the <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittance</b> of the sandblasted Inconel specimens only moderately. Of the specimens to which a coating about 0. 002 inch thick was applied, those coated with A- 418 had higher emittance at all wavelengths than did those coated with N- 143, and the coated specimens of Inconel had higher spectral emittance at all wavelengths than did the corresponding specimens of type 321 stainless steel.

40|$|Zirconium diboride (ZrB₂) is {{a ceramic}} {{material}} possessing ultra-high melting temperatures. As such, this compound {{could be useful}} {{in the construction of}} thermal protection systems for aerospace applications. This work addresses a primary shortcoming of this material, namely its propensity to destructively oxidize at high temperatures, as well as secondary issues concerning its heat transport properties. To characterize and improve oxidation properties, thermogravimetric studies were per- formed using a specially constructed experimental setup. ZrB₂-SiC two-phase ceramic composites were isothermally oxidized for ∼ 90 min in flowing air in the range 1500 - 1900 °C. Specimens with 30 mol% SiC formed distinctive reaction product layers which were highly protective; 28 mol% SiC - 6 mol% TaB₂ performed similarly. At higher temperatures, specimens containing lower amounts of SiC were shown to be non-protective, whereas specimens containing greater amounts of SiC produced unstable oxide layers due to gas evolution. Oxide coating thicknesses calculated from weight loss data were consistent with those measured from SEM micrographs. In order to characterize one aspect of the materials' heat transport properties, the thermal diffusivities of ZrB₂-SiC composites were measured using the laser flash technique. These were converted to thermal conductivities using temperature dependent specific heat and density data; thermal conductivity decreased with increasing temperature over the range 25 - 2000 °C. The composition with the highest SiC content showed the highest thermal conductivity at room temperature, but the lowest at temperatures in excess of ∼ 400 °C, because of the greater temperature sensitivity of the thermal conductivity of the SiC phase, as compared to more electrically-conductive ZrB₂. Subsequent finite difference calculations were good predictors of multi-phase thermal conductvities for the compositions examined. The thermal conductivities of pure ZrB₂ as a function of temperature were back-calculated from the experimental results for the multi-phase materials, and literature thermal conductivities of the other two phases. This established a relatively constant thermal conductivity of 88 - 104 W/m·K over the evaluated temperature range. Further heat transport characterization was performed using pre-oxidized, directly resistively heated ZrB₂- 30 mol% SiC ribbon specimens under the observation of a spectral radiometer. The ribbons were heated and held at specific temperatures over the range 1100 - 1330 °C in flowing Ar, and <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittance</b> values were recorded over the 1 - 6 μm range with a resolution of 10 nm.

40|$|The thermal {{radiative}} {{properties of}} high temperature {{solid and liquid}} metal alloys are particularly useful to research and development efforts in laser cladding and machining, electron beam welding and laser isotope separation. However the cost, complexity, and difficulty of measuring these properties have forced the use of crude estimates from the Hagen-Rubens relation, the Drude relations, or extrapolation from low temperature or otherwise flawed data (e. g., oxidized). The authors have found in this work that published values for the Hall coefficient and the electrical resistivity of liquid metal alloys can provide useful estimates of the reflectance and emittance of some groups of binary liquid metal and high temperature solid alloys. The estimation method computes the Drude free electron parameters, and thence the optical constants and the radiant properties from the dependence of the Hall coefficient and direct current resistivity on alloy composition (the Hall coefficient gives the free electron density and the resistivity gives the average time between collisions). They find that predictions of the radiant properties of molten cerium-copper alloy, which use the measured variations in the Hall coefficient and resistivity (both highly nonlinear) {{as a function of}} alloy fraction (rather than linear combinations of the values of the pure elements) yield a good comparison to published measurements of the variation of the <b>normal</b> spectral <b>emittance</b> (a different but also nonlinear function) of cerium-copper alloy at the single wavelength available for comparison, 0. 645 {mu}m.

After installation and adjusting the original electric 12 skew and 16 <b>normal</b> quadrupoles the <b>emittance</b> contribution from the region close to the interaction point, which was the biggest part in the original design, was considerably reduced. To strengthen the vertical behavior of the LER beam, a low emittance lattice was developed. It lowered the original vertical design emittance from 0. 54 nm-rad to 0. 034 nm-rad. In order to achieve this, additional skew quadrupoles were required to bring the coupling correction out of the arcs {{and closer to the}} detector solenoid in the straight (Fig. 1). It is important, together with low vertical dispersion, that the low vertical emittance is not coupled into the horizontal, which is what we get if the coupling correction continues into the arcs.

Besides the permanent magnets there are two other possibilities, using electric magnets or rotating normal quadrupoles.

In addition, low out-of-band spectral emittance, epsilon(sub lambda) less than 0. 2, suggest these materials would be excellent candidates for high efficiency selective emitters in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems operating at moderate temperatures (1200 - 1500 K). Spectral emittance {{measurements of the}} thin films were made (1. 2 less than lambda less than 3. 0 microns) and compared to the theoretical emittances calculated using measured values of the spectral extinction coefficient. In this paper we present the results for {{a new class of}} rare earth ion selective emitters. These emitters are thin sections (less than 1 mm) of yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) single crystal with a rare earth substitutional impurity. Selective emitters in the near IR are of special interest for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy conversion. The most promising solid selective emitters for use in a TPV system are rare earth oxides. Early spectral emittance work on rare earth oxides showed strong emission bands in the infrared (0. 9 - 3 microns). However, the emittance outside the emission band was also significant and the efficiency of these emitters was low. Recent improvements in efficiency have been made with emitters fabricated from fine (5 - 10 microns) rare earth oxide fibers similar to the Welsbach mantle used in gas lanterns. However, the rare earth garnet emitters are more rugged than the mantle type emitters. A thin film selective emitter on a low emissivity substrate such as gold, platinum etc., is rugged and easily adapted {{to a wide variety of}} thermal sources. The garnet structure and its many subgroups have been successfully used as hosts for rare earth ions, introduced as substitutional impurities, in the development of solid state laser crystals. Doping, dependent on the particular ion and crystal structure, may be as high as 100 at. % (complete substitution of yttrium ion with the rare earth ion). These materials have high melting points, 1940 C for YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet), and low emissivity in the near infrared making them excellent candidates for a thin film selective emitter. As previously stated, the spectral emittance of a rare earth emitter is characterized by one or more well defined emission bands. Outside the emission band the emittance(absorptance) is much lower. Therefore, it is expected that emission outside the band for a thin film selective emitter will be dominated by the emitter substrate. For an efficient emitter (power in the emission band/total emitted power) the substrate must have low emittance, epsilon(sub S).

The solar absorptance, total <b>normal</b> <b>emittance,</b> scanning electron and X-ray photoelectron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses will be compared for the control, the 10 month exposed, and the 5. 8 year exposed specimens. Data suggests that the high atomic flux over the last 6 months of the LDEF mission may have influenced the results from from this coatings experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{and total}} <b>normal</b> <b>emittance</b> of the Reaction Cured Glass (RCG) coating used on Shuttle tiles has been measured for surface temperatures of 300 to 1905 K. These measurements {{were made on}} two virgin and two flown Shuttle tile samples. Room temperature directional emittance data were also obtained and {{used to determine the}} total hemispherical emittance of RCG as a function of temperature. The data obtained from this calculation indicate that the total hemispherical emittance decreases from a room temperature value of 0. 83 to a value of 0. 76 at 1905 K. The flown Shuttle tiles exhibited a change in the spectral distribution of emittance compared to that of the virgin tile, but no significant trends in the total emittance from a virgin to a flown tile could be established...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A {{theoretical}} and experimental study was undertaken on the radiative properties of solids suspended in furnace gases {{and those of}} the solid deposits formed on the furnace wall during pulverised coal combustion. Experiments included measurement of the absorption indices of coal, char, ash and slag particles, and the emittance of their deposits, both real time and ex-situ, to assess the effects of particle size, physical state, iron and unburnt carbon (UC), devolatilisation and heating. Theoretical studies included formulation of mathematical models for spectral radiative heat transfer involving particulates and gases, and for the spectral emittance of opaque and semi-transparent ash deposits. These codes considered both isothermal and non-isothermal fields, particle size, composition and concentration variables and evaluation of the effect of UC on radiative heat transfer and emittance of ash clouds. A technique was proposed to measure the absorption index of the particulate samples. The technique, after calibration with known samples, was applied to three different coal samples, char prepared from each of these at several burnout levels, and fully burnt ash from each of these. In ash samples, the level of UC has a significant effect on the absorption index. Using these data the evolution of total emissivity of single coal particles with burnout was examined. A marked increase in emissivity was predicted during the initial stages of burnout followed by a decrease during the later stages. The effect of UC on net heat transfer across a plane parallel slab of particles was examined. Rapid decrease was observed up tp 10 % UC content, after which the rate of decrease was predicted to decrease. The effect of UC distribution in ash was examined qualitatively by calculating the hemispherical emittance of a slab of flyash particulates considering two cases: all particles have the same UC content, or the UC content was concentrated only in the large particles. The significant difference in emittance between the two cases suggest that it is not sufficient to specify only the bulk UC content of the flyash, rather how the UC is distributed relative to the particle size. A model was developed to predict the spectral <b>normal</b> and hemispherical <b>emittance</b> of opaque and semi-transparent particulate deposits. A significant effect of particle size and composition on spectral emittance of particulate deposits was predicted. The presence of large particles and particles having high iron content were found to make deposits more emissive at wavelengths up to 5 μm. Calculations indicated that the apparent emittance if there is a substantial temperature gradient across it and the material is weakly absorbing. Results of calculations performed for two types of deposits (one heated from bottom and the other heated from top), indicated that care must be taken in experimental design and data interpretation for accurate prediction of emittance from such measurements. The approximate thickness required for opacity (1 % transmission of ash deposits was calculated using the model developed and found to vary between 80 μm and 1 mm {{depending on the type of}} material and particle size in the deposit, consistent with measurements reported in literature. The emittance of smooth slag layers was predicted to be of grey character, insensitive to both the real and the absorption index and exceed 0. 9, a value supported by recent published measurements. Speculations on the variation in the deposit properties as they build are presented with results of preliminary experiments to examine these speculations. Calculations were performed to assess the effects of conductive and radiative properties on exit gas temperature, wall flux and efficiency of a power station furnace. For a moderately reflective layer, both these effects are found to be significant whereas for unreflective deposits, conductive effects are found to be more significant. Comparison with an industrial measurement supported the predicted effects. Spectral emittance measurements using slag particles showed the effect of particle size being limited primarily to the wavelengths below 6 μm, supporting model predictions. Heating of the particles at temperatures above 1000 °C resulted in higher emittance values. At a particular temperature, emittance measured during the cooling cycle was found to be higher than the emittance measured during the heating cycle indicating possible irreversible structural transformations. Spectral emittance measured on slag particles having difference iron contents indicated the effect to be limited to wavelengths below 5 μm with particles having higher iron content recording higher emittance. Spectral emittance measured on particles of muffle burnt ash and the particles of the same ash after melting to a slag showed differences with the slagged ash recording significantly higher emittance. The effect of devolatilisation on emittance increases to about 0. 85 before decreasing to values about 0. 7 with char combustion. Spectral emittance of char samples was measured as a function of ash content with char having lower ash content recording higher emittance. Few studies have reported the importance of the inclusion of dependent effects in radiation calculations on the emittance of ash deposits. All studies are limited to either very small particles or very large particles and the experiments are either transmission or reflection measurements. Measurements were conducted using particle sizes relevant to radiative heat transfer in furnaces, and also involving two independent sets of measurements, transmission and reflection, on the same sample. Measured emittances were significantly higher than the values predicted assuming independent effects only thus showing the importance of dependent effects. Additional experiments using a wider range of samples and particle sizes are recommended to quantify the extent of dependent effects. The study provides the {{theoretical and}} experimental confirmation of the difference in nature between the spectral emittance of particulate and slagged deposits and thus show the importance of the physical state on emittance of deposits rather than the chemical composition. The results provide the necessary background for deposit monitoring using pyrometric measurements with consequent effects on the calculation of devolatilisation rates and heat transfer as well as the inclusion of this spectral character in radiative transfer. All the effects (size, dependent, thermal, physical state etc.) on emittance of particulate deposits are found to be limited primarily to the wavelength region below 6 μm...|$|R

The degree of oxidation protection afforded to the alloys was evaluated from the amount of specimen weight gain after a 100 hour exposure to air at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 1255 K. Data are presented for two types of coatings, a monolithic and a multilayer, which have recombination efficiencies from 0. 005 to 0. 020 after ten one-half hour long simulated reentry cycles.
