5000|$|The {{natural grasslands}} {{of the desert}} have {{undergone}} change. Until the mid-1950s the region [...] "was visited by people and livestock only {{during the rainy season}} and {{at the very beginning of}} the dry season (July to November)." [...] In 1953, J. G. Adam noted that the [...] "groundnut cultivation has transformed the natural vegetation on sandy soils, to note, even at a distance from the water points, a climax, subclimax vegetation which has not been disrupted by cultivation, and hardly changed by grazing, since this has occurred only, until recent years, during the four summer months, where the vegetation is dense and close to standing water." [...] From the mid-1950s, boreholes were drilled and began to provide water to areas of the desert, which enabled pastureland to be used by the farmers all year round. By 1955, fifty wells were reported along the main trek routes to be providing water. Under better conditions, the population of livestock in the desert increased; by the 1990s, it supported livestock herding, cited as [...] "a continuous extension of the desert steppe into the savanna" [...] but one which was [...] "not rich enough to attract herders from the north of the Senegal river." [...] Between 1969 and 1972, the [...] "Study of <b>Natural</b> <b>Pastureland</b> in Northern Senegal" [...] was conducted, assessing the borehole development in the desert and found that the boreholes were still on average 25-30 km apart, which meant that exploitation of land was generally restricted to a 5 km radius of them. [...] Spate irrigation has since developed in the region, and temporary ponds may cover an area of several hectares during the wet season from July to October.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} twenty years, a main {{research}} topic of CNR-ISPAAM in Sassari has been the identification of native species from <b>natural</b> <b>pasturelands</b> that could be useful as forages and their characterization for introduction into cropping systems. More recent 1 y, our interest was focused on native species evaluation for multi purpose utilizations, considering the environmental aspects, related to the rehabilitaion and conservation issues deriving from such aspects as overgrazing, fires, environmental impacts due to human activities, land desertion in marginal areas. A series of species, belonging to the more traditional Leguminosae and Graminaceae, and also more unusual species such as Compositae and Geraniaceae have been isolated from the local flora and characterised for bioagronomic traits useful for fodder and multipurpose uses in Mediterranean environment. A few of such species are reported here...|$|R

40|$|Large {{herbivore}} {{livestock and}} wildlife in Mongolia depend almost entirely for substance on forage standing crop produced {{each year on}} <b>natural</b> <b>pastureland.</b> Consequently, both livestock and wildlife are continuously subject to environmental risk, especially drought and severe winter storms, while livestock are also subject to financial risk. As consumption-based livestock production changes to commercialized livestock production, steps taken by the livestock herder to avert both environmental and financial risk to livestock can increase environmental risk to large wild herbivores. A realistic and workable pastureland and risk management system will be critical for conservation of large herbivore habitat. New technologies are becoming available to facilitate understanding of risk and resource allocation. Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University has developed a suite of innovative technologies that facilitate resolving risk and resource allocation issues. A pre-parameterized rangeland model (i. e., PHYGROW) provides daily estimates of forage available to a mixed population of herbivores. Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) allows prediction of diet quality of free-ranging large herbivores via fecal scans which, when coupled with advanced nutritional management software (i. e., NUTBAL), can predict performance of animals. Oregon State University has developed a computerized multi-criteria decision-making tool (i. e., KRESS) that can take landscape parameters and determine the suitability of each cell or unit of the landscape for use by large herbivores. Emerging near real-time technologies can help clarify habitat needs, identify habitat improvements, and enable better management of large herbivore wildlife and livestock...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to assess botanical composition, DMY and chemical composition of Fogera upland <b>natural</b> <b>pastureland</b> under different application rates of N fertilizer and harvesting stages of natural pasture at smallholder farmers condition. The {{experiment was}} conducted using 3 x 4 factorial experiment arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications and the treatment consisted three stages of harvesting (60, 90 and 120 days) and four levels of N fertilizer application (0, 23, 46 and 69 kg N/ha) on the natural pasture land. The botanical composition of the natural pasture land that have been identified at the experimental site included thirteen grasses, seven annual legumes and seven other herbaceous species belonging to different families. The influence of stages of harvesting was significant (P< 0. 05) but application of N fertilizer was not significant on total DMY of the pasture. Natural pasture harvested at 120 -days of harvesting and at a fertilizer application of 69 kg/ha results the highest DMY (9. 97 t/ha) while the lowest level was (5. 38 t/ha) from unfertilized plots at 120 -days of harvesting. The effect of stage of harvesting and fertilizer level on DMY of legume components was highly significant (P< 0. 001) but for the grass components stage of harvesting had non- significant effect, where as fertilizer had a highly significant effect (P< 0. 001). The relative proportion of legumes in the pastureland reached highest at 90 -days of harvesting {{at all levels of}} fertilizer application. The proportion of legumes varied from the highest mean of 56. 18 % to the lowest of 37. 66 % at 90 and 120 -days of harvesting, respectively while that of grasses ranged from 58. 09 % to 40. 24 % at 120 and 90 -days of harvesting, respectively. The relative proportion of grasses increased with increasing levels of N fertilizer and stage of harvesting up to 120 -days. Significant effect of stage of harvesting (P< 0. 001) on CP, NDF, ADF, hemi-cellulose, cellulose, P and IVDMD were obtained at all levels of fertilizer application. At 60 -days of harvesting, highest values of 15. 53 %, 0. 41 % and 54. 86 % were obtained for CP, P and IVDMD, respectively. However, the lowest values 55. 63 %, 37. 32 %, 17. 55 % and 32. 02 % were obtained for NDF, ADF, hemi-cellulose and cellulose, respectively at the same stage of harvesting. The CP content was significantly (P< 0. 001) lower (6. 76 %) at 120 -days of harvesting compared with other stages of harvesting. At all levels of N- fertilizer, the mean CP content obtained were above the reported critical level for ruminant’s microorganism’s functioning (7 %). The IVDMD at 90 and 120 -day harvesting was 50. 09 % and 38. 76 %, respectively. The values at all harvesting stages were below the reported threshold value that ranged between 55 and 70 % for medium quality forages from natural pastures. The results obtained in the present study revealed that fertilizer application increased the yield of natural pasturelands by 36. 07 %. Fertilizer applications at the level of 46 kg/ha resulted in higher mean dry matter yield of 9. 58 t/ha and higher nutritional quality (11. 89 % CP, 1. 08 t/ha CPY, 49. 91 % IVDMD and 4. 65 t/ha IVDMDY) of the natural pasture. This level of fertilizer application combined with 90 days of (October) harvesting should be practiced for higher Pasture yield and quality parameters. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E

For this purpose, total of 36 sampling plots made of 1 m 2 size cages with of {{with the help}} of wire fences were established at 1900, 2000 and 2200 m altitudes. Vegetation samples taken from these cages were first identified and classified into botanical composition and then their fresh and dry forage yield were estimated along with their grazing capacity. In addition, total of 72 undisturbed and disturbed soil samples taken from 0 - 20 cm depth were analyzed for permeability, bulk density, content of fine particles and soil skeleton, root amount, texture, particle density, porosity, organic matter (OM) and soil pH. According to the estimated results, the mean fresh forage yield was determined as 647. 22 kg/da, the mean dry forage yield was estimated to be 196. 67 kg/da. It was determined that the botanical composition was made up of % 46. 16 poaceae (gramineae), % 14. 36 leguminosae (fabaceae) and % 39. 45 other families and showed some significant differences among the elevation gradients. In addition, some properties of soils including OM, bulk density, the contents of fine particles, soil skeleton and porosity displayed significant differences between the altitudes in the pasturelands. Finally, the results of the correlation analyses revealed that some of the soil properties played significantly important roles on shaping the botanical composition of the pasturelands...|$|R
40|$|Sardinia is {{the second}} largest island in the Mediterranean sea. Although it is famous for very {{beautiful}} landscapes not only along the coast, there are some polluted areas. A special project supported by the Sardinian Region and involving several research groups is trying to study these areas by using several approaches. In the present study, we report the preliminary results obtained from six sheep herds (Sardinian breed) grazing on <b>natural</b> <b>pasturelands</b> {{in the vicinity of}} possible polluted areas. Two herds were located in the Nordern area (industrial and military zones) and four herds were located in the Souther area (military, industrial and mine zones) of the Iceland. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 20 adult sheep (over 4 years) randomly selected from each of six herds grazing around above mentioned areas, as well as from three herds grazing in areas retained far from possible polluted areas and used as control. Two types of cell cultures were performed: without (normal cultures) and with addition of BrdU during the last 28 h: the former, to study the AC-test (chromosome and chromatid breaks), the latter for the SCE-test. In this report only data from SCE-test are reported. A total of 92 sheep from polluted areas and 37 sheep fromcontrol areas were studied. Upon 35 cells studied for each animal, SCE-mean values were 8. 65 ± 3. 40, 8. 10 ± 3. 50, 8. 05 ± 3. 08, 7. 42 ± 3. 34, 9. 28 ± 3. 56 and 8. 38 ± 3. 29 in the exposed areas, as well as 7. 86 ± 3. 31 in the control group. Significant increasing (P< 0. 01) of SCEs were found only in three areas of Southern area. Cytogenetic analyses using AC-test on the same animal groups are in progress...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, an {{increase}} of pollutants of diverse origin (industrial, military, mining, etc.) was recorded in several areas of Sardinia Island. We report {{the results of a}} multidisciplinary and complementary study based on cytogenetic and physiological analyses. The data obtained show the effects of the environmental impact on six sheep flocks (Sardinian breed) grazing on <b>natural</b> <b>pasturelands</b> next to possible polluted areas and compared to three herds grazing in different areas far from those potentially contaminated and used as control. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test was used as cytogenetic test to analyze chromosomal damages and it was performed on peripheral blood samples collected from 129 adult sheep (age &# 62; 4 years) randomly selected from polluted (92 animals) and control (37 animals) areas. Two types of cell cultures were performed: without (normal cultures) and with the addition of 5 -BrdU. SCE-mean values estimated over 35 cells counted for each animal were 8. 65 &# 177; 3. 40, 8. 10 &# 177; 3. 50, 8. 05 &# 177; 3. 08, 7. 42 &# 177; 3. 34, 9. 28 &# 177; 3. 56 and 8. 38 &# 177; 3. 29 in the exposed areas, whereas the average values were 7. 86 &# 177; 3. 31 in the control group. Significant increases (P &# 60; 0. 01) of SCEs were found in three investigated areas of Southern Sardinia. Furthermore, sheep of the same flocks were characterized for blood redox homeostasis in order to define the potential targets of oxidative damage and to identify biomarkers of the extent of animal exposure to environmental contaminants. The plasma levels of Asc, Toc and Ret were found to be significantly lower (P &# 60; 0. 001) in exposed sheep (I, II, IV and V) than in the control group. TAC as well as GPx and SOD activities were higher in control than in the exposed groups (P &# 60; 0. 001).

40|$|The central Ethiopian {{highlands}} {{where most}} human and livestock populations concentrated {{have experienced a}} drastic change in land use and land cover (LULC) of the landscapes. This study was aimed to define the rate and pattern of LULC changes in Dendi-Jeldu hilly-mountainous areas in the central Ethiopia. Aerial photographs of years 1957 and 1995, and Landsat images taken at 1995 and 2014 were {{used to analyze the}} historical land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The study covered an area of about 438 km 2. The analysis extracted from these remote sensing data revealed that, in 1957, the dominant LULCs were pastureland, cultivated land (cropland) and forestland covering 49, 25 and 20 % of the total area, respectively. Remarkable LULC change dominated by cultivated land expansion (now covering 68 % of the total area), however, claimed vast areas under pastureland (main), forestland and woodland. Deforestation in particular, would have been greater if Chilimo forest (remnant afro-montane forest) was not under state control. Plantation forestry exclusively dominated by eucalyptus species also showed substantial expansion into pastureland in the period between 1957 and 1995, and cultivated land between 1995 and 2014. In the period 1957 to 2014 cultivated land, plantation land and settlement were increased by 170 %, 13, 674 % and 172 % respectively, while pastureland, forestland and woodland declined by 67 %, 73 % and 100 %, respectively.
