40|$|Background: The {{endoscopic}} {{view of the}} gastric cardia {{could be}} related with the manometric competence of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and with pathological gastroesophageal reflux. Aim: To compare the endoscopic aspect of the cardia with the results from esophageal manometry and 24 h esophageal pH monitoring. Materials and Methods: The cardia {{of a group of}} 150 patients (aged 19 to 72 years, 89 women) with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms was classified as <b>normal</b> or <b>open,</b> during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. All subjects were subjected to a manometric study to measure LES pressure and determine LES incompetence and to a 24 h esophageal pH measurement. Results: LES pressure was 14. 7 ± 6. 2 and 8. 7 ± 4. 2 mmHg in patients with <b>normal</b> and <b>open</b> cardia, respectvively (p < 0. 001). Likewise, 43 and 79 % of patients with <b>normal</b> and <b>open</b> cardia had an incompetent LES, respectively (p < 0. 001).

50|$|The {{gradation}} of the K-factor reduces ratings {{changes at}} the top end of the rating spectrum, reducing the possibility for rapid ratings inflation or deflation for those with a low K factor. This might in theory apply equally to an online chess site or over-the-board players, since {{it is more difficult}} for players to get much higher ratings when their K-factor is reduced. When playing online, it may simply be the selection of highly rated opponents that enables 2800+ players to further increase their rating, since a grandmaster on the ICC playing site can play a string of different opponents who are all rated over 2100. In over-the-board events, it would only be in very high level all-play-all events that a player would be able to engage that number of 2700+ opponents, while in a <b>normal</b> <b>open</b> Swiss-paired chess tournament, frequently there would be many opponents rated less than 2500, reducing the ratings gains possible from a single contest.|$|E
5000|$|As {{its name}} implies, the Open Division {{allows for the}} {{greatest}} range of pistol and sight modification. Pistols used in Open division competition are the shooting sport equivalent to the Formula One race car. They are custom built with parts and features specifically designed for competition. The most notable modifications are the use of recoil compensators and red dot optical sighting systems. A <b>normal</b> <b>Open</b> division rig setup contains at least one 170 mm and four 140 mm magazines. The longer 170 mm magazines provide more capacity, but the shorter 140 mm magazines are also popular because of easier handling and often more reliable feeding, leaving the competitor a choice of equipment according to the stage at hand. Competitors may declare major scoring with a 9 mm (.354") or larger bullet, and the most popular cartridges in the Open division are the [...]38 Super and 9x19 mm handloaded to major power factor. For a while USPSA de facto (but not by rule) prohibited 9×19mm from scoring major power factor in the Open Division due to too high pressures, but 9x19 mm loaded to major became popular again as the power factor was relaxed from to 175 kgr·ft/s to 160 kgr·ft/s, and later raised to 165 kgr·ft/s.|$|E

5000|$|The tour to Britain, Ireland and France took in 29 matches, {{including}} Test {{games against}} the four Home Nations and a non-Test with the French national team. The tour began with great expectations, as the previous season had seen the Original All Blacks tour Britain with incredible success. The first 15 games were against club and county teams, with the South Africans victorious in every encounter, though they were run close by an extremely strong Glamorgan County team. The first international encounter for the team was against Scotland, played {{in front of a}} record crowd of 30,000. Roos was forced to miss the game after he injured his collarbone in the encounter with Oxford University, and the captaincy was handed over to Paddy Carolin; the match ended in the first defeat for the South African's with Scotland scoring two tries in the second half. The Springboks were back on winning form the very next game against the North of Scotland, then travelled to Belfast to face Ireland. Roos lead his team out at the Balmoral Showgrounds in an exciting match. After the first half, Roos men were leading 3-12, but brilliant play from Ireland levelled the scores to 12-12 before a try from the wing settled the game in the South Africans favour. How pleasantly the Tour passed over from first to last. What hospitality we enjoyed, even in private homes. Never could a team wish for better treatment, both from governing bodies and from spectators, than was accorded to us. Coming as it did just after the Anglo-Boer War, the 1906 team probably played no small part in healing the breach and restoring pleasant relations. - Roos recollections of the 1906 tour, spoken in 1931 The game against Wales was the most anticipated of the tour. Wales had been unofficially crowned the World's best team after a Triple Crown winning season in 1905 and a win over the All Blacks in the 'Game of the Century'. The Glamorgan team that had run the South Africans close earlier in the tour had contained twelve internationals, and the Welsh were keen for revenge. Despite this, Roos was a popular figure in Wales, and with his deep impressive voice and [...] "pronounced Dutch accent", he had spoken at church meetings throughout the tour; and Roos' cordial manner had paid dividends earlier in the tour after the game against Newport. South Africa beat Newport by a goal and a try to nil, and after the game the two team captains sat down at the Westgate Hotel for a post-match dinner. Roos asked Charlie Pritchard, the Newport skipper, how the Newport forwards, who were lighter than the South Africans, had stolen the ball away so many times in the scrums. The tactic, which the Welsh team had used to counter the famous New Zealand scrum, was discussed with great openness between Pritchard and Roos, and when the South Africans left the next day Roos shook Pritchard's hand at the train station and thanked him. This revelation became a controversial talking point when the Welsh press heard of it. The match against Wales was set for 1 December 1906, and was played at St. Helen's Ground in Swansea. Wales selected a strong team, with Teddy Morgan and Johnnie Williams on the wings, and captained by talismanic three-quarter Gwyn Nicholls, who had come out of retirement to lead the Welsh. Roos started the match with heavy strapping to protect an injured shoulder, and several of his team were suffering from coughs and sore throats brought on by the British winter weather. Although the Welsh started at a fast pace, the South Africans soon began to launch their own attacks and the firm surface of the St. Helen's pitch played to the Springbok's strengths. Wales under performed throughout the game, and the Springbok tactic to tightly mark Nicholls and Rhys Gabe at centre prevented the pair's <b>normal</b> <b>open</b> game. South Africa scored three tries without reply, dominating the game 11-0. At the final whistle the South African supporters, assisted by Welsh fans, rushed onto the pitch and carried Roos from the field. Roos later stated that 'he considered it to be the greatest honour of his life to be borne triumphant from the ground by supporters of his beaten opponents'.|$|E
40|$|The {{repeatability}} for {{measurement of}} corneal oxygen uptake for six human corneas, observed {{over the course}} of 3 years, was analysed. A total of 48 measurements, collected on three separate occasions, were completed on each cornea: 24 under <b>normal</b> <b>open</b> eye conditions and 24 under controlled hypoxic conditions.
