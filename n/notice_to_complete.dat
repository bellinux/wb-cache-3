25|$|The Kents teach Clark he must {{conceal his}} otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good. Clark creates the costumed {{identity}} of Superman {{so as to}} protect his personal privacy {{and the safety of}} his loved ones. As Clark Kent, he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his Superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment's <b>notice.</b> <b>To</b> <b>complete</b> this disguise, Clark avoids violent confrontation, preferring to slip away and change into Superman when danger arises, and suffers occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1903 architects {{were invited}} to submit designs for the library - the total cost was not to exceed £3,500. Mr John Dent Harker of St Anne's won the {{contract}} and was appointed as the architect and in March 1904 the tender for the building was awarded to Mr Samuel Wilson also of St Anne's. The building process wasn't without difficulty and the Council experienced some problems with the building contractor. The Council Minutes (Library and Baths Committee) of 30 October 1905 note that [...] "...the Architect submitted correspondence which had taken place {{between himself and the}} Contractor with reference to the great delay there has been in completing the Library building; he also reported that he had given the Contractor seven days <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the work, and that the Contractor had commenced {{on the last day of}} the notice to proceed to complete the work.", ...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} of Carrapetta v. Rado [2012] NSWCA 202 raises a short but very practical point {{relating to the}} right to deliver a <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> or have otherwise called for completion where {{time is of the essence}} of the contract in circumstances where a settlement statement subsequently sent from the seller has overstated the amount owing under the contract. It was common ground, following the oft quoted High Court decisions of Neeta (Epping) Pty Ltd v Phillips(1974) 131 CLR 286 and Louinder v Leis (1982) 149 CLR 509 that a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Complete</b> which called for completion outside the terms of the contract would be invalid. These decisions also further confirm the long accepted principles that a seller who is not “ready willing and able” to perform all their obligations or who is otherwise in breach of contract at the time could not deliver a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Complete</b> (at[27]). The issue in this case did not so much concern the efficacy of the <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Complete</b> at the time was delivered,but the legal effect upon the <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Complete</b> of the later delivery of a settlement statement for what the buyer considered to be performance beyond that required by the contract...|$|E

5000|$|Brian Pillman {{developed}} a [...] "Loose Cannon" [...] persona for himself while in WCW in 1996, conspiring with Vice President Eric Bischoff and booker Kevin Sullivan. Pillman's character was based entirely on straddling the fine line of kayfabe, presenting {{it as if}} he had legitimate problems with WCW management. He would engage in on-camera actions that seemed to be unscripted, even to the other performers, and even breached kayfabe protocol when he addressed Sullivan on air as [...] "bookerman". In the ultimate act of turning fiction into fact, Pillman convinced Sullivan and Bischoff that their storyline [...] "firing" [...] of him would seem more legitimate with the physical evidence of a release form. They faxed an actual WCW contract termination <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> him, <b>complete</b> with his name and the proper signatures, in order to preserve kayfabe. This allowed Pillman to actually leave WCW to work for Extreme Championship Wrestling and later the WWF.|$|R

40|$|The rule is {{that the}} {{necessity}} of a <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> quit is based on the relation of landlord and tenant, and where that relation does not exist, the <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> quit is not necessary.
