5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with <b>non-organic</b> failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
25|$|From {{the human}} soul there {{naturally}} issue forth powers pertaining to two orders, the organic and the <b>non-organic.</b> The organic powers, among which are the senses, have the composite as their subject. The <b>non-organic</b> powers have the soul alone as their subject. Hence, the intellect is a power intrinsically independent of any bodily organ.|$|E

25|$|Copper aesthetically enhances {{interior}} wall systems, ceilings, fixtures, furniture, and hardware by evoking {{an atmosphere of}} warmth, tranquility, and calm. Regarding performance advantages, it is lightweight, fire resistant, durable, workable, and <b>non-organic</b> (it does not off-gas). Typical copper-based interiors include panels, shingles, screens, ornaments, fixtures, and other decorative enhancements.|$|E

25|$|Montmorillonite, an {{abundant}} clay, is {{a catalyst for}} the polymerization of RNA and {{for the formation of}} membranes from lipids. A model for the origin of life using clay was forwarded by Alexander Graham Cairns-Smith in 1985 and explored as a plausible mechanism by several scientists. The clay hypothesis postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on pre-existing, <b>non-organic</b> replication surfaces of silicate crystals in solution.|$|E
25|$|Resource {{recovery}} (as {{opposed to}} waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) {{a number of}} broad {{studies have indicated that}} administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the <b>non-organic</b> fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also argued}} that this {{augmented}} understanding of etiology will lead to better remediation and rehabilitation strategies through {{an understanding of the}} different levels in the causal process where one can intervene. It may be that <b>non-organic</b> interventions, like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), better attenuate disorders alone or in conjunction with drugs. Linden's (2006) demonstration of how psychotherapy has neurobiological commonalities with pharmacotherapy is a pertinent example of this and is encouraging from a patient perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.|$|E
25|$|The Processing Laboratory {{incorporates}} {{equipment for}} the processing of archaeological materials for cataloguing, accessioning and analytical purposes. Analytical methods employed include sectioning and polishing of hard biological tissues, including animal bones, teeth and shell, and of <b>non-organic</b> materials, such as ceramics and lithics, as well as micro-drilling and milling to facilitate light stable isotope and trace elemental analysis. Equipment in the processing laboratory includes a manual grinder polisher (Buehler Metaserv 250), vacuum mounting (Buehler Cast N' Vac 1000), Buehler IsoMet 1000 Precision Saw and a Minimo high precision rotary tool for cutting samples such as bone, ceramic, antler, or shell.|$|E
25|$|John Ruben's {{conclusions}} have, however, {{been questioned}} by some scientists, such as Lawrence Witmer, who claimed {{the study to}} be flawed. The 2011 study concluded that {{due to the fact}} that the liver had been preserved as a vague halo, representing body fluids that after death might have covered a larger surface than the organs they originated from, its exact dimensions and extent cannot be determined. In any case a diaphragm itself or its position could not be directly observed. Many bird livers are large too, showing that such a trait is compatible with an air-sac system. The small body cavity in front of the halo seemed to indicate the presence of small stiff bird-like lungs. The presumed M. diaphragmaticus was shown to be an artifact caused by the polishing and engraving of calcite nodules of <b>non-organic</b> origin during preparation, creating the illusion of muscle fibres.|$|E
500|$|Apple {{trees are}} large if grown from seed. [...] Generally apple cultivars are {{propagated}} by grafting onto rootstocks, which control {{the size of}} the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and <b>non-organic</b> means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.|$|E
2500|$|Palynomorphs are {{broadly defined}} as organic-walled microfossils between 5 and 500 micrometres in size. [...] They are {{extracted}} from sedimentary rocks and sediment cores both physically, by ultrasonic treatment and wet sieving, and chemically, by chemical digestion {{to remove the}} <b>non-organic</b> fraction. Palynomorphs may be composed of organic material such as chitin, pseudochitin and sporopollenin. Palynomorphs that have a taxonomy description are {{sometimes referred to as}} palynotaxa.|$|E
2500|$|The size {{distribution}} is often {{of critical importance}} {{to the way the}} material performs in use. [...] A sieve analysis can be performed on any type of <b>non-organic</b> or organic granular materials including sands, crushed rock, clays, granite, feldspars, coal, soil, a wide range of manufactured powders, grain and seeds, down to a minimum size depending on the exact method. Being such a simple technique of particle sizing, it is probably the most common.|$|E
2500|$|An {{organism}} may {{be defined}} as an assembly of molecules functioning as {{a more or less}} stable whole that exhibits the properties of life. Dictionary definitions can be broad, using phrases such as [...] "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction". Many definitions exclude viruses and possible man-made <b>non-organic</b> life forms, as viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction. A superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit.|$|E
2500|$|Organic {{farming is}} farming without {{chemical}} fertilisers, most pesticides, genetic modification, or the routine use of drugs, antibiotics or wormers. [...] In the United Kingdom it is supported and {{encouraged by the}} Soil Association. [...] The Food Standards Agency says that organic food offers no additional nutritional benefits over the <b>non-organic</b> kind, though the Soil Association disputes this. However, there are definite benefits in terms of on-farm conservation and wildlife. In the UK as in most of northern Europe, organic crop yields can be 40%–50% lower than conventional, more intensive farming and labour use can be 10%–25% higher.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in every}} {{economic}} sector, the construction industry's purchases {{of materials and}} services creates a whole chain of processes from raw material selecting in situ, removal from the earth, usually proceeding to cutting, finishing, or processing/manufacturing, then transport, and retailing. [...] All of these activities have significant upstream (off-site) environmental impacts, whether in terms of energy and raw resource use or emissions to air, land, or water impacting living organisms or the Earth's surface (<b>non-organic).</b> [...] Life cycle assessment is a method for estimating and comparing a range of environmental performance measures (e.g. global warming, acidification potential, toxicity, ozone depletion potentials) over the full life cycle of a product, a building assembly, or a whole building. [...] As such, it provides a comprehensive means for evaluating and comparing products rather than prescriptive measures of individual product characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|Modern Egypt-India {{relations}} {{go back to}} {{the contacts}} between Saad Zaghloul and Mohandas Gandhi on the common goals of their respective movements of independence. In 1955, Egypt under Gamal Abdul Nasser and India under Jawaharlal Nehru became the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement. During the 1956 War, Nehru stood supporting Egypt to the point of threatening to withdraw his country from the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1967, following the Arab–Israeli conflict, India supported Egypt and the Arabs. In 1977, New Delhi described the visit of President Anwar al-Sadat to Jerusalem as a [...] "brave" [...] move and considered the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel a primary step on the path of a just settlement of the Middle East problem. Major Egyptian exports to India include raw cotton, raw and manufactured fertilisers, oil and oil products, organic and <b>non-organic</b> chemicals, leather and iron products. Major imports into Egypt from India are cotton yarn, sesame, coffee, herbs, tobacco, lentils, pharmaceutical products and transport equipment. The Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum is also currently negotiating the establishment of a natural gas-operated fertiliser plant with another Indian company. In 2004 the Gas Authority of India Limited, bought 15% of Egypt Nat Gas distribution and marketing company. In 2008 Egyptian investment in India was worth some 750 million dollars, according to the Egyptian ambassador.|$|E
