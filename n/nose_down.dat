5|$|On 29 August 1984, B-1A (AF Ser. No. 74-0159) stalled {{and crashed}} while {{performing}} minimum control speed tests at low altitude. The crew used the escape capsule {{to leave the}} bomber, but the parachutes deployed improperly, causing the capsule to hit <b>nose</b> <b>down.</b> The impact killed the B-1's pilot, Rockwell test pilot Doug Benefield, and seriously injured two other crew members.|$|E
5|$|Then, after flying past McCudden in a head-on firing pass, Voss's Fokker was {{hit with}} bullets on the {{starboard}} side by Hoidge. Meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he rejoined combat with a 150meter (500foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450meters (1,500feet), and began a long flat dive onto the tail of Voss' triplane. At point-blank range, he holed the German aircraft end to end with his machine guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again ripped the German plane as its engine quit. The aircraft missed a mid-air collision by inches. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300meters (1,000feet) altitude and lost sight of his opponent. From above, Bowman saw the Fokker in {{what could have been}} a landing glide, right up until it stalled. It then flipped inverted and <b>nose</b> <b>down,</b> dropping directly to earth. The resulting smash left only the rudder intact.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Lockheed Constellation L-049 {{aircraft}} allowed the pilots to disable the hydraulic elevator boost and control the elevators manually via direct mechanical linkage. The pilots of the accident flight apparently attempted to revert to manual control as the aircraft began to pitch up, but the design was such that a continuous <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> pressure on the elevators made the shift to manual elevator control mechanically impossible. Thus, according to the CAB's reconstruction of events, as the pilots were desperately applying <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> pressure to avoid a stall, they were also hampering themselves from shifting to manual mode and regaining elevator control.|$|E
6000|$|... "Send {{a hand up}} {{into the}} fore-top, Mr. Leach," [...] said the captain, gaping like a greyhound; [...] "a fellow with sharp eyes; none of your chaps who read with their <b>noses</b> <b>down</b> in the cloudy weather of an almanack; and let him {{take a look at}} the desert, in search of Arabs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, {{flying a}} U.S. Navy Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter, Fisher {{developed}} {{a way to}} fly [...] "zero-g", vertical dives. From 20,000 ft, the F8F would be <b>nosed</b> <b>down</b> into a vertical dive, while he simultaneously reversed the propeller pitch. This technique allowed a controlled vertical dive at rates of descent that varied between 30,000 and 37,000 fpm.|$|R

25|$|Nasogastric {{aspiration}} {{involves the}} placement of a tube via the <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> into the stomach, the stomach contents are then removed by suction. This procedure is mainly used for liquid ingestions where activated charcoal is ineffective, e.g. ethylene glycol poisoning.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of their {{investigation}} of the accident, the CAB urged the FAA to mandate a redesign of the elevator boost control, so that the shift to manual mode could be easily carried out by the pilots, even when applying <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> pressure. The FAA replied that they had asked the manufacturer to incorporate procedural changes in the aircraft's flight manual, but did not require any design changes.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the engine}} being mounted above the center of gravity, power was highly {{stabilizing}} (addition of power would push the <b>nose</b> <b>down),</b> {{which could have been}} disconcerting to pilots. Initially, Piper designers incorporated an automatic pitch trim system to coordinate horizontal stabilizer angle of incidence with power setting. This system was later replaced by a vectored thrust nozzle, developed by Williams International, which resulted in reduced weight and simplified manufacturing processes.|$|E

50|$|The oft-traveled Moorea to Tahiti {{route is}} one of the {{shortest}} in the world - only a 7-minute flight on average - and is flown 40 to 50 times a day. On 9 August 2007, F-OIQI was the aircraft operating the short route. The aircraft took off without incident just past noon, and was climbing through 400 feet when, according to eyewitnesses, it suddenly <b>nosed</b> <b>down</b> without warning and drove into the ocean, killing all 20 on board - 19 passengers and the pilot, Santeurenne.|$|R
25|$|On 6 May 2010, {{the morning}} of the election, Farage was {{travelling}} in a two-seater PZL-104 Wilga aircraft with a pro-UKIP banner attached, when the plane crashed. Farage suffered injuries that were described as non-life-threatening. Although his injuries were originally described as minor, his sternum and ribs were broken and his lung punctured. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said that the aeroplane was towing a banner, which caught in the tailplane, forcing the <b>nose</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was found 65 metres off shore in a 45 degree <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> attitude, with the forward {{half of the}} fuselage submerged in a water depth of approximately 6 metres. The flight deck was almost completely destroyed and the fuselage was firmly embedded in the sand. The empennage had separated and was found floating 100 metres {{to the east of}} the main wreckage. Both crew seats remained attached to the flight deck floor with no failure of the safety harnesses. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were both recovered intact.|$|E
25|$|An article, {{photograph}} of the wrecked airplane, and {{photograph of}} flight attendant Miss Betty Proctor appeared {{at the top of}} the front page of the Birmingham News the day after the crash. The photo depicts the DC-3 <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> in Village Creek with extensive damage to the right wing. Media attention of the crash quickly faded with the only immediate follow-up coverage being a note that the investigation was continuing in the January 8 edition of the paper in conjunction with a lengthier article regarding an altercation that occurred at the crash site.|$|E

The board of enquiry was unable to determine the exact cause but {{it may have been}} the forward-swivelling upper boost actuator jamming. All seven on board, three crew and four technicians, were killed.|$|R
5000|$|August 2, 1984 - an Islander, N589SA, {{operating}} as Vieques Air Link Flight 901A, crashed on initial {{climb out of}} Vieques en route to St. Croix. The Islander was overloaded by 600-700 pounds when it departed Vieques. Also, its centre of gravity was up to 5 inches behind the aft limit. After takeoff the left engine lost power. It lost altitude, banked abruptly to the left, <b>nosed</b> <b>down</b> and crashed into the ocean. It appeared that the fuel had been contaminated with water. On board were the pilot and 8 passengers, all were killed.|$|R

25|$|Suddenly the {{downdraft}} dissipated rapidly from 50 fps to 0 fps in four seconds, {{this cause}} a {{rapid increase in}} the angle of attack and, as the result, the stick shaker was activated for approximately two seconds. It appeared that the Captain desperately {{tried to get out}} from the TAWS pull up warning, as he maintained a nose up input. Thus, the plane stalled. He heard the stick shaker warning and, to get out of it, he later maintained a <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> input. This input continued for the next few seconds. However, proper and complete Boeing stall recovery action remained not carried out.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the design, thanks {{in no small part}} to the passionate enthusiasm of Mignet himself, the original HM.14 revealed design flaws that could lead to an unrecoverable and often fatal dive under certain conditions; when the front wing was put in a high attack angle for climbing, the high-speed flow of air deflected by the front wing went to the rear wing upper surface, greatly increasing the rear wing's lift, and putting the <b>nose</b> <b>down,</b> the instinctive reaction of pilot being pulling even more the stick, this worsened the situation, as the way to go out of this 'vicious circle' was reducing the front wing incidence, as to command a <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> descent. Also some homebuilders attempted to simplify construction by modifying components such as the wings tips curving up, resulting in extremely dangerous airplanes and deadly accidents that forced the air authorities to ban building more of them. Studies in the UK and France revealed the problem (the HM.14 was small enough to fit in wind tunnels in both countries usually used for scale models of larger aircraft) and corrections were made to the design. Unfortunately, the wave of bad publicity created by the crashes dogged Mignet {{for the rest of his}} life and continues to be associated with the design today despite the fact that the basic Mignet configuration has proven to be safe in hundreds of successful homebuilt aircraft and factory built microlights.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{was entirely}} of wood with fabric {{covering}} {{on the wings}} aft of the mainspar. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, with the student forward of the wings and the instructor immediately aft of the mainspar in the wing centre-section. The seating arrangement allowed the aircraft to be flown {{with one or two}} pilots without the need for ballast to adjust the centre of gravity. A single mainwheel with nose and tailskids comprised the undercarriage, with the aircraft sitting <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> on the nose skid with the front cockpit occupied. Large DFS style airbrakes extended from upper and lower wing surfaces aft of the mainspars.|$|E

25|$|After {{detailed}} {{forensic analysis}} of the FDR data, the flight control primary computer (FCPC) software and the air data inertial reference unit (ADIRU), {{it was determined that}} the CPU of the ADIRU corrupted the angle of attack (AOA) data. The exact nature was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously relabelled the altitude data word so that the binary data that represented 37,012 (the altitude {{at the time of the}} incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625 degrees. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the high-AOA protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system (EFCS) to pitch the <b>nose</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
25|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{fairly quickly}} {{centered on the}} actions of the relief first officer, Gameel Al-Batouti, and this drew relatively minor criticism from the Egyptians. The NTSB determined that the only way for the observed split elevator condition to occur was if the left seat pilot (the captain's position) was commanding nose up while the right seat pilot (the first officer's position) commanded <b>nose</b> <b>down.</b> As the Egyptian investigation forwarded various mechanical failure scenarios, they were each tested by the NTSB and found not to match the factual evidence. The NTSB concluded that no mechanical failure scenario either they or the Egyptians could come up with matched the evidence on the ground, and that even if mechanical failure had been experienced, the 767's design made the situation recoverable.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight crew}} did not acquire any visual ground {{references}} before the approach was started. The aircraft started its final descent for landing too early. The aircraft had descended to 280 feet above ground when the terrain awareness and warning system sounded in the cockpit. The captain ordered a go-around and the autopilot was turned off. The first officer put {{the nose of}} the aircraft up for 4 seconds and the thrust levers were set to go-around power. The aircraft pitched up to 12.3° nose up and the flight crew raised the landing gear and flaps. Shortly thereafter the co-pilot started making <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> inputs which caused the aircraft to pitch-attitude to reduce to 3.5° <b>nose</b> <b>down.</b> (The co-pilot could have been focused on the aircraft's speed, rather than its altitude.) The go-around pitch attitude was not maintained and the instructions from the flight director were not followed. (The report says that fatigue could {{have played a role in}} causing the first officer to focus solely on the airspeed.) The captain and the first officer were making inputs to the aircraft's side stick at the same time (although the dual inputs were not sufficient to trigger a dual-input warning). This action appears to be intended to provide assistance by the captain to fly the aircraft. This action led to confusion on who was flying the aircraft. The ground proximity warning system sounded as the aircraft lost more height and the co-pilot responded with a sharp nose-down input. Then the captain took control of the aircraft without warning, via the side stick priority button and maintained the nose-down input, while the first officer was simultaneously pulling back on his own side stick. Two seconds before impact with the ground the aircraft was at 180 feet. The captain was also pulling his side stick fully back, suggesting both pilots were aware of the aircraft's impending collision with the ground.|$|E
25|$|Brooks Air Force Base {{was named}} to honor San Antonio aviator Sidney Johnson Brooks, Jr. Cadet Brooks died on 13 November 1917 when his Curtiss JN-4 <b>nosed</b> <b>down</b> as he {{prepared}} to land after his final training flight at Kelly Field, Texas, possibly because he had blacked out in reaction to the inoculations they had been given shortly before the flight.

He was awarded his wings and commission posthumously.|$|R
5000|$|The Lockheed X-17 was a three-stage solid-fuel {{research}} rocket to {{test the}} effects of high mach atmospheric reentry. The first stage of the X-17 carried the rocket to a height of 17 mi before burning out. The rocket would then coast on momentum to about 100 mi before <b>nosing</b> <b>down</b> for reentry. The second stage engine would then fire before jettisoning and igniting {{the third and final}} stage. On April 24, 1957, an X-17 reached a speed of 9000 mph at Patrick AFB. [...] Ultimately the X-17 would be travelling towards Earth at up to Mach 14.5.|$|R

500|$|Early in its development, the Merlin engine's lack of fuel {{injection}} meant that Spitfires and Hurricanes, unlike the Bf 109E, {{were unable to}} simply <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> into a steep dive. This meant a Luftwaffe fighter could simply [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape an attack, leaving the Spitfire behind, as its fuel was {{forced out of the}} carburettor by negative [...] "g". RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. The carburettor was adopted because, as Sir Stanley Hooker explained, it [...] "increased the performance of the supercharger and thereby increased the power of the engine".|$|E
500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board report {{stated that}} [...] "the {{airplane}} was seen lifting off the runway, and then <b>nose</b> <b>down,</b> impacting in a marsh {{on the south}} side of the departure end of runway 27 and then exploding in flames." [...] It indicated that the pilot was not approved to fly the plane. Morales falsely obtained his FAA license by showing hundreds of hours never flown, and he may also have falsified how many hours he had flown in order to get a job with his employer, Blackhawk International Airways. Additionally, toxicology tests performed on Morales revealed traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system.|$|E
500|$|Corporal Burdett later stated, [...] "When McCudden {{took off}} {{he put the}} machine into a nearly {{vertical}} climb, seemed to do a half-roll and then nosed dived into a wood.....it was usual for scout pilots to perform some little stunt.....I {{think that is what}} he was doing." [...] Witness Lieutenant L.M Fenton had a different view, [...] "the aircraft took off into wind and at about 100 feet did a vertical turn and flew back across the aerodrome {{by the side of the}} wood. The engine appeared to be running badly. The pilot rolled the machine, which failed to straighten out, at approximately 200 feet. It crashed <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> into the wood." [...] Lieutenant E.M Greenwood stated he thought the crash was the result of a failed aerobatic manoeuvre: [...] "I was watching an S.E.5 flying over the aerodrome at about 200 feet, when it did one complete roll to the right, then dived steeply to the ground behind the trees." [...] Lieutenant K.V King believed a similar thing: [...] "......very low over the aerodrome, going east towards the wood on the south-east side of the aerodrome. He had apparently been rolling. I saw him <b>nose</b> <b>down</b> and engine off entering the trees and immediately afterwards heard a crash." [...] Lieutenant [...] T.H Barry, though supports the notion that something was amiss with the engine:"I saw an S.E.5 flying from west to east across the aerodrome at 200–300 feet. The engine was firing irregularly. Just after crossing the end of the aerodrome the pilot did a sharp stalling turn. The nose dropped and it dived behind the trees. During this dive the noise of the engine ceased." ...|$|E
