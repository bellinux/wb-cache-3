5|$|Upon {{the death}} of Carroll on July 26, 1977, Bishop Edward Anthony McCarthy was {{appointed}} as Miami's archbishop. McCarthy oversaw {{the construction of the}} Pastoral Center for the archdiocese and restructured most senior operational divisions. He established the Office of Lay Ecclesial Ministry, the Office of Evangelization and the Permanent Diaconate program. In 1980, he offered support and assistance during the Mariel Boat Lift. The following year, he supported the rights of Haitian immigrants who were detained under the Wet Foot, Dry Foot policy. Responding to the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new immigration, he opened the Pierre Toussaint Haitian Catholic Center. McCarthy retired in 1994 at the required age of 75.|$|E

Omaha jobbers handled a wide variety of wholesale products along the Great Platte River Road and beyond, including groceries, dry goods, hardware, fruits, paper, and liquor.

25|$|The Lumbee are {{originally}} from North Carolina, {{where they are}} concentrated in Robeson County. During the early and mid-20th century, the same wave of migration that brought large numbers of African Americans from the Deep South and poor white people from Appalachia also brought many people from the Lumbee tribe. The Baltimore American Indian Center was established in 1968 in order to serve the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> community. In 2011 the center established a Native American heritage museum, including exhibits on Lumbee art and culture. The urban Lumbee and other Native Americans in Baltimore are concentrated in the 6 blocks around Baltimore Street in East Baltimore. This community is the largest Lumbee community outside of the Lumbee's tribal territory. As of 1993 there were 4,300 Lumbee in Maryland, 2,500 of whom resided in Baltimore between Fleet and Fayette streets, Broadway and Milton Avenue. At the time, the South Baltimore Baptist Church at 211 S. Broadway had a congregation that was approximately 95% Lumbee. The Lumbee tend to be poor. Native Americans in Baltimore, {{the vast majority of}} whom are Lumbee, have the lowest income level of any ethnic or racial group, including white people, African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. High levels of unemployment, drug and alcohol abuse, and domestic violence are problems that plague the community. Over a third fall below the poverty line and the average Lumbee only has an eighth grade level education.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the largest}} issues confronting Cornwallis in {{managing}} the army was its diversity. [...] In addition to British Army and East India Company European forces, there were German troops from Hanover, {{and a large number}} of native sepoys from a diversity of cultural backgrounds, speaking different languages and having varied religious and dietary requirements. To meet the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> patchwork of forces, the army was followed by a number of camp followers that was unusually large by comparison to typical European or North American armies, further increasing the need for reliable supply. [...] The army he took over from General Medows had 15,000 troops and 60,000 camp followers. He permitted the artist Robert Home to accompany the army on its campaign; the resulting artwork is one of the legacies of the campaign.|$|E

Bragg, the {{associate}} editor of The New Humanist, sought to consolidate the input of Leon Milton Birkhead, Charles Francis Potter, and {{several members of the}} Western Unitarian Conference. Bragg asked Roy Wood Sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, [...] "any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present." [...] It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.|$|E

[...] He joined forces with a Merton tutor to open collegiate lectures to students of other colleges and received the College's authorisation. [...] Soon, the Association of Tutors was born, as well as an Oxford-wide series of lectures that any student could attend. [...] The lectures were to influence his choice of future research. [...] He wrote later, We worked out among us a scheme of lectures covering the whole field (of history), and were the pioneers of the [...] "Intercollegiate Lectures" [...] which now prevail at both universities.

2500|$|For many elderly carers of a {{relative}} {{who has a}} learning or other disability, future planning is an issue. [...] The population of older parents who have children with a learning disability is growing {{and many of their}} children are likely to outlive them. [...] In many cases the caring role can span up to seven decades, ending only with their death. [...] Governments and other service providers cannot ignore the pressing <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> population and their parent and sibling carers. [...] In most countries, family carers provide inexpensive care for a person with a learning disability and other disabilities. [...] This trend is set to continue in England. [...] Demographic changes and the health needs of these two growing populations must be considered against government policy constraints and limited in-home and external care options in order to avoid a crisis. [...] The consequences of not supporting these family carers will to lead to crisis management, increase in distress and care giving burdens, and increased spending on unsuitable crisis placements. [...] Housing and financial guidance are issues for caregivers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{breastfeeding}} {{promotion and}} support of adolescent mothers {{must take into account}} the context of the individual and their cultural norms. [...] Few teenagers can withstand the cultural pressure which categorizes bottle feeding as a norm. Therefore, new teenage mothers need more concerted prenatal anticipatory guidance, specialized lactation education and an increase of face-to-face postpartum support. [...] To succeed with the task at hand, inpatient nursing care will have to be tailor to the unique <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> population. [...] Positive perception of inpatient postpartum nursing care {{have been found to be}} an incredible influence in a young mother's success with breastfeeding. [...] In a study conducted in the United States, young mothers reported positive postpartum experiences, especially in respect to breastfeeding initiation and mother-infant bonding, when their nursing care was targeted for adolescent mothers. The mothers reported that they felt better cared for and more motivated to initiate and sustain breastfeeding when nurses where friendly, patient, respectful and understanding of their individual needs. [...] Maternal self-confidence is a contributing factor that influences positive breastfeeding outcomes especially among adolescent mothers. Empowerment, compassion, understanding and patience are key when caring for young moms.|$|E
2500|$|The Epistles may be {{considered}} among Horace's most innovative works. There was nothing like it in Greek or Roman literature. Occasionally [...] poems had had some resemblance to letters, including an elegiac poem from Solon to Mimnermus and some lyrical poems from Pindar to Hieron of Syracuse. Lucilius had composed a satire {{in the form of}} a letter, and some epistolary poems were composed by Catullus and Propertius. But nobody before Horace had ever composed an entire collection of verse letters, let alone letters with a focus on philosophical problems. The sophisticated and flexible style that he had developed in his Satires was adapted to the more serious <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new genre. Such refinement of style was not unusual for Horace. His craftsmanship as a wordsmith is apparent even in his earliest attempts at this or that kind of poetry, but his handling of each genre tended to improve over time as he adapted it to his own needs. Thus for example it is generally agreed that his second book of Satires, where human folly is revealed through dialogue between characters, is superior to the first, where he propounds his ethics in monologues. Nevertheless, the first book includes some of his most popular poems.|$|E

The man who proposes to meet taxation by cutting down his charities, is not the sort of man who is likely to find any very extensive source of economy in the charities which he has hitherto given. As for evasion, I hope the right hon. gentleman and his supporters underrate the public spirit which animates a proportion at any rate of the class which would be most notably affected by the present taxation. And there is for their consolation one great assurance which is worth much more to them than a few millions, more or less, of taxation. It is this--that we are this year taking all that we are likely to need for the policy which is now placed before the country, and which will absorb the energies of this Parliament. And, so far as this Parliament is concerned, it is extremely unlikely, {{in the absence of a}} national calamity, that any further demand will be made upon them, or that the shifting and vague shadows of another impending Budget will darken the prospects of improving trade.|$|E
