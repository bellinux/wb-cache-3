5000|$|It {{has also}} been speculated that {{nanotechnology}} may give rise to nanofactories which may have superior capabilities to conventional factories due to their small carbon and physical footprint on the global and regional environment. The miniaturization and transformation of the multi-acre conventional factory into the <b>nanofactory</b> may not interfere with their ability to deliver a high quality product; the product may be of even greater quality {{due to the lack}} of human errors in the production stages. <b>Nanofactory</b> systems may use precise atomic precisioning and contribute to making superior quality products that the [...] "bulk chemistry" [...] method used in 20th century and early 21st currently cannot produce.

30|$|Algae are {{considered}} as significant <b>nanofactories</b> {{and hold a}} huge potential as ecofriendly and cost-effective tools, avoiding toxic, harsh chemicals and the high energy demand required for physiochemical fabrication. In the present review, we have discussed the biosynthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles {{from a variety of}} algae and their toxicity against several pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The proteins, polysaccharides, amines, amino acids, alcohols, pigments, carboxylic acids carbohydrates and sugars have been shown to act as reducing agents.

The results suggest that the functionalized metal nanoparticles may be exploited in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria and fungi. They can also be used in phytomining and sequestering metals from waste disposals by redox process.|$|R
