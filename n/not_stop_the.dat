5|$|Despite {{their strong}} first half {{up to that}} point, Bolton went a goal behind in the 37th minute.

5|$|Once {{again the}} Byzantines' {{military}} power was depleted and Andronicus III {{was forced into}} diplomacy as his grandfather was before him; {{in return for the}} safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would be paid to the Ottomans. Unfortunately for the Byzantine Empire, this did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{government}} confiscated {{portions of}} land {{owned by the}} landed gentry {{in order to raise}} revenue for these projects, an act which caused dissension and loss of loyalty amongst leading members of Song society but did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Song's defensive preparations.

Pitigliano's death in January had left Andrea Gritti {{in command of}} the Venetian forces; although Maximilian failed to reinforce Louis, the French army was nonetheless sufficient to drive the Venetians from Vicenza by May. Gritti garrisoned Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco-Imperial army, but Louis, more concerned by the death of his advisor, the Cardinal d'Amboise, abandoned his plans for a siege.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, Neoguri (Ambo) brought heavy rainfall to many {{portions of the}} Philippines, including even Metro Manila. In Cebu City, the precipitation caused flooding, which forced 62people to evacuate their houses. In the Camotes Islands, rough waves capsized a motorboat with six passengers; five were rescued, with the other reported missing. But the storm at least alleviated {{for a few days}} the heat that has been experienced over Luzon from the past weeks. However, the storm did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Palarong Pambansa (National Games in the Philippines) which was held in Puerto Princesa City in Palawan, one of the areas said by PAGASA to see stormy weather.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this moment}} that the timely arrival of the Dutch General Chassé turned the tide in favour of the Anglo-allied army.Chassé's {{relatively}} fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain Krahmer de Bichin. The battery opened a destructive fire into the 1st/3rd Grenadiers' flank. This still did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade (Colonel Hendrik Detmers) to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet; the French grenadiers then faltered and broke. The 4th Grenadiers, seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves, now wheeled right about and retired.|$|E

5|$|The king, while Catholic, {{was very}} {{tolerant}} {{and did not}} support the more aggressive policies of the Counter-Reformation. When he took power, the Senate of Poland had 6 Protestant members; {{at the time of his}} death, it had 11. Despite his support for religious tolerance, he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the Union of Brest split.

Tempers ran high among Texas players, and Texas defender Stoney Clark was ejected from the game after throwing the football at a Virginia Tech player following {{the conclusion of a}} play. Texas was assessed two personal-foul penalties, which advanced the ball to the Texas 31-yard line and gave Virginia Tech a first down. Tech continued to run down the clock with rushing plays, and the Hokies brought in freshman backup quarterback Al Clark to supervise the game's final plays.

5|$|By 01:00 on 14 May, a {{pontoon bridge}} had been erected over which {{elements}} of the 1st Panzer Division began crossing the Meuse into the bridgeheads. General Marcel Têtu, commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces ordered an air strike against the pontoon bridge. Between 15:00 and 16:00 Allied bombers and fighters attacked the bridge. During this attack, Strachwitz organized the traffic across the bridge and ensured delivery of the anti-aircraft ammunition to help fend off the aerial attack, which inflicted only minor damage and did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> German advance. Panzer-Pionierbataillon 37 and Sturm-Pionierbataillon 43 ran into enemy tanks at Chéhéry and Panzer-Brigade I into French tanks at Bulson. More than 70 French tanks were left destroyed on the battlefield. While Kirchner ordered the bulk of 1st Panzer Division to keep heading west, French General Charles Huntziger ordered elements of his IIe Armée to protect the heights of Stonne, south of Sedan. This dissipated his forces and the French resistance was broken near Vendresse.|$|E
5|$|Discontent {{crystallised}} into {{a wave of}} uprisings and rioting {{known as}} the Small Revolution (Kleine Revolutie) of 1787. The revolution was suppressed by levying the civil militias but it alarmed the Governors-General and opposition grew. The Small Revolution proved that the Austrian army was insufficient on its own to keep order without some popular support. The allegiance of the civil militias, who were already beginning to call themselves Patriots (Patriotten), was uncertain. Fearing {{for the security of}} the regime, the Governors-General temporarily suspended the reforms without the Emperor's permission on 20 May 1787. They invited all aggrieved parties to express their opposition and grievances in petitions but this merely inflamed the regime's critics. The Emperor himself was furious and recalled his minister, Ludovico, Count di Belgiojoso. Alarmed by the level of unrest, Joseph eventually agreed to repeal his reforms to the judicial system and governance but left his clerical reforms in place. He hoped that, by removing the grievances of the states and middle classes, the opposition would become divided and would be easily suppressed. He also appointed a new Minister Plenipotentiary to oversee the province. The concession did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> opposition growing, inspired and funded by the Catholic clergy, which became especially notable at the University of Leuven.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, Rockefeller renewed {{the push}} for a parkway along the New Jersey Palisades, and teamed with {{ultimate}} PIP planner, Robert Moses, to establish and design the parkway. The plan originally {{was to have the}} PIP stretch from the Garden State Parkway, along the Hudson River, to the George Washington Bridge, and then north along its present-day route ending at the Bear Mountain Bridge. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later. Construction was delayed twice due to material shortages, but that did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> PIP from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s. The route was completed in New Jersey in 1957, and on August28, 1958, the final piece of the PIP was completed between exits5 and9 in southern Rockland County.|$|E

5|$|Grant was {{president}} during the Gilded Age, {{a time of}} massive industrial wealth, railroad speculation, and extravagance that fueled unethical behavior and influence in government offices. Although Grant was not personally involved in scandal, multiple corruption charges swept through his administration, clouding Grant's historical reputation. Grant was greatly trusting of men involved in speculation, particularly wealthy Gilded Age tycoons, loyally defending his corrupt cabinet or appointees whom he believed were innocent. Grant's failure was in his poor selection of cabinet officers and how he responded to their downfalls. Grant did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> guilty parties prosecutions, but was often insistent about having them prosecuted. His political enemies, outraged over the scandals, were eager to discredit Reconstruction, and the moral integrity of his administration. No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock, who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations. Historians debate how effective he was at halting corruption.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, marine {{biologist}} Doc is already at work in his one-man Western Biological Laboratory, getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in. Suzy is fully aware {{of what kind of}} a place it is.|$|E
5|$|Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine died in June 1717. Anna Maria Luisa {{returned}} home in October 1717, bringing with her vast treasures.

That did <b>not</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> two ladies from quarrelling, {{as was his}} intention. Cosimo discontinued hunting following an accident in January 1717. He accidentally shot, and killed, a man. He was so distraught, that he wished to be tried by the Knights of the Order of Saint Stephen. The state of the Grand Duchy reflected the decay of its ruler; in a 1718 military review, the army numbered less than 3000 men, {{some of whom were}} infirm, and aged 70. The navy composed of three galleys, and the crew 198. In September 1721, the Grand Duchess died; instead of willing her possessions to her children, as prescribed by the 1674 agreement; they went to the Princess of Epinoy.|$|E
