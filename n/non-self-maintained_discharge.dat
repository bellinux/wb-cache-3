40|$|A {{volumetric}} {{glow discharge}} at hightened pressures with the non-self-maintained ionization of gas by {{a beam of}} quick electrons at cryogeneous temperatures in nitrogen and mixture CO:N* 002 = 1 : 9 is considered in the paper aiming at the efectiveness investigation of the vibratory excitation of nitrogen molecules and carbon monooxide. The stability investigation of the combustion and glow of a cryogeneous <b>non-self-maintained</b> <b>discharge</b> is also {{the aim of the}} paper. As a result the dependence of the effectiveness of the vibratory escitation on the value of a reduced electric field has been determined, and at cryogeneous temperatures - for the first time. Mechanisms of the instability development have been established. The nitrogen afterglow has been detected and investigated for the first time. Main processes of the formation and excitation of cyan molecules have been established. The paper results may find their field of application in physics of low-temperature plasmaAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} the mathematical model of high-voltage low-pressure electron-ion {{system with a}} cold cathode and a pulse plasma ion generator disposed behind an anode. The model is based on kinetic equations describing time dynamics of ionization processes in the plane electrode gap with participation of electrons, ions and neutral species after ion charge exchange, as well as electrode emission processes, including reflection of atoms from cathode and electrons from anode. Numerical calculations allowed revealing and studying regimes of non-self-maintained and self-maintained discharges initiated by pulse injection of ions from the anode at gas pressures, accordingly, below and above some critical value. Continuously operating ion generator is needed to maintain the <b>non-self-maintained</b> <b>discharge.</b> The ion generator may be switched off after initiating the self-maintained discharge but duration of transient process of establishing this discharge can be shorted by increase of injected ion current density and injection pulse duration. Velocity and energy distributions of flows of high-energy particles going to the electrodes and time dynamics of variation of these flows are determined in different sections of the electrode gap. The obtained data is used for developing pulse electron and ion sources {{as well as of}} devices for thermo-ion deposition of materials in particular for manufacturing electromagnetic metamaterials. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????????-?????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ? ???????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????, ????????????? ?? ??????. ?????? ???????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ?????????, ??????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ? ???????? ??????????, ????? ? ????????? ????? ??????????? ????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ?? ??????????, ??????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ?? ?????? ? ?????????? ?? ?????. ????????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????????? ? ???????????????? ????????, ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ????? ?? ??????? ????? ??? ????????? ???? ?????????????? ???? ? ???? ?????????? ???????????? ????????. ??? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????. ????????? ????? ????? ????????? ????? ????????????? ???????????????? ???????, ?? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ????? ??????? ????? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ???? ????????????? ????? ? ???????????? ???????? ????????. ?????????? ????????????? ?? ????????? ? ???????? ??????? ?????????????????? ??????, ?????? ?? ?????????, ? ???????? ????????? ???????? ???? ??????? ?? ??????? ? ????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????????. ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ??????????, ? ????????? ??? ???????????? ???????????????? ??????????????...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the influence of the composition of a plasma-forming gas (N 2, Ar, He) on nitriding of VT 1 - 0 grade titanium (0. 25 %-Fe; 0. 1 %-Si; 0. 2 %-O) and commercial 40 X steel (0. 4 %-C; 1. 0 %-Cr) in the plasma of a <b>non-self-maintained</b> glow <b>discharge</b> with a large hollow cathode. It is shown that the efficiency of nitriding of 40 X steel weakly depends on the composition of the plasma-forming gas mixture, whereas nitriding of VT 1 - 0 titanium in a helium-nitrogen mixture leads to a noticeable increase in the microhardness of the specimenâ€™s surface in comparison with nitriding in an argon-nitrogen gas mixtureyesBelgorod State Universit...|$|R
