5000|$|The Elders' Journal {{contains}} {{a number of}} letters from church leaders, minutes from church conferences as well as <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> and obituaries.

50|$|If one of {{the people}} wanting to marry is subject to {{immigration}} control, <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> can only be done at a designated register office, which both parties must attend together. Marriage must be between two people neither of whom is in a Civil Partnership or separate marriage (foreign divorces are generally recognised; but an existing foreign marriage would prevent a marriage in the UK as this would be treated as bigamy).|$|E
50|$|Marriage in Northern Ireland {{is legally}} defined as {{between a man}} and a woman. Civil {{partnerships}} became available to same-sex couples in December 2005 and grant rights and responsibilities identical to civil marriage. There are residency conditions that have to be met prior to marriage. If one of the parties wishing to marry is subject to immigration control, <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> can only be given at a register office, which both parties must attend together. The marriageable age is 17 with consent but 18 otherwise. Marriage must be between two otherwise unmarried people (foreign divorces are generally recognised, but existing foreign polygamous marriages prevent a marriage as this would be treated as bigamy).|$|E

50|$|The protagonist, Su Huaiqin {{is a woman}} {{born into}} a fatherless household. She was {{considered}} a xiaojie (someone of poor standing), before she married Xu Chongxian. Her new husband is from a big feudal family. He is called Shaoye (young master), by the family servants. The novel begins with an official <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> their <b>marriage</b> in a newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|He {{is known}} to have collaborated with his father in the {{completion}} of large assignments. He worked in Danzig from 1592 to 1595 where his father was employed in the design of defensive works. [...] He worked in Prague from 1596 to 1599 where he painted the ceilings and the reception rooms of Emperor Rudolf II’s castle. [...] He was active in Amsterdam from 1599 to 1617. There is a record of a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> between him and Mayken Godelet issued in Amsterdam and dated 24 April 1601. In 1649 she was buried in Nieuwe Kerk. The year her husband died is uncertain; it could be 1630 when his designs for furniture were published or later, but before 1636.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to prove}} that the {{registration}} of marriages is one of the requirements of marriage, which means unregistered marriagesare illegal. The basic reasonsfor this conclusion is two-fold. First, the Prophet Muhammad had commanded public notices of marriage (walimahan, iklan). The purpose of this public notice is to secure the rights of spouses so that couples can achieve the purpose of marriage: a harmonious family. In fact, public notices are means to achieve this. Thus a contextual change is possible to changes the legal form as a mean to achieve the objectives of the marriage. Registration of marriage (marriage certificate) is a kind of contextualization of the command for the public <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> This contextualization is necessary because it is more effective and efficient to guarantee the achievement of a harmonious family as the ultimate goal of marriage. Second, Indonesian citizens must obey the rules of registration of marriage as set out and defined in the Act no. 1 of 1974 on Marriage [Marriage Act], as it is an implication of the obligation to obey the government (uli al-amr). Therefore, Indonesian citizens who do not comply with the contents of Marriage Act is disobeying the government. Furthermore, the Indonesian government has the right to make rules for creating welfare for the community (mashlah), being Indonesian citizens. Consequently, citizens are required to obey rules set by the Indonesian government for the whole welfare of community, and {{it is clear that the}} purpose of registration of marriage is for welfare of Indonesian citizen...|$|E

60|$|On the Monday morning, Mrs. Westerfield and her {{faithful}} James {{had their}} first quarrel. She took the liberty of reminding {{him that it was}} time to give <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> at the church, and to secure berths in the steamer for herself and her son. Instead of answering one way or another, James asked how the Expert was getting on.|$|R
60|$|But {{he had two}} merits, {{when his}} temper {{was in a state}} of repose. He knew when he was beaten; and he {{thoroughly}} appreciated the value of the diamonds. When Mrs. Westerfield saw him again, on the next day, he appeared with undeniable claims on her mercy. <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> had been received at the church; and a cabin had been secured for her on board the steamer.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not easy}} to say. The barren {{information}} which I had received from my darling was all the information that I possessed. Nugent had unflinchingly carried his cruel deception to its end. He had falsely given <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> his <b>marriage</b> at the church, in his brother's name; and he was now in London, falsely obtaining his Marriage License, in his brother's name also. So much I knew of his proceedings--and no more.|$|R
50|$|In many {{countries}} {{there is a}} requirement to give <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> an impending <b>marriage</b> to the community so that objections to the marriage can be raised. This custom was in place as a mechanism to necessitate the consent of parents {{as well as the}} wider community.|$|R
6000|$|They started {{arm in arm}} for {{the office}} aforesaid, no witness {{accompanying}} them except the Widow Edlin. The day was chilly and dull, and a clammy fog blew through the town from [...] "Royal-tower'd Thame." [...] On {{the steps of the}} office there were the muddy foot-marks of people who had entered, and in the entry were damp umbrellas Within the office several persons were gathered, and our couple perceived that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was just in progress. Sue, Jude, and the widow stood in the background while this was going on, Sue reading the <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> on the wall. The room was a dreary place to two of their temperament, though to its usual frequenters it doubtless seemed ordinary enough. Law-books in musty calf covered one wall, and elsewhere were post-office directories, and other books of reference. Papers in packets tied with red tape were pigeon-holed around, and some iron safes filled a recess, while the bare wood floor was, like the door-step, stained by previous visitors.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} to Alexander Murray and Catherine Robertson. He married Margaret Allan Grant and had a son and two daughters.

5000|$|Following the Supreme Judicial Court's (SJC) {{decision}} in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health (2003) as the May 17, 2004, date {{set for the}} legalization <b>of</b> same-sex <b>marriage</b> in Massachusetts approached, the state Department of Public Health (DPH) altered its <b>marriage</b> license form, <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> Intention <b>of</b> <b>Marriage,</b> to ask applicants where they intended to reside once married, citing the 1913 law in the form's instructions to clerks. Even before the first same-sex marriages occurred, the 1913 was a focus of debate and national press coverage. Governor Romney took the position that [...] "Massachusetts should not become the Las Vegas of same-sex marriage".|$|R
5000|$|The Gazette printed news of Europe, {{what the}} royalty had worn {{at the last}} formal event, news <b>of</b> the colony, <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> births, deaths, <b>marriages</b> and estate auctions, and advertisements, {{including}} those for runaway slaves.

6000|$|Two {{or three}} of the company {{accepted}} her challenge, giving the full names of their sisters or brothers; and, in three cases out of five, my witch was able to supply either the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> their <b>marriage</b> or some other like published circumstance. In the instance of Charlie Vere, it is true, she went wrong, just at first, though only in a single small particular; it was not Charlie himself who was gazetted to a sub-lieutenancy in the Warwickshire Regiment, but his brother Walter. However, the moment she was told of this slip, she corrected herself at once, and added, like lightning, [...] "Ah, yes: how stupid of me! I have mixed up the names. Charles Cassilis Vere got an appointment {{on the same day}} in the Rhodesian Mounted Police, didn't he?" [...] Which was in point of fact quite accurate.|$|R

Oh, if you knew----!" [...] Her rising agitation stifled her utterance at the moment. [...] "I mustn't waste the precious minutes; I must get back before Oscar returns," [...] she went on, rallying again. [...] "Oh, my old friend, you are never at a loss; you always know what to do!

50|$|Gretna's {{principal}} {{claim to fame}} arose in 1753 when an Act of Parliament, Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act, was passed in England, which provided, among other things, that if both parties to a marriage were not at least 21 years old, consent to the marriage had to be given by the parents. This Act did not apply in Scotland, which allowed boys to marry at 14 and girls at 12, with or without parental consent. In addition, the Act required procedures that gave <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> an impending <b>marriage</b> to the community. As a result, many elopers fled England, and the first Scottish village they reached was often Gretna. With {{the construction of a}} new highway, Gretna Green became easier to reach, and Gretna's appeal as an elopement destination waned.|$|R
5000|$|The Marriage Amendment Act, 1970 {{abolished}} {{the requirement that}} banns <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> or <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> intention to marry be published or that a special marriage licence be obtained.
