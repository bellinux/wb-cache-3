25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, rats did not {{directly}} start {{the spread of the}} bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a <b>new</b> <b>person,</b> and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.|$|E
25|$|The veneration of nats also shares similar {{practices}} with Buddhism. In Buddhism, offerings are extremely common and expected. Shrines and temples, {{in which these}} offerings are to be made, are seen in both Burmese folk religion and Buddhism. In both the faiths, many different statues of various deities {{can also be seen}} around the house. Burmese folk religion differs dramatically in the concept of a soul. Buddhism does not believe in a soul that leaves after one dies, but rather a consciousness that is transferred to a <b>new</b> <b>person</b> (consciousness is reborn in another). In contrast, Burmese folk religion holds that the soul can leave the body it inhabits. This soul is often depicted {{in the form of a}} butterfly called a leppya. The act of the soul leaving the host often happens in dreams, or when someone is sick or dying. If one is awoken in the middle of their dream, it is said that their soul might not be back to them yet. If a host tries to live without its soul it will die. When someone is dying, butterfly hunts are often held to try to recapture the soul that has wondered off.|$|E

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s times, {{research}} and common knowledge have substantiated that pastors and clergy persons experience {{an alarming rate}} of divorce, substance abuse, and other related issues resulting in mental and emotional burn-outs. This rate can be attributed among clergy to many factors, and these factors may continue to rise unless effective corrective actions are taken to include pastoral care and counseling as an instructional component to the teaching and assessment process for <b>new</b> <b>persons</b> entering the African Methodist Episcopal (A.

As a whole, empirical research has proven that clergy stress and burnout are multiphasic because of the spiritual and secular demands and expectations from others. The primary purpose of this project is to enhance the present Board of Examiner 2 ̆ 7 s process in southwest Georgia to include a pastoral care and counseling component in its teaching and assessment process for <b>new</b> <b>persons</b> entering the A. M. E. ministry because the current Board of Examiner 2 ̆ 7 s process {{does not include the}} benefits and use of Pastoral Care and Counseling in its seventeen week training program in the preparation of ministry to men and women for ministry. This project has created a Demographic, Pre and Post Test Survey of <b>new</b> <b>persons</b> entering the A. M. E. ministry in Southwest Georgia, developed a Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s Instructional and Lesson Plan which includes the history of Pastoral Care and Counseling, various Vignette Case Studies, and most importantly this project developed a method of approaching a parishioner/client in an attitude and modality of acceptance. The emphasis will be on the {{need to take care of}} oneself in the ministry and to recognize when there is a need to solicit professional help from a specialist. Plans, after this project, will also include a 2 ̆ 7 <b>new</b> <b>persons</b> 2 ̆ 7 psychological assessment test for incoming ministers with a continued efforts to reduce or avert the ever-increasing rate of divorce, substance abuse, and mental and emotional burnout among clergy. The methods used in this project will be qualitative and quantitative in a case study format. This project did impact and produce the following results: (1) It did permit a pastoral care and counseling component in the teaching and assessment process for <b>new</b> <b>persons</b> entering the A. M. E. ministry. (2) The Bishop, the Dean, and the Board of Examiners realized the benefits of Pastoral Care and Counseling as an 2 ̆ 7 equipping tool 2 ̆ 7 for persons entering the ministry and included it in their lesson plans for 2004. (3) <b>New</b> <b>persons</b> in ministry learned about Pastoral Care and Counseling and were more appreciative of a time for renewal, reflections.

2500|$|To Pope Paul VI, as with {{of all his}} predecessors, marital {{relations}} are {{much more than a}} union of two people.
