25|$|When East Asian {{names are}} transliterated into the Latin alphabet, some people prefer to {{convert them to}} the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family <b>name</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> letters. To avoid confusion, some always write a family <b>name</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> letters, {{especially}} when writing for an international audience. This habit is commonly used in the international language Esperanto. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).|$|E

50|$|Armand Mevis and Linda van Deursen {{redesigned}} {{the logo}} and visual {{identity of the}} museum in 2012, which was gradually unveiled with its re-opening on 23 September 2012. Mevis and van Deursen had previously designed the graphic identity of the temporary Stedelijk program from 2010 to 2012. The main aspect of the new logo is a large sans-serif S that is composed of {{the letters of the}} museum's <b>name</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> letters. The typeface used is Union, a hybrid of Helvetica and Arial, created by Czech typographer Radim Peško in 2009. Union is used for all of the museum's interior and exterior signage and additional materials and resources. The new logo visual identity was controversial at first, especially since Wim Crouwel's original logo was extremely admired and influential.|$|E

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the Chicago order {{came up in the}} eighth inning, and Koufax struck out all three of them. Banks, who struck out for the third time, never made contact the entire game. The Dodgers went three up and three down in {{the bottom half of the}} inning. Koufax again struck out the side in the ninth inning to secure the perfect game. Not until the San Francisco Giants' Chris Heston no-hit the New York Mets on June 9, 2015 would another pitcher {{complete}} a no-hitter by striking out the final three batters he faced, and the next no-hitter whose pitcher struck out all three batters he faced in the ninth inning wouldn't come until August 30 of the same season, when the Cubs' Jake Arrieta no-hit the Dodgers—a game also played at Dodger Stadium. Koufax also struck out at least one batter in all nine innings, the only perfect game pitcher to do so to date. Not until Nolan Ryan in [...] would a no-hit pitcher strike out at least one batter in all nine innings, doing so in the first of his seven career no-hitters; Koufax's catcher, Jeff Torborg, would catch that no-hitter as well. As Vin Scully, the Dodgers' long time play-by-play announcer, commented at the end: [...] "And Sandy Koufax, whose name will always remind you of strikeouts, did it with a flourish. He struck out the last six consecutive batters. So when he wrote his <b>name</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> letters in the record books, that [...] "K" [...] stands out even more than the O-U-F-A-X." [...] The final out was made by Harvey Kuenn, the same man who made the final out of Koufax's 1963 no-hitter—which had been, appropriately, a ground ball back to Koufax. In the end, Johnson's hit was the only one by either team; the combined total of 1 hit for the entire game is a major league record. Koufax threw 113 pitches during the game, 79 of which were strikes.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} knowledge, {{attitude}} {{and practice of}} prescription writing among interns in medical college. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the interns in a Medical College, after taking approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Participants were asked to write prescription for a common ailment in a given prescription blank page. A structured questionnaire was designed based on new Medical Council of India (MCI) prescription writing pattern to analyse the prescription. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: Among 84 interns, {{most of the participants}} had written the drug by generic name (95. 2 %) and have signed in the prescription sheet (98 %). None of them were aware of the latest prescription writing pattern recommended by Medical Council of India (MCI). The writing of generic <b>name</b> <b>in</b> <b>capital</b> letter was not done by 97. 6 % of interns.     Conclusion: Our study concluded that interns were not aware of new Medical Council of India (MCI) prescription writing pattern. Majority of interns have made errors while writing the prescription. Thus {{there is a need for}} regular formal education regarding prescription writing, before the start of internship. They can be given training under medical education unit regarding the recent updates of prescription writing. </p...|$|E
