50|$|Although {{the method}} of the {{unstructured}} interview allows for social interaction and different modes of communication between the interviewer and interviewee, some maintain {{that it is important}} that interviewers resist the urge to agree, disagree, or give biased probes and encouragement to interviewees so that they do not potentially introduce biased topics. Interviewers must remember to minimize any form of bias within the conversation. This way, the interviewee is able to freely discuss the topic given or their work from their own point of view, typically something the researcher hopes for in their search for information. Others maintain that the interviewer may introduce encouraging nods, expressions and non-directive, neutral probes. From the participant, “They are generally very short, such as ‘Why?’ or ‘Uh, huh’ or ‘That’s interesting.’ The <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview</b> originated in psychotherapy, intending to neutrally probe the respondent’s deepest and most subjective feelings". These acknowledgments such as “yeah,” “right,” “great,” “okay,” and “mhm” show response or influence from the interviewee’s answers can have on interviewer, not through contributions {{to the development of the}} topic but through minimal feedback. If these acknowledgements are not used then the conversation can be seen as problematic. However, at its extremes, these neutral probes may activate repressed feelings that the respondent may or may not know he or she had or was not willing to admit to him or herself originally before the conversation. Typically these probes uncover important issues and topics that can eventually guide future inquiries.|$|E
50|$|An {{unstructured}} interview or <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview</b> is {{an interview}} in which questions are not prearranged. These non-directive interviews {{are considered to be}} the opposite of a structured interview which offers a set amount of standardized questions. The form of the unstructured interview varies widely, with some questions being prepared in advance in relation to a topic that the researcher or interviewer wishes to cover. They tend to be more informal and free flowing than a structured interview, much like an everyday conversation. Probing is seen to be the part of the research process that differentiates the in-depth, unstructured interview from an everyday conversation. This nature of conversation allows for spontaneity and for questions to develop {{during the course of the}} interview, which are based on the interviewees' responses. The chief feature of the unstructured interview is the idea of probe questions that are designed to be as open as possible. It is a qualitative research method and accordingly prioritizes validity and the depth of the interviewees' answers. One of the potential drawbacks is the loss of reliability, thereby making it more difficult to draw patterns among interviewees' responses in comparison to structured interviews. Unstructured interviews are used in a variety of fields and circumstances, ranging from research in social sciences, such as sociology, to college and job interviews. Fontana and Frey have identified three types of in depth, ethnographic, unstructured interviews - oral history, creative interviews (an unconventional interview in that it does not follow the rules of traditional interviewing), and post-modern interviews.|$|E
50|$|Silence, {{being the}} {{apparent}} opposite of speech, is sometimes {{used in the}} method of the unstructured or <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview.</b> It is often suggested that silences may often be seen as awkward and are an enduring feature of human interaction. During more organized and highly structured interviews, questions are given and answered one after another, typically transcribed {{with little or no}} silences evident in between the responses. Oftentimes, {{it is up to the}} interviewer to present their interviewing skills by making sure the conversation does not hold any silences. However, with the fact that the unstructured interview is more like an everyday conversation, silence or the use of silence can be observed as a very important aspect of a natural conversation and in fact current research suggests that being attentive to silences will tell us a lot about how knowledge is constructed. Typically silence is overlooked in qualitative research, keeping in mind that there are multiple meanings involved in the conversation involving the interplay between speech and silence, it can be seen as one of the best types of probes used in interviews. Silences are profoundly meaningful as they can signify a withholding or resistance, can reflect a cultural mode of self-representation, or may represent a topic or idea as unthinkable. Many see the possible utility of silence as a strategic device to enhance data collection, while others argue that silence can be seen to represent failure on the part of the interviewer to ‘draw out’ information from the respondent.|$|E

We are especially interested in different semiotic representations that may constrain the researcher’s understanding of his or her direct perception of phenomena: the researcher as a “poet” or as a “machine. ” It is suggested that these notions may differentially constrain the researcher’s monitoring of the interaction with a participant, and that decisions in this monitoring process can have important implications for the ability of the interviewee to more fully express what it is he or she tries to communicate, and for the process of generating new knowledge. In conclusion, we suggest “poetic” and “mechanistic” approaches to the direct perception of phenomena, though distinct, may nonetheless be understood to complement one another...|$|E

40|$|International audienceObjectives: The great age {{was long}} {{regarded}} as synonymous with wisdom in Africa. Nowadays, {{it is increasingly}} synonymous to: body that breaks down and senile dementia. Dementia is a public health problem in high-income countries and in low-and middle-income-countries. In the latter, where {{more than half of}} people with dementia (PWD) live, the disease is considered as an enigma by informal caregivers (IC) who sometimes abuse them and limit their access to health care because of pejoratives socio-cultural representations. The objective {{of the study was to}} analyze these representations could influence their access to health care and quality of life. Methods: An ethnological study was carried out in three months immersion in urban and rural areas to Congo. The <b>non-directive</b> <b>interviews</b> were conducted in local languages, associated by participant observations to analyze behaviors, gestures, discourses, to record phenomena that an interviewee could intentionally or not, fail to say and to control his statements. All data collected were analyzed at the time of their compilations. All <b>non-directive</b> <b>interviews</b> and participant observations were annotated and then transcribed. Before classifying these interviews into themes, a critical reading was made of them. Results: 36 life stories were conducted among IC. In urban area, 68. 4 % and 26. 4 % of PWD were treated respectively by syncretic church leaders (SCL) and traditional healers (TH). In rural area, 58. 8 % and 29. 4 % of PWD were treated respectively by TH and SCL. Only 5. 3 % of PWD was treated by general practitioner in urban area versus 11. 8 % by nurses in rural area. PWD were considered as possessed of evil spirits or demons, justifying the solicitation of to SCL and TH. The disease isn’t medicalized, the hospital isn’t a priority.

Characterized by new forms and new meanings, the ceremonies of today do not necessarily appear in the same way and in the same places as before. But this does not mean that funeral rituals have disappeared...|$|R

All of the officers interviewed were bound by the same legislation and guidelines with respect to mental health and to policing, described in the theoretical framework of this thesis. Rural and urban perceptions are compared to determine differences in the areas explored: available information, general knowledge, descriptions of incidents, causes of disturbed behaviour, police actions, and interactions with community or health authorities to whom clients may be referred for further mental health interventions. Research method. The thesis compares <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview</b> material for differences in and within themes addressed. Seven interviews, all with male officers, are analyzed.

40|$|Our {{ambition}} was two-fold: {{as a first}} step, {{we approached}} ageing disabled people (PHV) already in a specialised establishment. We assessed how they and the people working with them saw life after 60. Secondly, we assessed the preparation for this stage of life of adults living in their parents’ home. So as to gather {{as much information as}} possible and to encourage maximum discussion, we decided to hold interviews. A <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview</b> was possible with professionals and families, but with PHV, some changes were necessary along with stimulation, reformulation, etc. Interviews were therefore semi-directive. These meetings lasted for about an hour and took place between April 2002 and October 2003. For a faithful dispatch of the information gathered during the interviews, we used a classificatory type content analysis. This work has essentially shown us that the concept of ageing does not feature as part of a PHV’s identity. However, from the age of 30, they regress physically, change psychologically and suffer from social and family isolation even though their need for relationships stays the same. Progress needs to be made with regard to professional training, decisions about and implementation of geriatric guidance and social and medical standards to prepare for and monitor the ageing of disabled people. Information and support for families are areas requiring development. The disability and geriatrics sectors could benefit much from sharing their knowledge and expertise...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{livestock}} productions {{is historically}} linked to local, traditional breeds. Both these production systems and traditional breeds have markedly declined or even disappeared in some areas, {{as a result}} of global trends toward intensification, specialisation and abandonment of marginal areas. More recently, interest in the preservation of livestock biodiversity has been revived. Concern over the livelihood of marginal rural areas and landscape management accompanies the political debate over rare breeds. Parallel to institutional activity, and in many cases as forerunners, social actors have undertaken action to avoid both breed extinction and the loss of pastoralist traditions. In this paper, we present the findings of a qualitative survey of local goat husbandry in Southern France. <b>Non-directive</b> <b>interviews</b> of extension experts and breeders of two local goat breeds, the Rove and the Provençal, revealed a strong link between the breeders’ perception of local breeds/pastoralism and their broader worldview.

40|$|In {{consideration}} of the prevalence and popularity of tattoos among our prison population, I argue that the disciplinary institution and the carceral experience may have an effect upon the function and value of tattoos for the prisoner. My approach to analysis is informed by the application of discourse analysis {{in the work of}} James Messerschmidt on the construction of masculinity, and Michel Foucault on the body of the condemned within the dynamics of the disciplinary institution. Given such insights and theoretical underpinnings, the purpose of this qualitative study is to explore whether the prison and the experience of incarceration has an effect upon the meaning, value and appeal of tattoos among Canadian prisoners, and more specifically, among men serving life sentences. I conducted eight <b>non-directive</b> <b>interviews</b> with incarcerated lifers concerning tattooing and their tattoos. Following the interviews, I undertook a time frame analysis in order to organize and examine the subjects' experiences with tattooing during three different time periods, these being, prior to incarceration, during incarceration, and today. Given the exploratory nature of my study, my research may be more accurately conceptualized as an exercise in logic of discovery rather than an exercise in the logic of verification.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with storytelling {{as a part of}} the folk culture of a fishing community on the north east coast of Newfoundland. The study is based on field work done in the community throughout the summer of 1969 during which I tape recorded oral narratives along with other folklore and folklife material. The principal genre discussed is the personal experience narrative which is an account of the experiences of either the narrator, someone in his kin network, orhis friends. It was found that a large number of community residents communicate in narrative form and that the narratives function to substantiate conversation preceeding the narrativei have a didactic function; function as a means of entertainment and reflect the narrators' and the community's value system. The methods employed in collecting the material were the directive and the <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview</b> techniques and participant observation. Collecting was done mainly among fishermen between fifty and eighty years of age and who, on -the average, had not gone beyond the sixth grade in school. Since the narratives are so much a part of the environment, I give an account of the community culture. The principal things that I deal with are the community's history, economy, education, religion, and social life which includes rites of passage, calendar customs, social events, visiting patterns, and gossip. Information in each of these categories is based primarily on oral reports, narratives and documented materials. After a discussion of the storytelling process in the community, I deal specifically with four male narrators. For each I give biographical information, discuss his repertoire, telling situations, style, and give a sampling of his narratives. The fourth narrator is discussed in more detail than the first three. The narratives of the latter comprise the final chapter in the study, and have been analyzed to show what they tell us about the narrator's style, his value system, and the community culture...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{contributions}} of previous studies, no satisfying answer has been provided to explain why some entrepreneurs decided to exit from entrepreneurship. This question will remain extremely complex and difficult to answer if researchers continue to study this phenomenon using uni-dimensional and/or binary approach. The aim {{of this paper is}} to contribute to a better understanding the complexity of entrepreneurial exit by proposing an integrative and typological framework. This study seeks to provide tow main contributions. First, given the little research integrating in the same studies the individual and firm levels of analysis, the current research propose an integrative theoretical framework based on entrepreneur/new venture dialogic and highlighting the multidimensional, the multiform and the paradoxical aspect of entrepreneurial exit. Second, despite the wide use of cognitive approach in entrepreneurship, only a few studies have used cognitive maps as a tool for understanding the “negative entrepreneurial outcomes”, such as the exit decisions of entrepreneurs. The methodological framework is based on cases studies of four entrepreneurs who have made the entrepreneurial exit decision. Based on cognitive mapping approach, the method used is this paper is divided into three stages. The first stage explores the view of the entrepreneur with regard to his/her exit experience and is based on <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview.</b> The second stage applies the cross-impact “cognitive matrix” in an effort to define the relationship among the concepts gathered during the first stage. In the final stage, the cognitive map composed of concepts and links is analysed in order to identify the root causes of entrepreneurial exit. The findings of this qualitative study show that entrepreneurial exit is not the exclusive consequence of the presence of positive or negative exit reasons, but the immediate result of the interaction of six key dimensions that this research aims to explore, describe and classify. The resulting analytical framework can be used as “visual support” by researchers and professional actors to provide an overall view of the entrepreneurial failure phenomenon, to better analyze its causes, and to build strategies for avoiding tragic and traumatic exit experiences.

Many claim this model teaches necessary XXI century skills for, and when applied correctly can help students learn faster and reach higher levels of learning. The Flipped Classroom is an education model that inverts the traditional classic teacher-centred classroom model upside down, into a student centred structured, where student use digital technology (or not) to learn the material for homework, usually in 10 - 15 minute videos, and use the class time for application of the material, usually using active learning and collaborative learning strategies. The following qualitative research project offers a comprehensive theoretical qualitative exploration of the Flipped Classroom Blended Learning model involving a <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview</b> with ten educational specialists in the Flipped Classroom model, including teachers, professors, and instructional designers who have converted their instruction to this model and who believe this is the future of education.

40|$|This {{study is}} about mobilizing {{resources}} {{in case of}} possibly malarial fever in children aged under  10  years and its consequences {{on the health care}} seeking behavior. The research methods are participative observation and <b>non-directive</b> <b>interviews</b> with  20  households of rural Senegal. All the household?s resources can?t be mobilized to treat a child fever and the lack of monetary availability certainly slows down the health care seeking. Various activities practised in addition to the traditional activities of the inhabitants of the studied area provide more support for effectively handling a fever. The financial management of the children?s health is the responsibility of both father and mother. But the behaviour of the mothers of the most ?destitute? families makes them more efficient in the quick pharmaceutical treatment of their children?s fever.

Presenteeism among nurses has been shown to negatively impact patient care and is associated with higher rates of patient falls and medication errors (Letvak et al., 2012). Presenteeism research in nursing has primarily focused on the employer’s point of view, leaving the perspective of the nurses unheard. The purpose of this phenomenological research study was to uncover a deep understanding of the experience of presenteeism by nurses who manage their own chronic condition while working in a healthcare setting. Participants were nurses with chronic conditions who experienced presenteeism and who, {{at the time of the}} interview, were working at least part time as a nurse in a healthcare setting. Data was collected via audio-recorded interviews. Participants were asked through open-ended <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview</b> questions to tell their story of working as a nurse with a chronic condition. Interpretation of interviews was done by an interpretive team using Heideggerian hermeneutical analysis. The number of interviews needed to reach data saturation determined the number of participants recruited for this study. Study results revealed three patterns and five themes that embody what it means to be a nurse with a chronic condition who experiences presenteeism. The themes identified were blurred boundaries, contributing to the profession, and losing and finding self. The theses included being a patient and being a nurse, proving yourself within the culture of nursing, advocacy, disclosing or withholding, and rewriting your story. The results of this Heideggerian interpretive phenomenological study contribute to nursing science through facilitating an understanding of the meaning of the experience of presenteeism among working nurses with chronic illness. This will have implications for employers of nurses for both policy making and for developing programs that support nurses’ continued contribution to the field throughout the span of their career.

40|$|Trata-se de pesquisa na abordagem qualitativa realizada na cidade de Londrina, Paraná, Brasil, e teve como objetivos compreender a experiência interacional homem-processo saúde-doença de usuários de serviços de urgência e emergência atendidos com crise hipertensiva e propor um modelo teórico representativo dessa experiência. A saturação teórica se configurou mediante a análise da vigésima primeira entrevista do tipo não diretiva, tendo como pergunta de partida: “Conte-me sobre a sua experiência em relação aos cuidados com a sua saúde. ”. As entrevistas foram audiogravadas, transcritas na íntegra e analisadas segundo os passos da Teoria Fundamentada nos Dados, de junho de 2011 a junho de 2012. Da análise das experiências emergiram três subprocessos: concebendo o cuidado à saúde inerente ao feminino: uma fantasia do masculino; aprisionando-se ao papel de homem com superpoderes sobre sua saúde; vivenciando a materialidade da doença nas comorbidades. Do realinhamento dos componentes desses subprocessos originou a categoria central e modelo teórico, denominado “movendo-se entre o fortalecimento e a fragilização do poder como homem de saúde inabalável: o medo do diagnóstico médico imaginado como componente interveniente para a materialidade da doença. ”. Analisando-o à luz do interacionismo Simbólico, verificou-se a necessidade de o indivíduo reconfigurar o seu self, dando a si mesmo a oportunidade de romper com a concepção de homem com superpoderes sobre a sua saúde para poder (re) alinhar-se a comportamentos saudáveis e abandonar o autocontrole de sua saúde sem auxílio de serviços de saúde. A pesquisa corrobora resultados de estudos anteriores, porém o modelo teórico descoberto configura-se em grande contribuição se considerado protótipo tecnológico para profissionais da saúde ajudarem homens a refletirem e se auto-avaliarem, ao interagirem com ele durante ações educativasThis is a {{qualitative}} study {{conducted in the}} city of Londrina, Paraná, Brazil, and it aimed at understanding the interactional experience man-health-disease process of users of urgency and emergency services attended to when facing a hypertensive crisis and at proposing a theoretical model of such experience. Theoretical saturation was configured by analyzing the twenty one <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview</b> with the starting request: Tell me about your experience in relation to your health care. The interviews were audiotaped, fully transcribed and analyzed according to the steps of the Grounded Theory from June 2011 to June 2012. Three sub-processes emerged from the analysis of the experiences: conceiving health care as inherent to females: a male‟s fantasy; being trapped to the role of a man with superpowers over his health; experiencing the materiality of disease comorbidities. The realignment of these sub-components gave origin to the theoretical model and the core category denominated moving between the strengthening and weakening of power as a man of unfailing health: the fear of medical diagnosis imagined as intervenient component for materiality of disease. When examined in light of Symbolic Interactionism, there was the need for the individual to reconfigure his self, giving himself the opportunity to break with the conception of a man with superpowers over his health in order to (re) align with healthy behaviors and abandon the self-control of his disease without help from health care services. The study confirms results from previous investigations, but the theoretical model discovered is configured as great contribution if considered as a technological prototype for health professionals to help men reflect and evaluate themselves when interacting with them during educational activitie...|$|E

Entretanto, atuar no complexo campo da saÃde coletiva exige desse profissional uma revisÃo de sua prÃtica, um pÃr em xeque os pressupostos tradicionais e, sobretudo, uma discussÃo Ãtica que aponte para uma outra atitude frente ao usuÃrio do serviÃo. O cuidado {{assume a}} configuraÃÃo dessa atitude de respeito e de acolhimento do sofrimento do outro, cuja via nÃo mais segue a razÃo, nem a do saber-poder, mas sim a afetaÃÃo e a escuta Ãtica. O objetivo deste estudo Ã compreender os sentidos atribuÃdos pelo psicÃlogo ao cuidado para com o outro em sua prÃtica na instituiÃÃo pÃblica de saÃde localizada em Fortaleza. De carÃter exploratÃrio, este estudo Ã qualitativo, numa perspectiva crÃtico-interpretativa de base fenomenolÃgica e adota como suporte metodolÃgico a hermenÃutica filosÃfica. As informantes foram oito psicÃlogas do quadro funcional da rede estadual de saÃde. O instrumento utilizado foi a entrevista nÃo-diretiva, por facilitar o diÃlogo e a livre exposiÃÃo dos cotidianos. A anÃlise em profundidade dos depoimentos de cada informante evidenciou trÃs eixos temÃticos centrais: a inserÃÃo no campo da saÃde coletiva; a prÃtica do psicÃlogo: saberes e fazeres em jogo; e concepÃÃes sobre a dimensÃo Ãtica do cuidado. QuestÃes relacionadas Ã formaÃÃo acadÃmica, considerada falha quanto Ã discussÃo da saÃde como uma dimensÃo coletiva, Ã falta de experiÃncia anterior no campo da saÃde, ao prÃprio processo de profissionalizaÃÃo e Ãs precÃrias condiÃÃes de trabalho sÃo vivenciadas como dificuldades para a atuaÃÃo do psicÃlogo. Esse ainda se pauta pelo modelo da psicologia clÃnica, de postura individualista e isolada, e pela biomedicina, de acentuada presenÃa no contexto cearense, marcada pela verticalizaÃÃo da assistÃncia e interessada mais no outro como um objeto de intervenÃÃo tÃcnica. Portanto, Ã possÃvel concluir que esse modelo de prÃtica Ã o de maior predominÃncia entre os psicÃlogos deste estudo, os quais, frente ao usuÃrio, assumem a atitude de cuidado como tÃcnica, ajustamento, controle e de anulaÃÃo da diferenÃa. HÃ, contudo, experiÃncias que ultrapassam a postura clÃnica clÃssica e a Ãnfase na perÃcia para dar conta do encontro intersubjetivo, do diÃlogo, do compartilhar de responsabilidades, do compromisso com a dimensÃo sÃcio-cultural e polÃtica do serviÃo de saÃde e, sobretudo, do outro, reconhecido e respeitado como um sujeito, de quem o psicÃlogo precisa se aproximar para oferecer um espaÃo de escuta de seu sofrimento e acolhimento de sua singularidade. The psychologist {{takes up the}} challenge of fitting into the public health services, more precisely into the general non-psychiatric institutions characterized as an specific locus of practice and comprehension of the {{issues related to the}} continuum health-illness. However, acting on the complex field of collective health imposes to this professional a review of his/her practice, a questioning of the traditional presuppositions and, above all, an ethical discussion that leads to another attitude regarding the user of the service. Caring assumes the configuration of this attitude of respect and embracement of the otherâs suffering, whose way does not follow reason any longer, nor the path of knowledge-power, but the affection and the ethical listening. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the meanings attributed by the psychologist to the care for the other in his/her practice in the public health institution in Fortaleza. Having an exploratory character, this study is qualitative, in a critical-interpretative perspective of phenomenological basis, and adopts as methodological underpinning the philosophical hermeneutics. The subjects were eight women-psychologists who are part of the personnel of the public health network. The instrument employed was the <b>non-directive</b> <b>interview,</b> as it facilitates the dialogue and the free expression of the subjectsâ daily living. The in-depth analysis of the accounts of each subject evidenced three central thematic axes: the insertion in the field of public health; the psychologistâs practice: knowing and doing at play; and conceptions on the ethical dimension of care. Issues related to the academic background, considered flawed in what regards the discussion about health as a collective dimension, to the lack of previous experience in the field of health, to the very process of professionalization and to the precarious working conditions, are experienced as difficulties to the psychologistâs practice. This professional, still in line with the clinic psychology model, of individualist and isolated attitude, and with biomedicine, of accentuated presence in the cearense context, marked by the vertical, top-to-bottom character of the hierarchy in charge of the assistance, and interested in the other more as an object of technical intervention. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that this model of practice is the prevalent among the psychologists of this study, who, in face of the user, assume the attitude of care as technique, adjustment, control and nullification of the difference. There are, however, experiences that reach beyond the classic clinic attitude and the emphasis on expertise to manage the intersubjective encounter, the dialogue, the sharing of responsibilities, the committment with the social-cultural and political dimension of the health service and, above all, the other, acknowledged and respected as a subject, whom the psychologist needs to approach in order to provide a space of listening to his/her sufferering and appreciation of his/her singularity...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{subjective}} {{experience of}} young women with breast cancer has some particular features linked {{to the impact of}} the disease and its treatment on their age-related issues (e. g. desire for a child, couple relationship, career management). Despite these specific concerns, no questionnaire currently targets the young breast cancer patient’s quality of life, subjective experience or common problems when facing cancer. This study presents the psychometric validation of an inventory that aimed to measure the impact of breast cancer on the quality of life {{of young women}} (< 45 years of age) with non-metastatic disease. Methods: 546 women aged < 45 years when diagnosed with a non-metastatic breast cancer were recruited in 27 French cancer research and treatment centers. They answered a self-reported questionnaire created from verbatim collected by <b>non-directive</b> <b>interviews</b> carried out with 69 patients in a first qualitative study. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses were conducted in order to obtain the final structure of the scale. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity with quality of life questionnaires currently used (QLQ-C 30 and the QLQ-BR 23 module) were then assessed. Results: The YW-BCI 36 contains 36 items and highlights 8 factors: 1) feeling of couple cohesion, 2) negative affectivity and apprehension about the future, 3) management of child(ren) and of everyday life, 4) sharing with close relatives...|$|R
40|$|In {{communication}} research, {{there has}} been a lack of studies that investigated how people interact with technologies. As technologies become more complex, the issue of usage must also be addressed. Twenty-eight secretaries and support staff were given a word processing test to assess their level of proficiency. Out of this group, four novice and six advanced users were selected for <b>non-directive</b> <b>interviewing.</b> The study found that advanced and novice users shared very different thought worlds about word processing. Additionally, it was found that there were novices who displayed characteristics of advanced users and there were novices who tended to learn new word processing skills only when their work demanded them (minimally-involved novices). A new hypothesis was developed. The notions of advanced-novice users (ANUs) and novice-advanced users (NAUs) were suggested. The ANUs was defined as novices who displayed characteristics of advanced users. The NAUs was defined as experienced users who displayed characteristics of novice users. A Likert scale was constructed to test whether these two notions appeared valid. The results supported the hypothesis. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Communication Studies.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the article is to present the “sound dimension” of Lisbon with {{particular}} regard to multi-ethnic musical wealth, {{which is the result}} of colonial interdependenceof Portuguese-speaking areas, and the immigration reality of contemporary Portugal. It is an attempt to show that this musical heritage can be an alternative to the standard tourist offers in Lisbon. The research showed that the current music offer for visitors of Lisbon is based almost exclusively on fado. The Portuguese capital seems to be lacking a promotional strategy focusing on Lisbon as a multiethnic and intercultural city, the area of convergence of many cultural influences (including music) from different continents (a consequence of both colonial experiences and the presence of immigrants in the post-colonial era). The official channels of the tourist promotion {{of the city and the}} available information is missing references to the concept of “lusophony” (Lusofonia), as the idea of a particular cultural tie and proximity connecting Portugal and its former colonies. Research method: Analysis of existing secondary sources (Polish and foreign scientific literature from the area of cultural tourism, sociology of music and ethnomusicology, press articles, web sites) and the use of primary data collected during field research in Lisbon in the following period of time: November 2014, February 2015, June - July 2015 (ethnographic method, observation, participatory observation, <b>non-directive</b> <b>interviews)</b> ...|$|R
