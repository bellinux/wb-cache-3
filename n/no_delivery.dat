However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but <b>no</b> <b>delivery</b> hoses.|$|E

25|$|On 2 July 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev {{said that}} the refit of the carrier should be {{completed}} {{as soon as possible}} so she could be delivered to India in 2012. On 7 December 2009, Russian sources indicated that final terms had been agreed on, but <b>no</b> <b>delivery</b> date was set. On 8 December 2009, it was reported that India and Russia ended the stalemate over Admiral Gorshkov price deal by agreeing on a price of US$2.2 billion. Moscow was asking for US$2.9 billion for the aircraft carrier, nearly three times the price that was originally agreed between the two sides in 2004. On the other hand, New Delhi wanted the price to be scaled back to US$2.1 billion. Both governments finalised the price of Admiral Gorshkov at US$2.35 billion on 10 March, a day ahead of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's two-day visit to India.|$|E

60|$|A slight {{diversion}} was presently {{created by}} Creedle bringing him a letter. She knew from this that Creedle {{had just come}} from Sherton, and had called as usual at the post-office for anything that had arrived by the afternoon post, of which there was <b>no</b> <b>delivery</b> at Hintock. She pondered on what the letter might contain--particularly whether it were a second refresher for Winterborne from her father, like her own of the morning.|$|E
6000|$|Paul {{made his}} way into Mrs Hurtle's sitting-room and wrote a note for her in pencil. He had come, he said, {{immediately}} on his return from Liverpool, and was sorry to find that she was away for the day. When should he call again? If she would make an appointment he would attend to it. He felt as he wrote this that he might very safely have himself made an appointment for the morrow; but he cheated himself into half believing that the suggestion he now made was the more gracious and civil. At any rate it would certainly give him another day. Mrs Hurtle would not return till late in the evening, and as the following day was Sunday there would be <b>no</b> <b>delivery</b> by post. When the note was finished he left it on the table, and called to Ruby {{to tell her that}} he was going. 'Mr Montague,' she said in a confidential whisper, as she tripped down the stairs, 'I don't see why you need be saying anything about me, you know.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{order that}} the {{advantages}} of the post-office should reach all persons, the delivery of letters should extend not only to towns, but to the country also. In France all letters are delivered free. However remote may be the position of a house or cottage, it is not too remote for the postman. With us all letters are not delivered, but the exceptions refer to distant solitary houses and to localities which are almost without correspondence. But in the United States there is no free delivery, and there is <b>no</b> <b>delivery</b> at all except in the large cities. In small towns, in villages, even in the suburbs of the largest cities, no such accommodation is given. Whatever may be the distance, people expecting letters must send for them to the post-office; and they who do not expect them, leave their letters uncalled for. Brother Jonathan goes out to fish in these especial waters with a very large net. The little fish which are profitable slip through; but the big fish, which are by no means profitable, are caught--often at an expense greater than their value.|$|E
