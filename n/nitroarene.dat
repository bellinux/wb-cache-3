50|$|The {{chemistry}} of organoindium (In) and organothallium (Tl) compounds parallel that of organogallium in many regards. Indium and thallium in oxidation state +1 are more common, {{for example the}} metallocenes cyclopentadienylindium(I) and cyclopentadienylthallium. Trimethylindium {{is important in the}} semiconductor industry. A special thallium feature is electrophilic thallation of arene compounds, reminiscent of mercuration (the group 12 neighbor). A common reagent for this purpose is thallium(III) trifluoroacetate. The intermediate arylthallium bisfluoroacetate can be isolated and converted to an aryl halide, aryl cyanide, aryl thiol or <b>nitroarene.</b> An example is the iodation of para-xylene.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{begins by}} the addition of the Grignard reagent (2) onto the <b>nitroarene</b> (1) to form intermediate 3. Intermediate 3 spontaneously decomposes to form a nitrosoarene (4) and a magnesium salt (5). (Upon reaction workup, the magnesium salt will liberate a carbonyl compound (6).) Reaction of the nitrosoarene (4) with a second equivalent of the Grignard reagent (2) forms intermediate 7. The steric bulk of the ortho group causes a 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangement forming the intermediate 8. Cyclization and tautomerization give intermediate 10, which will react with a third equivalent of the Grignard reagent (2) to give a dimagnesium indole salt (12). Reaction workup eliminates water and gives the final desired indole (13).|$|E

Tetracyclic <b>nitroarenes</b> are thought to be the most mutagenic compounds in the Salmonella test system, and some are carcinogenic in rats and mice. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} mutational <b>nitroarenes</b> produced mostly DNA damage, which is subject to recombination repair in the rec assay system using Bacillus subtilis. <b>Nitroarenes</b> in the environment seem to be ubiquitous; the majority of the compounds are emitted directly from diesel emissions, kerosene heaters, and gas and liquefied-gas burners or heaters.

40|$|The <b>nitroarene</b> dioxygenases are in {{the class}} of Rieske iron-containing oxygenases that {{incorporate}} atmospheric oxygen into substrates via electrophilic attack on the substrate. In their native role, the <b>nitroarene</b> dioxygenases start degradative pathways by hydroxylat-ing nitro-substituted, and adjacent unsubstituted carbons of nitroaromatic compounds. The reaction yields the corresponding nitro-cis-cyclohexadienediol, which is unstable and spontaneously re-aromatizes to form a catechol and nitrite. In bacterial metabolism, the specificity of the hydroxylation determines subsequent steps in degradation pathways. Experiments were done to find whether the specificity could be exploited to direct the hydroxylation of multiply substituted aromatic substrates and thereby produce novel catechols. Recombinant strains carrying genes for <b>nitroarene</b> dioxygenases were used for transformation of various substituted nitroaromatic compounds. The reactions were analyzed using HPLC to track substrate consumption and product formation, then GC–MS and NMR to identify the reaction products. A number of substituted catechols were obtained using the recombinant biocatalysts. The nitro-substituted carbon was the primary site for dioxygenase hydroxylation. When substrates included nitro and halogen substituents, the halogen-substituted positions were also targeted, but less frequently than the nitro-substituted site. The production of catechols was limited in batch fermentations, likely due to toxicity of the quinones that result from air oxidation of catechols. The <b>nitroarene</b> dioxygenases will serve as catalysts for direct synthesis of highly substituted catechols, however, the reaction conditions must be engineered to overcome product toxicity and allow sustained accumulation of catecholic products.

40|$|The {{gas phase}} {{selective}} hydrogenation {{of a series}} of nitroarenes (nitrobenzene, p-chloronitrobenzene, p-bromonitrobenzene, p-nitroaniline, p-nitrotoluene, p-nitrophenol and p-nitroanisole) has been examined over Au/TiO 2 (0. 3 % w/w Au, mean Au particle size = 3. 9 nm). Compensation behavior is demonstrated with an associated isokinetic temperature (T-iso) of 558 +/- 32 K. We account for this response in terms of the selective energy transfer (SET) model where the occurrence of resonance between catalyst and reactant vibrations generates the activated complex. An analysis of the stepwise variation of the activation energies has identified a critical vibrational frequency of 853 cm(- 1), which is close (+/- 2 cm(- 1)) to the reference value for nitro-group (in-plane symmetric O-N-O bending and stretching) vibrations. Application of SET suggests activation of weakly adsorbed <b>nitroarene</b> (at the support or metal/support interface) by excitation of the nitro-group via IR radiation from a strongly adsorbed surface <b>nitroarene</b> component. The excited <b>nitroarene</b> is then attacked by reactive hydrogen supplied by the Au sites to generate the respective aromatic amine with 100 % selectivity. Agreement of the SET predicted T-iso with the experimental value requires the incorporation of a term due to C-N torsional entropy resulting from distortion of the O-N-O plane...|$|E
40|$|N-Oxidation and nitroreduction {{to yield}} N-hydroxyarylamines are {{metabolic}} steps that are {{crucial for the}} genotoxic properties of aromatic amines and <b>nitroarenes,</b> respectively. N-Hydroxyarylamines can form adducts with DNA, tissue proteins, and the blood proteins albumin and hemoglobin in a dose-dependent manner. The determination of hemoglobin adducts is {{a useful tool for}} biomonitoring exposed populations. We have established the hemoglobin binding index (HBI) [(mmole compound/mole Hb) /(mmole compound/kg body weight) ] of several aromatic amines and <b>nitroarenes</b> in female Wistar rats. Incorporating values obtained by other researchers in the same rat strain, the logarithm of hemoglobin binding (log HBI) was plotted against several physicochemical parameters and against calculated electronic descriptors of <b>nitroarenes</b> and arylamines. Most arylamines and <b>nitroarenes</b> form hydrolyzable (e. g., sulfinamide) adducts with hemoglobin in rats. The amount of hemoglobin binding decreases with the oxidizability of the arylamines, except for compounds that are substituted with halogens in ortho or meta position. For halogen-substituted arylamines, the amount of hemoglobin binding is directly proportional to the pKa. Hemoglobin binding of <b>nitroarenes</b> increases with the reducibility of the nitro group. The structure activity relationships (SAR) for hemoglobin binding of <b>nitroarenes</b> and arylamines are comparable. The SAR found for hemoglobin binding were compared with the SAR found in the literature for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and cytotoxicity of arylamines and <b>nitroarenes.</b> In general, the mutagenicity or carcinogenicity of arylamines increases with their oxidizability. This first set of data suggests that the levels of hemoglobin binding, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity of arylamines are not determined by the same electronic properties of the compounds, or not by these properties alone.

40|$|Time-dependent {{oxidation}} of η 6 -alkylaniline-η 5 -cyclopentadienyliron hexafluorophosphates, 17 – 32, {{allows for}} the preparation of nitrobenzene complexes with alkyl 33 – 48 or keto 49 substituents. Alkylnitroarene complexes are prepared by the oxidation of their corresponding aniline complexes with H 2 O 2 in CF 3 CO 2 H for 20 min. An increase in the reaction time to 24 h gives rise to <b>nitroarene</b> complexes with keto substituents in lower yields. The use of nitroarenes as starting materials in the synthesis of alkanoates is of importance since it {{allows for the}} preparation {{of a large number}} of this class of compounds with a variety of alkyl substituents. Two different approaches have been utilized to allow for the synthesis of alkanoates. The first approach involves nucleophilic aromatic substitution of alkylnitrobenzene complexes with ethyl alkylacetoacetates followed by demetallation to give the alkanoates. This methodology allows for the preparation of these esters with a variety of alkyl substituents in either the meta or para positions. Another route outlines the reaction of phenylsulfonylacetonitrile with <b>nitroarene</b> complexes to prepare alkanoic acid precursors with alkyl substituents in the ortho, meta and para positions. The preparation of a larger pool of <b>nitroarene</b> complexes clearly demonstrates the advantage of using the cyclopentadienyliron arene complexes in the synthesis of alkanoates or their precursors, arylated phenylsulfonylacetonitriles, over traditional synthetic routes...|$|E

40|$|The electron-withdrawing nitro substituents of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) {{make the}} {{aromatic}} ring highly resistant to oxidative transformation. The typical biological transformation of TNT involves reduction {{of one or}} more of the nitro groups of the ring to produce the corresponding amine. Reduction of a single nitro substituent of TNT to an amino substituent increases the electron density of the aromatic nucleus considerably. The comparatively electron-dense nuclei of the aminodinitrotoluene (ADNT) isomers would be expected to be more susceptible to oxygenase attack than TNT. The hypothesis was tested by evaluating three <b>nitroarene</b> dioxygenases for the ability to hydroxylate the ADNT isomers. The predominant reaction was dioxygenation of the ring to yield nitrite and the corresponding aminomethylnitrocatechol. A secondary reaction was benzylic monooxygenation to form aminodinitrobenzyl alcohol. The substrate preferences and catalytic specificities of the three enzymes differed considerably. The discovery that the ADNT isomers are substrates for the <b>nitroarene</b> dioxygenases reveals the potential for extensive bacterial transformation of TNT under aerobic conditions...|$|E

40|$|Finely {{control of}} product {{selectivity}} {{is an essential}} issue in organic chemical production. In the synthesis of functionalized anilines via reduction of the corresponding nitroarenes, {{the challenge is to}} selectively reduce only the nitro group in the presence of other reducible functional groups in <b>nitroarene</b> molecules at a high reaction rate. Normally, the <b>nitroarene</b> is reduced stepwise through a series of intermediates that remain as byproducts, increasing the aniline synthesis cost. Here we report that alloying small amounts of copper into gold nanoparticles can alter the reaction pathway of the catalytic reduction under visible-light irradiation at ambient temperature, allowing nitroaromatics to be transformed directly to anilines in a highly selective manner. The reasons for the high efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction under these comparatively benign conditions as well as the light-excited reaction mechanisms are discussed. This photocatalytic process avoids byproducts, exhibits a high reaction rate and excellent substituent tolerance, and can be used for the synthesis of many useful functionalized anilines under environmentally benign conditions. Switching of the reaction pathway simply by tailoring the bimetallic alloy NPs of the photocatalysts is effective for engineering of product chemoselectivity...|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} of ortho-substituted nitrobenzenes with 3 mol vinylmagnesium halides gives mainly 7 -substituted indoles together with minor {{amounts of the}} aniline from complete reduction of the <b>nitroarene.</b> Under the same experimental conditions, para-substituted nitrobenzenes essentially lead to the corresponding anilines, with indoles being recovered in very low yield. Nitrosoarenes react with 2 mol Grignard reagent to give almost the same product distribution. An accurate analysis of the stoichiometry of the reaction established {{that in the first}} stage of the reaction nitroarenes are attacked at the oxygen atoms and are reduced to nitrosoarenes via enolate elimination. The nitroso derivative can undergo a 1, 2 -addition to give an N-aryl-N-vinylhydroxylamino magnesium salt. Hydrolysis of this intermediate affords hydroxylamine and the carbonyl derivative corresponding to the vinyl Grignard reagent, as proved by the {{reaction of}} nitroarenes with 2 mol Grignard reagent. In the presence of an excess of vinyl magnesium halide, a complete reduction to vinylaniline derivatives, which hydrolyse to aniline, occurs. The effect of the bulkiness of the substituent both in the <b>nitroarene</b> and in the Grignard reagent, the orientation of alkylation and the relative reaction rates of indole and aniline formation suggest that indoles arise via a completely different route: i. e. an inverse 1, 2 -addition to the NO double bond. The N-aryl-O-vinylhydroxylamino magnesium salt intermediate can undergo a [3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement followed by a rapid ring closure.

The enzyme also oxidizes the aromatic rings of mono- and dinitrotoluenes at the nitro-substituted carbon, but {{the basis for}} this specificity is not understood. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify the active site of nitrobenzene dioxygenase, and the contribution of specific residues in controlling substrate specificity and enzyme performance was evaluated. The activities of six mutant enzymes indicated that the residues at positions 258, 293, and 350 in the α subunit are important for determining regiospecificity with <b>nitroarene</b> substrates and enantiospecificity with naphthalene. The results provide {{an explanation for the}} characteristic specificity with <b>nitroarene</b> substrates. Based on the structure of nitrobenzene dioxygenase, substitution of valine for the asparagine at position 258 should eliminate a hydrogen bond between the substrate nitro group and the amino group of asparagine. Up to 99 % of the mononitrotoluene oxidation products formed by the N 258 V mutant were nitrobenzyl alcohols rather than catechols, supporting the importance of this hydrogen bond in positioning substrates in the active site for ring oxidation. Similar results were obtained with an I 350 F mutant, where the formation of the hydrogen bond appeared to be prevented by steric interference. The specificity of enzymes with substitutions at position 293 varied depending on the residue present.

Reaction over Pd/Al 2 O 3, as a benchmark catalyst (Pd particle size ca. 18 nm), resulted in a composite hydrodechlorination/hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene (as a representative <b>nitroarene)</b> to generate nitrobenzene and aniline. beta-Mo 2 N has been characterized in terms of temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), H- 2 chemisorption/temperature programmed desorption (TPD), BET surface area/pore volume, elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electronic microscopy. Elemental analysis, XRD, SEM and TEM have confirmed the formation of tetragonal beta-Mo 2 N, characterized by an agglomeration of flake-like crystallites. Post-synthesis, the nitride was passivated by contact with 1 % (v/v) O- 2 /He at ambient temperature and XPS analysis has demonstrated the formation of a superficial passivating oxide overlayer without bulk oxidation.
