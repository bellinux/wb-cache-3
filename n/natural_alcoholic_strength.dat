30|$|Following {{the initial}} {{experiments}} with steam distillation, instruments with increased steam power became available showing a larger optimal range independent of specific settings such as distillation time, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> of sample, sample volume or receiver volume (Lachenmeier et al. 2006). In this paper, we introduce {{the use of}} a completely new steam distillation device. The device not only comprises an increased steam power but also a redesigned geometry of the condenser, as well as a larger cooling coil with controllable flow. Based on a method development and validation study, this paper describes the optimized procedure for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> determination using steam distillation.|$|R

25|$|Most bitters contain both {{water and}} alcohol, {{the latter of}} which {{functions}} as a solvent for botanical extracts {{as well as a}} preservative. The <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> of bitters varies widely across different brands and styles.|$|R
30|$|In the {{regulatory}} control of alcoholic beverages, {{the determination of}} the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> is considered as pivotal parameter (Lachenmeier et al. 2010). Sample preparation by distillation followed by some form of density measurement (i.e. pycnometry, electronic densimetry and densimetry using hydrostatic balance) is still considered the gold standard and the reference methodology for determination of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> (European Commission 2000; OIV 2009), even when more rapid and direct methods such as infrared spectroscopy are gaining more and more distribution in routine testing laboratories (López Mahía et al. 1992; Gallignani et al. 1993, 1994 a, b, c; Maudoux et al. 1998; Lachenmeier et al. 2010; Lachenmeier 2007).|$|R
50|$|Under European Union legislation, a {{liqueur wine}} is a {{fortified}} wine that contains 15-22% abv, with Total <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Strength</b> {{no less than}} 17.5%, and that meets many additional criteria. Exemptions are allowed for certain quality liqueur wines.|$|R

5000|$|In the European Union, {{the labels}} of {{beverages}} containing more than 1.2% ABV must state the actual <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> (i.e., show the word [...] "alcohol" [...] or the abbreviation [...] "alc." [...] {{followed by the}} symbol [...] "% vol.").|$|R
50|$|At {{each step}} of the SNIF-NMR analysis, efforts should be made to avoid {{parasite}} isotopic fractionation.

50|$|In Portugal and Spain, reserva is a {{regulated}} term {{controlled by}} law, at least ensuring that reserve wines get some additional ageing. In practice {{it is very}} difficult to regulate quality, so the term primarily deals with ageing and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rice Wine House: In Vietnamese culture, {{rice wine}} is {{typically}} enjoyed with every meal. It is customary {{to invite the}} whole table to drink simultaneously. Most households produce their own rice wine resulting in each batch varying in <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|R

50|$|This {{approach}} {{relies on}} the fact that dissolved sugars and alcohol each affect the density of beer differently. Since sugars are converted to alcohol during the process of fermentation, gravity can be used to estimate the final alcohol. In beer brewing, a distinction is made between the original gravity, the gravity of the wort before fermentation has begun, and the final gravity of the product when fermentation has completed. Since the concentration of sugars is directly proportional to the gravity, the original gravity gives a brewer an idea of the potential <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> of the final product. After fermentation, the differences between the final and original gravities indicates the amount of sugar converted into alcohol, allowing the concentration of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> to be calculated.|$|R
40|$|Cheap licit and artisanal illicit {{spirit drinks}} have been {{associated}} with numerous outbreaks of alcohol poisoning especially with methanol. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of cheap spirit drinks in Kibera slums in Nairobi County, Kenya. The samples consisted of cheap licit spirits (n = 11) and the artisanal spirit drink, ‘chang’aa’, (n = 28). The parameters of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> and volatile composition were used as indicators of quality and were determined using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) respectively. The ranges for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> were 42. 8 – 85. 8 % vol and 28. 3 – 56. 7 % vol for chang’aa and licit spirit drinks respectively, while the pH ranges were 3. 3 – 4. 2 and 4. 4 – 4. 8 for chang’aa and licit spirit drinks respectively. The majority of volatiles were found in artisanal spirits and they included higher alcohols, ethyl esters and carbonyl compounds. The <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> of all the artisanal spirits (100 %) and 91 % of the licit spirits was above the 40 % vol of standard spirits such as vodka. The high ethanol content of the alcohol products was the only element of public health significance in this study...|$|R
50|$|In Brittany, the {{fermentation}} process is begun {{by the addition}} of freshly pressed apple juice. Yeasts can also be used, as in the beer-making process. To reach the required <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength,</b> for a litre of chouchen, approximately a third of a litre of honey is needed.|$|R
50|$|Pump clips are badges {{that are}} {{attached}} to handpumps in pubs to show which cask ales are available.In addition to {{the name of the}} beer served through the pump, they may give other details such as the brewer's name, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> of the beer and serve as advertising.|$|R
25|$|A quick {{estimate}} of the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength,</b> or proof, of the distillate (the ratio of alcohol to water) is often achieved by shaking a clear container of the distillate. Large bubbles with a short duration indicate a higher alcohol content, while smaller bubbles that disappear more slowly indicate lower alcohol content.|$|R
50|$|In October 2013, Boodles Gin was {{released}} in the UK, with a redesigned bottle and an <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> of 80 proof. The botanical recipe for the gin remains the same.

50|$|A {{barley wine}} {{typically}} reaches an alcohol strength of 8 to 12% by volume and is brewed from specific gravities {{as high as}} 1.120. Use of the word wine is due to its <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> similar to a wine; but since it is made from grain rather than fruit, it is a beer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>alcoholic</b> <b>strength</b> of IMFL {{generally}} {{does not}} exceed 42.8% alcohol by volume or 37% alcohol by weight.Most common bottles of IMFL {{are available in}} sizes of quart (750 ml, 684 g), pint (375 ml, 342 g) and nip (180 ml, 164 g) in cases of 12, 24 and 48 bottles respectively.|$|R
50|$|An {{ebullioscope}} (from the Latin ēbullīre (to boil) + -scope) is {{an instrument}} for measuring the boiling point of a liquid.

The procedure is known as ebullioscopy.|$|R
