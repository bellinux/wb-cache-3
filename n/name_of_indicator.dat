This study aimed to investigate the documentation pattern of neurology house officers, registrars (Regs), and specialist Regs following LP in a major teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: Total hundred patient records were examined in the light of a carefully designed proforma containing 15 important <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> good-quality LP documentation. Result: Mean number <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> overall documented by doctors was found to be 6. 24 ± 3. 0037. The mean number <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> recorded by house officers was 5. 11 ± 3. 01 and Regs was 7. 56 ± 3. 28. A total of 33 % LPs were performed without a documented consent.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> contemporaneous {{stress in the}} financial system <b>named</b> Composite <b>Indicator</b> <b>of</b> Systemic Stress (CISS). Its specific statistical design is shaped according to standard definitions of systemic risk. The main methodological innovation of the CISS is the application of basic portfolio theory to the aggregation of five market-specific subindices created from a total of 15 individual financial stress measures. The aggregation accordingly {{takes into account the}} time-varying cross-correlations between the subindices. As a result, the CISS puts relatively more weight on situations in which stress prevails in several market segments at the same time, capturing the idea that financial stress is more systemic and thus more dangerous for {{the economy as a whole}} if financial instability spreads more widely across the whole financial system. Applied to euro area data, we determine within a threshold VAR model a systemic crisis-level of the CISS at which financial stress tends to depress real economic activity.

Its specific statistical design is shaped in accordance with standard definitions of systemic risk. The main innovative feature of the CISS is the application of portfolio theory to the aggregation <b>of</b> individual stress <b>indicators</b> into the composite index. Along the lines of how portfolio risk is computed from the risks of individual assets, we propose to compute the level of stress in the system as a whole by aggregating five market-specific subindices of stress- comprising a total of 15 individual stress indicators- {{on the basis of a}} time-varying measure of the cross-correlations between them.

Recently, the road safety community got convinced of the policy supporting role <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> in terms <b>of</b> benchmarking, target setting and selection of measures. However, combining the information of a set <b>of</b> relevant risk <b>indicators</b> in one index presenting the whole picture turns out to be very challenging. In particular, the rank of a country can be largely influenced by the methodological choices made during the composite indicator building process. Decisions concerning the selection <b>of</b> <b>indicators,</b> the normalization <b>of</b> the <b>indicator</b> values, the weighting <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> and the way of aggregating can influence the final ranking. In this research, it is shown that the road safety ranking of countries differs significantly according to the selected weighting method, the expert choice and the set <b>of</b> <b>indicators.</b> From these three input factors, the selection of the set <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> is most influential. A well considered selection <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> will therefore establish the largest reduction in ranking uncertainty.

40|$|Measuring {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of heavy metal contaminants {{is the basis of}} pollution evaluation and risk control. Considering the cost of soil sampling and analysis, spatial interpolation methods have been widely applied to estimate the heavy metal concentrations at unsampled locations. However, traditional spatial interpolation methods assume the sample sites can be located stochastically on a plane and the spatial association between sample locations is analyzed using Euclidean distances, which may lead to biased conclusions in some circumstances. This study aims to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of copper and lead contamination in river sediments of Daye using network spatial analysis methods. The results demonstrate that network inverse distance weighted interpolation methods are more accurate than planar interpolation methods. Furthermore, the method <b>named</b> local <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> network-constrained clusters based on local Moran’ I statistic (ILINCS) is applied to explore the local spatial patterns of copper and lead pollution in river sediments, which is helpful for identifying the contaminated areas and assessing heavy metal pollution of Daye...|$|R

40|$|Evidence on {{the role}} of {{information}} and knowledge for policy making shows that policy actors seldom use information as a direct input to their decisions. Similar patterns of (non) use have been identified in the case <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> in the environmental and sustainable development policy domains. The objective of the paper is to elucidate the patterns <b>of</b> environmental <b>indicator</b> use and to argue for the introduction of a 'politics of policy indicators'. With a limited set of characteristics (e. g. legitimacy, credibility and salience) <b>of</b> <b>indicators,</b> which help to apprehend the usability <b>of</b> <b>indicators,</b> we argue that the usability profile <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> can be analysed as a matter of construction and deliberation by indicator creators and policy actors. The performance <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> as policy tools - as rendered with their usability profile - is co-dependent of the institutional embeddedness <b>of</b> the <b>indicators.</b> Our conclusion makes the case that if environmental improvements towards more sustainability are partly relying on the quality and uptake of information into policy processes in order to steer decisions, then the 'usability profile' <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> itself should be subject to collective and conscious steering. This call to 'steer the steering' is supported by the wider calls to initiate patterns of 'reflexive governance' within the sustainability policy domain. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
