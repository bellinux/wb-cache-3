5000|$|In {{the short}} (or American) scale, a billionth {{is equal to}} 0.000 000 001, or 1 x 10−9 in {{scientific}} notation. The prefix for this number is nano, and is abbreviated as [...] "n" [...] (for example, in electronics, one <b>nanofarad</b> would be written as 1 nF).|$|E
50|$|Historically, a farad was {{regarded}} as an inconveniently large unit, both electrically and physically. Its subdivisions were invariably used, namely the microfarad, <b>nanofarad</b> and picofarad. More recently, technology has advanced such that capacitors of 1 farad and greater (so-called 'supercapacitors') can be constructed in a structure little larger than a coin battery. Such capacitors are principally used for energy storage replacing more traditional batteries.|$|E
50|$|Many DVMs (digital volt meters) have a capacitance-measuring function. These usually operate by {{charging}} and discharging the capacitor under test with a known current and measuring {{the rate of}} rise of the resulting voltage; the slower the rate of rise, the larger the capacitance. DVMs can usually measure capacitance from <b>nanofarads</b> to a few hundred microfarads, but wider ranges are not unusual.|$|R
5000|$|... a {{limit on}} the charge stored in the capacitor. A {{discharge}} of less than 45 microcoulombs (µC) is considered safe, even in the unlikely scenario that the current from a flyswatter would be flowing from one arm to the other arm, partly through the heart. This means that the capacitor of a 1000 V flyswatter should be less than 45 <b>nanofarads</b> (nF). Due to this precaution for humans, the initial shock is usually inadequate to kill flies, but will stun them for long enough {{that they can be}} disposed of.|$|R
2500|$|Daniel Gralath was {{the first}} to combine several jars in {{parallel}} to increase the charge storage capacity. Benjamin Franklin investigated the Leyden jar and {{came to the conclusion that}} the charge was stored on the glass, not in the water as others had assumed. He also adopted the term [...] "battery", (denoting the increasing of power with a row of similar units as in a battery of cannon), subsequently applied to clusters of electrochemical cells. Leyden jars were later made by coating the inside and outside of jars with metal foil, leaving a space at the mouth to prevent arcing between the foils. The earliest unit of capacitance was the jar, equivalent to about 1.11 <b>nanofarads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Values of {{capacitors}} {{are usually}} specified in farads (F), microfarads (μF), nanofarads (nF) and picofarads (pF). The millifarad is rarely used in practice (a capacitance of 4.7 mF (0.0047 F), for example, is instead written as [...] ), while the <b>nanofarad</b> is uncommon in North America. The size of commercially available capacitors ranges from around 0.1 pF to [...] (5 kF) supercapacitors. Parasitic capacitance in high-performance integrated circuits {{can be measured}} in femtofarads (1 fF = 0.001 pF = [...] F), while high-performance test equipment can detect changes in capacitance on the order of tens of attofarads (1 aF = [...] F).|$|E
5000|$|The {{capacitance}} of {{the majority}} of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the farad. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the microfarad (µF), <b>nanofarad</b> (nF), picofarad (pF), and, in microcircuits, femtofarad (fF). However, specially made supercapacitors can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad. In the past, alternate subunits were used in historical electronic books; [...] "mfd" [...] and [...] "mf" [...] for microfarad (µF); [...] "mmfd", [...] "mmf", [...] "µµF" [...] for picofarad (pF); but are rarely used any more.|$|E
40|$|Clinical SPECT/MRI {{applications}} {{based on}} indirect conversion {{require the use}} of large area solid-state detectors. Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) is a fast-improving technology suitable for this application, due to its compatibility with the MRI environment and to its high multiplication gain. Considering the large number of detectors of a SPECT ring, a multichannel ASIC is needed to have a compact readout. SiPMs have a large specific output capacitance (approx. 200 pF·mm- 2), which can result in a load of several <b>nanofarad</b> for each pixel at the input of the readout circuit. We developed ANGUS, a 36 -channel 0. 35 μm CMOS technology ASIC designed to cope with input capacitances larger than 10 nF, with an overall power dissipation of 400 mW. A current mode input is used, allowing an input voltage tuning for SiPM overvoltage regulation in a 1 V range. A programmable RC filter is used to extract the signal amplitude information. The implemented time constants make the chip suitable for use with various type of scintillator crystal (e. g. CsI:Tl, GaGG:Ce, LYSO:Ce, NaI:Tl). Room temperature energy resolution measurements performed with ANGUS employing SiPM from FBK and Hamamatsu coupled to CsI:Tl crystals with a 57 Co source are reported in the following. 12 % FWHM resolution was measured at the 122 keV line of this source using FBK detectors...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to analyze active products of spark discharge plasma radiation determining biological effects in tissues, estimate the radiation intensity, identify the resulting products and determine their concentrations. Materials and Methods. The radiation intensity of discharge was estimated by means of detecting 1. 5 % solution of potassium iodine. The possibility of OH • and HO 2 • formation was analyzed by oxalic acid and mohr’s salt solutions. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was assessed by titanium ions test (λ= 410 нм). And NO 3 − ion formation was studied by means of ion selective electrodes. There was carried out chemical analytical and spectrophotometric analysis of products absorption over the range of λ= 200 – 400 nm to identify the products forming and accumulating in liquid phase of discharge. The active products forming in gas phase of discharge were analyzed by Fourier infrared absorption spectra. pH was measured by device “Expert 001 ”. All the solutions were treated in discharge optimal conditions: the capacity of pulse capacitor C= 3. 3 <b>nanofarad,</b> ballast resistance R= 10 МOhm, power supply voltage U PS = 11 kV, pulse recurrence frequency — 10 Hz. Results. Spark discharge plasma radiation initiates UV photon beam (2. 5 ± 0. 3) · 10 15 (cm 2 ·s) − 1, with energy density (2. 0 ± 0. 3) · 10 − 3 J(cm 2 ·s) − 1, maximum radiation spectrum — 220 nm. Under discharge pH in water samples decreases, oxidizers and deoxidizers accumulate. There have been identified radicals HO 2 •, initial yield — (1. 2 ± 0. 3) · 10 − 6 mol(l·s) − 1. Initial yield of acid residues ([H +] increase) — (5. 8 ± 1. 6) · 10 − 7 mol/(l·s) − 1, oxidizers (3. 3 ± 1. 0) · 10 − 6 mol-equiv. /(l·s) − 1, deoxidizers (4. 2 ± 1. 0) · 10 − 7 mol-equiv. /(l·s) − 1. The formation of nitro compounds containing CN, NH groups and organic compounds containing CH, CC groups has been proved. Nitrogen oxides and organic compounds make the main contribution to pH decrease...|$|E
40|$|The field {{experiment}} was established from pre-grown alfalfa sprouts in 2008. In 2009 and 2010, the harvest was carried out. The yield and the root size system (RSS) were evaluated {{in the total}} of five cuts. Two localities of diverse soil and weather conditions were selected. Žabčice is a dry location with a highly permeable sandy soil layer, {{but at the same}} time, with a considerable fluctuation of the underground water level; Troubsko, on the other hand, represented a location with a higher content of clay in soil suitable for growing alfalfa. The trial was established in two types of plant spacing – 25 × 25 [*]cm (16 plants per m 2) and 50 × 50 [*]cm (4 plants per m 2). Two alfalfa varieties were used – Hodonínka (an old variety) and Oslava (a new variety). The following factors were evaluated by statistical means: location, variety, plant spacing, and cut number. The effect of location on the above ground phytomass and the RSS value proved highly statistically decisive. The higher average values of above ground phytomass as well as RSS were achieved on the Troubsko location where the above ground phytomass was 19. 57 t. ha− 1 and RSS was 2. 71 <b>nanofarad</b> (nF). The impact of the variety was highly statistically significant only in respect to RSS. The effect of variety on the alfalfa above ground phytomass was not proven. The higher average RSS values were reached by the Hodonínka variety (2. 59 nF). The effect of the plant spacing on both the above ground phytomass and the RSS values was highly statistically significant. The higher average above ground phytomass was achieved when the 25 × 25 [*]cm plant spacing was employed (18. 64 t. ha− 1). As for the RSS value, the case was exactly opposite – the higher average value was reached when the plant spacing was 50 × 50 [*]cm (2. 99 nF). The impact of the cut number on both the above ground phytomass and the RSS was highly statistically significant. The highest average above ground phytomass and root system size were measured in the third cut. The above ground phytomass was 30. 36 t. ha‑ 1 and RSS was 3. 86 nF...|$|E
