Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.|$|E

He then scored 129 in the run-chase as The Rest of Australia narrowly defeated New South Wales by two wickets. Woodfull scored fifties in both interstate matches against New South Wales and added consecutive centuries for the national team against Tasmania before departing for his final tour of England. He ended the season with 818 runs at 62.92, returning to form after the tumult of the previous summer.|$|E

The aim is to study how this intervention changes the families’ everyday practices, as well as suggest how design can support and sustain such a change on a larger scale. If radically new paradigms are to be shaped, changes are needed both in what is considered <b>normalities</b> and in people’s everyday practices.

5|$|Six {{people were}} killed in the Dominican Republic and another {{fourteen}} in Haiti. Three were killed in Jamaica, which also suffered US$310million of damage—the heaviest in the Caribbean. The most severe damage there was to the agricultural sector; nearly the entire banana crop was destroyed. Global aid organizations contributed to the subsequent recovery effort; immediate life-saving needs were met within days, but the damage to Jamaica's infrastructure and economy took much longer to repair. With loans and grants from the local government, the European Union, and the United Nations, <b>normality</b> was restored by the following summer.|$|E

A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas <b>normality</b> is restored.|$|E

It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece. By putting {{the children in the}} place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry. He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving an appearance of <b>normality</b> without disguising Seneb's unusual physique.

40|$|Metachromatic {{polyelectrolyte}} titration {{was investigated}} {{as a means}} of analyzing polymeric quaternary ammonium salts (polyquaterniums) of relatively low charge density used as ingredients in cosmetics. They are of possible toxicological concern, but little is known of their environmental fate and behavior. With o-toluidine blue as the indicator, determination of the concentration of a range of polyquaterniums of commercial importance and cosmetic origin was possible. Using a visual endpoint, <b>normalities</b> as low as 3 10 - 5 N could be determined, while with a spectrophotometric endpoint, the technique was effective to approximately 3 10 - 6 N. The concentrations (g L- 1) to which these <b>normalities</b> correspond depend on the charge density of the polymer. Polyquaterniums are frequently used in association with anionic surfactants in cosmetic formulations and the presence of an anionic surfactant even in excess did not affect results although the color change was less stable. Titration in the presence of prepared humic acid was also possible. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R

Based on the least-squared technique, an imputation method is proposed to estimate the regression coefficients, single-index coefficients, and the nonparametric function, respectively. Thereafter, asymptotical <b>normalities</b> of the corresponding estimators are proved. A simulation experiment and an application to a diabetes study are used to illustrate our proposed method.|$|R
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives <b>normality</b> to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E

After {{locating}} the correct ship, Worf begins to travel back but is attacked by another Enterprise that has come from a Borg-overrun universe, its crew refusing to return. The Enterprise that he left fires upon the hostile ship and destroys it. Worf safely passes through the fissure, finding himself back in <b>normality</b> with a single Enterprise in front of him. After boarding, Worf finds that no time has passed since he initially entered the fissure. When he returns to his room expecting a surprise party, he finds only Troi waiting to give him a single present and, knowing that the two are married in many alternate universes, he invites her to share dinner with him.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{body was}} embalmed at Berkeley Castle, {{where it was}} viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester. It was then taken to Gloucester Abbey on 21 October, and on 20 December Edward was buried by the high altar, the funeral having {{probably}} been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person. Gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take the King's body, {{and because it was}} close to Berkeley. The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with gold leaf and oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds. Edward III's government probably hoped to put a veneer of <b>normality</b> over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young King's own reign.|$|E

5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of <b>normality</b> to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{sought to}} maintain an impression of <b>normality.</b> Just before Ramadan was to begin on 26 September, the Ministry of War publicly announced that military personnel could register to take leave to perform a Umrah (pilgrimage) in Mecca. Egyptian newspapers announced that sailboat races would be held, participants of which included several high-ranking officers of the Egyptian Navy. In addition, a visit planned for October 8 (two days after the scheduled attack) by the Romanian Minister of Defense to Egypt was also publicized by the Ministry of War, and a program for his visit was announced. This coincidental visit would be promptly canceled once war broke out on 6 October, but it proved useful {{as part of the}} deception plan.|$|E

The revolutionary government announced that its political prisoners, numbering 500, would be tried by special courts. Okello formed the Freedom Military Force (FMF), a paramilitary unit made up of his own supporters, which patrolled the streets and looted Arab property. The behaviour of Okello's supporters, his violent rhetoric, Ugandan accent, and Christian beliefs were alienating many in the largely moderate Zanzibari and Muslim ASP, and by March many members of his FMF had been disarmed by Karume's supporters and the Umma Party militia. On 11 March Okello was officially stripped of his rank of Field Marshal, and was denied entry when trying to return to Zanzibar from a trip to the mainland. He was deported to Tanganyika and then to Kenya, before returning destitute to his native Uganda.|$|E
