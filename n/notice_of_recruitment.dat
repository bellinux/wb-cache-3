40|$|Excerpt] The early phase <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> is {{essential}} to staffing success: larger applicant pools permit managers to be more selective when making job offers and increase the overall utility of selection systems (Murphy, 1986). Despite {{the importance of this}} early stage <b>of</b> <b>recruitment,</b> little is known about how early recruitment practices affect potential applicants’ intentions and decisions to pursue job opportunities (Breaugh 2 ̆ 6 Starke, 2000). In addition, existing research on the first phase <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> is limited because most recruitment research has only concentrated on a small range <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices that are typically deployed during later phases <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> like the job interview (Rynes, 1991). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to use the brand-equity literature as a conceptual framework for exploring how a company’s mix <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> activities affects job seekers’ perceived employment brand equity and their intentions to pursue job opportunities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a survey on teacher recruitment practices used in New York State school districts and analyzes whether the level <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices is related to teacher qualifications. We find that most districts employ {{a wide variety of}} practices and that the number <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices used by districts goes up with district size. To examine the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices, we estimate a model relating a composite measure of teacher qualifications to the level <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices and labor supply and demand factors. The recruitment regressor is treated as an endogenous variable with factors related to district use of these practices as instruments. While we cannot identify which individual practices are important, we find consistent evidence that districts using only a limited set <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices have hired less qualified teachers in New York...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that for Haliotis rubra Leach the localized abundance of mature abalone determines the abundance <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> was tested with experimental reductions of breeding stock at four sites. At each site {{there was an}} experimental area 60 m in length, from which adult abalone were removed, and two control areas 60 m {{either side of the}} experimental area. The abundance <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> was found to vary significantly between the four sites and between control areas within three of the sites. Observations which are consistent with recruitment being highly localized. The overall density <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> to the experimental areas was significantly lower than in the control areas indicating that the abundance of breeding animals determines the abundance <b>of</b> <b>recruitment.</b> When these data were combined with data from the studies of Prince et al. (in press) for the same sites, a relationship between breeding stock and recruitment is clearly evident, confirming that the density of breeding stock was the major determinant <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> abundance. These results show that for this species, on a spatial scale measured in 10 s of meters, the abundance <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> {{is directly related to the}} abundance of mature abalone...|$|R

40|$|Reduction of {{tidal volume}} to limit plateau {{pressure}} currently {{is recommended for}} the ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, sufficient evidence now exists to support the fact that excessive reduction in tidal volume may result in harmful alveolar derecruitment depending on {{the level at which}} positive end-expiratory pressure is set. The use <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> maneuvers has been proposed as an adjunctive lung-protective strategy to reverse low tidal volume-related derecruitment. Many questions remain regarding the basic physiologic principles <b>of</b> <b>recruitment,</b> and, therefore, the optimal way to perform recruitment maneuvers remains unknown. Moreover, apart from physiologic studies suggesting a potential benefit <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> maneuver in terms <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> and gas exchange, no data are yet available that demonstrate the ability of such a maneuver to improve outcome.
