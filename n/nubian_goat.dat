Escherichia sp. Gemella sp. Klebsiella sp. Microccocus sp. Proteus sp. Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. The organisms which were common between the two groups included: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Staphylococcus chromogens and Streptococcus faecalis. It was noticed that four goats in the control group were free from aerobic bacteria as early as day 13 and only one goat continued to show these organisms till the occurrence of first oestrus post-partum. However, in the C. S group, four goats continued to host the organisms till the signs of oestrus were observed and only one goat was free from the organisms at day 21. Depending on these finding, the post-partum period in the normally kidded <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> ranged between 13 - 36 days (23. 4 ? 8. 46) and between 21 - 41 days (35 ? 8. 22) in the C. sectioned <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> and {{the difference between the two}} groups was a significant (p< 0. 05).

Forty five heads of either Nubian goats or Newzealand rabbits were divided into 17 groups, each of three. Group 1 animals were the undosed controls. Test groups of either species were given polyDADMAC at similar dose rates of 0. 5, 2. 5, 4. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg body weight respectively for groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. On treating test goats and rabbits with alum solution, dose rates of 1 % and 20 % were accepted by groups 12 and 13 respectively. Further, test goats and rabbits were dosed with combinations of 1 % polyDADMAC and 1 % alum in ratios of 1 : 2 and 3 : 20 to groups 14 and 15 respectively. Clinical signs were closely observed with postmortem and histopathological examinations. Chemical investigations included enzymatic concentrations of ALP, GOT, CK, GPT and LDH and metabolic changes of albumin, urea, total protein, cholesterol, bilirubin, glucose and creatinine. Fluctuations in electrolyte levels of Mg, Fe, Na, K, Ca and P were monitored together with hematological changes in Hb, PCV, RBCs and WBCs. Selective rabbit vital organ atomic absorption spectroscopy was made for alum concentrations. Mortalities occurred in both species to variable degrees irrespective of the dose level. On polyDADMAC challenge, both test species showed clinical signs of dullness, loss of weight, anorexia, diarrhea, difficulty in respiration, and recumbency. On alum dosing, both test species clinically suffered low voice, inappitence, whitish salivation, watery diarrhea and also recumbency. Combined interacted doses of polyDADMAC and alum caused in both species interrupted salivation, vomiting and hind limb paralysis. Notably in both species oral dosing with polyDADMAC caused lung emphysema, hepatic and renal dysfunctions, irregularity in enzymatic activities and serum metabolites, sloughing of intestinal epithelium, decreased electrolytes in serum, and splenic haemosiderosis, whereas oral dosing with alum gave rise to lung emphysema,stiffness, and edema, electrolyte imbalance, renal and hepatic dysfunctions, and finally the focal enteritis was dominant. On atomic absorption only the lungs kept residual alum, while the livers washed- out the substance, may be via bile.

Test groups were given alum at dose rates of 1 and 20 % respectively for groups 2 and 3 for a period of 10 weeks after an adaptation period of two weeks during which the animals were X kept under ideal experimental conditions. Clinical signs were closely observed with postmortem and histopathological examinations. Chemical investigations included enzymatic activities of ALP, AST, CK, ALT and LDH and metabolic changes of albumin, urea, total protein, cholesterol, bilirubin, glucose and creatinine were detected. Fluctuations in electrolyte levels of Mg, Fe, Na, K, Ca and P were monitored together with hematological changes in Hb, PCV, RBCs and WBCs. Mortalities occurred to variable degrees irrespective to the dose level. On alum challenge, the test species showed clinical signs of low voice, inappitence, dullness, whitish salivation, watery diarrhea and also recumbency. On atomic absorption only the lungs kept residual alum, while the livers washed out the substance, maybe via bile. Notably oral dosing with alum caused changes consisted of congested liver with white spots, stiff-greenish lungs and inflammed empty intestines. The un-dosed group 1 goats showed a normal picture.

40|$|Derivative free {{restricted}} {{maximum likelihood}} (DFREML) {{was used to}} calculate variance and covariance components for cumulative milk yield, cumulative fat yield and cumulative protein yield, of Alpine, Toggenburg, Saanen and <b>Nubian</b> dairy <b>goat</b> breeds. First lactation records of 691 Alpine, 641 Toggenburg, 439 Saanen and 433 <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> freshening between 1986 and 1995, and a combined data set of all breeds, were analysed. Two basic models, either including or excluding coefficients for phantom groups, besides the random and fixed effects, were fitted for each trait and breed. Included fixed effects were age at first kidding and flock-year for the single breed data sets and an additional breed effect for the multiple breed data set. Random effects in sub-models were fitted to estimate direct effects (model 1), direct and maternal effects (model 2) and direct effects, maternal effects and the covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects (model 3).

40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out to study the {{susceptibility}} of <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> to experimental Trypanosoma vivax infection and the pathological effects of the infection on them. Also different parasitological techniques were compared in diagnosis of infection when taking blood samples from jugular and ear veins. Twenty <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> {{were used in the}} experiment. They were divided into four groups each contained five animals, the first three were experimentally infected with T. vivax through the jugular vein using different infective doses, low (+), medium (++) and high (+++). While the fourth group served as uninfected group. During the study different parasitological techniques were used for detecting trypanosome infection. These included wet blood smears, thin and thick stained blood smears, haematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT) and dark ground phase contrast buffy coat technique. The haematocrit centrifugation technique was found to be the most superior parasitological technique used. Higher parasitaemia levels were detected from blood collected from ear veins when compared to blood collected from jugular vein indicating accumulation of trypanosomes in the peripheral circulation of infected animals. The study showed that <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> are highly susceptible to T. vivax infection. Infected animals showed different clinical signs, while different changes in blood, serum and tissues of some organs were encountered. Also the infection led to death of some of the infected animals. The infection resulted in significant decrease in packed cell volume (PCV), total red blood cells numbers (RBCs) and 5 haemoglobin concentration (Hb) values. Significant increases were encountered in mean cell volume (MCV) and mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) values. No significant change was observed in mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). These results indicated the presence of macrocytic normochromic anaemia. Total white blood cells (WBCs) numbers were normal. Serum biochemical alterations showed significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase activity (AST), total proteins, globulins and urea values. However no alterations were observed in serum albumin, creatinine, sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) values. Different gross changes due to the infection were also detected, these included pale mucous and serous membranes, watery blood, muscle atrophy, hemorrhages in kidneys and congestion of the brain. Different histopathological changes were also detected in several organs; these include mononuclear cell infiltrations and vaculation of Purkingi cells in heart. The liver revealed congestion and areas of coagulative necrosis associated with vascular thrombosis. Lungs showed thickening of the alveolar septa and infiltration of mononuclear cells. Spleen sections revealed deposition of haemosiderin pigments. Changes of kidneys included haemorrhages in the medulary rays and degeneration of tubular cells while adrenal glands showed hemorrhages and degeneration of some cortical cells. There were oedema and thrombosis of some blood vessels in lymph nodes. The brain showed gliosis and vacuolation of cerebral gray matter and degeneration of neurons. Testis showed necrosis, oedema, congestion and multiple granulomas. It could be concluded that <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> are highly susceptible to T. vivax infection and could be suitable as experimental animal in 6 T. vivax studies. The HCT and thin stained smears were found to be suitable diagnostic tools for T. vivax infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{restriction}} on feed {{of a group}} of <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> was studied. Fifteen <b>Nubian</b> <b>goats</b> similar in age and parity were randomly divided into three groups of five goats each. The animals were watered every other day, once every day and adlibtum. They fed with Lucerne hay and concentrate which was composed (sorghum, wheat bran, molasses and salt). The experiment was conducted in autumn season There {{was no significant difference between}} goats watered every other day and goats watered adlibtum while the goats watered once every day showed a significant decrease in feed intake. Water consumption showed highly significant differences between the three groups. The goats watered every other day recorded a decrease in the consumption compared with the other two groups. The apparent digestibility coefficients for dry matter and crude protein did not significantly differ between the goats watered every other day and the goats watered once every day. However, the group which was watered adlibtum was reported a decrease in the dry matter and crude protein digestibility. The total nitrogen retained was significantly higher in goats watered every other day than the goats watered once every day while goats watered adlibtum had reported the lowest value of nitrogen retained in animal body. Animals body weight showed significant decrease in the goats watered every other day and goats watered once every day with an increase in the goats watered adlibtum during the six weeks of the experiment...|$|R
