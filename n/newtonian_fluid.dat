5|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the flow is that shear stress is {{constant}} throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of the velocity, , is constant. (This is implied by the straight-line profile in the figure.) According to Newton's Law of Viscosity (<b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid),</b> the shear stress {{is the product of}} this expression and the (constant) fluid viscosity.|$|E
500|$|Newton {{also built}} the first {{practical}} reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. [...] Newton's work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, first published in 1704. [...] He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation {{of the speed of}} sound, and introduced the notion of a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid.</b> [...] In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid</b> (named after Isaac Newton) {{is defined}} to be a fluid whose shear stress is linearly {{proportional}} to the velocity gradient in the direction perpendicular to the plane of shear. This definition means regardless of the forces acting on a fluid, it continues to flow. For example, water is a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid,</b> because it continues to display fluid properties {{no matter how much}} it is stirred or mixed. A slightly less rigorous definition is that the drag of a small object being moved slowly through the fluid is {{proportional to the}} force applied to the object. (Compare friction). [...] Important fluids, like water as well as most gases, behave – to good approximation – as a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid</b> under normal conditions on Earth.|$|E
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in non-Newtonian fluids {{is due to the}} many applications at low-Reynolds number like the microfluidics in biochemistry applications.

Explicit analytical expressions are obtained for the boundaries of the dynamically stable region which turns out to be completely analogue to the stability charts obtained for the case of ablation fronts. These results allow proposing experiments with <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> as surrogates for studying the case of ablation fronts. Experiments with <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> are presented which demonstrate the validity of the theoretical approach and encourage to pursue experimental research on ablation fronts to settle the feasibility of dynamic stabilization in the inertial confinement fusion scenario...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} the {{profiles}} of velocity and fluid flow rate in porous media with cylindrical geometries were made, using Maple, {{and the results were}} obtained in terms of the Bessel Functions. Some of them were the generalized forms of the Haugen-Poiseuille Law. The results could be applied to synthetic media such as zeolites.

2500|$|In nonideal fluid dynamics, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, {{also known}} as the Hagen–Poiseuille law, Poiseuille law or Poiseuille equation, is a {{physical}} law that gives the pressure drop in an incompressible and <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid</b> in laminar flow flowing through a long cylindrical pipe of constant cross section.|$|E
2500|$|Under certain circumstances, fluid {{mechanics}} is a scale-invariant classical field theory. The fields are {{the velocity of}} the fluid flow, , the fluid density, , and the fluid pressure, [...] These fields must satisfy both the Navier–Stokes equation and the continuity equation.

40|$|Various flow bifurcations are {{investigated}} for two dimensional combined mixing and separating geometry. These consist of two reversed channel flows interacting through {{a gap in}} the common separating wall filled with porous media of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> and other with unidirectional fluid flows. The Steady solutions are obtained through an unsteady finite element approach that employs a Taylor-Galerkin/pressure-correction scheme.

25|$|For some fluids, {{viscosity}} is {{a constant}} {{over a wide range}} of shear rates (<b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids).</b> The fluids without a constant viscosity (non-Newtonian fluids) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> {{are named}} after Isaac Newton, who first {{postulated}} {{the relation between}} the shear strain rate and shear stress for such fluids in differential form.|$|R
2500|$|In {{very general}} terms, the fluid's {{viscosity}} is {{the relation between}} the strain rate and the viscous stress. [...] In the <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid</b> model, the relationship is by definition a linear map, described by a viscosity tensor that, multiplied by the strain rate tensor (which is the gradient of the flow's velocity), gives the viscous stress tensor.|$|E
2500|$|In aerodynamics, air {{is assumed}} to be a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid,</b> which posits a linear {{relationship}} between the shear stress (due to internal friction forces) and the rate of strain of the fluid. The equation above is a vector equation in a three-dimensional flow, but it can be expressed as three scalar equations in three coordinate directions. The conservation of momentum equations for the compressible, viscous flow case are called the Navier–Stokes equations.|$|E
2500|$|The higher-order term, {{namely the}} shear stress {{divergence}} , has simply {{reduced to the}} vector laplacian term [...] This laplacian term {{can be interpreted as}} the difference between the velocity at a point and the mean velocity in a small surrounding volume. This implies that – for a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluid</b> – viscosity operates as a diffusion of momentum, {{in much the same way}} as the heat conduction. In fact neglecting the convection term, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations lead to a vector diffusion equation (namely Stokes equations), but in general the convection term is present, so incompressible Navier–Stokes equations belong to the class of convection-diffusion equations.|$|E

40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{dimensional}} analysis, which uses two kinds of scales, provides {{a powerful tool for}} analyzing heat and mass transfer correlations as has been demonstrated by Ruckenstein (1986) in the case of forced convection of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids.</b> In this work, the approach based on micro- and macro-scales is extended to free convection of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids,</b> as well as to forced and free convection of power-law fluids. As the micro-participation and macro-participation dominate in laminar and turbulent flow respectively, bounds on the exponents of the Reynolds number Re and the Grashof number Gr can be established in the case of forced and free convection respectively. An upper bound is obtained for laminar flow and a lower bound for turbulent flow. Thus, for free convection in <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids,</b> it is demonstrated that the bounds on the exponent of Gr for laminar and turbulent flow are 0. 25 and 0. 375 respectively...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a {{detailed}} asymptotic analysis of the lattice Boltzmann method with two different collision mechanisms of BGK-type on the D 2 Q 9 -lattice for generalized <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids.</b> Unlike that based on the Chapman-Enskog expansion leading to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, our analysis gives the incompressible ones directly and exposes certain important features of the lattice Boltzmann solutions. Moreover, our analysis provides a theoretical basis for using the iteration to compute the rate-of-strain tensor, which makes sense specially for generalized <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids.</b> As a by-product, a seemingly new structural condition on the generalized <b>Newtonian</b> <b>fluids</b> is singled out. This condition reads as "the magnitude of the stress tensor increases with increasing the shear rate". We verify this condition for all the existing constitutive relations which are known to us. In addition, it it straightforward to extend our analysis to MRT models or to three-dimensional lattices...|$|R
