25|$|The elected Eyemouth Town Community Council {{is led by}} a Chairman and has 12 members {{including}} an Honorary Provost. Three representatives of Scottish Borders Council attend monthly public meetings {{in order to take}} on board and act upon feedback from the community councillors who serve as a voice {{of the people of the}} town. Eyemouth Town Community Council (a Scottish Community Council), meets on the last Monday of the month (except in December) at 7.00pm in the community centre, minutes of the meetings being displayed on their website, on two <b>notice</b> <b>boards</b> in the town and also in the Berwickshire News.|$|E

We can rotate the news or notice or time table or related to any data which will be display on <b>notice</b> <b>board</b> from, right to left, left to right, up to down and down to up. In today’s life most of the colleges, offices use a simple <b>notice</b> <b>board</b> in which we cannot manage the whole data on single page for long time and it need more maintenance as compare to digital <b>notice</b> <b>board.</b> Few of the area’s need quick notices display on the light board like in restaurant, railway stations and share-market and this notice should be in real-time, so we need a real-time <b>notice</b> <b>board.</b> This project is our experiment to give a start {{to the area of}} manual handling <b>notice</b> <b>board.</b> In this, we present a feature extraction and sensor fusion technique that exploits a set of wireless nodes equipped with IR sensors to track hand movement...|$|R

25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are <b>notice</b> <b>boards</b> in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has a jug of water and goblets on a tray.|$|E
500|$|Since the mid-2000s, the Severnside Community Rail Partnership {{have been}} working to enhance Patchway station. One of the first acts was {{installing}} new community <b>notice</b> <b>boards.</b> A local working group was formed to [...] "adopt" [...] the station, and the group negotiated with Rolls Royce to use their CCTV system to cover the station. A successful bid was made to the Department for Transport's [...] "Access for All" [...] scheme, which provided for improved signage, lighting and seats. A station garden was created in partnership with nearby Patchway Community College, and two decorative mosaics were installed. The disused railway land adjacent to the station was cleared through a Community Payback scheme.|$|E

2500|$|The Ezhavas {{first took}} up issue in 1905. The Ezhava {{representatives in the}} Travancore Legislature (Kochu Kunjan Channar, Kunju Panicker and Kumaran Asan) raised the {{question}} of use of the public roads around the temples by avarnas. The authorities remained adamant and refused to take up the matter even for discussion as it was considered a religious question. [...] In 1920-21, representative Asan also raised the question and it was decided to shift the <b>notice</b> <b>boards</b> a little, so that some parts of the roads would be accessible to the avarnas.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the ride's final month, Chessington offered separately-priced 'VIP Behind The Scenes' {{tours to}} the public. Led by {{an actor in}} a Professor Burp {{imitation}} costume and wig, the tours purportedly contained factual inaccuracies about the original ride, including erroneously stating that the Bubblehead characters were named 'Willyheads'. This was also displayed on <b>notice</b> <b>boards</b> during the ride's closing-down media party. This name, referring to male genitalia, was instead alleged {{to have been a}} staff nickname for the since-removed Boffin characters in years prior. In several instances, social media users claimed that many portions of the tour material and media-night were downloaded from the internet, plagiarised from an online documentary about the ride, or lifted whole paragraphs from John Wardley's autobiography.|$|E

He was the sort of man one instinctively calls Bill.|$|E

This stretch of the Thames, this {{pleasure}} stretch, has in fact a curiously quarrelsome atmosphere. People scold and insult one another for the most trivial things, for passing too close, for taking the wrong side, for tying up or floating loose. Most of these <b>notice</b> <b>boards</b> on the bank show a thoroughly nasty spirit. People on the banks jeer at anyone in the boats. You hear people quarrelling in boats, in the hotels, as they walk along the towing path. There is remarkably little happy laughter here. The RAGE, you see, is hostile to this place, the RAGE breaks through.... The people who drift from one pub to another, drinking, the people who fuddle in the riverside hotels, are the last fugitives of pleasure, trying to forget the rage...." ...|$|E
60|$|As Bert {{travelled}} from parish to parish, {{and from}} district to district, avoiding {{as far as}} possible those festering centres of violence and despair, the larger towns, he found the condition of affairs varying widely. In one parish he would find the large house burnt, the vicarage wrecked, evidently in violent conflict for some suspected and perhaps imaginary store of food unburied dead everywhere, and the whole mechanism of the community at a standstill. In another he would find organising forces stoutly at work, newly-painted <b>notice</b> <b>boards</b> warning off vagrants, the roads and still cultivated fields policed by armed men, the pestilence under control, even nursing going on, a store of food husbanded, the cattle and sheep well guarded, and a group of two or three justices, the village doctor or a farmer, dominating the whole place; a reversion, in fact, to the autonomous community of the fifteenth century. But at any time such a village would be liable to a raid of Asiatics or Africans or such-like air-pirates, demanding petrol and alcohol or provisions. The price of its order was an almost intolerable watchfulness and tension.|$|E

6000|$|Most of {{our public}} {{buildings}} we destroyed and burnt as we reshaped our plan of habitation, our theater sheds, our banks, and inconvenient business warrens, our factories (these {{in the first year}} of all), and all the [...] "unmeaning repetition" [...] of silly little sham Gothic churches and meeting-houses, mean looking shells of stone and mortar without love, invention, or any beauty at all in them, that men had thrust into the face of their sweated God, even as they thrust cheap food into the mouths of their sweated workers; all these we also swept away in the course of that first decade. Then we had the whole of the superseded steam-railway system to scrap and get rid of, stations, signals, fences, rolling stock; a plant of ill-planned, smoke-distributing nuisance apparatus, that would, under former conditions, have maintained an offensive dwindling obstructive life for perhaps half a century. Then also there was a great harvest of fences, <b>notice</b> <b>boards,</b> hoardings, ugly sheds, all the corrugated iron in the world, and everything that was smeared with tar, all our gas works and petroleum stores, all our horse vehicles and vans and lorries had to be erased. [...] .
