5000|$|The queen is {{the only}} sexually mature female in the hive {{and all of the}} female worker bees and male drones are her offspring. The queen may live for up to three years or more and may be capable of laying half a million eggs or more in her lifetime. At the peak of the {{breeding}} season, late spring to summer, a good queen may be capable of laying 3,000 eggs in one day, more than her own body weight. This would be exceptional however; a prolific queen might peak at 2,000 eggs a day, but a more average queen might lay just 1,500 eggs per day. The queen is raised from a <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> egg, but is fed a larger amount of royal jelly than a <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> bee, resulting in a radically different growth and metamorphosis. The queen influences the colony by the production and dissemination of a variety of pheromones or [...] "queen substances". One of these chemicals suppresses the development of ovaries in all the female worker bees in the hive and prevents them from laying eggs.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of {{termites}} within the colony: the alate (swarmer), the soldier and the worker. Alates have an orange-brown head and pronotum, an 11-12.5 mm long, dark brown abdomen. This is the only caste that leaves the colony, which happens when they seek a mate. If they are successful, they will form the new kings and queens. There are also soldiers, which are large, reddish-brown, and have two teeth visible on the left mandible. They are noted for having a larger third antennal segment. They are 8-12 mm long, and can weigh from 20-25 mg. This eusocial species {{does not have a}} <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> caste. There are “pseudergates” which are false workers characterized by their lack of wing pads, as well as [...] "nymphs" [...] which do possess wing pads. These wing pads allow the nymphs to molt into a soldier or an alate, because they are not sterile. These workers are not the bottom class, meaning they are capable of becoming soldiers and alates. The pseudergates group is also able to change into male or female alates just by molting, which is very different from other insect species.|$|E
40|$|Singapore’s {{economic}} {{development has been}} progressing rapidly {{over the past few}} decades. The level of education and intellectual capacity of her has been improving over the years. More women are having higher educational qualifications and assume senior positions in their careers. Like other developed countries, this success also brings along a unique set of social problems. The country has been having a dry spell in terms of fertility rates. In addition, a growing trend in delaying marriage and a decline of married women’s participation in the workforce after childbirth. Previous studies have indicated that the choices made between family time and income, based on the income and substitution effect has an impact on family income and family life. In the comparison between family income and leisure time of working mothers in Singapore, there is a negative substitution effect for the high family-income working mothers when there is an increase in their wage rate. The additional wage rate does not motivate them to trade in more of their leisure time. This is contrary to the income and substitution effect theory of a <b>normal</b> <b>worker.</b> A <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> will trade-in more leisure time when there is an increase in wage rate. In the case of working mothers, this trend does not seem to apply. However, when the family-income is low or when the family is in-debt, there is a positive substitution effect even though the working mothers do not have much leisure time for themselves. They are willing to trade-in their limited leisure time for the additional income which could make a difference in their family income. This is not the behaviour exhibited for a <b>normal</b> <b>worker.</b> When the average <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> is left with limited leisure time, he will not trade-in his leisure time for more income. The income and substitution effect is used to shed light on the issues and contributing factors to the decision variables of the working moms in their participation in the workforce. The research included data collection, data analysis and a comparative review of existing literature and examination of official statistics. Data collection was conducted in two phases. The 1 st phase involved 100 survey participants and the 2 nd phase involved 10 in-depth structured interviews. The purpose of this research is to draw a deeper understanding of these factors and a review of existing government policies and explore possible areas where the government can explore in attracting stay-at-home mothers back to the workforce in Singapore and possibly increasing the fertility rate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A self-organized {{allocation}} {{scheme for}} service tasks in computing systems is proposed in this paper. Usually {{components of a}} computing system need some service {{from time to time}} in order perform their work efficiently. In adaptive computing systems the components and the necessary tasks adapt to the needs of users or the environment. Since in such cases the type of service tasks will often change it is attractive to use reconfigurable hardware to perform the service tasks. The studied system consists of <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> components and helper components which have reconfigurable hardware and can perform different service tasks. The speed with which a service tasks is executed by a helper depends on its actual configuration. Different strategies for the helpers to decide about service task acceptance and reconfiguration are proposed. These strategies are inspired by stimulus-threshold models that are used to explain task allocation in social insects. I...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{itself with}} how professional poker players construct their identities and chosen career via {{the use of}} language. The theoretical framework for this paper is social constructionism, with the methods of analysis being discourse analysis combined with a rhetorical approach. During {{the last five or}} so years poker's popularity has exploded and the image of the game has undergone a radical metamorphosis. These changes can largely be attributed to the advent of internet play and the numerous poker television programmes which have recently sprung up. Surprisingly, however, no academic research which focused on poker players could be found. The aim of this paper is then to be a preliminary study into how those players who derive all or the majority of their income from poker talk about the subject and themselves. The data set consisted of semi-structured interviews with five professional players. The results show that the discussion over poker players in this data set can be classified into five different themes. The themes found were: cowboy, <b>normal</b> <b>worker,</b> gambler, sportsman and intellectual combatant. The cowboy repertoire cantered around living on the outside of polite society and etching out a living by using one's cunning and wit. The <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> approach then saw poker as being similar to most other jobs, involving long hours and hard work. The gambler theme viewed poker players more like traditional gamblers where everything is always placed on the turn of a few cards. The sportsman approach saw professional players more along the lines of other top athletes and considered them to have entertainment value on television. The intellectual combatant theme considered poker as way of measuring one's mental capacities and money was considered a secondary goal. An ideological dilemma was also found in the data. It revolved around whether professional poker players were moral, worthwhile members of society, or alternatively amoral, drains on society. The themes mentioned above were all used when taking a stance on this dilemma. Key works in this paper were those texts by Jokinen, Juhlia and Suoninen which dealt with discourse analysis and those by Potter and Wetherell. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|At present, our {{knowledge}} of the genetic factors that are responsible for noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is still limited, especially compared with the relatively well-studied environmental factors. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that several genetic mutations could determine an individual and intrinsic predisposition to noise damage. An important contribution to the study of genetic factors in NIHL derives from laboratory research on genetically modified animals. To date, three loci that contribute to NIHL, have been identified in these strains of mice 10 that contribute to age-related hearing loss, and six loci that promote both. Experimental data obtained in mice have been found and confirmed in humans. The cross-talk between studies in humans and those in model organisms is essential in this field. Genetic polymorphism in several candidate genes showed significant differences between vulnerable and resistant subjects selected among populations of workers exposed to occupational noise. In theory, any gene that weakens the ear functionally or structurally would make it more susceptible to noise damage. The identification and isolation of these genetic factors could have important and practical outcomes. For example, workers genetically predisposed should be more strictly protected against noise, compared with what is requested by actual legislation, which is regulated on the basis of <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> populations...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} variations in individual longevity {{are not well}} understood, even though longevity can be increased substantially by means of diverse experimental manipulations. One of the factors supposed {{to be involved in}} the increase of longevity is a higher stress resistance. To test this hypothesis in a natural system, eusocial insects such as bees or ants are ideally suited. In contrast to most other eusocial insects, ponerine ants show a peculiar life history that comprises the possibility to switch during adult life from a <b>normal</b> <b>worker</b> to a reproductive gamergate, therewith increasing their life expectancy significantly. Results: We show that increased resistance against major stressors, such as reactive oxygen species and infection accompanies the switch from a life-history trait with normal lifespan to one with a longer life expectancy. A short period of social isolation was sufficient to enhance stress resistance of workers from the ponerine ant species Harpegnathos saltator significantly. All ant groups with increased stress resistances (reproducing gamergates and socially isolated workers) have lower catalase activities and glutathione levels than normal workers. Therewith, these ants resemble the characteristics of the youngest ants in the colony. Conclusions: Social insects with their specific life history including a switch from normal workers to reproducing gamergates during adult life are well suited for ageing research. The regulation of stress resistance in gamergates seeme...|$|E

There axe five departments in the agency: administration, residential services, human services, developmental services, and adult services. The first three of these departments comprise the main offices and provide general services to all clients involved {{in any of the}} agency's programs throughout the county. The administrative branch provides support services such as transportation, financial records, general coordination of programs, food service, and maintenance services. Residential service personnel run group homes in the community, respite services with community volunteers, and life skill training for adults. A "simulated living" apartment is included to teach basic living skills to clients in a "normal" setting. The human services department handles clients of all age groups and does intake and referral; diagnosis and evaluation; provides counseling services and coordinates recreational programs. Caseworkers prepare Individual Habilitation Plans for clients on an annual basis. The developmental and adult service departments both provide a number of programs which vary according to client age, level of retardation, level of academic skill, and level of vocational skill. This facility will include two related programs: a developmental workshop and an adult (sheltered) workshop. The developmental workshop is provided for adults whose productivity level is less than 25 % of a <b>normal</b> <b>worker.</b> Clients progress through three components: the education component which teaches academic skills; the prevocational component which provides training in basic job skills such as counting, being on time, coordination, etc [...] .; and finally to the work component where the client is paid wages and develops skills in production quality and in recognizing supervisors. Clients who achieve the necessary level of productivity are then placed in a sheltered workshop run by the adult services department. The emphasis is no longer on academic or self-help skills but strictly on vocational skills necessary for placement in a normal job in the community. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B.
