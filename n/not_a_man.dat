5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{marriage}} to Margaret of Anjou prompted criticism from Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, because it included {{the surrender of}} Maine and an extended truce with France. York was Henry's cousin through his descent from Edward III sons Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Edmund, Duke of York. This gave York political influence but he was removed from English and French politics through his appointment as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. On returning to England, York was conscious of the fate of Henry's uncle Humphrey {{at the hands of}} the Beauforts and suspicious that Henry intended to nominate Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, as heir presumptive, and recruited military forces. Armed conflict was avoided because York lacked aristocratic support and was forced to swear allegiance to Henry. However, when Henry later underwent a mental breakdown, York was named regent. Henry was trusting and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of war, but Margaret was more assertive and showed open enmity towards Yorkparticularly after the birth of a male heir that resolved the succession question and assured her position.|$|E

5|$|In {{the comic}} book {{adaptation}} of , Batwoman (Kate Kane) appears {{as a member of}} Batman's Insurgency. She is also married to Renee Montoya in this continuity. At the end of the Year Three series she and Huntress fight Wonder Woman of Superman's Regime, with the latter being accidentally killed by the Amazon; while Wonder Woman is shocked by this, a furious Kate beats her into submission. Her grudge towards Wonder Woman continues into Year Four, where she also suffers the death of Renee after she overdosed on enhancement pills. When the Regime and the Greek Gods battle at the Hall of Justice, Kate gets revenge on Wonder Woman by strangling her with her own Lasso of Truth, recreating Huntress' experience. However, while she acknowledged she wants Diana dead, she lets her live as a sign that she is a better person. In Year Five, when an underground resistance is built up and named after the Joker, she confronts them in their hideout and tells them the Joker is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who should be honored. In the conclusion of the series, she seemingly sacrifices herself when she helped transport the other universe's Justice League to their world.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|By 1945, Gardiner was {{considered}} one of the top half-dozen trial lawyers in the province and he commanded high fees. Gardiner was perceived as a stubborn and sometimes acid-tongued negotiator, and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to be crossed lightly as an opponent. Gardiner worked hard at research and marshalled detailed evidence with self-assurance.|$|E
25|$|He was {{not highly}} educated, but a simple man; neither was he covetous for gold, {{but only for}} fame {{and to be a}} good, strong captain. In the wars of New Spain he always took account of the soldiers... and befriended them and helped them. He was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who wore rich clothes, but very plain ones.|$|E
25|$|This theory too had its problems, in {{particular}} the fact that Indra was already evidently a divine figure, and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> in the Mittani treaties, where he appears {{in the company of}} Mitra and Varuna. That again raises more questions since the treaties echo the Rig Veda's invocation of all three as protectors of contract, again, not a property associated with Verethragna.|$|E

25|$|Percy Stallard was {{a bright}} and {{energetic}} man with a vision for his sport. But he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to tolerate argument or those with other views.

25|$|He was {{progressive}} and anti-progressive at once, and likewise at once both {{a critic of}} the Zeitgeist and its most interesting expression. He was, in effect, stranded on a beachhead of his own thinking between past and future. That he was not able, by himself, to fashion a bridge between them is neither surprising, nor, in the end, disappointing. We should see this failure, rather, as an aspect of his genius. He both was and was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of his time.|$|E
25|$|His name is the {{synonym for}} the {{faithful}} discharge of duty. In his business regulations {{he has won}} the respect and admiration of all who know him. As a public officer, when fortunes were within his grasp, not a thought of seizing them entered his mind. He is a man vigorously positive, determined, honest, generous and able. Not a stain has been cast on his name. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> can say a word against him to impeach his qualifications for the Mayoralty of New York.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Josipović {{responded to}} the other side's discrediting tactics based on {{religion}} {{as well as the}} savings fund affair by raising the issue of how Bandić had divorced his wife in 1996 and because of that managed to buy out another apartment from the government with a discount, claiming Bandić violated the most sacred sacrament of marriage with the intent of making profit. Bandić responded in outrage saying he went through great emotional pain during his divorce saying Josipović was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> unless he apologized.|$|E
25|$|I {{am proud}} of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured.

And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist {{because they want to}} preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm...

25|$|Sweet Honey in the Rock {{recorded}} Truth's song in 1993 {{on their}} 20th anniversary album, Still on the Journey. Bernice Johnson Reagon, Sweet Honey's founder, renamed the song “Sojourner's Battle Hymn.” Truth's biographers Erlene Stetson and Linda David describe the song as “rousing, brashly defiant, irreverent and joyous,” and characterized Sweet Honey's version as “stirringly performed.” In 2006 the Sojourner Truth Institute and Heritage Battle Creek produced a CD, Am I <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> and a Brother? Songs of Freedom North and South, with talented local singers and musicians from Battle Creek, Michigan, including a rendition of “The Valiant Soldiers” by Carolyn Ballard.|$|E

25|$|For all his {{strengths}} though, Zaheer was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{of crises}} unlike his contemporaries, Asif Iqbal and Majid Khan and later Javed Miandad. None of his 12 hundreds came under testing situations {{and apart from}} his 80 at Guyana against the West Indies in 1977, even his fifties were generally fair-weather efforts. His reputation was forged by his four double-hundreds, including two big ones in England, and two high-scoring series against India at home, apart from which he was generally inconsistent, except when playing county cricket, a fact surprisingly lost {{on some of the}} most seasoned Pakistani experts including Qamar Ahmed who found his consistency at Test level 'phenomenal'.|$|E
25|$|The obscure word sōpiō (gen. sōpiōnis) {{seemed to}} mean a sexualized {{caricature}} with an abnormally large penis, such as the Romans were known to draw. It appears in Catullus 37: frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam ("I will draw sopios {{on the front of}} the tavern") and in graffiti from Pompeii: ut merdas edatis, qui scripseras sopionis ("whoever drew sopios, let him eat shit!'") The grammarian Sacerdos preserves a quotation about Pompey, that says quem non pudet et rubet, non est homo, sed sopio ("whoever is not ashamed, and does not blush, is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> but a sopio.") Sōpiō would appear to describe drawings such as that of the god Mercury in the illustration.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E
