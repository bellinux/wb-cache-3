Author Peter Lavezzoli writes that, with the success of the live album and Saul Swimmer's concert documentary, which opened in US cinemas in March 1972, Indian classical music reached its largest Western audience to date through the Concert for Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Karl Dean drafted {{plans for}} {{financing}} the stadium and acquiring the necessary {{land from the}} state. The deal involved the Metropolitan Government of <b>Nashville</b> <b>and</b> Davidson County (Metro) receiving the state-owned Sulphur Dell property—then in use as a parking lot for state employees—in exchange for paying the state $18million {{for the construction of}} a 1,000-car parking garage on the site and $5million for an underground parking garage below the proposed new state library and archives.

5|$|An {{anthropomorphic}} cougar named Ozzie was the team's mascot from 1997 to 2014. The original Ozzie {{came from}} the Class A Kane County Cougars minor league team, which had an extra mascot costume. The surplus cougar outfit was sent to <b>Nashville,</b> <b>and,</b> after building a fan following during Ozzie's first season, team management decided to make him the permanent mascot. The original Ozzie costume was brown, but a new yellow costume was introduced in 1998. Ozzie wore the same style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. Ozzie was retired when the Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2014, although he continued to make appearances during the 2014 to 2015 off-season.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, The Greencards {{relocated}} from Austin to Nashville, to {{be closer}} to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to <b>Nashville</b> <b>and</b> work on their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas {{on the way back to}} Austin, but with no serious injuries.|$|E

5|$|Greer Stadium {{was home}} to a rare {{baseball}} occurrence on August 6 and August 7, 1988, when <b>Nashville</b> <b>and</b> Indianapolis exchanged no-hitters on back-to-back nights. First, Indianapolis' Randy Johnson and Pat Pacillo combined for a no-hit loss against the Sounds, a 1–0Nashville win. That game was won by Nashville when Lenny Harris walked to first base, stole second base, stole third base, and then came home, scoring on a groundout. The next night, Nashville's Jack Armstrong pitched a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0Sounds victory. This {{was the first time}} in American Association history that teams played in back-to-back no-hit games, and was the third no-hitter in Sounds franchise history.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Holloman again {{spent the}} season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17–10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an {{invitation}} to spring training. Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did not appreciate the pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, {{for this reason that}} Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between <b>Nashville</b> <b>and</b> the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year.

The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, becoming the group's tenth album {{to reach the top}} ten of the chart. This release fulfilled R.E.M.'s contractual obligations to Warner Bros., and the band began recording material without a contract a few months later with the possible intention of self-releasing the work.|$|E

5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued {{that they were in}} a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult.
