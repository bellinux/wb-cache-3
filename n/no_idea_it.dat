He later {{explained}} to media {{that he wanted}} to make the video available to his family and had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> would become popular online. CNN reported that after its appearance on YouTube, the video was viewed over 200,000 times in its first 48 hours online. This more than doubled the next day, and less than a week later it had over 900,000 total views. BBC News observed that Capaldi's message had become a viral video, and ITV News described response to the video as a global phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Stockholm and Andrea Doria were {{experiencing}} different weather conditions {{immediately prior to}} the collision. The collision occurred {{in an area of}} the northern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts, where heavy and intermittent fog is common. Although Andrea Doria had been engulfed in the fog for several hours, Stockholm had only recently entered the bank and was still acclimating to atmospheric conditions. The officer in charge of Stockholm incorrectly assumed that his inability to see the other vessel was due to conditions other than fog, such as the other ship being a very small fishing vessel or a 'blacked-out' warship on maneuvers. He testified that he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> was another passenger liner speeding through fog.|$|E

25|$|The {{owner of}} the {{property}} in 1614 did not alter or further publicize the tomb. He must have resealed it, hid the entrance and kept its location a secret, for whatever reasons, as it disappeared from public knowledge and was lost again, despite publication of the inscription. In 1780 the then owners of the vineyard, the brothers Sassi, who apparently had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> was there, broke into the tomb again during remodelling of their wine cellar. They opened it to the leading scholars of the day. Someone, perhaps them, fragmented the slabs covering the loculi, with the obvious intent of accessing the contents, being careful to preserve the inscriptions. If the act is to {{be attributed to the}} Sassi, and if the motive of treasure-hunting is to be imputed to them, they found no treasure. What they did find they turned over to the Vatican under Pope Pius VI, including the gold signet ring taken off the finger bone of Barbatus. Apparently some masonry was placed in the tomb with an obscure intent.|$|E
500|$|... "Grey Matters" [...] {{was written}} by screenwriters Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz, and was {{directed}} by Jeannot Szwarc. In an interview the following year, Miller noted that [...] "Your characters will often assert themselves, and remind you who they really are. In 'Grey Matters' there's a moment where pre-madness Walter wakes up in the chair — that beat emerged on the page. We had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> {{was going to be}} in the script until we were writing the scene. As a writer, you live for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Time Team {{was first}} {{broadcast}} in 1994, and would attract around four million viewers per episode, with Aston becoming [...] "an icon to the viewing public." [...] Writing in The Guardian, Christopher Dyer noted that Aston's [...] "unkempt hair and beard, multicoloured sweaters and Black Country accent made him instantly recognisable" [...] to the British public, describing him as [...] "a popular success" [...] who had attracted [...] "a large public following". Aston acted as chief archaeological {{adviser to the}} programme {{until the end of}} series nineteen, starring in almost every episode, although he would later comment that when it first started he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> would continue for so long. Aston enjoyed working with the Time Team crew, commenting that they were [...] "a great gang... There are some real party people." ...|$|E

5000|$|Now, 'craic' is {{interpreted}} as a specifically and quintessentially Irish form of fun. The adoption of the Gaelic spelling has reinforced {{the sense that this}} is an independent word (homophone) rather than a separate sense of the original word (polysemy). Frank McNally of The Irish Times has said of the word, [...] "most Irish people now have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it's</b> foreign." ...|$|R

[...] Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career, saying that the media now had confidence in her own work, after the death of Gianni Versace. She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success. The next day she [...] was everywhere and people were talking about her in that dress. It was one of those moments like the one that Gianni [...] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes-pins." [...] The dress has been referred to many times as [...] "notorious" [...] and [...] "infamous" [...] because of its boldness.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, {{freelance}} reporter Randy Shilts {{completed his}} first book: {{a biography of}} Milk, titled The Mayor of Castro Street. Shilts wrote the book while {{unable to find a}} steady job as an openly gay reporter. The Times of Harvey Milk, a documentary film based on the book's material, won the 1984 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. Director Rob Epstein spoke later about why he chose the subject of Milk's life: [...] "At the time, {{for those of us who}} lived in San Francisco, it felt like it was life changing, that all the eyes of the world were upon us, but in fact most of the world outside of San Francisco had <b>no</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> was just a really brief, provincial, localized current events story that the mayor and a city council member in San Francisco were killed. It didn't have much reverberation." ...|$|E
500|$|Love {{claimed she}} was misquoted by Hirschberg, and {{asserted}} {{that she had}} immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant. Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't say no to something like that. I had a sense of foreboding about it, but I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> as gonna be as bad as it was. [...] done a lot of stupid, self-destructive things, but I don't believe she screwed around with her pregnancy. Those allegations were anonymous." [...] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.|$|E

500|$|Recurring {{guest star}} Mike O'Malley {{appears in the}} episode as Kurt's father Burt, sharing a scene with Colfer and Monteith which Colfer has {{described}} as the most emotional scene of the series thus far, explaining: [...] "Reading it on paper I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> {{was going to be}} that intense. Once I got into it, then I kind of realised, 'Oh, there's such a bigger meaning behind this. Oh my God, this is so dramatic'." [...] Colfer called [...] "Theatricality" [...] his favorite episode of the whole series. Other recurring characters who appear in [...] "Theatricality" [...] are glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton, who gets his first lines in this episode), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), school athletes and bullies Karofsky and Azimio, Principal Figgins, Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran and Finn's mother Carole Hudson.|$|E
500|$|A failed early promotional attempt for {{the single}} took place after the Beatles' all-night {{recording}} session on 7–8 August 1968. With Apple Boutique having closed a week before, McCartney and his girlfriend, Francie Schwartz, painted Hey Jude/Revolution across its large, whitewashed shop windows. The words were mistaken for anti-Semitic graffiti (since Jude means [...] "Jew" [...] in German), leading to complaints from the local Jewish community, and the windows being smashed by passers-by. Discussing the episode in The Beatles Anthology, McCartney explained {{that he had been}} motivated by the location – [...] "Great opportunity. Baker Street, millions of buses going around…" [...] – and added: [...] "I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> meant 'Jew', {{but if you look at}} footage of Nazi Germany, Juden Raus was written in whitewashed windows with a Star of David. I swear it never occurred to me." [...] According to Barry Miles, McCartney caused further controversy in his comments to Alan Smith of the NME that month when he said: [...] "Starvation in India doesn't worry me one bit, not one iota … And it doesn't worry you, if you're honest. You just pose." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E

2500|$|Judith O'Dea as Barbra: Judith O'Dea, a 23-year-old {{commercial}} and stage actress, once worked for Hardman and Eastman in Pittsburgh. O'Dea was in Hollywood seeking {{to enter the}} movie business {{at the time of}} audition. Starring in the film was a positive experience for her, she remarked in an interview. She admitted that horror movies terrified her, particularly Vincent Price's House of Wax (1953). Besides acting, O'Dea performed her own stunts, which she jokingly claimed amounted to [...] "lots of running". [...] "I honestly had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> would have such a lasting impact on our culture", assessing Night of the Living Dead. She was just as surprised by the renown the film brought her: [...] "People treat you differently. [...] ho-hum Judy O'Dea until they realize [...] Barbra from Night of the Living Dead. All of a sudden [...] not so ho-hum anymore!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The duo dropped [...] "The Music Man" [...] melody, {{and wrote}} a new chorus. They at first {{attempted}} to set Kehoe's lyrics {{to the tune of}} their 1982 hit single, [...] "Arthur Daley (e's Alright)", creating an alternative version initially entitled [...] "Captain Kirk (He's Alright)". Unsatisfied, they sought to create something original, locking themselves away for a week to write [...] "Star Trekkin'", based on an increasing tempo seen previously in Rolf Harris' [...] "The Court of King Caractacus". They sought to have it recorded professionally, but were received unfavourably by potential recording labels. Instead, they recorded it at O'Conner's and Brian O'Shaughnessy's Bark Studios in Walthamstow, East London. The arrangement was by Bill C. Martin, and the rest of The Firm was made up of Dev Douglas and Peter Sills. O'Shaughnessy later said [...] "One of the greatest highlights of my career was producing 'Star Trekkin. The record was produced to mock the series and we had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> {{was going to be a}} big hit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey was {{surprised}} by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau [...] "Clexa". [...] "I was on Instagram or something and I checked my tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had <b>no</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> was the first time I realized I was a figure for that community," [...] said Debnam-Carey. She called this [...] "an honor" [...] and [...] "flattering," [...] and added, [...] "It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of. I'm all for it." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew she had that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, [...] "Not that much, no, that's amazing." [...] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.|$|E
