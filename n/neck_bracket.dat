50|$|Cymbaloms {{are most}} {{commonly}} played with two dulcimer hammers, one held in each hand. While playing with eight bowhammers and two thumb picks, Masley {{has been known}} also to use pan pipes attached to a <b>neck</b> <b>bracket,</b> as well as rhythm instruments such as shakers and rattles attached to his legs.|$|E
5000|$|Zsasz is {{not seen}} in any major villainous role again until Detective Comics #815, {{released}} in March 2006, entitled [...] "Victims". Before a quarterly psychiatric review, Zsasz kills his guards with metal poles attached to his <b>neck</b> <b>bracket</b> and escapes to kill again. Batman hunts for Zsasz, which proves unsuccessful until Zsasz gains access to a charity event (attended by Bruce Wayne) and stabs his beloved butler, Alfred Pennyworth, in the stomach. Wayne drives Alfred to the hospital, saving his life. To lure Zsasz to him, Wayne holds {{a press conference in}} which he announces that Alfred is still alive. Having already made a scar for Alfred, Zsasz realises that his tally is off by one (Zsasz remarks: [...] "My skin... its crawling... every inch of it feels... wrong.") During the second part of [...] "Victims" [...] (Detective Comics #816), after a fight with Batman, Zsasz proceeds to the hospital to finish off Alfred. Batman catches him off-guard and knocks him unconscious, thus saving Alfreds life and sending Zsasz back to Arkham. Throughout this appearance, Cliff Chiangs artwork portrays Zsasz with visual elements commonly associated with the skinhead subculture, including work boots resembling Doc Martens, tight jeans, a white tank top, suspenders or [...] "braces", and a close-cropped hairstyle. Additionally, Chiangs portrayal of Zsasz is more outwardly physically imposing than the gaunt, wiry physique created by Breyfogle and favored by most subsequent artists. No dialogue in the story arc references Zsasz being a skinhead nor does it explain his increased musculature, and it is likely these visual elements were the decision of the artist.|$|E
