25|$|Direct <b>nitration</b> of {{pyridine}} requires harsh {{conditions and}} has very low yields. The 3-nitropyridine {{can be obtained}} instead by reacting pyridine with dinitrogen pentoxide in presence of sodium. Pyridine derivatives wherein the nitrogen atom is screened sterically and/or electronically {{can be obtained by}} <b>nitration</b> with nitronium tetrafluoroborate (NO2BF4). In this way, 3-nitropyridine can be obtained via the synthesis of 2,6-dibromopyridine followed by removal of the bromine atoms.|$|E
25|$|Diphenyl ether is {{the organic}} {{compound}} with the formula O(C6H5)2. The molecule {{is subject to}} reactions typical of other phenyl rings, including hydroxylation, <b>nitration,</b> halogenation, sulfonation, and Friedel–Crafts alkylation or acylation. This simple diaryl ether enjoys a variety of niche applications.|$|E
25|$|Uracil readily {{undergoes}} regular reactions including oxidation, <b>nitration,</b> and alkylation. While in {{the presence}} of phenol (PhOH) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), uracil can be visualized in ultraviolet light. Uracil also has the capability to react with elemental halogens {{because of the presence of}} more than one strongly electron donating group.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} phase {{inversion}} during semibatch aromatic <b>nitrations</b> is experimentally characterized and analysed. The influence of various parameters, i. e. interfacial area, effective heat-transfer coefficient and overall mass-transfer coefficient, is studied. The implications for optimizing <b>nitrations</b> are discussed from performance and safety points of view. The accumulation of unreacted nitric acid {{can be dangerous}} if accompanied by a phase inversion, owing {{to the fact that}} the rate may increase suddenly...|$|R

50|$|Trimethyl {{phosphate}} {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} for aromatic halogenations and <b>nitrations</b> as required for the preparation of pesticides and pharmaceuticals.|$|R
25|$|Direct sulfonation of {{pyridine}} is {{even more}} difficult than direct <b>nitration.</b> However, pyridine-3-sulfonic acid can be obtained at acceptable yield by boiling pyridine in an excess of sulfuric acid at 320°C. Reaction with the SO3 group also facilitates addition of sulfur to the nitrogen atom, especially {{in the presence of}} a mercury(II) sulfate catalyst.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>nitration</b> and sulfonation, the direct bromination and chlorination of pyridine proceed well. The reaction of pyridine with molecular bromine in sulfuric acid at 130°C readily produced 3-bromopyridine. The yield is lower for 3-chloropyridine upon chlorination with molecular chlorine {{in the presence of}} aluminium chloride at 100°C. Both 2-bromopyridine and 2-chloropyridine can be produced by direct reaction with halogen with a palladium(II) chloride catalyst.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{aromatic}} <b>nitration</b> to afford picric acid from the trinitration of phenol {{was performed in}} the early 19th century, though {{it is possible that}} Johann Rudolf Glauber may have reported it much earlier. Nitroesters would find use in gun propellant formulation. Nitroaromatics like picric acid eventually found use in explosive cannon shells owing to their ability to withstand the severe shock of firing.|$|E
50|$|Nitrosonium, NO+, is {{sometimes}} confused with nitronium, NO, the active agent in <b>nitrations.</b> These species are quite different, however. Nitronium {{is a more}} potent electrophile than is nitrosonium, as anticipated {{by the fact that}} the former is derived from a strong acid (nitric acid) and the latter from a weak acid (nitrous acid).|$|R
40|$|A review {{has been}} given of {{molecular}} orbital theory and of its application of calculations of ground and excited state properties of substituted aromatic hydrocar bons. The <b>nitrations</b> of ortho, meta and para-xylsnes and naphthalene have been studied, alone and in competitive reactions with benzene, using, nitric acid/acetic acid as the nitrating medium. Partial rate factors have been determined relative to benzene. Competitive <b>nitrations</b> {{have been carried out}} between: naphthalene and 2 -flucro- 6 -mathylnaphthalene, naphthalene and 2 -acetamido- 6 -methylnaphthalene, 2 -methylnaphthalene and 2, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene, 2 -methoxy- 6 -methylnaphthalene and 2, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene. Partial rate factors have been determined relative to naphthalene. Proton magnetic resonance studies at 60, 100 and 220 Mc/s have been made of a series of 2, 6 -disubstituted naphthalenes. An attempt has been made to interpret the experimental data by detailed Parlser-Parr-Pople self-consistent field molecular orbital calculations...|$|R
50|$|Selectivity {{can be a}} {{challenge}} in <b>nitrations</b> because as a rule more than one compound may result but only one is desired, so alternative products act as contaminants or are simply wasted. Accordingly, it is desirable to design syntheses with suitable selectivity; for example, by controlling the reaction conditions, fluorenone can be selectively trinitrated or tetranitrated.|$|R
25|$|Nitric acid is {{the primary}} reagent used for <b>nitration</b> – the {{addition}} of a nitro group, typically to an organic molecule. While some resulting nitro compounds are shock- and thermally-sensitive explosives, a few are stable enough to be used in munitions and demolition, while others are still more stable and used as pigments in inks and dyes. Nitric acid is also commonly used as a strong oxidizing agent.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in the European theater, Winters {{worked for}} his close wartime friend Captain Lewis Nixon at Nixon's family business, Nixon <b>Nitration</b> Works of Edison, New Jersey, rising to become general manager in 1950. On May 16, 1948, Winters married Ethel Estoppey and {{continued}} to pursue his education through the GI Bill, attending a number of business and personnel management courses at Rutgers University.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{reacting}} {{sulfuric acid}} with potassium nitrate {{can be used}} to produce nitric acid and a precipitate of potassium bisulfate. When combined with nitric acid, sulfuric acid acts both as an acid and a dehydrating agent, forming the nitronium ion , which is important in <b>nitration</b> reactions involving electrophilic aromatic substitution. This type of reaction, where protonation occurs on an oxygen atom, is important in many organic chemistry reactions, such as Fischer esterification and dehydration of alcohols.|$|E
50|$|Dinitrogen pentoxide is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula N2O5. Also known as nitrogen pentoxide, N2O5 {{is one of}} the binary nitrogen oxides, a family of compounds that only contain nitrogen and oxygen. It is an unstable and potentially dangerous oxidizer that once was used as a reagent when dissolved in chloroform for <b>nitrations</b> but has largely been superseded by NO2BF4 (nitronium tetrafluoroborate).|$|R
40|$|Online {{analytical}} {{techniques were}} used to monitor fast and strong exothermic <b>nitrations</b> in microreactors. Mechanistic studies were conducted by using online FTIR microscopy to identify key intermediates in microchannels. IR spectroscopy, thermography and HPLC {{were used to}} investigate the influence of changing process conditions, to control the completeness of conversion and to monitor {{the stability of the}} entire microreaction process...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally {{raised by}} the {{toxicological}} implications of excess exposure to nitrogen oxides and nitrite ions, interest in the chemistry of biological nitrosations and <b>nitrations</b> has gained new impetus {{in the past decade}} following the discovery of nitric oxide (NO) as an endogenous physiological regulator and an amplifier of oxidative stress-dependent toxic processes. This account is concerned with an overview of the reactions of nitrosating and nitrating agents of pathophysiological relevance with two potential biochemical targets, namely polyunsaturated fatty acids and catecholamines. The results of model studies on the mechanism of the antinitrosating activity of caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid are also presented...|$|R
25|$|A unit {{operation}} {{is a physical}} step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as crystallization, filtration, drying and evaporation) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors. On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a {{unit operation}}. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as <b>nitration</b> and oxidation) involve the conversion of material by biochemical, thermochemical and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called process engineers.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{powerful}} oxidizing acid, nitric acid reacts violently with many organic {{materials and the}} reactions may be explosive. The hydroxyl group will typically strip a hydrogen from the organic molecule to form water, and the remaining nitro group takes the hydrogen's place. <b>Nitration</b> of organic compounds with nitric acid is the primary method of synthesis of many common explosives, such as nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene (TNT). As very many less stable byproducts are possible, these reactions must be carefully thermally controlled, and the byproducts removed to isolate the desired product.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} other roles of complex I activity in the brain. Andreazza et al. (2010) found {{that the level of}} complex I activity was significantly decreased in patients with bipolar disorder, but not in patients with depression or schizophrenia. They found that patients with bipolar disorder showed increased protein oxidation and <b>nitration</b> in their prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that future studies should target complex I for potential therapeutic studies for bipolar disorder. Similarly, Moran et al. (2010) found that patients with severe complex I deficiency showed decreased oxygen consumption rates and slower growth rates. However, they found that mutations in different genes in complex I lead to different phenotypes, thereby explaining the variations of pathophysiological manifestations of complex I deficiency.|$|E
50|$|This article covers protein {{engineering}} of cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes. P450s {{are involved in}} a range of biochemical catabolic and anabolic process. Natural P450s can perform several different types of chemical reactions including hydroxylations, N,O,S-dealkylations, epoxidations, sulfoxidations, aryl-aryl couplings, ring contractions and expansions, oxidative cyclizations, alcohol/aldehyde oxidations, desaturations, nitrogen oxidations, decarboxylations, <b>nitrations,</b> as well as oxidative and reductive dehalogenations. Engineering efforts often strive for 1) improved stability 2) improved activity 3) improved substrate scope 4) enabled ability to catalyze unnatural reactions.P450 engineering is an emerging field in the areas of chemical biology and synthetic organic chemistry (chemoenzymatic).|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of microfluidics in organic chemistry {{is a valuable}} tool to access new synthesis pathways and to break limitations set by traditional batch chemistry. In the past, the majority of research focused on solving problems associated with individual reactions. It is necessary to advance the field by incorporating flow chemistry in longer multistep syntheses to open more direct paths towards complicated compounds. Several strategies were developed {{to meet the demands}} of a four step synthesis, which includes biphasic <b>nitrations,</b> gaseous substrates and very fast reactions on multifunctional molecules. A unique micro flow setup was applied in each reaction to meet its’ specific requirements...|$|R
50|$|Formed in 1977, the Design Institute for Emergency Relief Systems was a {{consortium}} of 29 companies {{under the auspices of}} the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) that developed methods for the design of emergency relief systems to handle runaway reactions. Its purpose was to develop the technology and methods needed for sizing pressure relief systems for chemical reactors, particularly those in which exothermic reactions are carried out. Such reactions include many classes of industrially important processes including polymerizations, <b>nitrations,</b> diazotizations, sulphonations, epoxidations, aminations, esterifications, neutralizations and many others. Pressure relief systems can be difficult to design, not least because what is expelled can be gas/vapour, liquid, or a mixture of the two - just as with a can of carbonated drink when it is suddenly opened. For chemical reactions, it requires extensive knowledge of both chemical reaction hazards and fluid flow.|$|R
25|$|The tumor {{microenvironment}} (TME) features prevents {{the recruitment of}} T cells to the tumor. Ways include chemokine CCL2 <b>nitration,</b> which traps T cells in the stroma. Tumor vasculature helps tumors preferentially recruit other immune cells over T cells, in part through endothelial cell (EC)–specific expression of FasL, ETBR, and B7H3. Myelomonocytic and tumor cells can up-regulate expression of PD-L1, partly driven by hypoxic conditions and cytokine production, such as IFNβ. Aberrant metabolite production in the TME, such as the pathway regulation by IDO, can affect T cell functions directly and indirectly via cells such as Tregcells. CD8 cells can be suppressed by B cells regulation of TAM phenotypes. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have multiple TME functions, in part through extracellular matrix (ECM)–mediated T cell trapping and CXCL12-regulated T cell exclusion.|$|E
25|$|RDX was {{reported}} in 1898 by Georg Friedrich Henning, who obtained a German patent (patent No. 104280) for its manufacture by nitrolysis of hexamine (hexamethylenetetramine) with concentrated nitric acid. In this patent, the medical properties of RDX were mentioned; however, three further German patents obtained by Henning in 1916 proposed its use in smokeless propellants. The German military started investigating its use in 1920, referring to it as hexogen. Research and development findings were not published further until Edmund von Herz, described as an Austrian and later a German citizen, obtained a British patent in 1921 and a United States patent in 1922. Both patent claims were initiated in Austria; and described the manufacture of RDX by nitrating hexamethylenetetramine. The British patent claims included the manufacture of RDX by <b>nitration,</b> its use with or without other explosives, and its use as a bursting charge and as an initiator. The US patent claim was {{for the use of}} a hollow explosive device containing RDX and a detonator cap containing RDX. In the 1930s, Germany developed improved production methods.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas is a {{rapid and}} {{effective}} sterilant for use against {{a wide range}} of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO2 gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and ambient pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of DNA in the spore core through <b>nitration</b> of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO2. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas. NO2 has a boiling point of 21°C at sea level, which results in a relatively high saturated vapour pressure at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO2 may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO2 is often referred to by the name of its dimer, dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no condensation occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle. NO2 is also less corrosive than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.|$|E
5000|$|Microreactors {{typically}} have heat exchange coefficients {{of at least}} 1 megawatt per cubic meter per kelvin, up to 500 MW m−3 K−1 vs. a few kilowatts in conventional glassware (1 l flask ~10 kW m−3 K−1). Thus, microreactors can remove heat much more efficiently than vessels and even critical reactions such as <b>nitrations</b> can be performed safely at high temperatures. Hot spot temperatures {{as well as the}} duration of high temperature exposition due to exothermicity decreases remarkably. Thus, microreactors may allow better kinetic investigations, because local temperature gradients affecting reaction rates are much smaller than in any batch vessel. Heating and cooling a microreactor is also much quicker and operating temperatures can be as low as −100 °C. As a result of the superior heat transfer, reaction temperatures may be much higher than in conventional batch-reactors. Many low temperature reactions as organo-metal chemistry can be performed in microreactors at temperatures of −10 °C rather than −50 °C to −78 °C as in laboratory glassware equipment.|$|R
50|$|Microreactor Technology (MRT), making part of “process intensification”, is a {{relatively}} new tool that is being developed at several universities, as well as leading fine chemical companies, such as Bayer Technology Services, Germany; Clariant, Switzerland; Evonik-Degussa, Germany; DSM, The Netherlands; Lonza, Switzerland; PCAS, France, and Sigma-Aldrich, US. The latter company produces about 50 fine chemicals up to multi-kilogram quantities in microreactors. From a technological point of view, MRT, a.k.a. continuous flow reactors, represents the first breakthrough development in reactor design since the introduction of the stirred-tank reactor, which was used by Perkin & Sons, when they set up a factory on the banks of what was then the Grand Junction Canal in London in 1857 to produce mauveïne, the first-ever synthetic purple dye. For a comprehensive coverage of the subject see Micro Process Engineering. Examples for reactions that have worked in microreactors include aromatics oxidations, diazomethane conversions, Grignards, halogenations, hydrogenations, <b>nitrations</b> and Suzuki couplings. According to experts in the field, 70% of all chemical reactions could be done in microreactors, however only 10-15% are economically justified.|$|R
40|$|Tetranitromethane (TNM), a small aqueous reagent that {{specifically}} modifies solvent-accessible tyrosine residues to o-nitrotyrosine, {{was used to}} probe the topology of the GlyR. Homomers of human α 1 GlyR were recombinantly expressed via a baculovirus system, affinity-purified, and reconstituted in lipid vesicles of defined composition. The native-like reconstituted receptors were then reacted with TNM, and GlyR reaction products were isolated by SDS−PAGE. After proteolytic digestion, TNM-labeled residues were identified using mass spectrometry by observing the mass shift corresponding to the nitrate moiety. In this manner, we have identified TNM modifications of tyrosine residues at positions 24, 75, 78, 161, 223, and 228 in the receptor. Of significance, <b>nitrations</b> at Tyr 223 and Tyr 228 occur within the first putative transmembrane helix (M 1) of the receptor, and their labeling suggests a nonhelical secondary structure for M 1 for the glycine receptor. In a previously published report [Leite et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 13683], we also identified proteolytic cleavage sites within M 1. Taken together, these studies support a topological model where the “historical” M 1 segment cannot be entirely α-helical and may contain an extramembranous surface loop. Furthermore, we have also identified a tyrosine modification (Tyr 161) within a region of the N-terminal domain critical in agonist and antagonist binding...|$|R

40|$|Microstructured {{reactors}} {{are well}} known to provide far better heat exchange characteristics than attainable in macroscopic batch or flow-through reactors due to their high surface-to-volume ratios. In the last decade, {{a large number of}} studies have impressively demonstrated that the accumulation of strong reaction heats and hot spots, which result in unwanted side, subsequent and decomposition reactions, can be successfully surpressed in microreactors. Consequently, the use of microreactors greatly reduces the hazardous potential associated with reactions that are highly exothermic or potentially explosive. Greater safety is also attained with toxic substances due to the small hold-up of microfluidic devices. Here we report on the use of microreactors for the safe processing of strong exothermic reactions in the liquid and liquid/liquid regime, such as <b>nitrations,</b> oxidations, esterifications, etc. The hazardous potential of such reactions often arises from the huge reaction enthalpy and/or the thermolability of the reaction products or intermediates. Microreactors have been particularly used in our studies to systematically investigate strong exothermic reactions under unusual process conditions such as higher temperatures, higher concentrations or varied stoichiometries which are not possible to apply on a macroscopic scale. Such parameter screenings provide valuable routes for process intensification in terms of yield and selectivity but also with respect to energy savings and improved safety. Hence, microreactors have been deliberately used as tools for safety analyses to investigate experimentally worst case scenarios at the threshold of decomposition and runaway reactions. Moreover, we use microreactors also as measurement tools to quantify the heat release under strong exothermic process conditions. For this purpose, we have developed a continuous microL-flowthrough calorimeter which consists of a microreactor embedded between thermoelectric modules (Seebeck and Peltier elements). This new mirol-calorimeter has a very small time constant of about 2 s which is by a factor of 20 - 30 smaller than that of conventional reaction calorimeters. Hence, it is ideally suited to measure enthalpies of fast and highly exothermic reactions under both isothermal and continuous process conditions...|$|R

One mole of hexamethylenetetramine could produce at most one mole of RDX.
