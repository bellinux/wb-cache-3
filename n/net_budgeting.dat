40|$|Each year, small Member States {{receive a}} disproportionate share of the European Union's (EU's) budget. A {{prominent}} explanation for this is that Council decision-making involves a healthy dose of vote selling, whereby large Member States offer small states generous fiscal transfers in exchange for influence over policy. But nobody has investigated whether <b>net</b> <b>budget</b> contributors actually get anything for their money. In this paper I identify the vote selling model's observable implications and find virtually no evidence consistent with Council cash-for-votes exchanges. I also show that a compromise model – the leading model of EU decision-making to date – modified to incorporate vote selling does not outperform a standard one that assumes votes are traded rather than sold. Taken together, the results suggest that Council decision-making operates with little or no vote selling, and that regardless of whatever they think they might be buying, <b>net</b> <b>budget</b> contributors get little or nothing in return for their money. These findings call for further investigation into how Member States approach the issue of fiscal transfers, and into the factors other than formal voting weight that affect the power of actors engaged in EU decision-making...|$|R

The formulation captures all topological paths in a linear sized LP and thus, heuristic net weights or <b>net</b> <b>budgets</b> are not necessary. Additionally, explicit enumeration {{of a large number}} of paths is avoided. The flow begins with a given placement and iteratively extracts timing-critical sub-circuits, optimally places the sub-circuit by LP and applies a timing-driven legalizer.

40|$|QM-AI- 11 - 005 -EN-C (print) /QM-AI- 11 - 005 -EN-N (online) THINK Policy Briefs are {{abbreviated}} {{versions of}} THINK Reports. In the current context, where public budgets are overstretched {{due to the}} economic crisis, there is a pressing {{need to understand the}} fiscal implications of climate policies. Policies intended to achieve decarbonization will impact both sides of a country’s budget via changes in the tax levels and composition of taxes on the one hand, as well as transfer payments and direct investments on the other. Back-of-the-envelope calculations – comparing net public revenues in 2020 for a Baseline and an Enhanced Policy scenario – show that the additional revenues from carbon pricing and the reduction in revenues from excise taxes on fossil fuels clearly dominate other direct and indirect effects of policies on public budgets such as the additional expenditures dedicated to RD&D targeting low-carbon technologies. The aggregated <b>net</b> <b>budget</b> impact of all direct and indirect effects of new climate policies implemented in the Enhanced Policy Scenario on public budgets in 2020 for the EU- 27 as a whole – given our simplyfying assumptions – amounts to additional net public revenues of about € 12. 6 bn (0. 09 % in terms of the EU- 27 GDP) under medium-level abatement costs. This makes a non-negligible impact which is nevertheless much lower than the impact on public accounts from changes in main macroeconomic variables over time. Differences among Member States mainly depend on the additional revenues they will obtain from carbon pricing, which are driven by three main factors: the carbon intensity of the economy, which is positively correlated with the absolute value of the <b>net</b> <b>budget</b> impact of new policies; the share of non-ETS GHG emissions, which is positively correlated with the <b>net</b> <b>budget</b> impact; and the reduction in GHG emissions resulting from new policies, which is negatively correlated with this impact. Countries most significantly affected, both positively and negatively, are among the “new” Member States in the EU- 27. In contrast, the impact of new climate policies on large EU- 15 economies would be generally positive and typically in line with average EU values. Therefore, authorities from the EU- 15 may consider the option of sharing the economic burden of the transition to a low-carbon economy among EU countries, taking into account their economic strength.

40|$|A {{sediment}} {{budget of}} Pegasus Bay {{is presented in}} order to build up a comprehensive account of sediment movements and potential shoreline behaviour of the region. The bay has been extensively researched on a local scale but very few works examine the bay as a entire unit. This thesis gives an overview of the bay as a whole as well as examining site specific areas which leads to the derivation of a sediment budget for Pegasus Bay. The principal objective is to establish and quantify the sources, sinks and transfers of sediment within the Pegasus Bay coastal system. This is achieved by establishing annual river yields, estuary and lagoon sedimentation rates; profile volume analysis; longshore transport calculations based on wave observations; and examining sedimentation on the Canterbury Continental Shelf. It is found that the Avon-Heathcote Estuary and Brooklands Lagoon are sinks of sediment, storing 3, 000 m³. yr⁻¹ and 1, 000 m³. yr⁻¹ respectively. The annual river sediment yields are found to be 3, 005, 000 m³. yr⁻¹ with the Waimakariri River contributing 78 %. A predominant southerly component of longshore transport is discovered in the south (281, 000 m³. yr⁻¹) and mid Pegasus Bay (l, 572, 000 m³. yr⁻ ¹) while north Pegasus Bay exhibits net northerly transport (203, 000 m³. yr⁻¹). The onshore/offshore exchange examinations reveal that there is net onshore transport for the bay of 1, 190, 000 m³. yr⁻¹. The gross sediment budget for the region sums to 20, 571, 000 m³. yr⁻¹. The <b>net</b> sediment <b>budget</b> for Pegasus Bay at 5, 843, 000 m³. yr⁻¹ represents 30 % of the gross budget of which rivers are the most significant source contributing 55 % to the <b>net</b> <b>budget.</b> The <b>net</b> <b>budget</b> exhibits a surplus of sediment for the each sector of the bay. This is not reflected in five sectors which are in either an erosionary or equilibrium state. Despite this anomaly a positive correlation between the state of the beach and the amount of surplus for each sector is identified. The relationship is represented by a critical line which marks the point at which a beach may change its state...|$|R

40|$|By {{combining}} CO 2 measurements with hydrographic velocity calculations, the zonal {{and vertical}} variability of meridional fluxes of total alkalinity (TA), total {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (TIC), and anthropogenic CO 2 (dC) are estimated. The resulting CO 2 fluxes are examined in four geostrophic mid-ocean zones {{as well as in}} the Gulf Stream flow through Florida Straits and in the surface ageostrophic Ekman flow. This method allows an estimate of the <b>net</b> <b>budgets</b> of these chemical species in the system considering together the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans north of 24. 5 N. Taking into account the net flux contribution through Bering Strait, total meridional transports of chemical properties across 24. 5 N latitude are also estimated. The slightly divergent <b>net</b> TA <b>budget</b> (460 ± 200 kmol s 1) suggests that the North Atlantic is a small alkalinity source. The divergent TIC budget (2430 ± 200 kmol s 1 or 0. 92 ± 0. 08 GtC yr 1) suggests that the North Atlantic is a source of TIC and therefore a net sink for atmospheric CO 2. This value is twice as large as a previous estimation made from a poorly sampled section. Surprisingly, the North Atlantic Ocean appears to act as a net sink of anthropogenic CO 2 (+ 630 ± 200 kmol s 1 or + 0. 24 ± 0. 08 GtC yr 1) and therefore a weak source of anthropogeni...|$|R

This is equivalent to a net source of 3800 - 3900 Gg yr(- 1), slightly higher than previously estimated.
