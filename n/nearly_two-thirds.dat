There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. <b>Nearly</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} {{efficient}} algorithms for modular reduction to derive novel systolic and non-systolic archi-tectures for polynomial basis finite field multipliers over GF (2 m) {{to be used}} in Reed-Solomon codec. Using the proposed algorithm for unit degree reduction and optimization of implementation of the logic functions in the processing elements (PE), we have derived an efficient bit-parallel systolic design for finite field multiplier which involves <b>nearly</b> <b>two-third</b> of the area-complexity of the existing design having the same time-complexity. The proposed modular reduction algorithms are also used to derive efficient non-systolic serial/parallel designs of field multipliers over GF (28) with different digit-sizes, where the critical path and the hardware-complexity are further reduced by optimizing the implementation of modular reduction operations and finite field accumulations. The proposed bit-serial design involves nearly 55 % of the minimum of area, and half the minimum of area-time complexity of the existing bit-serial designs. Similarly, the proposed digit-serial/parallel designs involve significantly less area, and less area-time complexities compared with the existing designs of the same digit-size. By parallel modular reduction through multiple degrees followed by appropriate logic-level sub-expression sharing; a hardware-efficient regular and modular form of a balanced-tree bit-parallel non-systolic multiplier is also derived. The proposed bit-parallel non-systolic pipelined design involves less than 65 % of the area and <b>nearly</b> <b>two-third</b> of the area-time complexity of the existing bit-parallel design for a Reed-Solomon codec, while the non-pipelined form offers nearly 25 % saving of area with less time-complexity.

40|$|Background: To achieve osteosynthesis of femoral neck {{fractures}} is {{a challenge}} to the treating surgeon. Plethora of devices and methods has been described. Method: A new technique of achieving union of femoral neck fractures by dual-fibular fixation has been reported in 150 patients. The age of the patients ranged from 6 - 75 years. Results: <b>Nearly</b> <b>two-third</b> of these were Garden type II and III with an average follow-up of 120 months. In this series 67 &#x 0025; had good to excellent long term results. Conclusion: Two fibular struts provide autologous bone, filling the whole of the osteopenic femoral neck and prevent the rotational forces. Since the total fixation is biologically active, the technique has proved advantageous even when stable / desirable reduction is not possible and adequate fixation is not achieved, because of posterior communition at the fracture site or due to osteoporosis. Being autologous bone, the twin-fibular graft is advantageous even when there is &#x 2032;subsequent loss of reduction&#x 2032; of the fracture. It is, therefore, suggested that this simple, inexpensive and biological technique has many advantages over the existing methods of fixation of these fractures...|$|R

The contributions of these groups are imperative in cities like Perth where <b>nearly</b> <b>two-third</b> wetlands/bushland ecosystems have {{been lost in the}} past 150 years and the remnant ecosystems are continually under threat from the potential redevelopment.

However, a lower rate of natural growth in population and the need for low-skill labour resulted in a deliberate shift in policy by the Singapore government to allow more foreigners to live and work in the country, and net migration increased in the 1980-1990 period to nearly 200,000.
