5|$|A {{receptor}} for tomato systemin {{was identified}} as a 160KDa leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from A. thaliana, the receptor that brassinolides bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a steroid and a peptide ligand and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses. Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In cu3 mutants of tomato, a <b>null</b> <b>allele</b> with a stop codon present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling. These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton et al. to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived. Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is silenced in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to cu3 mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.|$|E
25|$|Loss-of-{{function}} mutations, {{also called}} inactivating mutations, {{result in the}} gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated). When the allele has a complete loss of function (<b>null</b> <b>allele),</b> it is often called an amorph or amorphic mutation in the Muller's morphs schema. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often recessive. Exceptions are when the organism is haploid, or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product {{is not enough for}} a normal phenotype (this is called haploinsufficiency).|$|E
500|$|Individuals who are {{homozygous}} for {{a specific}} mutation (K404E) or compound heterozygous with a <b>null</b> <b>allele</b> in CPOX have a more severe erythropoietic porphyria, harderoporphyria, characterized by neonatal jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatosplenomegaly and skin lesions upon exposure to ultraviolet light. [...] HCP is a rare disease, but the exact incidence {{is difficult to determine}} due to the reduced penetrance of the acute porphyrias. [...] Overall, the incidence of all porphyrias is estimated at 1:20,000 in the United States. [...] The incidence of harderoporphyria is even lower, with less than 10 cases reported worldwide.|$|E
40|$|We have {{disrupted}} one allele of the N-myc locus in mouse {{embryonic stem}} (ES) cells by using homologous recombination techniques and have obtained germ line transmission of null N-myc ES cell lines with {{transmission of the}} <b>null</b> N-myc <b>allele</b> to the offspring. The creation of mice with a deficient N-myc allele will allow the generation of offspring bearing null N-myc alleles in both chromosomes and permit study of the role that this proto-oncogene plays in embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|Common wheat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural plants, their use is not only feeding, but especially in the food industry. In recent years, great interest is focused on the wheat caryopsis unusual coloration, e. g. purple yellow and blue. This coloring is caused by natural dyes, which have evidently positive impact on living organisms. Therefore, the aim is to use colored wheat also in human nutrition. This work is focused on the detection of allelic composition at loci Glu-A 3, Pina, Pinb and <b>null</b> <b>allele's</b> Waxy genes, using molecular markers based on PCR. Bread-making quality depends on the composition of storage proteins, glutenins and gliadins and their rate. It is important to the starch content in caryopses and the ratio of amylose and amylopectin. Milling, resp. feeding quality is affected by the hardness of wheat caryopses. Using molecular analysis in 13 genotypes with white (1 genotype), purple pericarp (8), yellow endosperm (4) has been described allelic variation at the locus Glu-A 3, Pina-D 1 and Pinb-D 1, and null alleles at locus Wx-B 1 were detected. The obtained results can be used in wheat breed-ing with an unusual coloration of kernels...|$|R
30|$|Bengal tiger DNA samples (n[*]=[*] 8) were amplified {{successfully}} for all 39 heterologous loci, and data analysis using MICROCHECKER 2.2. 3 (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004) and GIMLET (Valiere 2002) clearly indicated {{the absence of}} <b>null</b> alleles, <b>allele</b> dropout, false alleles and scoring errors, associated with peak stuttering in genotyping data. The mean value of the relatedness coefficient (R[*]=[*]− 0.143) also indicate that the selected tigers were not closely related to each other, as could be expected in captive individuals.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>null</b> <b>allele</b> is a mutant {{copy of a}} gene at a locus that {{completely}} lacks that gene's normal function. This can {{be the result of}} the complete absence of the gene product (protein, RNA) at the molecular level, or the expression of a non-functional gene product. At the phenotypic level, a <b>null</b> <b>allele</b> is indistinguishable from a deletion of the entire locus.|$|E
40|$|The {{extracellular}} calcium-sensing receptor (CaR; alternate gene names, CaR or Casr) is a membrane-spanning G protein–coupled receptor. CaR {{is highly}} {{expressed in the}} parathyroid gland, and is activated by extracellular calcium (Ca 2 +o). Mice homozygous for null mutations in the CaR gene (CaR–/–) die shortly after birth because {{of the effects of}} severe hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia. A wide variety of functions have been attributed to CaR. However, the lethal CaR-deficient phenotype has made it difficult to dissect the direct effect of CaR deficiency from the secondary effects of hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia. We therefore generated parathyroid hormone–deficient (PTH-deficient) CaR–/– mice (Pth–/–CaR–/–) by intercrossing mice heterozygous for the <b>null</b> CaR <b>allele</b> with mice heterozygous for a <b>null</b> Pth <b>allele.</b> We show that genetic ablation of PTH is sufficient to rescue the lethal CaR–/– phenotype. Pth–/–CaR–/– mice survive to adulthood with no obvious difference in size or appearance relative to control Pth–/– littermates. Histologic examination of most organs did not reveal abnormalities. These Pth–/–CaR–/– mice exhibit a much wider range of values for serum calcium and renal excretion of calcium than we observe in control littermates, despite the absence of any circulating PTH. Thus, CaR is necessary for the fine regulation of serum calcium levels and renal calcium excretion independent of its effect on PTH secretion...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{expression}} of the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) allele from chromosome 4 A of wheat is associated with improved starch quality for making Udon noodles. Several PCR-based methods {{for the analysis of}} GBSS alleles have been developed for application in wheat. A widely applied approach has involved a simple PCR followed by electrophoretic separation of DNA products on agarose gels. The PCR amplifies one band from each of the loci on chromosomes 4 A (Wx-B 1), 7 A (Wx-A 1), and 7 D (Wx-D 1), and the band from the Wx-B 1 locus is diagnostic for the occurrence of the <b>null</b> Wx-B 1 <b>allele</b> that is associated with improved starch quality. The reliable detection of the <b>null</b> Wx-B 1 <b>allele</b> has been important in identifying wheat breeding lines. Allele-specific PCR has also been used to successfully detect the occurrence of the <b>null</b> Wx-B 1 <b>allele.</b> In the present paper the various protocols were evaluated by testing a segregating double haploid population from a cross between Cranbrook and Halberd and the tests gave good agreement in different laboratories. The application of the DNAbased tests applied in wheat breeding programs provides one of the first examples of a molecular marker selection for a grain quality trait being successfully applied in an Australian wheat breeding program...|$|R
50|$|Cyc01 {{also known}} as cyc0 is a {{recessive}} <b>null</b> mutant <b>allele.</b> This means that a Drosophila with two copies of the cyc01 mutant does not produce a functional CYCLE protein. The resulting Drosophila exhibits arrhythmic activity and cannot entrain to any light-dark cycle. Cyc01 mutants showed a disproportionately large sleep rebound and died after 10 hours of sleep deprivation, although they were more resistant than other clock mutants to various stressors. Unlike other clock mutants, cyc01 flies showed a reduced expression of heat-shock genes after sleep loss. However, activating heat-shock genes before sleep deprivation rescued cyc01 flies from its lethal effects.|$|R

50|$|Another {{definition}} of <b>null</b> <b>allele</b> concerning molecular markers, refers {{to such a}} marker in the case {{it can no longer}} be detected because of a mutation. For example, microsatellites (i.e. a repetitive sequence of DNA, in which the repeat is rather short) are used as molecular markers amplifying them through PCR. To do so, a primer or oligonucleotide aligns with either of ends of the locus. If a mutation occurs in the annealing site, then the marker can no longer be used and the allele is turned into a <b>null</b> <b>allele.</b>|$|E
50|$|Given the {{importance}} of the C957T and TaqIA polymorphisms for the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorder, a rapid screening protocol for these genes has been developed. Since the DRD2 1101A <b>allele</b> <b>nulls</b> the effects of the 957T allele, screens for the 957C allele which ignore the 1101A allele can sometimes lead to false negatives.|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{three sets}} of experiments to determine whether cloned DNA fragments can be substituted for homologous regions of the Aspergillus nidulans genome by DNA-mediated transformation. A linear DNA fragment containing a heteromorphic trpC+ allele was used to transform a trpC- strain to trpC+. Blot analysis of DNA from the transformants showed that the heteromorphic allele had replaced the trpC- allele in {{a minority of the}} strains. An A. nidulans trpC+ gene was inserted into the argB+ gene, and a linear DNA fragment containing the resultant <b>null</b> argB <b>allele</b> was used to transform a trpC- argB+ strain to trpC+. Approximately 30 % of the transformants were simultaneously argB-. The <b>null</b> argB <b>allele</b> had replaced the wild-type allele in a majority of these strains. The A. nidulans SpoC 1 C 1 -C gene was modified by removal of an internal restriction fragment and introduced into a trpC- strain by transformation with a circular plasmid. A transformant containing a tandem duplication of the C 1 -C region separated by plasmid DNA was self-fertilized, and trpC- progeny were selected. All of these had lost the introduced plasmid DNA sequences, whereas about half had retained the modified C 1 -C gene and lost the wild-type copy. Thus, it is possible with A. nidulans to replace chromosomal DNA sequences with DNA fragments that have been cloned and modified in vitro by using either one- or two-step procedures similar to those developed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae...|$|R

Renal histopathology showed extensive tubular dilation, inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis that varied in severity between different mouse backgrounds.

40|$|The proteinase {{inhibitor}} <b>null</b> (Pi-) <b>allele</b> {{is a rare}} cause of alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. In three families, all the subjects with AAT deficiency due to PiZ- presented in early childhood with recurrent chest infections and wheezing presumably related to passive smoking. In Pi- the AAT gene is present {{and there is no}} evidence for a gene deletion. In one family a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) detected with the enzyme XbaI segregates with the Pi- allele. In a family where a consanguineous marriage occurred, the XbaI polymorphism segregates with the normal M 1 allele rather than Pi-, suggesting that Pi- may have originated from M 1. In contrast, a third family and 20 normal unrelated subjects do not show the RFLP...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} subcellular location of DNase-I, a major acid deoxyribonuclease in Drosophila melanogaster. Embryonic tissue used in these experiments was derived from a wild type strain and from a strain homozygous at the DNase-l locus (3 - 61. 8) for the <b>null</b> activity <b>allele,</b> DNase-lnl 24. The majority of total acid DNase and DNase-l activity {{is found in the}} small particulate fraction of tissue homogenates fractionated by differential centrifugation. The activity exhibits latency in these extracts indicating that it is membrane delimited. DNase-I activity also co-equilibrates in sucrose density gradients with acid phosphatase activity which, in D. melanogaster, is known to be lysosomal. These results suggest that DNase-l is localized largely within the Iysosomes of embryonic tissue. Functional implications of a lysosomal location for DNase-l are discussed...|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} a <b>null</b> <b>allele</b> is the 'O' blood type allele in the human A, B and O blood type system. The alleles for the A-antigen and B-antigen are co-dominant, thus they are both phenotypically {{expressed}} if both are present. The allele for O blood type, however, is a mutated version of the allele for the A-antigen, with a single base pair change due to genetic mutation. The protein coded for by the O allele is enzymatically inactive and therefore the O allele is expressed phenotypically in homozygous OO individuals as {{the lack of any}} blood antigen. Thus we may consider the allele for the O blood type as a <b>null</b> <b>allele.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{population}} or {{species of}} organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each locus among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable {{as the number}} of alleles (polymorphism) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population.

40|$|AbstractN-myc is a {{transcription}} factor {{expressed in the}} developing metanephric kidney and other organs.

In addition to the <b>null</b> N-myc <b>allele,</b> others have generated a hypomorphic N-myc allele. In this study, combinations of these mutant genes were used to demonstrate that reduction in N-myc protein levels correlate with fewer developing glomeruli and collecting ducts in embryonic kidney explants. Histological sections revealed that the mutant kidneys were hypoplastic with normal developing structures. The data indicate that the hypoplasia is due to a reduction in proliferation rather than an increase in apoptosis. Thus, N-myc loss causes a decrease in numbers of ureteric bud tips and developing glomeruli in explants and hypoplastic kidneys in vivo, in a dose-dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} a <b>null</b> HLA-A* 02 <b>allele,</b> HLA-A* 0232 N, by {{using a combination of}} serology, flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) and full-length sequencing. The <b>null</b> HLA-A 2 <b>allele</b> was identified in an Asian individual originally typed by serology as an apparently homozygous HLA-A 3, B 51. Subsequent genotyping by PCR-SSP identified the genotype as HLA-A* 0201, * 0301, B* 51, Cw* 1402. The serological type and lack of detectable HLA-A 2 was confirmed using monoclonal antibody typing reagents. Flow cytometry studies failed to identify any cell surface HLA-A 2 expression on the patient 19 s peripheral blood lymphocytes. Genotyping using a PCR-SSP set designed to detect null alleles revealed the mutation had not been previously described. Full-length sequencing of the allele identified an allele which was subsequently named HLA-A* 0232 N. This allele is identical to HLA-A* 0201 except for a novel point mutation (T for C) at position 493 which creates a premature stop codon. The sequencing enabled the development of a monospecific A* 0232 N PCR-SSP reaction which was used to screen 973 DNA samples: no further examples of A* 0232 N were identified...|$|R
40|$|Ras {{proteins}} {{are highly}} related GTPases that have key roles in regulating growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Gene-targeting experiments have shown that, {{out of the}} three mammalian ras genes, only K-ras is essential for normal mouse embryogenesis, and that mice deprived of H-ras and/or N-ras show no major phenotype. We generated mice (HrasKI) in which the K-ras gene had been modified to encode H-Ras protein. HrasKI mice produce undetectable amounts of K-Ras but - in contrast to mice homozygous for a <b>null</b> K-ras <b>allele</b> - they are born at the expected mendelian frequency, indicating that H-Ras can be substituted for K-Ras in embryonic development. However, adult HrasKI mice show dilated cardiomyopathy associated with arterial hypertension. Our results show that K-Ras can be replaced by H-Ras in its essential function in embryogenesis, and indicate that K-Ras has a unique role in cardiovascular homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|Apela (also {{known as}} Elabela, Ende, and Toddler) {{is a small}} {{signaling}} peptide that activates the G-protein-coupled receptor Aplnr to stimulate cell migration during zebrafish gastrulation. Here, using CRISPR/Cas 9 to generate a <b>null,</b> reporter-expressing <b>allele,</b> we study the role of Apela in the developing mouse embryo. We found that loss of Apela results in low-penetrance cardiovascular defects that manifest after the onset of circulation. Three-dimensional micro-computed tomography revealed a higher penetrance of vascular remodeling defects, from which some mutants recover, and identified extraembryonic anomalies as the earliest morphological distinction in Apela mutant embryos. Transcriptomics at late gastrulation identified aberrant upregulation of erythroid and myeloid markers in mutant embryos prior to the appearance of physical malformations. Double-mutant analyses showed that loss of Apela signaling impacts early Aplnr-expressing mesodermal populations independently of the alternative ligand Apelin, leading to lethal cardiac defects in some Apela null embryos...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tumoral {{calcinosis}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by ectopic calcification and hyperphosphatemia. METHODS: We describe {{a family with}} tumoral calcinosis requiring amputations. The predominant metabolic anomaly identified in three affected family members was hyperphosphatemia. Biochemical and phenotypic analysis of 13 kindred members, together with exome analysis of 6 members, was performed. RESULTS: We identified a novel Q 67 K mutation in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23), segregating with a <b>null</b> (deletion) <b>allele</b> on the other FGF 23 homologue in three affected members. Affected siblings had high circulating plasma C-terminal FGF 23 levels, but undetectable intact FGF 23 or N-terminal FGF 23, leading to loss of FGF 23 function. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that in human, as in experimental models, severe prolonged hyperphosphatemia may be sufficient to produce bone differentiation proteins in vascular cells, and vascular calcification severe enough to require amputation. Genetic modifiers {{may contribute to the}} phenotypic variation within and between families...|$|R
