30|$|The Notification Distributor {{receives}} {{events from}} the Location Manager and {{interacts with the}} Policy Enforcer (see next item) {{to know if there}} are users to be notified of a given event. As a consequence, the Policy Enforcer will evaluate each notification policy. If, for a certain <b>notification</b> <b>request,</b> a <b>notification</b> is needed, the Notification Distributor is responsible for doing so, using the previously configured communication channels for the user being notified.|$|R
30|$|Notifications were {{generated}} either periodically (every 2  h) or by requests from contextual triggers. Three contextual triggers were implemented {{in an attempt}} to characterize when is the right time to prompt the users with inspiring content. Each trigger represents a different hypothesis: (1) Location changes: A <b>notification</b> is <b>requested</b> whenever users move from one region, where they have spent at least half an hour, to another (region here is a circle with < 400  m radius). (2) Social proximity: Proximity to other group members is inferred by constantly monitoring the phone’s Bluetooth interface. A <b>notification</b> is <b>requested</b> when peers that have been close to each other depart. (3) Physical activity: Physical activity is estimated via the phone’s inertial sensors. When the user is active for over 7  min, a <b>notification</b> is <b>requested.</b> We consider active as either walking, running or cycling estimated with over 75  % confidence.|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{support for}} {{distributed}} data management {{is one of}} the key features of present and future database systems. In this paper, we propose an agent-based communication mechanism for distributed database systems. First, an agent architecture (DBAA) is introduced. Agents can function on their own or work cooperatively with a (virtual) collection, block or federation of agents. While working towards a certain goal, agents may exploit concurrency, parallelism and distribution. To do so, communication capabilities are required. Thus, a corresponding agent communication language, DBACL, is proposed. DBACL supports a variety of communication types (i. e. one-to-one, one-to-many and broadcast), message transfer modes (e. g. streams), and message types (e. g. signals, <b>notifications,</b> <b>requests,</b> and negotiations). Besides efficiency and interoperability, simplicity has been another main objective underlying our research...|$|R

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of the World Wide Web, it has become very important to provide advanced tools for maintaining referential integrity of information resources. The growing tendency toward building increasingly complex Web sites makes it necessary to maintain not only physical files, but also logical resources, or views, which are composed of references to other resources and presentation programs. Our {{solution to this problem}} is to design an infrastructure of resource maintenance agents. It includes the Data Agent, which keeps track of files and supports third-party requests to notify them of changes that occur to these files. Another component of the infrastructure is the Repository Agent, which supports change <b>notification</b> <b>requests</b> for logical resources. Prototype implementation of the infrastructure is currently available and is discussed in this paper. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: We {{developed}} an enhanced surveillance system for hepatitis B {{to improve the}} detection of newly acquired cases and to collect epidemiological data. Methods: The study was undertaken from February to June (inclusive) 2005 at the Sydney South West Area Health Service Eastern Zone Public Health Unit. A letter was sent to treating doctors on receipt of a <b>notification,</b> <b>requesting</b> additional information on cases. Cases identified by the treating doctors as newly acquired were followed up by telephone. Results: There were 295 notifications of hepatitis B in the period, of which three were newly acquired infections. Only one of these three cases was identified through enhanced surveillance. Information on ethnicity was obtained. Conclusions: This enhanced surveillance system is of limited value as an ongoing process. We recommend that it be undertaken periodically to monitor the epidemiology of the disease...|$|R

40|$|The Technical Work Plan Tracking Tool is {{a web-based}} {{application}} that enables interactive communication and approval of contract requirements that {{pertain to the}} administration of the Science, Engineering, Analysis, and Test (SEAT) contract at Johnson Space Center.

The application is accessible to over 300 designated NASA and contractor employees via two Web sites. For each employee, the application regulates access according to the employee s authority to enter, view, and/or print out diverse information, including reports, work plans, purchase orders, and financial data.

50|$|The MPNS is {{natively}} {{designed for}} use with Windows Phone 8 applications that implement the service. It allows for developers to send toast notifications, as well as update the tile image and flip notification text on the application's Windows Metro start screen tile. This is accomplished by developers by sending POST messages to the MPNS server network with the request and relevant content. A user typically must allow for data or notifications to be received before an application will register with the MPNS for notification data. The MPNS can be implemented to send notification data using an encrypted channel if the developer purchases an SSL certificate from a third-party provider and uploads its private key and certificate data to their Microsoft Developer Portal account. Otherwise, the MPNS can be implemented to send notification data using an unencrypted channel. Applications that utilize unencrypted channels have rate and size limitations with all <b>notification</b> <b>requests</b> and content that is updated or displayed to the device. These limits can be lifted by purchasing an SSL certificate and switching to utilize MPNS encryption.|$|R

[...] Xgrid does not leverage BEEPs message/reply infrastructure. [...] Any received message which requires a response merely generates an independent BEEP message containing the reply. [...] The Xgrid messages are encoded as dictionaries of key/value pairs which are converted to XML before being sent across the BEEP network.|$|R

It is also {{a major factor in}} building relationships between individuals. Business correspondence in Germany is defined by German Industry Standards (DIN 5008, 676) and has more requisite elements than it does in Ukraine. The differences lie in the format and placement of the date, the main text of German letter being divided into three parts versus two parts in Ukrainian, the signature in German letter is placed above the name of the author while Ukrainian letter has it across from author's name. Ukrainian business letter does not call for specify its subject before the salutation. Common to both German and Ukrainian business letters is the use of a certain minimum of set expressions and stock phrases predicated upon a limited number of standard aspects of business writing which tend to be highly repetitive (letter of <b>notification,</b> <b>request,</b> proposal, demand, refusal, agreement). Covered herein are main types of German business letters (corporate partnership request letter, inquiry letter, business proposal letter, marketing letter, repeat offer letter, order letter, refusal letter, complaint letter, reminder letter), their characteristic features and typical stock phrases and set expressions. A grammatical analysis shows that business correspondence is marked by prevalence of present tense, more frequent use of active voice over passive, rather frequent occurrence of infinitive constructs with "zu" and imperative mood, rather infrequent occurrence of subordinate clauses ? mainly noun, adjective and conditional clauses.
