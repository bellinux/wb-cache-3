25|$|Regarding to {{economic}} development, {{in the political}} program of Can Lao party and <b>National</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Movement,</b> Diệm and Nhu pointed out the key factors of the RVN economy: a developed and independent economy, support local capitalists, stabilized currency and reduce budget deficit; enhance building infrastructure to meet military needs and create a prosperous South Vietnam. In 1957, Diệm's government suggested the 5–year plan (1957–1961), which aimed at expanding cultivated area to 20 percent and improving agricultural production to 25%, restoring exploitative industry and developing infrastructure. On 31 December 1955, Diệm promulgated the Decree 48 on RVN independence on currency and banknotes.|$|E

The <b>National</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Movement,</b> an organization used by the Ngô family to stage orchestrated mass demonstrations in support of themselves, called for the death penalty against the two pilots and further asked Diệm to enact the [...] "strictest measures to insure discipline in the military".|$|E

2500|$|Large {{numbers of}} Bolivian {{highland}} peasants retained indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at {{the dissolution of}} communal landholdings and used legal recognition of [...] "empowered caciques" [...] to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953. While the <b>National</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Movement</b> government begun in 1952 discouraged people identifying as indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s. Many lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official title to indigenous territories. The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted [...] "grassroots territorial organizations;" [...] these are recognized {{by the state and}} have certain rights to govern local areas.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1952, a Cuban {{general and}} politician, Fulgencio Batista, seized {{power on the}} island, proclaimed himself {{president}} and deposed the discredited president Carlos Prío Socarrás of the Partido Auténtico. Batista canceled the planned presidential elections, and described his new system as [...] "disciplined democracy". Although Batista gained some popular support, many Cubans saw it as {{the establishment of a}} one-man dictatorship. Many opponents of the Batista regime took to armed rebellion in an attempt to oust the government, sparking the Cuban Revolution. One of these groups was the <b>National</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Movement</b> (Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario – MNR), a militant organization containing largely middle class members that had been founded by the Professor of Philosophy Rafael García Bárcena. Another was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE), which had been founded by the Federation of University Students (FEU) President José Antonio Echevarría (1932–1957). However, the best known of these anti-Batista groups was the [...] "26th of July Movement" [...] (MR-26-7), founded by a lawyer named Fidel Castro. With Castro as the MR-26-7's head, the organization was based upon a clandestine cell system, with each cell containing ten members, none of whom knew the whereabouts or activities of the other cells.|$|E
60|$|In any case, it {{does not}} seem to me {{probable}} that there can be any <b>national</b> <b>revolutionary</b> <b>movement</b> or any complete arrest in the development of an aristocratic phase in American history. The area of the country is too great and the means of communication between the workers in different parts inadequate for a concerted rising or even for effective political action in mass. In the worst event--and it is only in the worst event that a great insurrectionary movement becomes probable--the newspapers, magazines, telephones and telegraphs, all the apparatus of discussion and popular appeal, the railways, arsenals, guns, flying machines, and all the material of warfare, will be in the hands of the property owners, and the average of betrayal among the leaders of a class, not racially homogeneous, embittered, suspicious united only by their discomforts and not by any constructive intentions, will necessarily be high. So that, though the intensifying trouble between labour and capital may mean immense social disorganisation and lawlessness, though it may even supply the popular support in new attempts at secession, I do not see in it the possibility and force for that new start which the revolutionary Socialists anticipate; I see it merely as one of several forces making, on the whole and particularly in view of the possible mediatory action of the universities, for construction and reconciliation.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{proclamation}} restricted {{its claim to}} the territory north of the Araz River, {{the use of the}} name Azerbaijan would soon bring objections from Iran. In Teheran, suspicions were aroused that the Republic of Azerbaijan served as an Ottoman device for detaching the Tabriz province from Iran. Likewise, the <b>national</b> <b>revolutionary</b> Jangali <b>movement</b> in Gilan, while welcoming the independence of every Muslim land as a [...] "source of joy," [...] asked in its newspaper if the choice of the name Azerbaijan implied the new republic's desire to join Iran. If so, they said, it should be stated clearly, otherwise Iranians would be opposed to calling that republic Azerbaijan. Consequently, to allay Iranian fears, the Azerbaijani government would accommodatingly use the term Caucasian Azerbaijan in its documents for circulation abroad.|$|R
2500|$|Because the European monarchies, allied in the {{so-called}} [...] "Concert of Europe", were suspicious towards <b>national</b> or social <b>revolutionary</b> <b>movements</b> such as the Etaireia, the First Greek National Assembly, convening in January 1822, took steps to disassociate itself from the Etaireias legacy and portray nascent Greece as a [...] "conventional", ordered nation-state. As such {{not only were the}} regional councils abolished in favour of a central administration, but it was decided to abolish all revolutionary flags and adopt a universal national flag. The reasons why the particular arrangement (white cross on blue) was selected, instead of the more popular blue cross on a white field, remain unknown.|$|R

50|$|What {{preceded the}} return to {{democratic}} government in the 1980s was {{a long period of}} instability. After the Chaco War (1932-1935), during the period of 1936 until 1952, Bolivia had ten presidents (six military).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a short survey {{and assessment of}} the political evolution of Rwanda {{since the inception of}} the Second Republic in 1973. After a period of de facto rule the country returned to constitutional government in 1978.

The paper examines the constitution, the organisation of elections, political conflict and the respect for human rights and the rule of law. While the regime has achieved considerable successes, the paper argues that its level of institutionalisation remains limited and that its stability and achievements are essentially due to the personality of President Habyarimana...|$|R

25|$|On the {{political}} side, negotiations for Treaty of Sèvres presumed a Greek (Christian Administration), a French-Armenian (Christian Administration), Italian occupation region (Christian Administration) and Wilsonian Armenia (Christian Administration) over what was Ottoman Empire (Muslim Administration).

British intelligence registered the Turkish national movement as a movement of the Muslim citizens of Anatolia. The Muslim unrest all around Anatolia brought two arguments to the British government regarding the new establishments: the Muslim administration (Ottoman Empire) was not safe for Christians; the Treaty of Sèvres {{was the only way}} that Christians could be safe.

The Soviet supply of gold and armaments to the Kemalists in 1920-1922 was a key factor in the latter's successful power grab in an Ottoman Empire defeated by the Triple Entente and their victory in the Armenian campaign and the Greco-Turkish War (1919-22).|$|R

40|$|On 1 November, 1954 {{an armed}} {{insurgency}} against French rule commenced {{with a large}} scale terrorist attack throughout various parts of Algeria. France responded by sending troops from the continent to Algeria and was soon involved in a full out counterinsurgency against the Front Liberé <b>National</b> (FLN), a <b>revolutionary</b> <b>movement</b> organised in a classical communist insurgent pattern. Many of the experiences the French gained conducting counterinsurgency in Algeria have been examined by writers of COIN literature. The conclusions have been incorporated into counterinsurgency doctrines of many countries, and the works of Galula, who experienced the war, is considered basic literature for many counterinsurgency courses. This has been inherited by modern COIN literature. The US FM 3. 24 draws from the French experiences and theorists in its main body. This essay examines whether modern counterinsurgency literature derived from French experiences and theories gained, fighting FLN fails {{to address the question}} on how the insurgent organisation is structured. It provides a few arguments why we should know this, such as knowing your enemy’s structure will help you understand his vulnerabilities. To archive this and lay a foundation for the argumentation it first compares the Algerian FLN to modern day Taliban to establish if their organisational structures are different or similar...|$|R
