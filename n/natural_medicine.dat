Here, we report a systematic strategy for evaluating the bioactive candidates in <b>natural</b> <b>medicines</b> used for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We found that Drynaria Rhizome could enhance memory function and ameliorate AD pathologies in 5 XFAD mice. Biochemical analysis led to the identification of the bio-effective metabolites that are transferred to the brain, namely, naringenin and its glucuronides. To explore the mechanism of action, we combined the drug affinity responsive target stability with immunoprecipitation-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, identifying the collapsin response mediator protein 2 protein as a target of naringenin. Our study indicates that biochemical analysis coupled with pharmacological methods can be used in the search for new targets for AD intervention...|$|R

25|$|Traditional {{medicine}} {{may include}} formalized aspects of folk medicine, {{that is to}} say longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the healing practices and ideas of body physiology and health preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience. Folk medicine may also be referred to as traditional medicine, alternative medicine, indigenous medicine, or <b>natural</b> <b>medicine.</b> These terms are often considered interchangeable, even though some authors may prefer one or the other because of certain overtones they may be willing to highlight. In fact, out of these terms perhaps only indigenous medicine and traditional medicine have the same meaning as folk medicine, while the others should be understood rather in a modern or modernized context.|$|E

40|$|Leishmaniasis is an {{important}} zoonotic parasitic disease in tropical areas. It is a neglected disease and is a great health catastrophe in Iran. Pentavalent antimony compounds are used for its treatment, but they have adverse effects. Therefore, the use of natural herbs with low adverse effects seems necessary for treatment of Leishmaniasis. In this study, we tried to introduce the <b>natural</b> <b>medicines</b> effective against Leishmaniasis. In this review study, keywords searched included <b>natural</b> <b>medicines,</b> herbal medicines, medicinal plants, Leishmaniasis, and treatment in relevant publications published between 1990 and 2017. Searching was on databases including ISI Web of Science, PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, ISC, SID, Magiran and some other databases. The relevant articles were reviewed for the review study. The results showed that medicinal plants: Ferula assafoatida (with IC 50 of 0. 38 mg/ml), Glycyrrhiza glabra (with IC 50 of 25 mg/ml), Allium sativum (with IC 50 of 0. 57 mg/ml), Cephalis ipecacuana (with IC 50 of 0. 01 mg/ml), Artemisia aucheri (with IC 50 of 0. 46 mg/ml) and Eucalyptus globulus (with IC 50 of 0. 17 mg/ml) were the <b>natural</b> <b>medicines</b> effective against the disease.

[...] This trend would continue from the 1970s to the 1990s, mostly focused on the activities of the Tehuantepec diocese under bishop Arturo Lona Reyes, who led from 1971 to his retirement in 2000. [...] The Diocese of Tehuantepec was part of a movement to mobilize the poor and indigenous in the 1980s and 1990s, allied with other elements of the Catholic Church in Oaxaca, the CEDIPIO and others. This movement was based on the teachings of liberation theology. Bishop Arturo Lona was a strong supporter of the teachings of Vatican II calling {{for the creation of a}} “people’s church”. The Oaxaca church was allied with Diocese of Chiapas under Bishop Samuel Ruiz. The pastoral style of these Oaxacan and Chiapas churches came to be known as the “pastoral indígena” or indigenous pastoral and was focused explicitly on working with the most marginalized segments of society. He instituted a health clinic just outside the city of Tehuantepec basic hospital facilities and the promotion of <b>natural</b> <b>medicine</b> with the training of local healers called curanderos.
