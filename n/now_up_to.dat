5|$|Today {{the former}} Victorian Railways {{locomotive}} fleet has {{been split into}} two, with the N, A and P classes utilised by V/Line on passenger services, with the remainder with Pacific National or other private operators in freight use. No new passenger locomotives have been built since the 1980s, with Diesel Multiple Units being acquired instead. Freight operations have seen the re-powering of the G and X classes, {{as well as the}} restoration to service of stored locomotives, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 50 years old.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 daily {{services}} along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and cigarettes, and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two-track pinch point.|$|E

25|$|Cavour {{agreed with}} Napoleon to cede Savoy and Nice to France, {{in order to}} annex Tuscany and Emilia to Piedmont.

25|$|With {{the first}} {{production}} car {{shown to the}} public in 1993, Porsche had only to meet certain design criteria--the requirement that production-based cars have storage space for a typical suitcase had already been fulfilled, as the Dauer road car was able to carry luggage. The flat bottom of the 962 Le Mans also fit with GT rules. Three more modifications were necessary to fully comply: Narrower tires than the 962 had run in Group C, a larger fuel tank (<b>now</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 120 litres), and the reinstallation of a restrictor for the engine, although this one would be larger than the one they had run in Group C.|$|E

By July the 46th was back in Italy, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> strength (largely from anti-aircraft gunners who had been retrained as infantrymen), as part of Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese's British Eighth Army's V Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Keightley, on the Adriatic coast.

25|$|Unfortunately, Stibor de Beckov died {{suddenly}} in battle against Hussite forces {{soon after the}} agreement between Emperor Sigismund, Albert II of Germany and the Piast dynasty had been made. Just a few weeks later, a peace agreement with the Hussites was signed. It was <b>now</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Katarina to marry Duke Przemyslaw II in accordance with her father's wish. However, this was not to happen as Katarina later married Lord Pál Bánffy of Alsolindva. Soon after, Stibor the Bishop of Eger lost his office and the Wawrzyniec lost all their offices and properties including the Castle of Košecy (which had previously been granted by Stibor of Stiboricz). All this {{was a result of}} their support for the Hussites. According to the testament, all lands possessed by the Ostoja clan in Upper Hungary was to be passed to the closest family of Stibor.|$|E

25|$|Giovnazzi spun at the Melco hairpin but recovered. The safety car's {{deployment}} was necessitated {{to allow}} the track to be cleaned. At {{the end of the}} first lap, Lynn led from Derani, Félix da Costa, Marciello, Sims, Coletti, Buller, King, Sainz and Latifi. At the restart, Lynn held on to the lead and Derani was passed by Félix da Costa on the outside line at Lisboa corner. Sims lined up an manoevure on Marciello but realised the move could not be completed and eased off. King fell to ninth when Sainz overtook him. Lynn increased his lead to two laps in the following laps, Marciello attempted to force his way through Derani but the Italian resisted his attempts at being overtaken. Sainz moved in front of both Coletti and Buller but the two drivers retook their lost positions. Marciello made it past Derani's who made his car wide at Lisboa corner to take over third place. On lap seven, Coletti and Buller collided which caused the latter's retirement but the latter was able to restart racing although he lost positions as a consequence of being forced to spin onto the escape road. King benefited from the incident and was <b>now</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> seventh and both he and Carlin teammate Jaafar passed Sainz after a battle for sixth position ended. Sun spun off at Fisherman's Bend and prompted the brief waving of localised yellow flags.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{almost a}} decade after their {{victories}} at Talikota, the Deccan sultanates of Bijapur and Ahmadnagar agreed in 1573 not to interfere in each other's future conquests by reserving regions to the south for Bijapur. In 1577, Bijapur forces attacked again and overwhelmed all opposition along the western coast. Easily taking Adoni, a former Vijayanagara stronghold, they attempted next to take Penukonda, the new Vijayanagara capital. (See [...] ).) There, however, they were repulsed by an army led by the Vijayanagara ruler's father-in-law, Jagadeva Raya, who had traveled north for the engagement from his base in Baramahal. For his services, Jagadeva Raya's territories within the crumbling empire were vastly expanded, extending westward <b>now</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Western Ghats, the mountain range running along the southwestern coast of India, and with a new capital in Channapatna (See [...]) ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the issue}} was still pending in court, the SP decided to {{change the course of}} the route, {{claiming}} that was its prerogative, despite the Department of the Interior having already granted homestead rights. Those who had been building homes along the previous course were distraught. Settlers argued in court that by not building the line where the federal government had deeded the land, SP forfeited the title. On the other hand, the SP was convinced of its legal ownership of the land and felt it should have the freedom to set whatever prices it deemed fit for its property. Others took the opportunity to move onto the SP's parcels, anticipating that the courts would rule against the company, thus allowing them to get the land for free. The Supreme Court finally ruled in Schulenberg v. Harriman 21 Wall. 44 (1874) that SP still owned the lands and as such, the SP was justified to reclaim the land without compensation unless the settlers were willing to pay their asking price, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $35/acre. [...] Still, the Settler's League, which was formed in 1878 in opposition to the SP's Mussel Slough actions, even attempted to appeal directly to President Rutherford B.
