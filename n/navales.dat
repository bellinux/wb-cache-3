25|$|This {{situation}} {{continued until}} the First Punic War: the main {{task of the}} Roman fleet was patrolling along the Italian coast and rivers, protecting seaborne trade from piracy. Whenever larger tasks had to be undertaken, such as the naval blockade of a besieged city, the Romans called on the allied Greek cities of southern Italy, the socii <b>navales,</b> to provide ships and crews. It {{is possible that the}} supervision of these maritime allies was one of the duties of the four new praetores classici, who were established in 267 BC.|$|E

25|$|In most cases, the socius sole treaty {{obligation}} to Rome was to {{supply to the}} confederate army, on demand, a number of fully equipped troops up to a specified maximum each year. The vast majority of socii were required to supply land troops (both infantry and cavalry), {{although most of the}} coastal Greek colonies were socii <b>navales</b> ("naval allies"), whose obligation was to provide either partly or fully crewed warships to the Roman fleet. Little is known about the size of contingent each socius was bound to provide, and whether it was proportional to population or wealth.|$|E

50|$|Cantiere <b>navale</b> di Ancona (Ancona Shipyard) is an Italian shipyard. Active in Roman {{and medieval}} times, it was refounded in 1843 when Ancona {{was under the}} control of the Papal States. Acquired by Rodolfo Hofer in 1899, it was {{combined}} with his Cantiere <b>navale</b> del Muggiano into the Officine e Cantieri Liguri-Anconetani and then, together with the Cantiere <b>navale</b> di Palermo, amalgamated into Cantieri Navali Riuniti (CNR) on 31 January 1906.

25|$|Seeing a need {{to replace}} the ageing oiler , the RAN placed an order in 1971 for a combat support ship-a {{replenishment}} vessel capable of supplying ammunition and stores in addition to fuel-to be named HMAS Protector. However, concerns {{about the cost of}} construction prompted the order's cancellation in 1974. Instead, the Directions Techniques Des Constructions <b>Navales</b> was approached about constructing a Durance-class replenishment oiler for the RAN, and a design contract was awarded to the Government of France in 1977. The $68.4 million (in 1978 prices) construction contract was awarded to Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard in October 1979, with ship delivery by 31 July 1983.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} following the defeat of Macedon, Rome became embroiled in a war with the Seleucid Empire. This war too was decided mainly on land, although the combined Roman-Rhodian navy also achieved victories over the Seleucids at Myonessus and Eurymedon. These victories, which were invariably concluded with the imposition of peace treaties that prohibited the maintenance of anything but token naval forces, spelled {{the disappearance of the}} Hellenistic royal navies, leaving Rome and her allies unchallenged at sea. Coupled with the final destruction of Carthage, and the end of Macedon's independence, by {{the latter half of the}} 2nd century BC, Roman control over all of what was later to be dubbed mare nostrum ("our sea") had been established. Subsequently, the Roman navy was drastically reduced, depending on its Socii <b>navales.</b>|$|E
25|$|The exact {{origins of}} the Roman fleet are obscure. A {{traditionally}} agricultural and land-based society, the Romans rarely ventured out to sea, unlike their Etruscan neighbours. There is evidence of Roman warships in the early 4th century BC, such as mention of a warship that carried an embassy to Delphi in 394 BC, but at any rate, the Roman fleet, if it existed, was negligible. The traditional birth date of the Roman navy is set at ca. 311 BC, when, after the conquest of Campania, two new officials, the duumviri <b>navales</b> classis ornandae reficiendaeque causa, were tasked with {{the maintenance of a}} fleet. As a result, the Republic acquired its first fleet, consisting of 20 ships, most likely triremes, with each duumvir commanding a squadron of 10 ships. However, the Republic continued to rely mostly on her legions for expansion in Italy; the navy was most likely geared towards combating piracy and lacked experience in naval warfare, being easily defeated in 282 BC by the Tarentines.|$|E

25|$|Comparatively less {{is known}} about the Roman navy than the Roman army. Prior {{to the middle of the}} 3rd century BC, {{officials}} known as duumviri <b>navales</b> commanded a fleet of twenty ships used mainly to control piracy. This fleet was given up in 278 AD and replaced by allied forces. The First Punic War required that Rome build large fleets, and it did so largely with the assistance of and financing from allies. This reliance on allies continued to the end of the Roman Republic. The quinquereme was the main warship on both sides of the Punic Wars and remained the mainstay of Roman naval forces until replaced by the time of Caesar Augustus by lighter and more maneuverable vessels. As compared with a trireme, the quinquereme permitted the use of a mix of experienced and inexperienced crewmen (an advantage for a primarily land-based power), and its lesser maneuverability permitted the Romans to adopt and perfect boarding tactics using a troop of approximately 40 marines in lieu of the ram. Ships were commanded by a navarch, a rank equivalent to a centurion, who were usually not citizens. Potter suggests that because the fleet was dominated by non-Romans, the navy was considered non-Roman and allowed to atrophy in times of peace.|$|E
