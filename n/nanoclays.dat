The testing results indicated that both the critical-stress-intensity and the critical strain energy release rate were dramatically augmented owing to the introduction of <b>nanoclay.</b> The interlaminar fracture toughness of carbon fiber-reinforced composites was evidently increased with the introduction of <b>nanoclay.</b> The fracture surface of nanoclay-filled samples exhibited relatively rougher feature, compared to the featureless fracture surface of pristine epoxy system. Small amount of <b>nanoclay</b> (2 phr) can significantly enhance the flexural strength and modulus of the composites. The fire resistance of epoxy composites was enhanced due to the addition of <b>nanoclay</b> via the limiting oxygen index experiment and TGA testing. An evident augmentation of thermal shock resistance was obtained with the addition of <b>nanoclay...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{modification}} of pristine <b>nanoclay</b> and its application in wood plastic composite (WPC) {{have been investigated}} in this paper. Pristine <b>nanoclay</b> was modified using transition metal ion (TMI) which was copper (II) chloride to achieve good dispersion and to improve properties of WPC. The morphology, composition, structure, and thermal stability of TMI-modified <b>nanoclay</b> were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis. The pristine (WPC/MMT) and TMI-modified (WPC/MMT Cu) <b>nanoclay</b> based WPC were made from polypropylene (PP), wood flour (WF), and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agent. Pristine and modified <b>nanoclay</b> with different concentration (1 wt%, 2. 5 wt%, 4 wt% and 5 wt%) were used as a reinforcing filler for WPC. Mechanical, physical, morphological, and thermal properties of the prepared composites were evaluated. Result exhibit that at 1 wt% <b>nanoclay</b> content, the tensile, flexural, and impact strength of WPC/MMT improved by approximately 6 %, 4 %, and 8 %, respectively, compared to WPC without <b>nanoclay.</b> For the WPC/MMT Cu, the improvements in these properties were about 2. 6, 2. 1 and 3 {{times higher than the}} WPC/MMT. The physical and thermal properties also improved by incorporating modified <b>nanoclay</b> in WPC...|$|R
