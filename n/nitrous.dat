5|$|All {{emissions}} from all sources will have obligations. This includes {{emissions from}} biological {{sources such as}} methane from enteric fermentation and <b>nitrous</b> oxide from animal effluent.|$|E
5|$|Methoxyflurane has a {{very high}} lipid {{solubility}} (oil:gas partition coefficient of around 950), which gives it very slow pharmacokinetics (induction and emergence characteristics); this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting. Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in unpremedicated healthy individuals, induction of general anesthesia with methoxyflurane-oxygen alone or with <b>nitrous</b> oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time. It {{was found to be}} necessary to administer an intravenous anesthetic agent such as sodium thiopental to ensure a smooth and rapid induction. It was further found that after thiopental induction, it was necessary to administer <b>nitrous</b> oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of methoxyflurane could accumulate in the bloodstream to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia. This was despite using high flow (liters/minute) of <b>nitrous</b> oxide and oxygen, and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of methoxyflurane.|$|E
5|$|Mycena leptocephala is {{classified}} in the section Fragilipedes of the genus Mycena, along with other similar-looking mushrooms, such as M.aetites, M.austera, M.parca, and M.aronsenii. Some of these have a <b>nitrous</b> smell similar to M.leptocephala.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nitrous</b> oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of <b>nitrous</b> oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
5|$|When inhaled at high partial {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30m in scuba diving), nitrogen is an anesthetic agent, causing nitrogen narcosis, a temporary state of mental impairment similar to <b>nitrous</b> oxide intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural emissions, methane from enteric {{fermentation}} and manure management {{as well as}} <b>nitrous</b> oxide from animal effluent and fertiliser, were to enter the scheme on 1 January 2015. A 'Questions and Answers' fact sheet released by Nick Smith (Minister for Climate Change Issues) stated that the delayed entry {{was due to the}} difficulties in measuring and monitoring agricultural emissions and the limited technologies available for reducing emissions in the sector.|$|E
5|$|From 23 December 2011, Certified Emission Reduction units (CERs) from HFC-23 and <b>Nitrous</b> oxide (N2O) {{industrial}} gas destruction projects were banned from {{use in the}} NZ ETS, unless they had been purchased under future delivery contracts entered into prior to 23 December 2011. The use of CERs from the future delivery contracts ended in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen azide (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by <b>nitrous</b> acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell {{and is a}} potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen forms nine {{molecular}} oxides, some {{of which}} were the first gases to be identified: N2O (<b>nitrous</b> oxide), NO (nitric oxide), N2O3 (dinitrogen trioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), N2O4 (dinitrogen tetroxide), N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), NO3 (nitrogen trioxide), N4O (nitrosylazide), and N(NO2)3 (trinitramide).)3 |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1145–8 |doi=10.1002/anie.201007047}} All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole (N4O), an aromatic ring.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which <b>nitrous</b> oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Some {{noble gases}} have direct {{application}} in medicine. Helium is sometimes {{used to improve}} the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers. Xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids, which makes it more potent than the usual <b>nitrous</b> oxide, {{and because it is}} readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery. Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI. Radon, which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts, is used in radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, <b>nitrous</b> oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, epinephrine, lidocaine and vasopressin.|$|E
5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike <b>nitrous</b> oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of <b>nitrous</b> oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|Tesla {{noted the}} hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early {{investigation}} of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated {{in contact with the}} skin, and to a lesser extent, by <b>nitrous</b> acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E

Teague as Krunk, John DiMaggio as Tiny Tiger, Michael Ensign as Doctor Nefarious Tropy, Quinton Flynn as Doctor N. Gin and <b>Nitrous</b> Oxide, André Sogliuzzo as Norm and Zem, Paul Greenberg as Geary and Pura and Tom Bourdon as N. Trance and an advisor of Velo.|$|E
5|$|Two {{series of}} {{nitrogen}} oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first are very reactive gases {{that can be}} made by directly halogenating <b>nitrous</b> oxide. Nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) behaves {{in much the same way}} and has often been used as an ionising solvent. Nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing <b>nitrous</b> oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas <b>nitrous</b> oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, <b>nitrous</b> oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in xenon gas (169m/s) is less than that in air because the average {{velocity}} of the heavy xenon atoms is {{less than that of}} nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than <b>nitrous</b> oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and <b>nitrous</b> oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with <b>nitrous</b> oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
25|$|People {{with normal}} vitamin B12 levels have stores {{to make the}} effects of <b>nitrous</b> oxide insignificant, unless {{exposure}} is repeated and prolonged (<b>nitrous</b> oxide abuse). Vitamin B12 levels should be checked in people with risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency prior to using <b>nitrous</b> oxide anaesthesia.|$|E
25|$|On 10 December 1844, Gardner Quincy Colton held {{a public}} {{demonstration}} of <b>nitrous</b> oxide in Hartford, Connecticut. One of the participants, Samuel A. Cooley, sustained a significant injury to his leg {{while under the}} influence of <b>nitrous</b> oxide without noticing the injury. Horace Wells, a Connecticut dentist present in the audience that day, immediately seized upon the significance of this apparent analgesic effect of <b>nitrous</b> oxide. The following day, Wells underwent a painless dental extraction while {{under the influence of}} <b>nitrous</b> oxide administered by Colton. Wells then began to administer <b>nitrous</b> oxide to his patients, successfully performing several dental extractions {{over the next couple of}} weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrous</b> oxide is {{prepared}} on an industrial scale by careful heating of ammonium nitrate at about 250 C, which decomposes into <b>nitrous</b> oxide and water vapour.|$|E
25|$|Oxidation by <b>nitrous</b> acid has a kinetic {{control over}} {{thermodynamic}} control, this is best illustrated that dilute <b>nitrous</b> acid {{is able to}} oxidize I− to I2, but dilute nitric acid cannot.|$|E
25|$|Natural soil {{biogeochemical}} processes {{result in}} the emission of various greenhouse gases, including <b>nitrous</b> oxide. Agricultural management practices can affect emission levels. For example, tillage levels have {{also been shown to}} affect <b>nitrous</b> oxide emissions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrous</b> oxide {{is stored}} as a {{compressed}} liquid; the evaporation {{and expansion of}} liquid <b>nitrous</b> oxide in the intake manifold causes a large drop in intake charge temperature, resulting in a denser charge, further allowing more air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. Sometimes <b>nitrous</b> oxide is injected into (or prior to) the intake manifold, whereas other systems directly inject, right before the cylinder (direct port injection) to increase power.|$|E
25|$|In a 1914 patent, American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard {{suggested}} <b>nitrous</b> oxide {{and gasoline}} as possible propellants for a liquid-fuelled rocket. <b>Nitrous</b> oxide {{has been the}} oxidiser of choice in several hybrid rocket designs (using solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidizer). The combination of <b>nitrous</b> oxide with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene fuel {{has been used by}} SpaceShipOne and others. It also is notably used in amateur and high power rocketry with various plastics as the fuel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrous</b> acid is {{involved}} in the ozone budget of the lower atmosphere: the troposphere. The heterogeneous reaction of nitric oxide (NO) and water produces <b>nitrous</b> acid. When this reaction takes place on the surface of atmospheric aerosols, the product readily photolyses to hydroxyl radicals.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 1772, English {{scientist}} Joseph Priestley {{discovered the}} gas <b>nitrous</b> oxide. Initially, people thought this gas to be lethal, even in small doses, like some other nitrogen oxides. However, in 1799, British chemist and inventor Humphry Davy {{decided to find}} out by experimenting on himself. To his astonishment he found that <b>nitrous</b> oxide made him laugh, so he nicknamed it laughing gas. Davy wrote about the potential anesthetic properties of <b>nitrous</b> oxide, but nobody at that time pursued the matter any further.|$|E
25|$|Examples: psilocybin, LSD, Salvia divinorum and <b>nitrous</b> oxide.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to <b>nitrous</b> oxide may cause vitamin B deficiency. It inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin B12 by oxidation. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, including sensory neuropathy, myelopathy, and encephalopathy, may occur within {{days or weeks}} of {{exposure to}} <b>nitrous</b> oxide anaesthesia in people with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Carbon dioxide, methane, and <b>nitrous</b> oxide are all {{long-lived}} greenhouse gases.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, the Ministry of Health {{has warned}} that <b>nitrous</b> oxide is a {{prescription}} medicine, and its sale or possession without a prescription, is an offense under the Medicines Act. This statement would seemingly prohibit all non-medicinal uses of <b>nitrous</b> oxide, {{although it is}} implied that only recreational use will be targeted legally.|$|E
