25|$|There {{have been}} three main ways to {{formulate}} spectral theory, all of which retain their usefulness. After Hilbert's initial formulation, the later development of abstract Hilbert space and the spectral theory of a single <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> on it did very much go in parallel {{with the requirements of}} physics; particularly in the hands of von Neumann. The further theory built on this to include Banach algebras, which can be given abstractly. This development leads to the Gelfand representation, which covers the commutative case, and further into non-commutative harmonic analysis.|$|E

Thus the essential idea {{of working with}} unbounded operators is to look instead at the resolvent [...] where [...] is nonreal. This is a bounded <b>normal</b> <b>operator,</b> which admits a spectral representation that can then be transferred to a spectral representation of [...] itself. A similar strategy is used, for instance, to study the spectrum of the Laplace operator: rather than address the operator directly, one instead looks as an associated resolvent such as a Riesz potential or Bessel potential.|$|E

2500|$|There are however severe {{difficulties}} {{with this particular}} approach, for example the Hamiltonian operator is not self-adjoint, {{in fact it is}} not even a <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> (i.e. the operator does not commute with its adjoint) and so the spectral theorem cannot be used to define the exponential in general. The most serious problem is that the 's are not mutually commuting, it can then be shown the formal quantity [...] cannot even define a (generalized) projector. The master constraint (see below) does not suffer from these problems and as such offers a way of connecting the canonical theory to the path integral formulation.|$|E
5000|$|If N is a <b>normal</b> <b>operator,</b> then N and N* {{have the}} same kernel and the same range. Consequently, the range of N is dense {{if and only if}} N is injective. Put in another way, the kernel of a <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> is the {{orthogonal}} complement of its range. It follows that the kernel of the operator Nk coincides with that of N for any k. Every generalized eigenvalue of a <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> is thus genuine. λ is an eigenvalue of a <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> N if and only if its complex conjugate [...] is an eigenvalue of N*. Eigenvectors of a <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, and a <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> stabilizes the orthogonal complement of each of its eigenspaces. This implies the usual spectral theorem: every <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> on a finite-dimensional space is diagonalizable by a unitary operator. There is also an infinite-dimensional version of the spectral theorem expressed in terms of projection-valued measures. The residual spectrum of a <b>normal</b> <b>operator</b> is empty.|$|E

Actually, in the afore mentioned cases, the normality of AB is equivalent with that of BA, and a more general result of F. Kittaneh implies that it is sufficient that AB be normal and compact to obtain that BA is the same. On the other hand, I. Kaplansky had shown {{that it may be}} possible that AB is normal while BA is not.
