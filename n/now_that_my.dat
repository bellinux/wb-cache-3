500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Dade County vote, a {{gardener}} {{who worked for the}} City of San Francisco named Robert Hillsborough was stabbed 15 times in his face and chest while his attackers chanted [...] "Faggot" [...] at him.

Mrs. Hillsborough brought a $5 million civil suit against Anita Bryant claiming Hillsborough's attackers said [...] "Here's one for Anita". She said, [...] "I didn't think much about Anita Bryant's campaign at first. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> son's murder has happened, I think about the Bryant campaign a lot. Anyone who wants to carry on this kind of thing must be sick. My son's blood is on her hands." [...] Bryant, Green, Mike Thompson and Save Our Children were dismissed from the suit in November 1977.|$|E

[...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> husband had become so famous I really thought it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I will not. I shall {{think you}} are {{convinced}} that, had she seen Diggory in his present position, she would have considered him a fitting husband for you. <b>Now,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>my</b> real feeling. Don't consult me any more, but do as you like, Thomasin. I shall be content." ...|$|R

An' so long as Mrs. Flower makes them thar three-inch-deep pies for me, I don't care who she thinks she made, an' who she thinks she didn't make. Thar <b>now,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>my</b> opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|Payne grinned {{as if he}} {{appreciated}} his tact, {{and then}} resumed: [...] "In the settlement where I was raised, the old fellow who kept the store had a cheat-ledger. When somebody traded stale eggs and garden-truck for good groceries, and the storekeeper saw he couldn't make trouble about it without losing a customer, he said nothing but scored it down against the man. Sometimes he had to wait a long while, {{but sooner or later}} he squared the account. <b>Now</b> <b>that's</b> <b>my</b> plan with Don Ramon Oliva." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{not write}} to her? 'Tis a very queer corner {{that you have}} got into, sergeant. You see all these things will come to light if you go back, and they won't sound well at all. Faith, if I was you I'd even bide as you be--a single man {{of the name of}} Francis. A good wife is good, but the best wife is not so good as no wife at all. <b>Now</b> <b>that's</b> <b>my</b> outspoke mind, and I've been called a long-headed feller here and there." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> page upcloses, doomed, maybe, Never {{to press}} thy cosy {{cushions}} more, Or wake thy ready Yeas as heretofore, Or stir thy gentle vows {{of faith in}} me: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said he, and I am <b>now</b> persuaded <b>that</b> <b>my</b> words turned his {{attention}} to me for the first time, but at the moment I was sure some impertinent meaning lurked behind his answer.|$|R
6000|$|Up to that day, Bertram {{had heard}} {{nothing of the}} {{circumstances}} under which the living had been given. Then did Wilkinson tell him the story, and ended by saying--"You <b>now</b> see <b>that</b> <b>my</b> marriage is quite out of the question." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because I {{come here}} {{only as a}} visitor. If I came on a mission from the queen, or {{as one of a}} {{deputation}} of chiefs, I should wear my ornaments. I wear them at home <b>now,</b> those <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; should Mr. Harcourt be <b>my</b> lover <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> is <b>my</b> {{affair and}} his, not yours. But {{had he been}} so then-- You owe it to me to say whether among other sins, that sin also is charged against me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|LORETTA. This afternoon. Just <b>now.</b> Billy said <b>that</b> <b>my</b> [...] . our [...] . our [...] . our kisses were terrible if we didn't get married.|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> sister's suspicions were correct, {{and that there}} was some very {{intimate}} connection between the presence of the three Orientals and the mysterious peril which hung over the towers of Cloomber.|$|E
60|$|It was grim {{news that}} old Falcone brought us. He had never quitted {{my father in}} those six weary years of {{wandering}} until <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father was beyond the need of his or any other's service.|$|E
