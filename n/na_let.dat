In {{the first}} part of this paper we prove a saddle Fredholm alternative: Let A: D(A) → H be a linear self adjoint {{operator}} with a null space <b>N(A).</b> <b>Let</b> bH, eH ⊂H be subspaces of a Hilbert space H and H = bH ⊕ N(A) ⊕ eH. If there exist c 3 > 0, c 4 > 0 such that (Au, u) ≤ −c 3 ‖u‖ 2 ∀u ∈D(A) ∩ bH, (Au, u) ≥ c 4 ‖u‖ 2 ∀u ∈D(A) ∩ eH, then an equation Au = f has a solution for an f ∈ H if and only if (f, v) = 0 ∀ v ∈ N(A). We also prove that the classical Fredholm alternative is a consequence of the saddle Fredholm alternative. In the second part we formulate a nonlinear Fredholm alternative and we prove it using the Saddle Point Theorem. We also show that the saddle Fredholm alternative is a consequence of the Saddle Point Theorem. MSC 2000. 57 R 70, 34 G 20, 47 A 53, 46 T 99...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} a convex function ψp,q,λ = max{ψp, λψq}, (1 ≤ q < p ≤ ∞), and its corresponding absolute normalized norm ‖. ‖ψp,q,λ. We determine a dual norm {{and use it}} for getting refinements of the classical Hölder inequality. Also, we consider a related concave function φp,q,λ = min{ψp, λψq}, (0 < p < q ≤ 1). 1. Preliminaries Since the end of 20 th century several mathematicians have intensively researched properties of the absolute normalized norms on C 2 (see [2], [6], [9], [10], [11]). In this section we give some properties of it which have impact to the classical Hölder inequality for two pairs of numbers. Let us recall that a norm ‖. ‖ on C 2 {{is said to be}} absolute if ‖(x, y) ‖ = ‖(|x|, |y|) ‖ for all x, y ∈ C and it is normalized if ‖(1, 0) ‖ = ‖(0, 1) ‖ = 1. The set of all absolute normalized norms on C 2 is denoted by <b>Na.</b> <b>Let</b> Ψ denotes the family of all convex functions ψ on [0, 1] with ψ(0) = ψ(1) = 1 satisfying max{ 1 − t, t} ≤ ψ(t) ≤ 1, (0 ≤ t ≤ 1). Classes Na and Ψ are in one-to-one correspondence, (see [1]). Namely, if ‖. ‖ ∈ Na, then the function ψ(t) = ‖(1 − t, t) ‖ belongs to Ψ. Conversely, if ψ ∈ Ψ, then th...|$|E
