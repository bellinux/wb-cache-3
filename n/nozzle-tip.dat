40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for optimised component surfaces with enhanced chemical and geometric complexity {{is a key}} driver in the manufacturing technology required for advanced surface production. Current methodologies cannot create complex surfaces in an efficient and scalable manner in robust engineering materials. Hence, {{there is a need}} for advanced manufacturing technologies which overcome this. Current technologies are limited by resolution, geometric flexibility and mode of energy delivery. By addressing the fundamental limitations of electrochemical jetting techniques through modulation of the current density distribution by mechanical design, significant improvements to the electrochemical jet process methods are presented. A simplified 2 D stochastic model was developed with the ability to vary current density distribution to assess the effects of <b>nozzle-tip</b> shape changes. The simulation demonstrated that the resultant profile was found to be variable from that of a standard nozzle. These <b>nozzle-tip</b> modifications were then experimentally tested finding a high degree of variance was possible in the machined profile. Improvements such as an increase in side-wall steepness of 162 % are achieved over a standard profile, flat bases to the cut profile and a reduction of profile to surface inter-section radius enable the process to be analogous to traditional milling profiles. Since electrode design can be rapidly modified EJP is shown to be a flexible process capable of varied and complex meso-scale profile creation. Innovations presented here in the modulation of resistance in-jet have enabled electrochemical jet processes to become a viable, top-down, single-step method for applying complex surfaces geometries unachievable by other means...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} in residual spraying programmes for malaria eradication that a uniform deposit of insecticide should {{be applied to the}} walls of dwellings. The uniformity of application with hand compression sprayers is greatly enhanced if a disk flow regulator is used, but this device has not been popular for field use as its properties alter after a few days' use. This study explains the mode of action of the device and discloses that swelling of the disk caused by the DDT formulation is the primary cause of the gradual reduction of output. The need for proper mating of the disk with the nozzle tip is explained, and the 9504 E-type tip is described as best suited for the desired spray output. Use of the disk flow regulator is recommended because it permits uniform spray application and reduces <b>nozzle-tip</b> erosion...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{design and}} {{construction}} of two new sample injection systems or nozzles, for use with the Oregon State electron diffraction apparatus are discussed. One of these nozzles was intended for use with volatile samples the vapors of which were to be heated or cooled over the range - 196 to 540 °C; it is currently in regular use. The other nozzle, equipped with a sample volatilizing oven, was intended for use with relatively involatile materials, that is, materials having vapor pressures {{of only a few}} torr in the range 150 to 1200 °C. Only a prototype of this nozzle was constructed. The structures and particularly the torsional properties of the molecules diboron tetrafluoride, diboron tetrabromide, biacetyl (2, 3 - butanedione), and oxalyl chloride (ethanedioyl dichloride) have been investigated, For B₂F₄ <b>nozzle-tip</b> temperatures of - 50, 22, and 150 °C were used. In contrast to B₂Cl₄ which is staggered in the gas phase, the B₂F₄ molecule has a coplanar equilibrium conformation (symmetry D₂h). The effect of temperature change on the amplitude of torsional motion is commensurate with a description of this motion as slightly hindered internal rotation. The average value for the rotational barrier V₀ is 0. 418 (156) kcal/mol based on an assumed hindering potential of the form 2 V = V₀(1 -cos 2 o). An estimate of the fundamental torsional frequency gives 20 (4) cm⁻¹. For B₂Br₄ <b>nozzle-tip</b> temperatures of 23, 90, 150 and 305 °C were used. The molecule is like B₂C 1 ₄ in that it has a staggered equilibrium conformation (symmetry D₂d). The average of the rotational barrier for the four temperatures based on the assumed potential function for hindered rotation V = V₀(1 - cos 2 o) is V₀ = 3. 07 (. 33) kcal/mol. higher than that for B₂F₄ or B₂C 1 ₄. The estimated value for the torsional frequency is 18 (4) cm⁻¹. An earlier electron diffraction investigation of biacetyl at a <b>nozzle-tip</b> temperature of 228 °C revealed only a trans conformer, in contrast to certain similar conjugated systems which have substantial amounts of gauche rotameric forms as well. New experiments at 525 °C have been carried out with the same result: there is no evidence for the presence of any but the trans conformer. The structure and conformational properties of oxalyl chloride were studied by reanalyzing the data from experiments at 0, 80, and 190 °C obtained from an older investigation together with new data taken from experiments at 405 and 525 °C in terms of a more sophisticated model, The experiment at 525 °C resulted in essentially complete decomposition into, apparently, phosgene and carbon monoxide. In agreement with the former study, all evidence still indicates the gas to be a mixture of trans and gauche conformers. Making the approximation that the difference between the trans (torsion angle o) = 0 ⁰) and gauche conformers lies only in the torsion angle about the C-C bond, the average gauche torsion angle over all four temperatures is og = 93. 5 (8. 2) ⁰. The conformational analysis was based on an assumed rotational potential function of the form 2 V = ³∑i=₁Vi(1 - cos io). The average values of the three potential constants were found to be V₁ = 1. 94 (31), V₂ = - 0. 53 (. 24), and V₃ = 0. 70 (12) kcal/mol. Equilibrium constants were evaluated from the temperature dependence of the composition with the energy difference ΔE° = Eg° - Et° = 1. 72 (σ= 0. 29) kcal/mol and entropy difference ΔS° = Sg° - St° = 1. 8 (σ= 0. 8) cal/deg begin subsequently obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{structures of}} NbOBr 3, NbSCl 3, and NbSBr 3 have been determined by gas-phase electron diffraction (GED) at <b>nozzle-tip</b> temperatures of 250 degreesC, {{taking into account}} the possible presence of NbOCl 3 as a contaminant in the NbSCl 3 sample and NbOBr 3 in the NbSBr 3 sample. The experimental data are consistent with trigonal-pyramidal molecules having C- 3 v symmetry. Infrared spectra of molecules trapped in argon or nitrogen matrices were recorded and exhibit the characteristic fundamental stretching modes for C- 3 v species. Well resolved isotopic fine structure (Cl- 35 and Cl- 37) was observed for NbSCl 3, and for NbOCl 3 which occurred as an impurity in the NbSCl 3 spectra. Quantum mechanical calculations of the structures and vibrational frequencies of the four YNbX 3 molecules (Y = O, S; X = Cl, Br) were carried out at several levels of theory, most importantly B 3 LYP DFT with either the Stuttgart RSC ECP or Hay-Wadt (n + 1) ECP VDZ basis set for Nb and the 6 - 311 G* basis set for the nonmetal atoms. Theoretical values for the bond lengths are 0. 01 - 0. 04 Angstrom longer than the experimental ones of type r(a), in accord with general experience, but the bond angles with theoretical minus experimental differences of only 1. 0 - 1. 5 degrees are notably accurate. Symmetrized force fields were also calculated. The experimental bond lengths (r(g) /Angstrom) and angles (angle(alpha) /deg) with estimated 2 sigma uncertainties from GED are as follows. NbOBr 3 : r(Nb=O) = 1. 694 (7), r(Nb-Br) = 2. 429 (2), angle(O=Nb-Br) = 107. 3 (5), angle(Br-Nb-Br) = 111. 5 (5). NbSBr 3 : r(Nb=S) = 2. 134 (10), r(Nb-Br) = 2. 408 (4), angle(S=Nb-Br) = 106. 6 (7), angle(Br-Nb-Br) = 112. 2 (6). NbSCl 3 : Nb=S) = 2. 120 (10), r(Nb-Cl) = 2. 271 (6), angle(S=Nb-Cl) = 107. 8 (12), angle(Cl-Nb-Cl) = 111. 1 (11) ...|$|E
