50|$|The {{building}} {{is located in}} the former fortified town, about 150 m west of the eastern wall and 400 m <b>north</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Baghdad</b> Gate. When in the 1970s the modern city began to expand rapidly, the entire historic area was overbuilt. The archaeological complex at Qasr al-Banat was urbanized with new housing so that only an open space of 80 m wide and 200 m long remained.|$|R
25|$|Camp Ashraf {{is located}} {{northeast}} of the Iraqi town of Khalis, about 120 kilometers west of the Iranian border and 60 kilometers <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad,</b> and is {{the seat of the}} PMOI. Iraq and Iran have designated the PMOI a terrorist group, though not the United States, European Union or United Nations. The PMOI was welcomed into Iraq in the 1980s by then-President Saddam Hussein who funded and armed the group, which fought alongside Iraqi forces during the Iran–Iraq War.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June, Iraqi General Najim al-Jubouri, the {{commander}} of the planned operation to retake Mosul, reported that Iraqi special forces were massing to the <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad</b> and Baiji, in preparation for the coming battle. Units from the 15th and 16th Divisions of the Iraqi Army, federal police, and Golden Brigade were said to have been dispatched. General al-Jubouri also stated that the Iraqi forces deployed had been trained, and that they will be equipped with advanced weapons when the assault begins. He also said that the operation would be accompanied by an intense Coalition air campaign against ISIL positions in Mosul.|$|E
25|$|The al-Khilani mosque bombing {{occurred}} on 19 June 2007 when a truck bomb exploded {{in front of}} the Shia al-Khilani mosque in Baghdad, Iraq. At least 78 people were killed and another 218 injured in the blast. The explosion occurred just two days after a four-day curfew banning vehicle movement in the city was lifted after the al-Askari Mosque bombing (2007), and just hours after 10,000 US troops began the Arrowhead Ripper offensive to the <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad.</b> Because the site was a Shia mosque, the bombing is presumed to have been the work of Sunnis. The Sinak area where the explosion took place was also the targeted by a suicide car bomber on 28 May 2007, which resulted in 21 deaths.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] United States began {{conducting}} airstrikes in Iraq on 8 August 2014.

25|$|The site of {{the battle}} was at the city of Opis on the river Tigris, located about 50 miles (80km) <b>north</b> <b>of</b> modern <b>Baghdad.</b> The city {{is thought to have}} been a {{preferred}} point to cross the river; Xenophon describes a bridge there. The timing of the invasion may have been determined by the ebb of the Mesopotamian rivers, which are at their lowest levels – and therefore are easiest to cross – in the early autumn.|$|R
50|$|The Middle East Command hastily {{assembled}} a formation known as Iraqforce — {{which included the}} Indian 10th Infantry Division and the Arab Legion — and it arrived on April 18. There were two main British military bases in Iraq, at Basra and at Habbaniya, <b>north</b> east <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad.</b> On April 30, the Iraqi Army surrounded and besieged the isolated and poorly defended Royal Air Force base at Habbaniya. Although the base had no offensive aircraft, RAF personnel converted training aircraft to carry weapons, and attacked the Iraqi forces.|$|R
25|$|This {{deception}} plan worked, and on 2 April Saddam's son Qusay Hussein {{declared that}} the American invasion from the south was a feint and ordered troops to be re-deployed from the Karbala front to the <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad.</b> Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was {{in command of the}} Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time.|$|E
500|$|This was a {{major factor}} in al-Mu'tasim's {{decision}} in 836 to found a new capital at Samarra, some [...] <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad,</b> but there were other considerations at play as well. Founding a new capital was a public statement of the establishment of a new regime, and according to Tayeb El-Hibri allowed the court to exist [...] "at a distance from the populace of Baghdad and protected by a new guard of foreign troops, and amid a new royal culture revolving around sprawling palatial grounds, public spectacle and a seemingly ceaseless quest for leisurely indulgence", an arrangement compared by Oleg Grabar to the relationship between Paris and Versailles after Louis XIV. In addition, by creating a new city in a previously uninhabited area, al-Mu'tasim could reward his followers with land and commercial opportunities without cost to himself and free from any constraints, unlike Baghdad with its established interest groups and high property prices. In fact, the sale of land seems to have produced considerable profit for the treasury—in the words of Kennedy, [...] "a sort of gigantic property speculation in which both government and its followers could expect to benefit".|$|E
500|$|The 45th Infantry Brigade {{was formed}} from {{existing}} {{elements of the}} disbanded 45th Infantry Division which had seen action during World War II and the Korean War. Concurrently, the 45th Field Artillery Group (today's 45th Fires Brigade) and 90th Troop Command, were also formed in the same way. The 45th Infantry Brigade was activated in 1968 and assigned to training duties for active duty army units until 1994 when the 45th was selected as one of 15 [...] "enhanced brigades". The brigade deployed {{as part of the}} UN peacekeeping force {{in the wake of the}} Bosnian War, with C Company, 1-179th Infantry being among the first National Guard units to see duty there. In 2003, A Co 1-179 deployed to Saudi Arabia while B 1-179 deployed to Kuwait to provide security for Patriot missile sites. During the invasion of Iraq, B Co 1-179 pushed <b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad</b> establishing a foothold in Taji Iraq. Later that year, the 45th deployed to Afghanistan to train soldiers of the Afghan National Army which was followed by a deployment to Iraq to assist in the turning over of American military bases to Iraqi forces. A second brigade deployment to Afghanistan in 2011 assigned the brigade to full-spectrum operations for the first time since the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|In May 1941, {{to add to}} British {{troubles}} in the area, there was a coup d'état against the pro-British government in Iraq. A pro-German ruler took power in the coup and ordered British forces out of Iraq. There were two main British bases in Iraq, around Basra and at Habbaniya <b>north</b> east <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad.</b> Basra was too well defended for the Iraqis to consider taking. However, Habbaniya was a poorly defended air base, situated {{in the middle of}} enemy territory. It had no regular air forces, being only a training centre. Nonetheless, the RAF personnel at the base converted as many of the training aircraft as possible to carry weapons.|$|R

Part of the right hand wing had been detached and it was found 1.3 mi south-southwest from {{the crash site}}. The Board of Inquiry (BoI) investigating team travelled to the crash site 65 hours after {{the loss of the}} aircraft. They were only able to spend a short time at both sites due to local hostilities with a cordon and security being provided by 150 United States Marine Corps personnel. The BoI team had all the remaining wreckage dragged into a canal as this would hopefully deter further looting by locals. The tailfin of the aircraft was destroyed on site on orders of the BoI team to prevent its use as a backdrop in propaganda videos.|$|R
50|$|On April 5, 2004, {{the radical}} cleric Muqtada Al Sadr {{called for a}} jihad against {{coalition}} forces and Thursday night, April 8, his Mahdi Militia dropped eight bridges and overspans around Camp Scania, thus severing the northbound traffic into the Sunni Triangle. He was hoping to starve the 1st Cavalry Division of fuel and ammunition. Consequently, the 724th Transportation Company was tasked to haul fuel to the <b>north</b> gate <b>of</b> <b>Baghdad</b> Airport from Camp Anaconda, 60 miles away the next morning - Good Friday and {{the anniversary of the}} Americans entering Baghdad. Unknown to the truck drivers, elements of the 1st Cavalry Division had pushed militants into the suburbs of Abu Graib, through which the convoy had to travel. Up until this time, the convoy ambushes consisted of four or five insurgents firing on passing convoys with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms. The reaction to enemy contact at time was to return fire and clear the area.|$|R
