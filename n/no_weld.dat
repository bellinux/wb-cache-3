40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} a new {{geometry of the}} gate system in injection moulding process. The corners of existing edge gates results in the turbulence of molten plastic into the cavity which leads to internal and external defects. The aim of the new geometry {{is to reduce the}} internal and external defects of injected parts. Also easier de-gating of final part for the new geometry which decreases the visible blemish of final part after de-gating is a target of this study. A new design of edge gate is suggested for two circular flat plates with a thickness of 1 mm. Internal and external defects in the plastic part are analysed with SolidWorks Plastics to validate the proposed geometry. The contribution of this research is to modify the geometry of existing edge gate by removing the corners of rectangular edge gate to reduce the scrap rate of injected parts. Also, a smooth flow of molten plastic into the cavities reduces the internal and external defects. The outcome demonstrates filling the cavities with no short shot.

Both nanocomposites show brittleness when the weld line is present. The fracture tensile surfaces are examined using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy and the results show that much larger micron-sized organoclay entities exist in the melt blended nanocomposites and that these, rather than nano-sized individual layers, cause the final behaviour.

40|$|International audienceRotational molding {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a plastic molding method with great potential. The process offers virtually stress-free products having <b>no</b> <b>weld</b> lines or material wastage, and utilizes relatively inexpensive molds. Yet its widespread growth is hindered due to long production cycle times, which are limited by {{the time required to}} heat up and cool down the mold and the product. This presentation is about the study of making multilayer PP/PA 6 parts with the reactive rotational molding process. Different studies have already been made in the past about rotational molding or about reactive process of monolayer part. The aim of this work is to reduce cycle time by making a layer via anionic polymerization of caprolactam, and them to compare each process. This presentation is divided into two parts: the first part deals with rheological, dieclectric aland thermal analysis to investigate the effect of mixtures and the crystallization/polymerization effect; the second part deals with the processing of bilayer parts. Firstly, different mixtures of catalysts and activators were investigated by Rheology and thermal analysis in order to determine which mixture would be the most appropriate for the rotational molding process: 2 - 2 (2 % of activator and 2 % of catalyst), 3 - 3, 4 - 4 and 6 - 6. In the second step, different processing investigations have been done in order to study the influences of the parameters like oven time or cooling time. An experimental analysis of heat transfer in reactive rotational molding process was also lead. By using an instrumented mold associated with a radio transmission data acquisition system, we demonstrate that the rotational parts of the bilyar PP/PA 6 (reactive way) can be obtained with optimised conditions in correlation with the results of rheology and dielectric measurements. Moreover, the results allows us {{that it is possible to}} make bilayer reactive part with the rotational molding process by using less energy in a shorter time...|$|E
40|$|The CO 2 -laser-MAG hybrid {{welding process}} {{has been shown to}} be a {{productive}} choice for the welding industry, being used in e. g. the shipbuilding, pipe and beam manufacturing, and automotive industries. It provides an opportunity to increase the productivity of welding of joints containing air gaps compared with autogenous laser beam welding, with associated reductions in distortion and marked increases in welding speeds and penetration in comparison with both arc and autogenous laser welding. The literature study indicated that the phenomena of laser hybrid welding are mostly being studied using bead-on-plate welding or zero air gap configurations. This study shows it very clearly that the CO 2 laser-MAG hybrid welding process is completely different, when there is a groove with an air gap. As in case of industrial use it is excepted that welding is performed for non-zero grooves, this study is of great importance for industrial applications. The results of this study indicate that by using a 6 kW CO 2 laser-MAG hybrid welding process, the welding speed may also be increased if an air gap is present in the joint. Experimental trials indicated that the welding speed may be increased by 30 - 82 % when compared with bead-on-plate welding, or welding of a joint with no air gap i. e. a joint prepared as optimum for autogenous laser welding. This study demonstrates very clearly, that the separation of the different processes, as well as the relative configurations of the processes (arc leading or trailing) affect welding performance significantly. These matters influence the droplet size and therefore the metal transfer mode, which in turn determined the resulting weld quality and the ability to bridge air gaps. Welding in bead-onplate mode, or of an I butt joint containing no air gap joint is facilitated by using a leading torch. This is due to the preheating effect of the arc, which increases the absorptivity of the work piece to the laser beam, enabling greater penetration and the use of higher welding speeds. With an air gap present, air gap bridging is more effectively achieved by using a trailing torch because of the lower arc power needed, the wider arc, and the movement of droplets predominantly towards the joint edges. The experiments showed, that the mode of metal transfer has a marked effect on gap bridgeability. Transfer of a single droplet per arc pulse may not be desirable if an air gap is present, because most of the droplets are directed towards the middle of the joint where no base material is present. In such cases, undercut is observed. Pulsed globular and rotational metal transfer modes enable molten metal to also be transferred to the joint edges, and are therefore superior metal transfer modes when bridging air gaps. It was also found very obvious, that process separation is an important factor in gap bridgeability. If process separation is too large, the resulting weld often exhibits sagging, or <b>no</b> <b>weld</b> may be formed at all as a result of the reduced interaction between the component processes. In contrast, if the processes are too close to one another, the processing region contains excess molten metal that may create difficulties for the keyhole to remain open. When the distance is optimised - i. e. a separation of 0 - 4 mm in this study, depending on the welding speed and beam-arc configuration - the processes act together, creating beneficial synergistic effects. The optimum process separation when using a trailing torch was found to be shorter (0 - 2 mm) than when a leading torch is used (2 - 4 mm); a result of the facilitation of weld pool motion when the latter configuration is adopted. This study demonstrates, that the MAG process used has a strong effect on the CO 2 -laser-MAG hybrid welding process. The laser beam welding component is relatively stable and easy to manage, with only two principal processing parameters (power and welding speed) needing to be adjusted. In contrast, the MAG process has a large number of processing parameters to optimise, all of which play an important role in the interaction between the laser beam and the arc. The parameters used for traditional MAG welding are often not optimal in achieving the most appropriate mode of metal transfer, and weld quality in laser hybrid welding, and must be optimised if the full range of benefits provided by hybrid welding are to be realised...|$|E
