5|$|The polity of Tondo flourished {{during the}} latter half of the Ming dynasty as a result of direct trade {{relations}} with China. The Tondo district was the traditional capital of the empire, and its rulers were sovereign kings, <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> chieftains. They were addressed variously as panginuan in Maranao or panginoón in Tagalog ("lords"); anák banwa ("son of heaven"); or lakandula ("lord of the palace"). The Emperor of China considered the Lakans—the rulers of ancient Manila—"王", or kings.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged on whether or <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated {{the overthrow of the}} United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E

25|$|The mosques were <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> {{places for}} {{offering}} prayers; these were community centers as well where the faithful gathered to discuss problems {{of social and}} cultural importance. During the caliphate of Umar as many as four thousand mosques were constructed extending from Persia in the east to Egypt in the west. Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and Masjid al-Haram were enlarged first during the reign of Umar and then during the reign of Uthman ibn Affan who not only extended them to many thousand square meters but also beautified them on a large scale.|$|E

25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} his condemnation, Photios had reingratiated himself with Basil, and became tutor to the Byzantine emperor's children. From {{surviving}} letters of Photios written during his exile at the Skepi monastery, {{it appears that}} the ex-patriarch brought pressure to bear on the Byzantine emperor to restore him. Ignatios's biographer argues that Photios forged a document relating to the genealogy and rule of Basil's family, and had it placed in the imperial library where a friend of his was a librarian. According to this document, the Byzantine emperor's ancestors were <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> peasants as everyone believed but descendants of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. True or not, this story does reveal Basil's dependence on Photios for literary and ideological matters. Following Photios's recall, Ignatios and the ex-patriarch met, and publicly expressed their reconciliation. When Ignatios died on October 23, 877, {{it was a matter of}} course that his old opponent replaced him on the patriarchal throne three days later. Shaun Tougher asserts that from this point on Basil no longer simply depended on Photios, but in fact he was dominated by him.|$|E

25|$|While Berlioz is {{best known}} as a composer, he was also a {{prolific}} writer, and supported himself for many years by writing musical criticism, utilising a bold, vigorous style, at times imperious and sarcastic. He wrote for many journals, including the Rénovateur, Journal des débats and Gazette musicale. He was active in the Débats for over thirty years until submitting his last signed article in 1863. Almost from the founding, Berlioz was a key member of the editorial board of the Gazette as well as a contributor, and acted as editor on several occasions while the owner was otherwise engaged. Berlioz took full advantage of his times as editor, allowing himself to increase his articles written on music history rather than current events, evidenced by him publishing seven articles on Gluck in the Gazette between June 1834 and January 1835. An example of the amount of work he produced is indicated in his producing over one-hundred articles for the Gazette between 1833 and 1837. This is a conservative estimate, as not all of his submissions were signed. In 1835 alone, due to one of his many times of financial difficulty, he wrote four articles for the Monde dramatique, twelve for the Gazette, nineteen for the Débats and thirty-seven for the Rénovateur. These were <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> scribbles, but in-depth articles and reviews with little duplication, which took considerable time to write.|$|E

500|$|William Paden {{argued that}} {{religious}} language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that {{to those who}} practice a religion, myths are <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must explain something {{in the world with}} reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as [...] "folktales". Using the example of creation myths, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed {{in the same way as}} a scientific theory.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have also}} noted Indo-European {{parallels}} to the wolves Geri and Freki as companions of a divinity. 19th century scholar Jacob Grimm observed {{a connection between}} this aspect of Odin's character and the Greek Apollo, to whom both the wolf and the raven are sacred. Philologist Maurice Bloomfield further connected the pair with the two dogs of Yama in Vedic mythology, and saw them as a Germanic counterpart to a more general and widespread Indo-European [...] "Cerberus"-theme. Michael Speidel finds similar parallels in the Vedic Rudra and the Roman Mars. Elaborating on the connection between wolves and figures of great power, he writes: [...] "This is why Geri and Freki, the wolves at Woden's side, also glowered on the throne of the Anglo-Saxon kings. Wolf-warriors, like Geri and Freki, were <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> animals but mythical beings: as Woden's followers they bodied forth his might, and so did wolf-warriors." ...|$|E

He added that the episode feels fresher because of the [...] "rapid-fire dialogue, farcical situations and ubiquitous double-entendres. And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt, it did prove that real people — and <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> machines — laugh at the characters and the jokes." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted that the episode showed that Will & Grace still had a bit of life left. He added that McCormack seemed to flourish under the pressure, and that Hayes and Mullally [...] "were given free rein to flex their Jack and Karen [...] ". Dana Stevens of Slate magazine reported that [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] offered a chance to punch up the show with some [...] "unusually broad sight gags."

500|$|Character {{witnesses}} in 18th-century English trials were, according to author Douglas Hay, [...] "extremely important, and very frequently used ... in character testimony too, {{the word of}} a man of property had the greatest weight. [...] Judges respected the evidence of employers, farmers and neighboring gentlemen, <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> neighbors and friends." [...] The jury were apparently unimpressed by the defence's case and pronounced both defendants guilty. [...] They were sentenced on 26February; Wells would be branded {{in her hand and}} spend six months in prison. [...] For stealing Canning's stays, Squires was to be hanged. [...] By March 1753 pamphlets on Canning's story were being read in the coffee-houses of London. [...] There was widespread outrage over Squires' treatment of her, exacerbated when Little Jemmy, [...] "a poor man who cries sticks about the streets" [...] was supposedly robbed and then stamped on by five gypsies. [...] Canning was celebrated by the mob and gentry, several of whom contributed to her purse, enabling her to move to better accommodation in the house of a Mr Marshall, a cheesemonger in Aldermanbury.|$|E
500|$|The {{main issue}} for Zwingli is that Luther puts [...] "the chief point of {{salvation}} in the bodily eating {{of the body}} of Christ". Luther saw the action as strengthening faith and remitting sins. This, however, conflicted with Zwingli's view of faith. The bodily presence of Christ could not produce faith as faith is from God, for those whom God has chosen. Zwingli also appealed to several passages of scripture with John 6:63 in particular. He saw Luther's view as denying Christ's humanity and asserted that Christ's body is only at one place and that is at the right hand of God. The Marburg Colloquy did not produce anything new in the debate between the two reformers. Neither changed his position, but it did produce some further developments in Zwingli's views. For example, he noted that the bread was <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> bread and affirmed terms such as [...] "presence", [...] "true", and [...] "sacramental". However, it was Zwingli's and Luther's differences in their understanding of faith, their Christology, their approach and use of scripture that ultimately made any agreement impossible.|$|E
500|$|A {{factor of}} great {{conflict}} all over Eora is the recent scientific discovery that souls are <b>not</b> <b>mere</b> metaphysical abstractions, but quantifiable, measurable objects {{that can be}} transferred, stored, or molded. Souls are the basis of magic, as accessing their power is what allows certain people to use it. Souls leave the body upon death, and go through a largely unknown process before reincarnating into a newborn body. Every soul does, however, have embedded memories from their previous lives, and through certain processes a person's soul can be [...] "Awakened," [...] meaning they gain awareness of these past lives. There are also {{people in the world}} who have the supernatural ability to perceive people's souls, which allows them to access past memories, among other things; these individuals are called [...] "Watchers." [...] Though the study of souls, called animancy, is still a young field of science, the implications for society at large has been vast, led to rapid advances in technology, and caused several rifts and clashes in the different religious communities, which has marked the era as a time of great turmoil.|$|E
