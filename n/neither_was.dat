For the British War Memorials Committee, he produced a design for a Hall of Remembrance (1918) that {{would have been in the}} form of an art gallery, and for New College, Oxford, he created a design for a tiny memorial chapel (1919). <b>Neither</b> <b>was</b> constructed.|$|E

5|$|Neither he nor Greenfield had {{run as a}} {{candidate}} in the election, and <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> {{a member of the}} legislature. Percival Baker, the UFA member elected for Ponoka, had died on election day, opening up a seat for one of them. A second seat, Peace River, became available when incumbent Donald MacBeth Kennedy resigned to run in the 1921 federal election. Greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was acclaimed as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.|$|E

Both ships were withdrawn from service later in the war, Stettin {{to serve as a}} training ship, and Stuttgart to be converted into a seaplane tender in 1918. They both survived the war, and were surrendered to Britain as war prizes; they were dismantled in the early 1920s.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky was a shadow government {{established for the}} Commonwealth of Kentucky by a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers during the American Civil War. The shadow government never replaced the elected government in Frankfort, which had strong Union sympathies. <b>Neither</b> <b>was</b> it able to gain the whole support of Kentucky's citizens; its jurisdiction extended {{only as far as}} Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the provisional government was recognized by the Confederate States of America, and Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861. Kentucky was represented by the central star on the Confederate battle flag.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} engine propelling {{the carousel}} was a belt-driven mechanism, {{but after the}} initial restoration it was exchanged for a fluid drive provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who suggested the platform for the carousel be improved.

The next day Utley hit a grand slam and Hamels continued his dominance as the Phillies shut out the Mets 6–0, but the Mets routed the Phillies 11–2 in the series finale. The last game of the month opened a four-game series with the Nationals; the Phillies won 10–4 but Lee re-injured his elbow, probably ending his season.|$|E
