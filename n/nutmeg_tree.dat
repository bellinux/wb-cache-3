[...] In his letter, Leith points out that Captain Francis Light was the first to introduce cinnamon, clove and nutmeg trees, from Mauritius, to the island, 'procured at great expense,' but notes that the clove and nutmeg trees died shortly after. Light noted that there were 500 nutmeg trees between 3 and 10 years of age, at Caunter's estate, a few of the 10-year-olds, being between 7 and 9 feet and in bloom. Also on Caunter's estate were 40 clove plants between 3 and 4 feet high. Light died on 25 October 1794. It seems reasonable, therefore, that the tree that produced the fruit, that Leith referred to, and the others that were in blossom, may have been the ones Caunter obtained from the subsequent sale of the ones that arrived from the Moluccas aboard the 'Surprise,' in 1798, four years after Light's demise and four years before Leith's letter.|$|E

Lumut kerak merupakan gabungan antara alga dan cendawan, sehingga secara morfologi dan fisiologi merupakan satu kesatuan. Lumut kerak termasuk tumbuhan epifit yang dapat hidup pada suhu rendah maupun tinggi. Di Kecamatan Meukek, Kabupaten Aceh Selatan banyak dijumpai tanaman pala yang tumbuh di perkebunan rakyat. Namun, hingga saat ini belum ada informasi mengenai data keberadaan dan kekayaan jenis lumut kerak pada tanaman pala rakyat yang terdapat di Kecamatan Meukek, Kabupaten Aceh Selatan. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mendapatkan data mengenai tipe morfologi talus dan kekayaan jenis lumut kerak pada perkebunan pala rakyat di Kecamatan Meukek, Kabupaten Aceh Selatan. Metode yang digunakan adalah survei eksploratif dan pemilihan lokasi pengambilan sampel (desa) dilakukan secara purposive sampling. Tipe morfologi talus lumut kerak yang didapat ada tiga tipe, yaitu: crustose, foliose dan frusticose. Lokasi penelitian terbagi dua yaitu: sembilan plot pada kawasan dekat hutan dan sembilan plot di kawasan pesisir. Delapan dari sepuluh jenis lumut kerak yang ada terdapat di kawasan pesisir, yaitu: Platythecium dimorphodes, Verrucaria mucosa, Megalospora tuberculosa, Phyllospora furfuracea, Megalospora sulphurata, Coccocarpia erythroxyli, Heterodermia japonica, dan Lecanora tropica. Sedangkan lima dari sepuluh lumut kerak terdapat di kawasan dekat hutan, yaitu: Platythecium dimorphodes, Verrucaria mucosa, Graphis subtenella, Coegonium lateum, dan Phyllospora sulphurata.

The problem statement {{of this study is}} that the <b>nutmeg</b> <b>tree</b> trunk is a substrate that can be utilized by lichen as host plant. At Meukek District, South Aceh Regency, <b>nutmeg</b> <b>tree</b> are commonly found at local estate. However, until now there is no information about the presence and diversity of lichens species at local nutmeg plantation located at Meukek District, South Aceh Regency. The host plant was <b>nutmeg</b> <b>tree</b> (Myristica fragrans Houtt).

This study was purposed to obtain information related to the morphological type of thallus and the diversity of lichens species at local nutmeg plantation in Meukek District, South Aceh Regency. This study was using explorative survey method, and the selection of village for sampling location was done by purposive sampling. Identification of lichens was using spot test, microcrystal test, and apothecium-slice test. The result of this study showed that at local nutmeg plantation, found three types of lichens thallus morphology, which are crustose, foliose, and fruticose. There are ten species of lichens, i. e.

40|$|Reproductive strategies, sexual selection, {{and their}} {{relationship}} with the phenotype of individuals are topics widely studied in animals, but this information is less abundant for plants. Variability in flowering phenology among individuals has direct impact on their fitness, but how reproductive phenology is affected {{by the size of the}} individuals needs further study. We quantified the flowering intensity, length, and reproductive synchronization of two sympatric dioecious Wild <b>Nutmeg</b> <b>tree</b> species (Virola, Myristicaceae) in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, and analyzed its relationships with tree size. Two distinct strategies in flowering timing and intensity were found between species (annual versus biennial flowering), and among individuals in the annual flowering species (extended versus peak flowering). Only for the annual flowering species the reproductive output is related to tree size and large trees present proportionally higher flower coverage, and lower synchronization than smaller ones. Flowering is massive and highly synchronized in the biennial species. Sex ratios are not different from 1 : 1 in the two species, and in the two segregated reproductive subgroups in the biennial flowering species. The biennial flowering at individual level is a novelty among reproductive patterns in plants, separating the population in two reproductive subgroups. A proportional increase in the reproductive output with size exists only for the annual flowering species. A biennial flowering can allow resource storage favouring massive flowering for all the individuals diluting their relationship with size. © 2013 The Authors...|$|E
40|$|Moritz Herrmann {{writes about}} a {{different}} aspect of history: „Die goldene Frucht Ostindiens. Eine Warengeschichte der Muskatnuss. “ (The Golden Fruit of East-India: The History of the Nutmeg Trade). The story ranges from {{the discovery of}} nutmeg, its way to Europe and its significance in early modern times. The actual reason for the numerous voyages of discovery during the 15 th and 16 th century was the acquisition of trade items and exotic spices. Nutmeg trees only grew on a small island group in the east of what is nowadays known as Indonesia. Therefore, nutmeg became a rare trade item. Out of a cultural historical viewpoint, the reader is introduced to the <b>nutmeg</b> <b>tree</b> and its economical life conditions. The arduous production of the spice and its manifold use as a luxury foodstuff and as a medicine are also depicted. A subsequent in-depth analysis of the European trade relations shows the numerous conflicts of interest. The problematic relationship between the indigenous population and the European traders are also considered. At {{the end of the}} 16 th century, the Portuguese domination in the high-sea spice trade was challenged by Britain and the Netherlands. Especially the Netherlands {{played a crucial role in}} this process, as they had a prosperous monopoly on the nutmeg trade until 1810. The historical importance of nutmeg spices not only had an impact on international trade and worldwide political relations, but also can be regarded as an example of European early capitalism as well as an example for the increasing colonialisation of indigenous people. Moritz Herrmann achieves the goal of showing the far-reaching dimensions of the inconspicuous little nut, which nowadays can be found in almost every German household...|$|E
