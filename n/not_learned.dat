5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it {{to everyone else}} in the Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody else in the office already knew about it.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species have}} {{distinctive}} loud grating calls used for advertising and territorial purposes in the breeding season, although the corn crake is silent on its African wintering grounds. They are mainly active during the day; they walk with a high-stepping action, and when disturbed {{they can run}} swiftly through grass or fly a short distance to cover. Migration takes place at night, {{and the ability to}} undertake these journeys is innate, <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> from adults. The nest is a shallow cup of grass lined with finer vegetation and built in a well hidden depression. The precocial chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, and fledge after four to six weeks. These are ground-feeding omnivores, but mainly eat invertebrates. They may be killed by a variety of mammals and large birds, and infected by parasites.|$|E
5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was drafted}} by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reports in February 1948 {{indicated}} that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year. However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers' offer, opting instead {{to play for the}} new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In June 1948, Chappuis signed with Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC after coach Carl Voyles outbid the Steelers for his services at $17,000. Chappuis had been drafted by the Cleveland Browns, and the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis. Rickey had felt that modern football was based on speed and that he could win with a good center, passing quarterback and two tall sprinting ends. Thus, he placed a premium on signing Chappuis, the passing quarterback. The college All-star game caused Chappuis to miss three weeks of practice and he played little in the early season games because he had <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> his plays.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in August, the battalion remained on Tarakan to undertake garrison duties. During this time it undertook patrol operations {{to bring in the}} various pockets of Japanese troops who had <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> of the surrender; these were dangerous operations and in an effort to reduce casualties, the patrols went out with several Japanese prisoners to help talk their former comrades into surrendering. As the demobilisation process began, its numbers dwindled as long-serving men were repatriated back to Australia, while others with only limited service were transferred to other units for further service. Finally, on 25 October 1945, while still on Tarakan, the battalion was disbanded. The occasion was marked by a small ceremony at Tarakan involving the unit's remaining members. During {{the course of the war}} a total of 2,838 men served with the 2/48th Battalion, of whom 343 men were killed in action or died on active service, 675 were wounded, and 20 captured.|$|E

5|$|The 5th Division was out {{of action}} for some months. It finally moved {{with the rest of}} the I Anzac Corps to the Somme sector in October. After months of {{fighting}} and recent rain, the front line area was a devastated muddy morass. McCay was ordered to undertake an attack with the 2nd Division's 7th Infantry Brigade at Flers, which cost 819 casualties and gained no ground. Once again, McCay's handling of his division showed poor planning and tactics. Moreover, at Flers he showed that he had <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> from the lessons of Fromelles. His relief was now only a matter of time. Nonetheless, McCay remained in command of the 5th Division until 18 December 1916 when he was granted medical leave in the United Kingdom for treatment on his leg, which the doctors diagnosed as neuralgia. Birdwood took the opportunity of removing McCay, ostensibly on medical grounds. McCay was mentioned in despatches a third time.|$|E

25|$|Second {{is the use}} of {{numerical}} tablature, which {{expresses the}} musical notes as numbers.

25|$|Pidgin {{languages}} characteristically {{arise from}} interactions between speakers {{of two or}} more languages who are not bilingual in the other group's language. Pidgin languages typically have greatly simplified syntax, a limited vocabulary, and are <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> as a first language by its speakers. Words typically have very general meanings but do not carry more than one meaning concept, and do not have the type of structural complexity commonly found in many languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{of the concept of}} chance throughout history has been very gradual. Historians have wondered why progress in the field of randomness was so slow, given that humans have encountered chance since antiquity. Deborah Bennett suggests that ordinary people face an inherent difficulty in understanding randomness, although the concept is often taken as being obvious and self-evident. She cites studies by Kahneman and Tversky; these concluded that statistical principles are <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> from everyday experience because people do not attend to the detail necessary to gain such knowledge.|$|E

Whether it is jealousy, feeling of incompetence that leads to resentment, or anger they all can take on both forms of emotions and help to drive the emotional reactions towards infidelity. The affective states of partners determine how they react to secrets or feelings they have <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> to expect from one another which later transforms into cognitive responses as the significant others begin to anticipate the actions and feelings of themselves and their partners.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetry}} of the hand-axes {{has been used}} to suggest that Acheulean tool users possessed the ability to use language; the parts of the brain connected with fine control and movement are located in the same region that controls speech. The wider variety of tool types compared to earlier industries and their aesthetically as well as functionally pleasing form could indicate a higher intellectual level in Acheulean tool users than in earlier hominines. Others argue that there is no correlation between spatial abilities in tool making and linguistic behaviour, and that language is <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> or conceived {{in the same manner as}} artefact manufacture.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{is often used}} by casual or league-level bowlers who have <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> how to hook the ball {{using one of the}} more standard, thumb-in grips. It is also prevalent among left-handed bowlers using house balls. A left-handed bowler would have to reverse the ball in order to properly use the holes typically drilled for right-handed bowlers. Notable bowlers to use this technique at the professional level include Mike Miller and Tom Daugherty. Another successful no-thumb bowler is Eric Copping, who holds the Vermont state record for average in a season with 246 and, as of April 2016, has bowled over eighty each of perfect games and 800 series.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} the {{scientists}} finished working with Genie, she had not fully mastered English grammar and her rate of acquisition had significantly slowed down. Linguists ultimately concluded that because Genie had <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> a first language before the critical period had ended, {{she was unable to}} fully acquire a language. Furthermore, despite the clear improvements in her conversational competence it remained very low, and her vocalizations remained highly atypical. While she had expanded her use of language to serve a wider range of functions, she had an unusually difficult time utilizing it during social interactions. Tests on Genie's brain found she was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain despite being right-handed, giving rise to many new hypotheses and refining existing hypotheses on cerebral lateralization and its effect on linguistic development.|$|E

25|$|Indulf {{is first}} mentioned, by the {{historian}} Procopius, as a barbarian (in all probability a Goth) bodyguard of the Byzantine general Belisarius. When Belisarius departed Italy in early 549, Indulf remained behind, {{and soon after}} joined the Goths. In late spring/early summer of 549, the Ostrogoth king Totila (r. 541–552) entrusted him with a large army and a fleet, and sent him to campaign in Dalmatia, which the Byzantines had taken in 535/536. There, he used his known association with Belisarius to capture the fortified towns of Movicurum and Laureate, whose inhabitants had <b>not</b> <b>learned</b> of his volte-face. Indulf killed the inhabitants and plundered the two settlements and the surrounding countryside. He also defeated a Byzantine force sent against him by the local Byzantine governor and captured a number of supply ships destined for the Byzantine army in Italy, before returning with his men to Italy.|$|E
