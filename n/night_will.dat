Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.4–3.7 billion birds and 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually. The bulk of predation in the United States is done by 80 million feral and stray cats. Effective measures to reduce this population are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts. In the case of free-ranging pets, equipping cats with bells and not letting them out at <b>night</b> <b>will</b> reduce wildlife predation.|$|E

They assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a parade. The {{carnival}} is out searching the streets {{for the two of}} them. The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Holloway pretends not to know the two boys whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke at her- choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Holloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That <b>night</b> <b>Will</b> and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves {{in the midst of a}} giant storm. Mr. Dark appears and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Holloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Holloway's heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles Holloway looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrator is}} first-person, omniscient: [...] "I would {{introduce}} myself {{if it were}} not useless.

[...] This might be a conscious echo of the opening of Melville's Moby-Dick: [...] "Call me Ishmael," [...] or perhaps a contemporary bathos. The title of the novella alludes to an old joke, also alluding to Moby-Dick. One of Sam's friends tells a shaggy dog story of a man who goes to India to study yoga, echoing Pip's passing mention of a joke in Melville's novel: he unscrews his navel, thinking he {{is on the verge of}} a revelation, and his ass falls off.
