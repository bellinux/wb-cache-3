25|$|Using the Debye model, the {{specific}} heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to T3, while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to T4.

For {{the specific}} heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as {{borne out by}} experiments to below 10K. Even the less detailed Einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>those</b> of crystals.

Due to the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion unique addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol (IPv6) to scale to the extremely large address space required.|$|E
25|$|Building on its {{ruling in}} Buffalo Linen Supply Co., the Supreme Court held in American Ship Building v. NLRB, 380 U.S. 300 (1965) that an {{employer}} may lock out its employees without violating the NLRA if a bargaining impasse {{has been reached}} and the lockout is {{for the purpose of}} applying economic pressure to support the employer's bargaining position. However, the employer cannot hire permanent replacements, only temporary ones. The high court further extended its reasoning in NLRB v. Brown Food Stores, ' 380 U.S. 278 (1965), holding that an employer could lock out its employees in advance of a whipsaw strike so long as the employer only utilized temporary replacements and locked out all workers (<b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>those</b> who supported the union).|$|E

25|$|Few {{nations have}} {{addressed}} the use of lockouts during whipsaw strikes, however. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled on {{the legality of the}} practice. The question before the Court was whether a lockout during a whipsaw strike was an unfair labor practice (ULP) under the National Labor Relations Act and its various amendments. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP. The high court further extended this ruling in NLRB v. Brown Food Stores, 380 U.S. 278 (1965), holding that an employer could engage in a partial lockout of its employees in advance of a whipsaw strike so long as the employer only utilized temporary replacements and locked out all workers (<b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>those</b> who supported the union).|$|E
25|$|Both {{have higher}} risks than a vaginal birth with no {{previous}} caesarean section.

A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section. On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.|$|E
25|$|This was an {{enlargement}} by Barber {{consisting of}} a new north aisle and vestries for an existing 1871 church in Burley Lane, Menston, West Yorkshire. The plans were created in 1884–85 and the building was completed in 1886. There have been other additions since Barber's work. In 1890 an organ chamber was added, with an organ by I.W. Binns of Bramley; the organ has been rebuilt several times since then. In 1920 a reredos and panelling were installed in the sanctuary; the reredos has now been removed. In 1950 the organ was rebuilt, the pulpit moved and pews and other carved furniture such as pew ends, pulpit, lectern and baptistry screen were made by Thompson's of Kilburn. In 1970 a Lady chapel and two vestries were designed by architect Michael Ryley.
