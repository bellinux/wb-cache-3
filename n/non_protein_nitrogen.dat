40|$|ABSTRACT: Urea is a <b>non</b> <b>protein</b> <b>nitrogen</b> {{compound}} {{that can be}} used to replace protein sources usually offered in ruminant nutrition. It is a technology that can be efficiently used in dairy cow nutrition, assuring good production levels. Taking to account the ruminant metabolism, the efficiency of urea use by ruminal microorganisms depends on the correct diet balance. Ingredients that supply adequate amounts of rumen degradable energy and protein are needed. Diets also must be corrected with minerals, especially sulphur, mixed directly to the urea. Regarding to the forms of use in the diet, urea can be supplied mixed with concentrates, roughages, in total ration or in mineral mixtures. It must be always attempted to the period of adaptation and supply levels to the animals. 200...|$|E
