The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere is relatively small compared {{to the amount of}} carbon dioxide, but because the atmosphere is so much thicker than that on Earth, its total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>content</b> is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high <b>nitrogen</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E

The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>content</b> of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E

The tree legumes included Albizia lebbeck, Dalbergia sissoo, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dulce, Prosopis cineraria, Prosopis glandulosa and Prosopis juliflora, all growing under arid environment. Rhizobia from these legumes formed nodules on the roots of Vigna mungo except isolates from Albizia lebbeck. Dry weight and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>contents</b> of Vigna mungo plants increased significantly (P< 0. 05) in response to cross inoculation as compared to uninoculated control. Rhizobia from Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis glandulosa showed significant increase in dry weight (P< 0. 05) and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>contents</b> (P< 0. 05) than other inoculated treatments. The natural rhizobia of wild tree legumes growing under arid environment show higher tolerance to prevailing adverse conditions like salt stress, elevated temperatures and drought.

25|$|Melamine is {{sometimes}} illegally added to food products {{in order to}} increase the apparent protein content. Standard tests, such as the Kjeldahl and Dumas tests, estimate protein levels by measuring the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>content,</b> so they can be misled by adding nitrogen-rich compounds such as melamine. An instrument (SPRINT) developed by the company CEM Corp allows the determination of protein content directly in some applications; the instrument cannot be fooled by adding melamine in the sample.|$|E

40|$|Chlorophyll {{contents}} in vegetation {{depend on}} soil nitrogen availability and on crop nitrogen uptake, which are important management factors in arable farming. Crop nitrogen uptake is important, as nitrogen {{is needed for}} chlorophyll formation, which is important for photosynthesis, i. e. the conversion of absorbed radiance into plant biomass. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate leaf and canopy <b>nitrogen</b> <b>contents</b> by near and remote sensing observations and to link observations at leaf, plant and canopy level. A theoretical base is presented for scaling-up leaf optical properties to whole plants and crops, by linking different optical recording techniques at leaf, plant and canopy levels through the integration of vertical nitrogen distribution. Field data come from potato experiments in The Netherlands in 1997 and 1998, comprising two potato varieties: Eersteling and Bintje, receiving similar nitrogen treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg N ha- 1) in varying application schemes to create differences in canopy nitrogen status during the growing season. Ten standard destructive field samplings were performed to follow leaf area index and crop dry weight evolution. Samples were analysed for inorganic nitrogen and total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>contents.</b> At sampling dates, spectral measurements were taken both at leaf level and at canopy level. At leaf level, an exponential relation between SPAD- 502 readings and leaf organic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>contents</b> with a high correlation factor of 0. 91 was found. At canopy level, an exponential relation between canopy organic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>contents</b> and red edge position (L rep, nm) derived from reflectance measurements was found with a good correlation of 0. 82. Spectral measurements (SPAD- 502) at leaf level of a few square mm were related to canopy reflectance measurements (CropScan-TM of approximately 0. 44 m 2. Statistical regression techniques were used to optimise theoretical vertical nitrogen profiles that allowed scaling-up leaf chlorophyll measurements to canopy nitrogen values. A nitrogen attenuation coefficient (kN) of 0. 41 g N m- 2 soil resulted in highest correlation coefficients for scaling-up <b>nitrogen</b> <b>contents</b> from leaf to canopy values. Remote sensing of canopy nitrogen (g N m- 2 soil) did not require considering vertical nitrogen profiles, as canopy reflectance measurements were able to integrate organic nitrogen over total canopy depth. The integration of near sensing techniques, theories on the interpretation of reflectance signatures and vertical crop nitrogen distribution allowed scaling between leaf chlorophyll measurements and canopy nitrogen values. This results in more accurate quantification of the nitrogen status of a potato crop, which is important information in potato crop managemen...|$|R
25|$|Surplus {{melamine}} {{has been}} an adulterant for feedstock and milk in mainland China {{for several years now}} because it can make diluted or poor quality material appear to be higher in protein content by elevating the total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>content</b> detected by some simple protein tests.

25|$|Melamine {{may have}} been added to fool {{government}} protein content tests after water was added to fraudulently dilute the milk.

Although the amount of damage caused by herbivores frequently increases under elevated levels of atmospheric CO2, the proportion of damage remains constant when host plants are infected by their fungal endophytes. The change in Carbon-Nitrogen ratio will also have important consequences for herbivores.
