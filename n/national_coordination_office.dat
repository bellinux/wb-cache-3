40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} results of a task force convened to determine what types of system software and tools were sufficiently important to warrant implementation across multiple vendors and machine types. The group included representatives {{from a wide range of}} user sites, as well as from the software development groups at vendor sites. Together, they established key software requirements, identified priorities for different types of user organizations, and formulated the requirements into language suitable for direct inclusion in procurements and requests-for-bids. The report is structured into four sections. The first discusses the formation and objectives of the task force and the processes used to arrive at consensus. Part 2 outlines the group's assumptions about how software will be specified on RFPs for parallel and clustered computers. In the next section, a tabular summary describes the requirements and the priority rank that was assigned to each. Part 4 presents the wording that is recommended for specifying each software element. Examples of how the requirements might be applied for various RFP scenarios, are in the appendices, which also provide vendor estimations of the level-of-effort required to develop and supply each requirement. The task force was sponsored by the Parallel Tools Consortium and the <b>National</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Office</b> for Computing, Information, and Communication.

To establish a <b>National</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Office</b> for development, and a structure for development on all levels. 3. Give training in development related topics both to professionals and volunteers. This project review takes place within a period during which the Basic Philosophy Document was approved by the MLC, the National Office for Coordination of Development activities is constituted with the staff, the administrative structures are settled and in function and training both on national and synod levels have been carried out. One of the main points in the Policy Document is that development is basically promoted by what is going on on the grassroots’ level, what kind of initiatives single persons, farmers and others, church committees on different levels and other organizations take. This review focuses especially on that aspect. The conclusion was that the impact of the National Office in the synods was very visible. They have guided the synods through a process so that the synods now have their own development plans. Every synod also has a development coordinator and a development committee. And the National Office is still following up the processes in the synods. The review team strongly suggests that these follow-up activities continue...|$|E
30|$|INTAS {{became one}} of the fist ‘victims’ of this reorientation. Although the {{programme}} proved to be successful (Idenburg et al. [2004]), it could not be adapted to a changing policy environment and ceased its operations {{at the end of the}} first decade of the new millennium. This was especially disadvantageous for the economically less advanced EECA countries since they hardly had capacities to withstand the higher competition exercised within the sixth and seventh FPs, which generally opened up for participation of international partner countries. Although the interest of Central Asian institutions in participating in FP 7 is broad, in fact, only 34 institutes succeeded in different S&T projects within FP 7 (data until May 2011). These participations were supported by the EC with a mere budget of € 1.7 million. With 17 participations, Kazakhstan was the strongest partner from this region. Discussions with policy makers from Central Asia revealed that the European Framework Programme for RTD is rather a distant concept to them, while INTAS is still more present in their heads. A reason for this lack of awareness is also the underdeveloped FP 7 National Contact Point (NCP) system in Central Asia. With 14 thematic NCPs and 1 <b>national</b> <b>coordination</b> <b>office,</b> Kazakhstan has the most developed NCP system in the region. A similarly advanced structure can only be found in Uzbekistan (13 NCPs). Overall, however, the existing FP 7 national information points in the region are not directly supported financially by their national governments (Sonnenburg et al. [2012]).|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} {{a strategy for}} the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) have emphasized the need to enable more effective technology transfer and provide added focus on nanomanufacturing and commercialization. These objectives are intended to foster needed economic development within the U. S., while also providing a return on investment (ROI) for the federal government’s long-term support of the NNI. While various interpretations {{can be made from}} the PCAST reports’ (NNI report, Advanced Manufacturing Report) recommendations, one thing is very clear: the linkage between nanomanufacturing and commercialization. While the NNI’s investment has {{had a significant impact on}} our understanding of nanoscience, and has established the U.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} meet the U. S. government’s goal of supplementing the energy {{available}} from petroleum by increasing the production of energy from renewable resources, increased production of bioenergy {{has become one of the}} new goals of the United States government and our society. U. S. Executive Orders and new Federal Legislation have mandated changes in government procedures and caused reorganizations within the government to support these goals. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative is a multi-agency effort to coordinate and accelerate all U. S. Federal biobased products and bioenergy research and development. The Initiative is managed by the <b>National</b> Biomass <b>Coordination</b> <b>Office,</b> which is staffed by both the DOE and the USDA. One of the most readily available sources of biomass from which to produce bioenergy is an agricultural crop residue, of which straw from small grains is the most feasible residue with which to start. For the straw residue to be used its collection must be energy efficient and its removal must not impact the sustainability of the growing environment. In addition, its collection must be economically advantageous to the producer. To do all that, a single pass multi-component harvester system is most desirable. Results from our first prototype suggest that current combines probably do adequate threshing and that a separate chassis can be developed that does additional separation and that is economically feasible...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{undertaken by}} Data Intensive Cyber Environments Center (DICE) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Liverpool {{on the development}} of an integrated preservation environment, which has been presented at the <b>National</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Office</b> for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD), at the National Science Foundation, and at the European Commission. The underlying technology is based on the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS), which implements a policy-based approach to distributed data management. By differentiating between different phases of the data life cycle based upon the evolution of data management policies, the infrastructure can be tuned to support data publication, data sharing, data analysis and data preservation. It is possible to build generic data management infrastructure that can evolve to meet the management requirements of each user community, federal agency and academic research project. In order to manage the properties of the data collections, we have developed and integrated scalable digital library services that support the discovery of, and access to, material organized as a collection. The integrated preservation environment prototype implements specific technologies that are capable of managing a wide range of preservation requirements, from parsing of legacy document formats, to enforcement of preservation policies, to validation of trustworthiness assessment criteria. Each capability has been demonstrated and is instantiated in multiple instances, both in the United States as part of the DataNet Federation Consortium (DFC) and through multiple European projects, primarily the FP 7 SHAMAN project. </p...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSince September 11, 2001, {{a collection of}} bills have been submitted to Congress proposing to amend section 349 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that an individual may lose United States citizenship for joining a terrorist organization, or engaging in or supporting terrorism. Although several of our allies, including the U. K., Australia, and France, have considered {{and in some instances}} passed similar legislation during the same period, Congress has not given these proposals serious consideration. This thesis provides a policy analysis, assessing the viability of terrorism-related loss of citizenship under U. S. law. Following a review of the history of acquisition and loss of citizenship in the United States, including key laws and precedent decisions, and a comparative analysis of legislation considered and either passed or rejected by the U. K., Australia, and France, it provides a critical review of terrorism-related loss of citizenship bills submitted to Congress since 9 / 11. This thesis demonstrates that viable terrorism-related loss of citizenship legislation may be possible, but that bills submitted to date have been largely symbolic, rather than serious, efforts. This thesis provides drafting recommendations to legislators, but raises questions about the practical utility and necessity of such laws.
