5|$|After deliberating {{for five}} days the jury found Massino guilty of all eleven counts on July 30, 2004. His {{sentencing}} was initially scheduled for October 12, and {{he was expected to}} receive a sentence of life imprisonment with <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> parole.

5|$|Besides poets, at {{high school}} Lewis met Sophie Carson, who {{eventually}} became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from a religious Jewish family.

5|$|A 1997 {{survey of}} early astronomical records and {{drawings}} {{suggested that a}} certain dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 {{may have been an}} impact scar. The survey initially produced eight more candidate sites as potential impact observations that he and others had recorded between 1664 and 1839. It was later determined, however, that these candidate sites had little or <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> being the results of the proposed impacts.|$|E

5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> {{improvement}} but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E
5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured that there would be <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to {{be the only way to}} salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E

Posing as his assistant, Mysteron {{intermediary}} Captain Black reports that Scarlet is dead with <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> recovery, his retro-metabolic ability being {{too weak to}} heal such extensive injuries. The Mysteron assault intensifies, resulting {{in the deaths of}} Magenta and the remaining Angels, until only White, Blue and Lieutenant Green are left alive in the Control Room. As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself. White resolves to go down with his command, and is seen standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling freeze frame shot, accompanied by the sounds of Cloudbase crashing to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the group}} wanted to release an album cover using an edited image from a Holy Communion card, showing {{children}} joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, {{so it had}} become distorted. The art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, was unable to determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became nervous about copyright infringement, so the artwork was pulled at the last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled {{to coincide with the}} release of the album, so there was <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> delaying the release.|$|E
5|$|Middleton {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of raid and harrying. Although successful in distracting the Commonwealth forces and causing disruption, it soon began to prove counter-productive, as growing unpopularity led to a drying up of recruitment. With his return to Scotland after his brief naval command against the Dutch, Monck began a campaign against the rising, making forced marches of between 12 and 20 miles a day in difficult terrain. On 19 July 1654 a force from Monck's command under Thomas Morgan caught Middleton's army at Dalnaspidal. In the resulting battle the royalists were scattered and a wounded Middleton was forced to escape to the Highlands. The end of the Dutch War meant there was <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> foreign aid and government reinforcements were now available to combat the rising. As a result, the Royalist military effort petered out. Eventually, Glencairn surrendered to Monck and Middleton escaped to the continent to join the court in exile.|$|E

30|$|The overall fit of {{the model}} is about 38  % {{which can be treated}} as a {{moderate}} good fit. The R-squared reported is relatively higher than other similar studies (Munoz et al. 2014; Papadaki et al. 2002). The estimated model does not show any issue of collinearity as variance inflation factors (VIF) are less than 10.00. Heteroskedasticity and Jarque-Bera (JB) tests also do not bring any suspicious results, and Durbin-Watson statistics is around 2 meaning <b>no</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> autocorrelation although it is argued that cross-sectional data is less prone to serial correlation problem.|$|R
5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance would argue that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez {{ordered his}} squadron's boats to assist Hannibal and Pompée, {{both of which}} were trapped under heavy fire and unable to {{effectively}} respond. As he did so, Linois ordered his ships to cut their anchor cables and drift into the shallows, away from the becalmed British squadron. Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but both Desaix and Indomptable grounded inshore, where they were exposed to heavy fire from Saumarez's ships, which had also cut their cables in an effort to close with their opponents. At 13:35 however, Saumarez recognised that his squadron was in danger of grounding directly under the fire of the Spanish batteries. With the squadron's boats either sunk or employed towing Pompée back to Gibraltar, there was <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> launching an amphibious operation against the Spanish forts and Saumarez reluctantly called the attack off, the remainder of the squadron retiring to Gibratar but leaving the stranded Hannibal in the Bay of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|The Chester Canal was an English canal {{linking the}} south Cheshire town of Nantwich with the River Dee at Chester. It was {{intended}} to link Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich, but the Trent and Mersey Canal were unco-operative about a junction at Middlewich, and so the route to Nantwich was opened in 1779. There were also difficulties negotiating with the River Dee Company, and with <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> through traffic, the canal was uneconomic. Part of it was closed in 1787, when Beeston staircase locks collapsed, {{and there was no}} money to fund repairs. When the Ellesmere Canal was proposed in 1790, the company saw it as a ray of hope, and somehow managed to keep the struggling canal open. The Ellesmere Canal provided a link to the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port from 1797, and the fortunes of the Chester Canal began to improve.|$|E

5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
5|$|Cofresí {{received}} a council of war trial, with <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a civil trial. The only right granted the pirates was {{to choose their}} lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was a formality. José Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried—an oddity, since other cases as serious (or more so) sometimes took months or years. Cofresí was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought {{that the reason for}} the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter's court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofresí trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required by trial protocol). The trial was based on the pirates' confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

This disjunct distribution pattern may be maintained by zonal equatorial current systems. Although mixing of the two species may occur during seasonal weakenings of the currents, the two populations of H. sericeus appear to be quite separate, with little or <b>no</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> genetic exchange...|$|R
5|$|Lured by {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better housing and other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative connotation. Their treatment by the Soviet government was not much better. A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with them everything they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was <b>no</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real or perceived ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E
