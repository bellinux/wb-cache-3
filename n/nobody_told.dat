500|$|Another person {{planned to}} voice a {{character}} in the film was Janeane Garofalo, who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project with little explanation. Years later, Garofalo stated [...] "I was never told why [...] I assume because I sound like a man sometimes? I don't know why. <b>Nobody</b> <b>told</b> me... But, you know, the movie didn't do anything, so who cares?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} a box office bomb in the US but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. [...] "It was just a coincidence. <b>Nobody</b> <b>told</b> me about it. I was surprised how close it was," [...] director Tim Burton continued, [...] "but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone â€“ it was different in everything. It almost seemed like we had done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day." [...] During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film.|$|E
500|$|No.30 Communications Unit was {{headquartered}} at Iwakuni, {{along with}} the rest of No.91 Wing's components except No.77 Squadron, which was based on the Korean peninsula. It was initially commanded, unofficially, by Flight Lieutenant (later Air Commodore) Dave Hitchens. According to Hitchens, [...] "Having commanded the communications flight in No. 77 Squadron, I assumed control but had no formal authority to do so, but <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> me to stop." [...] The transport aircraft included the personal Dakota of the BCOF commander, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, operating under his direction. [...] During November 1950, the unit received another four Dakotas from No.38 Squadron (of No.90 (Composite) Wing in Malaya), giving it a total strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers. It supported all Australian forces in Korea. One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs. Unlike No.77 Squadron, it was not tasked by the US Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control, exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan. In December 1950 the unit undertook [...] "Operation Haggis", the delivery of [...] of haggis to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders based in Suwon, Korea. The same month, a United States Air Force Mustang taking off from Suwon smashed into the cockpit of one of the Dakotas; none of the Australian crew was injured but the aircraft had to be written off and stripped for components by No.491 Squadron.|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed for}} Mojo {{magazine}} the band {{said the most}} amazing sight at Live Aid was to see the audience clapping to [...] "Radio Ga Ga". Brian May stated: [...] "I'd {{never seen anything like}} that in my life and it wasn't calculated either. We understood our audience and played to them but that was one of those weird accidents because of the (music) video. I remember thinking 'oh great, they've picked it up' and then I thought 'this is not a Queen audience'. This is a general audience who've bought tickets before they even knew we were on the bill. And they all did it. How did they know? <b>Nobody</b> <b>told</b> them to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had said anything to me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gilby Clarke's {{contract}} was not renewed {{and he was}} gone from the band by 1995. Slash stated in his book that Rose fired Clarke without consulting anyone, claiming he was only a [...] "hired hand". Clarke was not involved in the recording of 'Sympathy for the Devil', stating [...] "I knew that that was the ending [...] because <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me". Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose came up to him and told him [...] "Hey, enjoy your last show". Clarke later sued the band over the use of his likeness in Guns N' Roses Pinball.|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> had <b>told</b> her of this Chicago. Nobody {{could tell}} her of it, indeed, for no one else saw it as she did. When Mason spoke again his voice was very low and gentle. He began to {{comprehend}} {{the soul of the}} girl.|$|R
6000|$|... "Instead of that," [...] said I, {{plucking}} up more {{grass and}} chewing a blade or two, [...] "see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if <b>nobody</b> had <b>told</b> me so!" ...|$|R
50|$|Their stagecoach is {{held up by}} the Snead brothers, a {{group of}} outlaws that Ragsdale has sent to run off Eli. Unfortunately, <b>nobody</b> was <b>told</b> that Jasper's other son was a twin, so they mistake Eli for Wild Billy (the first of many to mistake the two).|$|R

Has <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> you that she politely placed her own boudoir at the {{disposal}} of the very woman whom she had ordered half an hour before to leave the house? Do you really not know that Mr. Julian Gray has himself conducted this suddenly-honored guest to her place of retirement? and that I am left alone in the midst of these changes, contradictions, and mysteries--the only person who is kept out in the dark?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Frightfully rich," [...] said Bernard; [...] "but {{really you}} would hardly find it out if <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> you. Of course {{she lives in}} a big house, and has a heap of servants; but she can't help that." ...|$|E
60|$|In a sense, it had wrecked Steve's world. <b>Nobody</b> had <b>told</b> {{him to stop}} or even {{diminish}} the number of his visits, but the fact remained that, by the time Kirk returned to New York, he had practically ceased {{to go to the}} house on Fifth Avenue.|$|R
60|$|And so {{a terrible}} unrest pervaded the whole {{household}} after {{the receipt of}} Jaspar Bellew's note. <b>Nobody</b> was <b>told</b> anything, yet everybody knew there was something; and each after his fashion, down to the very dogs, betrayed their sympathy with the master and mistress of the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>nobody</b> has <b>told</b> me so. I {{have never}} dreamed of such a thing; nor, as far as I believe, have they. If anybody has spread such a report, or said that either of them have hinted at such a thing, it is a base lie. Good heavens! Lufton, for what do you take them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] said Rufus quietly. [...] "But {{when a man}} hasn't taken liberties, there don't {{seem much}} to be said. Sally was at the Home, when I last saw you--and <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> me I should find her in this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I do {{understand}} this, Hist, and so I must talk about it. Deerslayer {{as good as}} told father all about it, in my presence, and as <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> me not to listen, I overheard it all, as I did Hurry and father's discourse about the scalps." ...|$|E
60|$|He said he {{had been}} with the Grevilles; he did not see why anybody need ask him questions; he should do what he pleased without being called to account. <b>Nobody</b> <b>told</b> him not to run away after dinner; {{he was not going to}} stay to be ordered about for nothing.|$|E
60|$|The {{greatness of}} this country rests on two anecdotes. The first one is that of Washington and his hatchet, {{representing}} the foundation of true speaking, which is the characteristic of our people. The second one is an old one, and I've been waiting to hear it to-night; but as <b>nobody</b> has <b>told</b> it yet, I will tell it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No;--I've <b>told</b> <b>nobody</b> yet. But it won't do {{to go on}} like that, you know,--will it? You don't {{want it to go}} on {{always like}} that;--do you?' ...|$|R
40|$|On a startlingly bright autumn {{night in}} 2006, Harper Regan {{walked away from}} her home, her husband and daughter, and kept walking. She <b>told</b> <b>nobody</b> that she was going. She <b>told</b> <b>nobody</b> where she was going. She put {{everything}} she ever built at risk. For two lost days and nights, until {{it looked as though}} her entire life might unravel, she didn't turn back. From Uxbridge to Stockport to Manchester and back again, Harper Regan navigates the UK, exploring family, love and delusion. It received its world premiere at the National Theatre, London, in 2008...|$|R
60|$|But I didn't know I was {{displacing}} two men. <b>Nobody</b> <b>told</b> me. On the contrary, {{the superintendent}} warned everybody {{not to tell}} me. How valiantly I went at it that first day. I worked at top speed, filling the iron wheelbarrow with coal, running it on the scales and weighing the load, then trundling it into the fire-room and dumping it on the plates before the fires.|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>told</b> {{them to do}} it, but all {{the hands}} were clapped heartily before a single child stirred; then {{one by one they}} came to look up wonderingly at the pretty giver of the feast as she leaned down to offer them great yellow oranges, red apples, bunches of grapes, bonbons, and cakes, till all were gone, and a double row of smiling faces turned toward her as the {{children}} filed back to their places in the orderly way they had been taught.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{so ashamed}} of myself, I daren't {{attempt to make}} my apologies personally. Will you accept my written excuses? Upon my honor, <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> me when I got here {{yesterday}} {{that you were in}} the house. I heard the recitation, and--can you excuse my stupidity?--I thought it was a stage-struck housemaid amusing herself with the children. May I accompany you when you go out with the young ones for your daily walk? One word will do. Yes or no. Penitently yours--S. S." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It doesn't much {{matter who}} it was," [...] replied the doctor. And I {{could see that}} neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that <b>nobody</b> had <b>told</b> the {{situation}} of the island.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE. I never <b>told</b> <b>nobody.</b> His {{father and}} mother would be wild if they knew it. I didn't answer them--I just sent him two post cards with no writing on except the address--just pictures.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} it is.

Tom, something's always told me we'd never get holt of that swag." ...|$|E
60|$|James {{looked at}} his daughter-in-law. That unseen glance of his was cold and dubious. Appeal and fear were in it, {{and a sense of}} {{personal}} grievance. Why should he be worried like this? It was very likely all nonsense; women were funny things! They exaggerated so, you didn't know what to believe; and then, <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> him anything, he had to find out everything for himself. Again he looked furtively at Irene, and across from her to Soames. The latter, listening to Aunt Juley, was looking up, under his brows in the direction of Bosinney.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't seen Kenneth {{since the}} night of the party. He was here one evening after Jem came back but I {{happened}} to be away. I don't think he mentioned me at all--at least <b>nobody</b> <b>told</b> me he did and I was determined I wouldn't ask--but I don't care in the least. All that matters absolutely nothing to me now. The only thing that does matter is that Jem has volunteered for active service and will be going to Valcartier in a few more days--my big, splendid brother Jem. Oh, I'm so proud of him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They didn't {{teach me}} like Honora Charlecote,' she faltered on; 'but I always did as your poor papa <b>told</b> me. <b>Nobody</b> ever <b>told</b> {{me how to}} be religious, and your poor papa would not have liked it.
