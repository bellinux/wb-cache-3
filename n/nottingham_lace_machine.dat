50|$|The Old Loughborough {{became the}} {{standard}} lacemaking machine, particularly the 1820 form {{known as the}} Circular producing two-twist plain net. The smooth, unpatterned tulle produced on these machines was {{on a par with}} real, handmade lace net. Heathcoat’s bobbinet machine is so ingeniously designed that the ones used today have suffered little alteration. However during the next 30 years inventors were patenting improvements to their machines. The ones that stand out are the Pusher machine, the Levers machine (now spelled Leavers) and the <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> curtain <b>machine.</b> Each of these developed into separate machines. Others were the Traverse Warp machine and the Straight Bolt machine.|$|R
50|$|The frame {{viewed from}} the front is similar to Leavers machine. Its action is {{different}} as it produces a square net rather than a hexagonal one. The <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> curtain <b>machine</b> only has one warp and the patterning threads are carried on a spools not on a beam. The terms to describe the actions {{are the same as}} those used for a Leavers machine: rise, fall, right, left, sley, carriage, comb et c. The lace is collected at the top, unlike the Pusher machine where it is at the bottom, It is collected on a take up beam; a spiky roller called the porcupine beneath it, regulated the take up tension.|$|R
50|$|Bobbinet {{machines}} were invented in 1808 by John Heathcoat. He studied the hand movements of a Northamptonshire manual lace maker and reproduced {{them in the}} roller-locker machine. The 1809 version of this machine (patent no.3216) {{became known as the}} Old Loughborough, it was 18 in wide and was designed for use with cotton. The Old Loughborough became the standard lacemaking machine, particularly the 1824 form known as the Circular, producing two-twist plain net. The smooth, unpatterned tulle produced on these machines was on a par with real, handmade lace net. Heathcoat’s bobbinet machine is so ingeniously designed that the ones used today have suffered little alteration. During the next 30 years inventors were patenting improvements to their machines.

40|$|A one-person {{exhibition}} of paintings at the Lace Mills of Morton Young and Borland (MYB). The {{aim of the}} research was to reflect through painting and drawing processes pictorial aspects of lace design. The company was founded in 1900 in the Irvine Valley of Ayrshire, Scotland. In 1913 MYB Textiles invested in <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> Looms. MYB Textiles is now the only producer in the world manufacturing patterned <b>lace</b> with original <b>Nottingham</b> <b>Lace</b> Looms. This manufacturing process is extremely labor intensive. The methods employed by Kathleen through painting and drawing aim to mimic the structure of the lace. This group of paintings was achieved and developed in terms of enlarging the original lace structure and painting this on an architectural scale. The rationale for investigating the painting process in this context is to construct a pictorial handmade series of painted pattern formations. To accompany the exhibition Kathleen has also been working with Emma Dick to record the painting process and the textile pattern in an artist’s book. ISBN 978 1 85924 533...|$|R
50|$|In 1891, Kilpin {{moved to}} Turin, in Italy, {{in order to}} work for Edoardo Bosio, an Italian-Swiss textile {{merchant}} with links to a <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> manufacturer. In the same year Bosio founded Internazionale Torino, {{believed to be the first}} Italian football club. Kilpin played for the team, becoming the first-ever Englishman to play football abroad. During this time, he also took part in the first two editions of the Italian Football Championship, losing both times in the final against Genoa.|$|R
5000|$|Invented by John Livesey in <b>Nottingham</b> in 1846, <b>lace</b> curtain <b>machine</b> was {{initially}} {{seen as a}} form of a Leavers machine- a modification of the Circular. The Leavers mesh tends to be hexagonal while the Curtain machine gives a straight mesh. The use of Jacquards for producing patterned lace was well established. At the 1851 Great Exhibition curtains 5 yard cm long by 2 yard cm wide were displayed. The spacious designs required over 12000 Jacquard cards. The curtain Lace industry prospered now the fashion was for large rising sash windows.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{building}} was opened in 1876, built to a {{design of the}} architect Stuart Colman, of Bristol. It {{was used as a}} place of worship for Unitarian Presbyterians in Nottingham until 1982. It was then converted into the <b>Nottingham</b> <b>Lace</b> Museum, but this venture proved financially unviable. The {{building was}} then converted to its current use, as a Pitcher and Piano public house. [...] The current congregation, Nottingham Unitarians, are now based nearby at 3 Plumptre Street, Nottingham NG1 1JL, a former lace factory where items of lace were finished.|$|R
50|$|The {{first sign}} of {{industrialisation}} in the Loughborough district came {{in the early years}} of the 19th century, when John Heathcoat, an inventor from Derbyshire patented in 1809 an improvement to the warp loom, known as the twisted <b>lace</b> <b>machine,</b> which allowed mitts with a lace-like appearance to be made.|$|R

5000|$|The {{company was}} the world leader in <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> and also {{produced}} tablecloths, napkins, valances, and shower curtains, among many other types of lace items. During the 1940s, the company teamed up with subsidiaries such as Victory Parachutes, Inc. and Sweeney Bros. to manufacture parachutes and camouflage netting. The company prospered well into the 1950s, but risky investments involving Hal Roach Studios and the fledgling television industry placed the company in financial peril and eventually led to its closure in 2002. Despite the factory being one of area's biggest employers, it closed in 2002 with the company's vice president telling its employees, mid-shift, that the facility was closing [...] "effective immediately".|$|R

40|$|This {{event was}} the {{culmination}} of a short residency at hARTslane Gallery in Deptford, London, by the 3 artists involved in this first year of the 5 year "Bummock"research project. The project leaders are artists Danica Maier and Andrew Bracey, with invited artist collaborator for {{the first year of the}} project, Lucy Renton. 'Bummock' describes the hidden part of an iceberg, and the project is working with 5 invited artists and 5 archives over 5 years working with the more unseen parts of collections, raising ethical and other questions around how much an artist needs to know about a particular collection they are working with.

50|$|Zimmern and {{her parents}} emigrated in 1850 to Britain, where her father became a <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> {{merchant}}.

Her sister was the suffragist Alice Zimmern and the political scientist Alfred Eckhard Zimmern was a cousin. Her first appearance in print was a story for Once a Week. She was soon writing for the Argosy and other magazines.
