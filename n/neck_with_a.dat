5|$|A {{narrative}} pattern follows, whereby Cet {{demands a}} challenge, an Ulster warrior rises, and the Ulaid cry out {{the name of}} the challenger; Cet then proceeds to shame that warrior by recounting one of his deeds against him, as above. Cet shames the challenger Óengus son of Lam Gabuid, by recounting how he had cut off Lam Gabuid's hands in battle; he shames Éogan son of Durthacht, the king of Fermag, by recounting how he put out his eye in a cattle-raid; he reminds Muinremur son of Gerrgend how he had taken his son's head as a trophy not six days earlier; Mend son of Salchad, how he had cut off his father's foot; Celtchair son of Uthecar, how he had castrated him with his spear; and even Conchobar's son Cúscraid Mend Machae, how he had pierced his <b>neck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spear during Cúscraid's first feat of arms, in ignominious circumstances which led to the abandonment a third of Cúscraid's retinue in a cowardly retreat.

5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and <b>neck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident.

5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh {{into one of}} the most sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already coming on the back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain around the <b>neck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> razor blade as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film also proved to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be attached with his name in the media along with a tag of 'Chocolate Hero'. The film also proved to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E
5|$|With 17minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at {{the feet}} of Murphy to win the ball, but in the {{collision}} Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's <b>neck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.|$|E

25|$|Ornitholestes had a {{relatively}} short <b>neck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slight sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve. The tail was long and whiplike, comprising {{over half of the}} body's length. Not all of the vertebrae were preserved, but Osborn (1917) estimated that Ornitholestes had nine or ten cervical (neck) vertebrae, thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae, four sacral (hip) vertebrae, and 39 to 44 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Carpenter et al. (2005a) recorded that the specimen contained five sacral vertebrae. Ornitholestes was a short-bodied theropod, and this was reflected in the short front-to-back dimensions of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|Biba's {{early years}} were rather humble, {{with many of}} the outfits being cheap and {{available}} to the public by mail order. Biba’s postal boutique had its first significant success in May 1964 when it offered a pink gingham dress with a hole cut {{out of the back of}} the <b>neck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> matching triangular kerchief to readers of the Daily Mirror.

Ultimately, some 17,000 outfits were sold.|$|E
25|$|Despite his sacking Taylor {{remained}} {{friendly with}} the band and he {{asked if he could}} come to Paris too.

One version of the story says he gave such an extraordinary performance at the sound check, that the organizers decided to put Taylor {{at the top of the}} bill for both shows. As a result of his performance at those two shows, Eddie Barclay signed him to a six-year record deal on the Barclay label.|$|E
