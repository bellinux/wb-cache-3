5|$|Medicinal plants demand {{intensive}} management. Different species each require {{their own}} distinct conditions of cultivation. The World Health Organization recommends {{the use of}} rotation to minimise problems with pests and plant diseases. Cultivation may be traditional or may make use of conservation agriculture practices to maintain organic matter in the soil and to conserve water, for example with <b>no-till</b> farming systems. In many medicinal and aromatic plants, plant characteristics vary widely with soil type and cropping strategy, so care is required to obtain satisfactory yields.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} <b>no-till</b> and related methods are {{impractical}} and {{too expensive for}} many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that <b>no-till</b> complicates weed control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.|$|E

25|$|Tillage is the {{practice}} of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to <b>no-till.</b> It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO2, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midwestern}} United States, low-till or <b>no-till</b> farming {{techniques}} are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting {{or after the}} previous harvest. The fields are planted and fertilized. Weeds are controlled {{through the use of}} herbicides, and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season. This technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil, and thus provides more moisture for the crop.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} have expressed concerns about land-use change {{in response to}} greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions. The payback period, that is, the time it will take biofuels {{to pay back the}} carbon debt they acquire due to land-use change, has been estimated to be between 100 and 1000 years, depending on the specific instance and location of land-use change. However, <b>no-till</b> practices combined with cover-crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion.|$|E
25|$|The {{chisel plough}} {{is a common}} tool to get deep tillage (prepared land) with limited soil disruption. The main {{function}} of this plough is to loosen and aerate the soils while leaving crop residue {{at the top of}} the soil. This plough can be used to reduce the effects of compaction and to help break up ploughpan and hardpan. Unlike many other ploughs the chisel will not invert or turn the soil. This characteristic has made it a useful addition to <b>no-till</b> and low-till farming practices that attempt to maximise the erosion-prevention benefits of keeping organic matter and farming residues present on the soil surface through the year. Because of these attributes, the use of a chisel plough is considered by some to be more sustainable than other types of plough, such as the mouldboard plough.|$|E
500|$|Plants are {{generally}} started in protected locations {{early in the}} growing season before being transplanted outside, although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested. Seedlings typically emerge in about 4–6 days from seeds planted [...] deep at a soil temperature between [...] Growers normally place plants [...] apart. Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant (especially the amount of light) and increases the time taken to reach maturity. Some varieties of cabbage {{have been developed for}} ornamental use; these {{are generally}} called [...] "flowering cabbage". They do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white, red, or pink. Early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity, while late varieties take about 120 days. Cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to the touch. They are harvested by cutting the stalk just below the bottom leaves with a blade. The outer leaves are trimmed, and any diseased, damaged, or necrotic leaves are removed. Delays in harvest can result in the head splitting as a result of expansion of the inner leaves and continued stem growth. Factors that contribute to reduced head weight include: growth in the compacted soils that result from <b>no-till</b> farming practices, drought, waterlogging, insect and disease incidence, and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds.|$|E

2500|$|Methods that {{significantly}} enhance carbon sequestration in soil include <b>no-till</b> farming, residue mulching, cover cropping, and crop rotation, {{all of which}} are more widely used in organic farming than in conventional farming. [...] Because only 5% of US farmland currently uses <b>no-till</b> and residue mulching, there is a large potential for carbon sequestration. Conversion to pastureland, particularly with good management of grazing, can sequester even more carbon in the soil.|$|E
2500|$|Soil-conservation farming {{involves}} <b>no-till</b> farming, “green manures” {{and other}} soil-enhancing practices. [...] Such farming methods attempt {{to mimic the}} biology of barren lands. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. <b>No-till</b> farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of soil organic matter.|$|E

2500|$|Milan (...) is {{the second}} largest city after Humboldt in Gibson County, Tennessee, and the largest entirely within the county. [...] It {{is home to the}} Milan Army Ammunition Plant, the West Tennessee Agricultural Museum and several {{historical}} sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). [...] The city was the first in Tennessee to begin <b>no-till</b> farming and to flouridate its drinking water. [...] The Milan Endowment for Growth in Academics (MEGA) was the first private community financial endowment for public schools in Tennessee.|$|E
2500|$|An ongoing {{concern is}} that [...] "nutrient {{overloading}} from fertilizers, human and animal waste", known as eutrophication, in which additional nitrogen and phosphorus enter the lake, will cause plant life to [...] "run wild and multiply like crazy". Since there are fewer wetlands, which are like [...] "Nature's kidneys" [...] by filtering nutrients, as well as greater [...] "channelization of waterways", nutrients in water can cause algal blooms to sprout as well as [...] "low-oxygen dead zones" [...] in a complex interaction of natural forces. As of the 2010s much of the phosphorus in the lake comes from fertilizer applied to <b>no-till</b> soybean and corn fields but washed into streams by heavy rains. The algal blooms result from growth of Microcystis, a toxic blue-green algae that the zebra mussels which infest the lake don't eat.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, Fukuoka {{married his}} wife Ayako, {{and they had}} five {{children}} together. After World War II, his father lost most of the family lands due to forced redistribution policies of the American occupying forces and was left with only three-eighths of an acre of rice land and the hillside citrus orchards his son had taken over before the war. Despite these setbacks, in 1947 he took up natural farming again with success, using <b>no-till</b> farming methods to raise rice and barley. He wrote his first book Mu 1: The God Revolution, or Mu 1: Kami no Kakumei (...) in Japanese, during the same year, and worked to spread word {{of the benefits of}} his methods and philosophy. His later book, The One-Straw Revolution was published in 1975 and translated into English in 1978.|$|E

50|$|<b>No-till</b> {{farming is}} not {{equivalent}} to conservation tillage or strip tillage. Conservation tillage {{is a group}} of practices that reduce the amount of tillage needed. <b>No-till</b> and strip tillage are both forms of conservation tillage. <b>No-till</b> is the practice of never tilling a field. Tilling every other year is called rotational tillage.|$|E

50|$|Recently, {{researchers}} at the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture found that <b>no-till</b> farming makes soil much more stable than plowed soil. Their conclusions draw from over 19 years of collaborated tillage studies. <b>No-till</b> stores more carbon in the soil and carbon {{in the form of}} organic matter is a key factor in holding soil particles together. The first inch of <b>no-till</b> soil is two to seven times less vulnerable than that of plowed soil. The practice of <b>no-till</b> farming is especially beneficial to Great Plains farmers because of its avoidance of erosion.|$|E
50|$|A {{problem that}} occurs in some fields is water {{saturation}} in soils. Switching to <b>no-till</b> farming will correct the drainage the because of the qualities of soil under continuous <b>no-till</b> include a higher water infiltration rate.|$|E
50|$|<b>No-till</b> farming {{requires}} some different skills to achieve success. As with any production system, if <b>no-till</b> isn't done correctly, yields can drop. A combination of technique, equipment, pesticides, crop rotation, fertilization, and irrigation {{have to be}} used for local conditions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>No-till</b> farming can {{increase}} organic (carbon based) [...] {{matter in the}} soil, which {{is a form of}} carbon sequestration. However, there is debate over whether this increased sequestration detected in scientific studies of <b>no-till</b> agriculture is actually occurring, or is due to flawed testing methods or other factors. [...] Regardless of this debate, a case can still be made for <b>no-till,</b> in the form of reduction in fossil fuel use, less erosion and better soil quality.|$|E
50|$|The farm {{practices}} <b>no-till</b> farming.|$|E
50|$|Most crops {{can benefit}} from the {{practice}} of <b>no-till,</b> but not all crops are suitable for complete <b>no-till</b> agriculture. Crops that do not perform well when competing with other plants that grow in untilled soil in their early stages can be best grown by using other conservation tillage practices, like a combination of strip-till with <b>no-till</b> areas. Also, crops which harvestable portion grows underground can have better results with strip-tillage, mainly in soils which are hard for plant roots to penetrate into deeper layers to access water and nutrients.|$|E

50|$|In one study, yields {{were higher}} in the strip-tilled area than in the area where <b>no-till</b> was practiced. In a low {{phosphorus}} site, yield was 43.5 bu/a in strip-till compared to 41.5 bu/a in a <b>no-till</b> system. Yield is comparable to that of intensive tillage systems — without the cost.|$|E
50|$|<b>No-till</b> can {{contribute}} to higher soil organic matter and organic carbon content in soils, though reports of no-effects of no-tillage in organic matter and organic carbon soil contents also exist, depending on environmental and crop conditions. In addition, <b>no-till</b> can indirectly reduce CO2 emissions by decreasing the use of fossil fuels.|$|E
50|$|Tillage remains {{relevant}} in agriculture today, but {{the success of}} <b>no-till</b> methods in many contexts keeps farmers aware that multiple options exist. In some cases low-till methods combine aspects of till and <b>no-till</b> methods. For example, some approaches may use {{a limited amount of}} shallow disc harrowing but no plowing.|$|E
