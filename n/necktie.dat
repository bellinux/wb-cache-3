40|$|We {{set out to}} {{investigate}} whether <b>neckties</b> worn by doctors {{are more likely to}} be contaminated with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to <b>neckties</b> worn by preclinical medical undergraduates who have never been exposed to a hospital environment.
