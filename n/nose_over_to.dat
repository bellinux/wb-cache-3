50|$|The Lovettsville air {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} August 31, 1940 near Lovettsville, Virginia. Pennsylvania Central Airlines Trip 19 {{was a new}} Douglas DC-3A that was flying through an intense thunderstorm at 6000 ft. Numerous witnesses reported seeing a large flash of lightning shortly before it <b>nosed</b> <b>over</b> and plunged <b>to</b> earth in an alfalfa field. With limited accident investigation tools at the time, it was at first believed that the most likely cause was the plane flying into windshear, but the Civil Aeronautics Board report concluded that the probable cause was a lightning strike. U.S. Senator Ernest Lundeen from Minnesota {{was one of the}} 25 people (21 passengers and 4 crew members) killed.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{a strong}} tremor traveled throughout Monte Cervantes and {{the bow of}} the ship <b>nosed</b> <b>over</b> and began <b>to</b> sink. The crew jumped into the water and were saved by the waiting launch. However Captain Dreyer was unable to save himself. Wearing his life ring, he jumped and accidentally slipped into the open promenade area of the ship. He thus drowned in his own ship and became the only victim of the shipwreck. The launch searched for over an hour for Dreyer, but his body was never found. The stern of the ocean liner did not go under but remained visible from the sea. Since the ship rested on a rocky reef outside the normal shipping routes, no efforts were made to remove it.|$|R
60|$|The hoarse danger cry had ceased; {{the woods}} were all still again. A {{movement}} in the underbrush, and I saw the doe glide out beyond the brook and stand looking, listening. She bleated softly; the hemlock curtain was thrust aside, and the little ones came out. At sight of them she leaped forward, a great gladness showing eloquently in every line of her graceful body, rushed up to them, dropped her head and ran her keen <b>nose</b> <b>over</b> them, ears <b>to</b> tail and down their sides and back again, {{to be sure that}} they were her own little ones and were not harmed. All the while the fawns nestled close to her, as they had done a moment before to me, and lifted their heads to touch her sides with their noses, and ask in their own dumb way what it was all about, and why she had run away.|$|R

2500|$|The Type D was {{the third}} and last of Handley Page's early single-seat monoplanes (the Type B being a biplane). [...] It was a close {{relative}} of the Type A, which crashed on its first turn, and the [...] Type C which did not fly at all. [...] Like them the Type D used the wing patented by José Weiss that promised, but failed to deliver, automatic lateral stability. [...] Its structure {{was based on a}} rigid inner section, built with four spars and standard ribs with a flexible outer section carried on ribs attached fanwise {{from the end of the}} spars in a bird-like fashion. The wing was braced by wires from a tall, narrow inverted V kingpost, lifting loads being carried by symmetrical bracing to a matching V post under the fuselage. [...] This latter structure also carried the two-wheel single axle undercarriage and a long central skid <b>to</b> prevent <b>nosing</b> <b>over</b> and <b>to</b> hold the tail clear of the ground. After the Type A crash, Handley Page had added wing warping for lateral control to the Type C. [...] The Type D also used this system, with a steering wheel pulling on wires to the mid-wing via the kingpost. [...] The horizontal tail was an approximately 60° delta with rounded tips; most of the surface moved to form the single-piece elevator and carried the rudder post and split (above and below the elevator) rudder, so that all the control surfaces moved together as a cruciform piece. The elevator was operated by pushing or pulling the lever-mounted steering wheel and the rudder by a [...] "foot tiller". There was no fixed fin.|$|R
