5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (<b>nearby</b> <b>in</b> both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E
