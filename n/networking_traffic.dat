50|$|Although RMAs {{are derived}} from RIAs, there are {{fundamental}} dissimilarities between them, particularly task/layer distribution of application, interaction medium, screen size and layout, communication and networking mediums. The logic and data layers in RIAs are initially located in remote back-end servers and only the user interface is located inside the end-user's device. The fundamental principle in forming RIAs is to mitigate the server-side computing cost of the applications by exploiting the computing power of contemporary desktop computers at the user end. Parts of logic and data layers are transferred from the server node to the client node. The rich computing and storage resources in contemporary personal computers (PCs) reduce client-server <b>networking</b> <b>traffic</b> and delay, and shrink ownership and maintenance costs on the server side. This helps service providers reduce operating costs. In return, the end-user benefits from a crisp interaction response from the application since {{some part of the}} data and logic is stored in their local computer.|$|E

40|$|Differentiated {{services}} (DS) is {{a mechanism}} by which network service providers can offer differing levels of network service to different traffic, {{and in doing so}} they provide quality of service (QoS) to their customers. The advantage of DS is that many traffic flows can be aggregated to a small number of classes, thereby simplifying the processing and storage associated with packet classification and conditioning. In addition, there is no signaling state or related processing required in the DS network since QoS is invoked on a packet-by-packet basis. To succeed in differentiation, router must somehow decide which packet should go into which class.

The natural traffic granularity is the flow between packet and circuit and between connection-less and connection-oriented modes. Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of "knowledge plane" and "network mining. ...|$|E

Based on these parameters the network must decide whether to accept or refuse the connection, and it must reserve resources to guarantee the requested quality of service constraints.

However, texting messages and notes such as emails and instant messages replace handwriting letters and notes in communication {{due to the}} popularity and availability of mobile devices and personal computers. Furthermore, the commonly used input methods and devices also limit handwriting messaging. For example, limited mobile screen sizes make writing multiple Chinese characters difficult. As a result, this work aims at designing and developing a handwriting messaging system based on our handwriting characteristic exploration and texting-handwriting difference discovery. We first discover Chinese texting issues for mobile devices and emotion-delivered effectiveness of handwriting with pilot studies. Then, our emotion-embedded handwriting messaging framework is implemented to record writing strokes on the entire touch screen, vectorize them as Bézier curves, and send them as instant messages. Vectorizing strokes can preserve personal and emotional handwriting features with compact <b>networking</b> <b>traffic</b> without deteriorating the convenience of instant messaging.

The main difficulty in designing routing algorithms for such a network is the large number of topology changes that the network undergoes due to device movement. Selective flooding is a routing technique that is more resilient to topology changes than traditional algorithms but is more bandwidth efficient than pure flooding. An on-demand selective flooding algorithm has been designed and tested on the ns- 2 simulator. In scenarios involving a large number of topology changes, selective flooding outperforms other ad hoc network routing techniques. Unfortunately, selective flooding is much more bandwidth hungry and is unable to scale to handle reasonable traffic loads. Interestingly, the analysis of selective flooding reveals major problems with traditional ad hoc networking techniques.
