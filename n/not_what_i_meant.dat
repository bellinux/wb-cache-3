6000|$|Wisbech laughed. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "I {{certainly}} would <b>not.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> to suggest was that I am naturally {{more or less}} acquainted with Derrick Nasmyth's habits. In fact, I may admit I was a little astonished to hear he had contrived to accumulate those thirty dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carmen {{gave him}} a level, {{critical}} glance. [...] "They won't {{be able to find}} much fault with you, and if they did, you wouldn't guess it, so it wouldn't matter. But that is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> You have been Featherstone's partner for some time, and it's curious that he has told you nothing about his home." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me, and I {{saw that he}} did <b>not</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> <b>I</b> explained.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Herbert, [...] "was <b>not</b> quite <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> <b>I</b> was {{thinking}} of the effect upon the gentlemen who wish to launch this company." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> do <b>not</b> {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> by [...] "the bright hearts," [...] but {{a little}} later I wrote of Spirits [...] "with mirrors in their hearts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Perhaps you’re right. However, I don’t {{think you}} need object if I’m able to put any {{business}} in your way; but this is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> to talk about. I cannot consent to an engagement just now, but after you have been twelve months in business you may come to me again, and we’ll see what progress you are making.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Ormsgill strode forward masterfully, {{and it was}} {{a minute}} later when she smiled up at him. [...] "This," [...] she said, [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> to do--at least, just now--but when I saw you looking so worn and anxious and remembered that you were still a {{prisoner}} I forgot how I hated that Englishwoman. I only remembered how I loved you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> After all, {{nobody in}} the hotel knows much about the matter, and there is, of course, no {{need to do more}} than bow to the men if you meet them at the landing, though {{it would be better to}} avoid this, if possible. A small favor of the kind they did you does not justify their {{claiming}} your acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me if <b>I</b> do <b>not</b> say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> to. <b>I</b> have reasons for--" [...] (he paused again)--"Then you {{are pleased}} {{with the way the}} people treat you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] I said, drawing {{him aside}} down {{the corner of}} Craven Street; [...] "you did <b>not</b> {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> when <b>I</b> said people went to York by rail?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond {{shook hands}} with him. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it's like you. Where are your niggers, and what's the matter with my--sentries? Still that's <b>not</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> No maid has a {{right to}} take such a vow on herself without consent of her father, nor is it binding otherwise. No! but no one can take away from a Christian maid the power of holiness. Bear that for ever in mind, sweetheart. Naught that can be done by man or by devil to the body can hurt the soul that is fixed on Christ and does not consent to evil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Flora, [...] "this is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> It is that I {{have never}} set my heart right. I am {{not like you}} nor my sisters. I have seemed to myself, and to you, {{to be trying to}} do right, but it was all hollow, for the sake of praise and credit. I know it, now it is too late; and He has let me destroy my child here, lest I should have {{destroyed}} her everlasting life, like my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, I should say, Never wade {{across a}} South American river at all," [...] said Miss Millet; [...] "but, brother, that's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> Before you arrived, Jeff and I {{had been talking}} about God's ways with man, and I was trying to show that {{disasters}} and what we call misfortunes are not necessarily evil, but are often the means of great blessing. I don't think Jeff quite sees that. I can't explain myself clearly, brother; but you know what I mean." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could have}} nothing to object against an offer of this kind, because he could <b>not</b> guess <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> but gave me all the {{assurance}} of service and assistance that lay in his power in anything that I {{might have to do}} in that country.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} {{travelled}} through it," [...] Jeanne answered; [...] "but I {{am afraid that}} you did <b>not</b> understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> just now. <b>I</b> {{said that there were}} very few people with whom I cared to talk. You are not one of those few, Monsieur le Comte." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose they should? It's an even chance Sampson'll search {{every room}} and corner in this old house. If they found me here I couldn't start a fight. You might be hurt. Then--the fact {{of my being}} here--" [...] <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> finish <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> but instead made {{a step toward the}} door.|$|R
6000|$|And {{would it}} have been worth it, after all, After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, Would it have been worth while, To have bitten off the matter with a smile, To have {{squeezed}} the universe into a ball To roll it toward some overwhelming question, To say: [...] "I am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"-- If one, settling a pillow by her head, [...] Should say: [...] "That is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> at all; [...] That is not it, at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{would it}} have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worth while, After the sunsets and the dooryards and the {{sprinkled}} streets, After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the [...] floor-- And this, and so much more?-- It is impossible to say just what I mean! But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: Would it have been worth while If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, And turning toward the window, should say: [...] "That is not it at all, [...] That is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Bessie, {{you know}} that is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> In that respect they are both alike. But you, when you were engaged, were about three years younger than the man, and I am nearly twenty years younger than Sir Francis. You don't suppose that I can put myself {{altogether}} on the same platform with him as you did with your lover. It is absurd to suppose it. Do you let him go his way, and me go mine. You may be sure that not a word of reproach will ever fall from my lips."--"Till we are married," [...] Cecilia had intended to say, {{but she did not}} complete the sentence.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you do <b>not</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> you're <b>not</b> {{the girl}} I {{take you to}} be." [...] Then as she walked with him {{back out of the}} ball-room into the drawing-room she assured him that she did know what he meant, and that {{therefore}} she was the girl he took her to be.|$|R
60|$|I {{then asked}} the fellow {{if he could}} direct us to Ryde or Newport; but again he shook his head, {{and said that he}} never had heard of such countries. And when I asked him if there were any cities in this country he did <b>not</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> never having heard the word cities.|$|R
60|$|She evidently did <b>not</b> quite {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> {{for there was}} a look of slight bewilderment in her eyes; and I was not surprised, for I had not myself the faintest notion of my meaning. Still she saw it was a compliment.|$|R
6000|$|And {{would it}} have been worth it, after all, [...] After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, [...] Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, [...] Would it have been worth while, [...] To have bitten off the matter with a smile, [...] To have {{squeezed}} the universe into a ball [...] To roll it toward some overwhelming question, [...] To say: [...] "I am Lazarus, come from the dead, [...] Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"-- [...] If one, settling a pillow by her head, [...] Should say: [...] "That is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> at all; [...] That is not it, at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now, I hope," [...] said Fred; [...] "but {{that was}} <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> to say. No one could say, Uncle Geoffrey told me, that the illness was brought on either by anxiety or over-exertion. The {{complaint}} was of long standing, {{and must have}} made progress some time or other; {{and he said that}} he was convinced that, as she said to Aunt Geoffrey, she had rather have been here than anywhere else. She said she could only be sorry for grandpapa and grandmamma's sake, but that for herself it was great happiness to have been to Knight Sutton Church once more; and she was most thankful that she had come to die in my father's home, after seeing us well settled here, instead of leaving us to come to it as a strange place." ...|$|E

6000|$|Their {{weapons were}} most primitive, {{consisting}} of rude spears tipped {{with pieces of}} metal pounded roughly into shape. They had no literature, no religion, and recognized no law other than the law of might. They produced fire by striking a bit of flint and steel together, {{but for the most}} part they ate their food raw. Marriage is unknown among them, and while they have the word, mother, they did <b>not</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> by [...] "father." [...] The males fight for the favor of the females. They practice infanticide, and kill the aged and physically unfit.|$|R
6000|$|... "That won't do--you don't mean it. You never cared--you {{were too}} proud to care; and when I spoke to you about my fault, you did <b>n't</b> even know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> You might have told me, therefore, that my remorse was idle, that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said to Gordon had not been of the {{smallest}} consequence, and that the rupture had come from yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the first}} floor," [...] said Herbert. Which was <b>not</b> at all <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> for <b>I</b> had {{intended}} {{my question to}} apply to his means. [...] "I have never seen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows,--roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument." [...] In {{looking at me and}} then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true, and it happens," [...] said Edgar, sadly, [...] "that I {{know a few}} {{interesting}} facts regarding that vessel. I know of {{some people}} whose hearts were broken {{by the loss of}} relatives in that wreck. There were many such--God comfort them! But that is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> to speak of. The facts I refer to are connected with the treasure lost in the vessel. Just before leaving London I had occasion to call on the gentleman who had the management of the recovered gold, and he told me several interesting things. First of all, the whole of the gold that could be identified was handed at once over to its owners; but this matter of identification was not easy, for much of the gold was found quite loose in the form of sovereigns and nuggets and dust. The dust was ordered to be sent up with the `dirt' that surrounded it, and a process of gold-washing was instituted, after the regular diggings fashion, with a bowl and water. Tons of `dirt' were sent up and washed in this way, and a large quantity of gold saved. The agent showed me the bowl that was used on this occasion. He also showed me sovereigns that had been kept as curious specimens. Some of them were partly destroyed, {{as if they had been}} caught between iron-plates and cut in half; others were more or less defaced and bent, and a few had been squeezed almost into an unrecognisable shape. In one place, he told me, the divers saw a pile of sovereigns through a rent in an iron-plate. The rent was too small to admit a man's arm, and the plates could not be dislodged. The divers, therefore, made a pair of iron tongs, with which they picked out the sovereigns, and thus saved a large sum of money. One very curious case of identification occurred. A bag of sovereigns was found with no name on it. A claimant appeared, but he could tell of no mark to prove that he was the rightful owner. Of course it could not be given up, and it appeared as if the unfortunate man (who was indeed the owner) must relinquish his claim, when in a happy moment his wife remembered that she had put a brass `token' into the bag with the gold. The bag was searched, the token was found, and the gold was immediately handed to them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout, Georgantas {{continued}} to record {{at home on}} a 424 Portastudio: In 2005 he posted a new song every week to Thunderegg's website, the best of which were collected for the CD This Week, which was self-released in early 2007. Several other albums followed, including <b>Not</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Meant,</b> Thunderegg's first San Francisco album, which was recommended for fans of [...] "The Eels, Ween, The Flaming Lips, and Pulp." [...] That album's closing track, [...] "The Guest Star of the Rest Stop," [...] was initially commissioned by author T Cooper for a CD accompanying his 2012 book Real Man Adventures.|$|E
5000|$|Goldman later elaborated:Boys and Girls Together {{was three}} {{years of my life}} and I thought it was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> It was {{depressing}}, and not at all what I had meant when I started. It's so hard to fill that many pages, and I thought, [...] "Well, it's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> but at least they'll have to think I'm serious. Nobody would write this depressing a book, in which nobody gets what they want and everybody fails, if you're trying to be Harold Robbins." [...] There was a review of Boys and Girls Together that I remember very clearly. It {{was one of the most}} painful reviews of my life by a critic from the New York Times called Conrad Knickerbocker... which compared me with Harold Robbins, and I thought, [...] "You never read Harold Robbins. They get what they want in that world, and this is basically a cold, unpleasant book." [...] I remember for a month I was on the verge of tears.Richard Andersen wrote of the novel:Seeing all their energies leading to death and betrayal, the characters of Boys and Girls Together conclude that there are no satisfactory alternatives. Life is hopeless. Nevertheless, suicide is not the answer; man must find a way to affirm life over death whenever his identities fail him. One way of achieving affirmation in the wasteland, Goldman seems to be saying, is through endurance.|$|E
60|$|Here, evidently, were {{a people}} {{slightly}} superior {{to those of}} the Isle of Wight. These must have at least the rudiments of civilized government since they recognized one among them as ruler, with the title, king. Also, they retained the word father. The girl's pronunciation, while far from identical with ours, was much closer than the tortured dialect of the Eastenders of the Isle of Wight. The longer I talked with her the more hopeful I became of finding here, among her people, some records, or traditions, which might assist in clearing up the historic enigma of the past two centuries. I asked her if we were far from the city of London, but she did <b>not</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> When <b>I</b> tried to explain, describing mighty buildings of stone and brick, broad avenues, parks, palaces, and countless people, she but shook her head sadly.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} was fine, neither too cool nor too warm; the breezes were gentle, and Nature smiled. But there were no walks or rides with Madeline. She seemed to be much engaged during the day, and I saw but little of her. When we met at meals she was polite, but very quiet and reserved. She had evidently {{determined}} on a course of conduct, and had resolved to assume that, although I had been very rude to her, she {{did not understand the}} import of my words. It would be quite proper, of course, for her <b>not</b> to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> by my expressions of the night before.|$|R
6000|$|The brute laughed. [...] "No, I can't take {{a letter}} to the Captain," [...] he said; [...] "I saw Jan Vanzyl shoot him. He fell so," [...] and {{suddenly}} he collapsed all in a heap on the path, in imitation of a man struck dead by a bullet. [...] "I can't take him a message, missie," [...] he went on, rising, [...] "but one day {{you will be able to}} go and look for him yourself. I did <b>not</b> mean that; <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> was that <b>I</b> could take {{a letter to}} Frank Muller. A live Boer is better than a dead Englishman; and Frank Muller will make a fine husband for any girl. If you shut your eyes you won't know the difference." ...|$|R
