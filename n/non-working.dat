5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} {{driving a}} passenger-carrying CMV (e.g., commercial and city buses, passenger vans, and school buses) {{for more than}} 10hours, or to drive after having been on-duty for 15hours. The 5-hour difference between the 10-hour driving limit and the 15-hour on-duty limit gives drivers {{the opportunity to take}} care of non-driving work-related duties such as loading and unloading of passengers and luggage, and fueling the vehicle, as well as <b>non-working</b> duties such as meal and rest breaks. After completing a 10 to 15-hour on-duty period, the driver must be allowed 8hours off-duty.|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} {{driving a}} property-carrying CMV (e.g., trucks) more than 11hours or to drive {{after having been}} on-duty for 14hours. The 3-hour difference between the 11-hour driving limit and the 14-hour on-duty limit gives drivers {{the opportunity to take}} care of non-driving working duties such as loading and unloading cargo, fueling the vehicle, and required vehicle inspections, as well as <b>non-working</b> duties such as meal and rest breaks. After completing an 11- to 14-hour on-duty period, the driver must be allowed 10hours off-duty.|$|E
5|$|Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog {{has high}} energy levels, an active mind, and {{a level of}} independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated {{as one of the}} most {{intelligent}} dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a <b>non-working</b> dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.|$|E
5|$|The Halifax Gibbet was {{dismantled}} {{after the}} last executions in 1650, and the site was neglected until the platform on which the gibbet had been mounted was rediscovered in about 1840. A full-size <b>non-working</b> replica was erected on the original stone base in August 1974; it includes a blade made from a casting of the original, which as of 2011 is displayed in the Bankfield Museum in Boothtown {{on the outskirts of}} Halifax. A commemorative plaque nearby lists the names of the 52 people known to have been executed by the device.|$|E
5|$|Almost 100 {{people were}} {{beheaded}} in Halifax {{between the first}} recorded execution in 1286 and the last in 1650, but as {{the date of the}} gibbet's installation is uncertain, it cannot be determined with any accuracy how many were dealt with by the Halifax Gibbet. By 1650 public opinion considered beheading to be an excessively severe punishment for petty theft; use of the gibbet was forbidden by Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, and the structure was dismantled. The stone base was rediscovered and preserved in about 1840, and a <b>non-working</b> replica was erected on the site in 1974. The names of 52 people known to have been beheaded by the device are listed on a nearby plaque.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Luccombe {{lies at the}} foot of Dunkery Hill. Along with Stoke Pero and Horner it forms a civil parish. Horner is on the eastern bank of Horner Water on which there is a restored, but <b>non-working,</b> watermill. The river is crossed by two medieval {{packhorse}} bridges, one of which is known as Hacketty Way Bridge which is crossed by the Coleridge Way. The parish Church of St Mary has a chancel dating from about 1300, with the nave and tower being added around 1450. Stoke Pero Church has a 13th-century tower. The Dovecot at Blackford Farm is part of the estate. It was built in the 11th century and is a Grade II* listed building, and ancient monument. It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} <b>non-working</b> air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E

25|$|During the expedition, Gibbs helped catch Adelie {{penguins}} for the Smithsonian Institution. This {{was dangerous}} work because {{the men had}} to work from a rowboat in fog with a <b>non-working</b> radio. Only the sounding of the ship's horn gave the men bearings {{to find their way}} back to the ship.|$|E
25|$|With few exceptions, {{all legal}} {{residents}} {{working in the}} United States now have an individual Social Security number. Indeed, nearly all working (and many <b>non-working)</b> residents since Social Security's 1935 inception have had a Social Security number because it is required to do {{a wide range of}} things, e.g., paying taxes and getting a job.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, because Easter {{falls on}} a Sunday, {{which is already}} a <b>non-working</b> day for federal and state employees, {{it has not been}} {{designated}} as a federal or state holiday. Easter parades are held in many American cities, involving festive strolling processions, with the New York City parade being the best known.|$|E
25|$|On April 9, 2002, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo {{proclaimed that}} the Philippine–American War had ended on April 16, 1902 with the {{surrender}} of General Miguel Malvar, and declared the centennial anniversary of that date as a national working holiday and as a special <b>non-working</b> holiday in the Province of Batangas and in the Cities of Batangas, Lipa and Tanaun.|$|E
25|$|Du Qiong {{was known}} for being a man of few words and for {{maintaining}} a low profile throughout his career. He hardly interacted with his colleagues outside the workplace and stayed in his residence {{most of the time}} during <b>non-working</b> hours. Jiang Wan and Fei Yi, who consecutively served as the heads of the Shu central government between 234 and 253, respected and regarded him highly.|$|E
25|$|During 1929 the {{original}} wheels and one cylinder {{were incorporated into}} a full scale, <b>non-working</b> model that is now {{on display in the}} Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. This early replica was rebuilt in 1988 and currently includes batteries and an electric motor to allow it to move (all wheels are driven making the engine a 4wBE), although the steam components are non-functional. The other cylinder is on display at Rainhill Public Library.|$|E
25|$|Counterfeit {{products}} {{tend to have}} fake company logos and brands (resulting in patent or {{trademark infringement}} {{in the case of}} goods), have a reputation for being lower quality (sometimes not working at all) and may even include toxic elements such as lead. This has resulted in the deaths {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people, due to automobile and aviation accidents, poisoning, or ceasing to take essential compounds (e.g., in the case a person takes <b>non-working</b> medicine).|$|E
25|$|Circuit City's City Advantage Plan {{was also}} {{challenged}} in a United States District Court in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs' claim concerned Circuit City's cancellation of its warranty plan without full {{disclosure of the}} plan {{at the time of}} sale. The plaintiffs cited breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. Circuit City requested the matter be dismissed. The court, however, upheld the plaintiffs' claim that the monies paid for the protection plan be reimbursed and credit be issued for <b>non-working</b> goods returned.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} {{and social conditions}} of employment of the workers were very favourable and unusual for the time. To retain his workforce, Riquet paid his workers well enough. More importantly, he gave benefits never before seen such as <b>non-working</b> rain days, Sundays and public holidays, and finally paid sick leave. The employment contract was individual and is done by free recruitment. Pay was, at the beginning, 20 sols (1 livre) per day, double the agricultural wage. Discontent from farm owners, however, forced Riquet to reduce pay to 15, then 12 sols per day. In 1668 he established the monthly payment of 10 livres.|$|E
25|$|An unskilled male worker earned {{about twenty}} to thirty sous a day (there were twenty sous in a livre); a woman earned {{about half as}} much. A skilled mason could earn fifty sous. A four-pound loaf of bread cost eight or nine sous. A family with two children, where both parents worked, {{consumed}} two four-pound loaves a day. Because there were between 110 and 150 holidays, Sundays and other <b>non-working</b> days, families often spent half their income on bread alone. In 1700, the minimum rent for an attic room was thirty to forty livres a year; rent for two rooms was a minimum of sixty livres.|$|E
25|$|The {{restoration}} of Wardown Park {{was completed in}} June 2005, using one million pounds of lottery funding, by the local council {{as well as the}} work and contributions of local people. The council and the Friends of Wardown Park, have replaced the old refreshment kiosk with a building mirroring the design of the boathouse. Across the lake from the kiosk is the original boathouse which also underwent restoration {{with the rest of the}} buildings of the park. At the same time the Edwardian Daisy Chain wall and drinking fountain were restored using the original designs and old photographs. The drinking fountain is an exact replica of the original based on a photograph from 1907 on display in the museum, however it is a <b>non-working</b> replica.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{has been}} {{directed}} at the cost to users of the SmartRider system compared to its predecessor, the MultiRider. While the MultiRider could be bought as a 40-ride ticket for a 25% discount, a lesser 20% discount can now only be obtained by paying by direct debit, which {{can take up to}} 3 weeks to activate. A 10% discount is available for all other methods of payment. This was raised in Parliament by Liberal MP Katie Hodson-Thomas, who claimed that passengers would end up paying $324 more a year for public transport under SmartRider. In February 2006, The West Australian reported criticism by trial users who claimed that their failure to tag off, either by accidentally forgetting to do so or due to a <b>non-working</b> machine, resulted in a four-zone fare being charged to the SmartRider regardless of distance travelled.|$|E
25|$|The Spinone has {{a square}} build (the {{length of the}} body is {{approximately}} equal to the height at the withers). It is a strong-boned, solidly built dog with a well-muscled body and limbs that are suited to almost any kind of terrain. A brown and white Spinone can sometimes be confused with a German Wirehaired Pointer by someone unfamiliar with the breeds. However, the long head and pronounced occipital are unique to the breed. He has an expression that shows intelligence and understanding and is often described as having human-like eyes. The tail of the working Spinone is customarily docked at half its length (approx 5.5 to 8inches or 140 to 200mm {{from the base of the}} tail). <b>Non-working</b> UK based Italian Spinones are no longer docked, in accordance with current legislation. Even as adults, Spinoni retain disproportionate, puppy-like, webbed paws which make them powerful swimmers.|$|E
500|$|Manila celebrates {{civic and}} {{national}} holidays. Since {{most of the}} city's citizens are Roman Catholics, most of the festivities are religious in nature. Manila Day, which celebrates the city's founding on June 24, 1571 by Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi, was first proclaimed by Herminio A. Astorga (then Vice Mayor of Manila) on June 24, 1962. It has been annually commemorated under the patronage of John the Baptist, and has always been declared by the national government as a special <b>non-working</b> holiday through Presidential Proclamations. Each of the city's 897 barangays also have their own festivities guided by their own patron saint.|$|E
500|$|The {{citizens}} of Leningrad {{were subjected to}} heavy bombardment and a siege that would last 872 days and starve {{more than a million}} people to death, of whom approximately 400,000 were children below the age of 14. The German-Finnish blockade cut off access to food, fuel and raw materials, and rations reached a low, for the <b>non-working</b> population, of four ounces (five thin slices) of bread and a little watery soup per day. Starving Soviet civilians began to eat their domestic animals, along with hair tonic and Vaseline. Some desperate citizens resorted to cannibalism; Soviet records list 2,000 people arrested for [...] "the use of human meat as food" [...] during the siege, 886 of them during the first winter of 1941–42. The Wehrmacht planned to seal off Leningrad, starve out the population, and then demolish the city entirely.|$|E
500|$|Depictions {{of humans}} {{collecting}} honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them {{are shown in}} Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago. Simple hives and smoke were used; jars of honey {{were found in the}} tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. From the 18th century, European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony. Among Classical Era authors, beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in the History of Animals Book 9 (a book not written by Aristotle himself). The account mentions that bees die after stinging; that workers remove corpses from the hive, and guard it; castes including workers and <b>non-working</b> drones, but [...] "kings" [...] rather than queens; predators including toads and bee-eaters; and the waggle dance, with the [...] "irresistible suggestion" [...] of άpοσειονται (aroseiontai, it waggles) and παρακολουθούσιν (parakolouthousin, they watch).|$|E
500|$|As of 2010, {{people who}} were aged 12 years and above {{involved}} in a profession were classified as economically active, while housewives, homemakers, students, aged and <b>non-working</b> people were classified as inactive. Western had 63.8 per cent of active population, [...] making it the province with the highest proportion of working people. Lusaka had the most number of active people (703,097), while Muchinga Province had the least number (150,267). Lusaka also had the most number of working women, while North-Western had the least number of working women. The national average of active people stood at 55.5 per cent with 50.2 in rural areas and 65.3 per cent in urban areas. The unemployment rate was 13.0 per cent during 2010, with Copperbelt Province having {{the highest rate of}} 22.1 per cent and Northern Province had the least rate of 13.0 per cent. The youth unemployment, defined as unemployed rate of people aged 15–35 years, stood at 16.7 per cent, with the age group of 20-24 constituting 23.5 per cent.|$|E
500|$|Steam's {{customer}} {{service has been}} highly criticized, with users citing poor response times or lack of response in regards to issues such as being locked out of one's library or having a <b>non-working</b> game redemption key. In March 2015, Valve {{had been given a}} failing [...] "F" [...] grade from the Better Business Bureau due to a large number of complaints in Valve's handling of Steam, leading Valve's Erik Johnson to state that [...] "we don't feel like our {{customer service}} support is where it needs to be right now". Johnson stated the company plans to better integrate customer support features into the Steam client and be more responsive to such issues. In May 2017, in addition to hiring more staff for customer service, Valve publicized pages that show the number and type of customer service requests it was handling over the last 90 days, with an average of 75,000 entered each day. Of those, requests for refunds were the largest segment, and which Valve could resolve within hours, followed by account security and recovery requests. Valve stated at this time that 98% of all service requests were processed within 24 hours of filing.|$|E
