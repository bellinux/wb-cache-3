5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E

5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{as that of the}} outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as that of the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus {{in the same way that}} helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> elevation.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 2001, a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The {{increase in the}} forecast was attributed to the warm sea surface temperatures, although the agency noted that the season would likely not be as active as previous ones due {{to the effect of}} a weak to moderate El Nino. The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly to 65 percent; the East Coast potential also went up slightly, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} have <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bore and use {{the same}} mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon {{lives in}} groups of 15 to 150, {{made up of a}} few males, many females, and their young. Each baboon has a social ranking somewhere in the group, {{depending}} on its dominance. Female dominance is hereditary, with daughters having <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rank as their mothers, and adult females forming the core of the social system. Female relatives form their own subgroups in the troop. Related females are largely friendly to each other. They tend to stay close together and groom one another, and team up in aggressive encounters within the troop. Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E
5|$|Another factor {{pointing}} to Deva Victrix as a provincial capital {{is the presence}} of a port. From Deva, Ireland (Hibernia) was also accessible, a land which Agricola had plans to conquer; he even launched an expedition to Ireland, though where from is unclear. Also, the Flavian dynasty was expansionist, and Deva was closer to what would then have been the front, making administration quicker and easier. Furthermore, historian Vittorio Di Martino believes that Agricola could have chosen Deva Victrix as a possible future capital of Roman Britain because it was practically placed at the centre of the British isles, being located geographically at <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> distance from the westernmost shores of Ireland, the easternmost lands of Britannia and the Channel.|$|E

5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town. What may have been another tornado caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another tornado struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|By August28, {{the storm}} began to re-intensify, after curving north-northwestward near The Bahamas. At 0000UTC on the {{following}} day, Faith peaked as a 125mph (205km/h) Category3 hurricane Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Eventually, the storm weakened back to a Category2 hurricane and re-curved to the northeast. One person drowned in the western Atlantic after his ship sank. Heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted Bermuda, though no damage occurred. The storm maintained <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> intensity as a Category2 hurricane for several days, while tracking northeastward into the far North Atlantic Ocean. Faith finally weakened while north of Scotland and became extratropical near the Faroe Islands on September6. Three other drowning deaths occurred in the North Sea near Denmark. A fifth death occurred after a man succumbed to injuries sustained during a boating incident related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{assessments}} in the Philippines began on October31, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads blocked off or washed away, clearing operations were a priority. The Philippine Red Cross {{assisted in the}} immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16,000people in Aurora. The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received. By November1, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2million PHP (US$81,000). Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck <b>nearly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> areas. A weaker, though still powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited.|$|E
