The second virial coefficients of the excess enthalpies are found to be positive for all the systems studied in water-urea mixtures. A preliminary analysis, carried out using the Savage and Wood group additivity approach, suggests that, in concentrated aqueous solutions of urea, this arises from the peptide-peptide or hydroxyl-hydroxyl, and the apolar-apolar group contributions, all being positive, and these overwhelm the negative contributions from the polar-apolar group interactions. A remarkable feature is the inversion of the signs of the peptide-peptide, hydroxyl-hydroxyl, peptide-methylene and hydroxyl-methylene, group interactions when compared with those which prevail in pure water. This suggests a completely different solvation and interaction mechanism in concentrated urea solutions. The enthalpic contributions from apolar-apolar group interactions in the mixed solvent, in turn, are higher than the values found in water.
