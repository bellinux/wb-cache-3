As usually occurs when a rider dies {{in the midst of}} a multi-day cycling event, the next day was not competitively raced. Instead, the stage was preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a procession in Weylandt's memory. Each of the 23 teams took to the front of the peloton for about 15 minutes, and members of , along with Farrar, were allowed to finish first with their arms around each other. Millar led the rest of the field across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the [...] team to lead another moment of silence.

This group also included teammate Le Mével, and had he taken any of the time bonuses he and not Millar would have taken the race lead. However, the race and the entire cycling world were turned sideways by the death of [...] rider Wouter Weylandt after crashing on the descent of the day's last climb, the Passo del Bocco. Other than Weylandt's own team, Garmin-Cervélo was perhaps the team most affected. Millar, in the role of race leader, took up the task of organizing the tributes to Weylandt in the next day's stage. Weylandt's death was especially hard on Farrar, as the two had been close friends and training partners, resulting from Farrar relocating to Weylandt's hometown of Ghent, Belgium when he first became a professional. Farrar said that Weylandt was [...] "like another brother to [...] " [...] and that his death left him [...] "unbearably saddened." [...] The peloton <b>neutralized</b> <b>stage</b> 4, with each team riding on the front for approximately 15 minutes and there being no competitive racing at any time. The final team to take to the front was Weylandt's [...] squad, who rode side-by-side in the stage's final kilometers. They also invited Farrar up to ride with them, and the nine of them crossed the finish line first together. Millar quietly led the remainder of the peloton across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded for any of the race's classifications. Farrar, as well as the remaining [...] squad, decided to leave the Giro after this neutralized ride.

40|$|Single-ended and {{differential}} low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), {{designed in}} 0. 18 μm CMOS for operation at 24 GHz, are introduced in this paper. Novel, high-Q series-stub transmission lines (SSTLs) {{are used in}} the matching networks of both LNAs. This SSTL structure shows a notable Q factor improvement over the com-monly used spiral inductor, which helps to minimize the losses and noise pro-duced in the LNA matching networks, making these topologies suitable for sen-sitive receiver front ends. The single-ended amplifier uses two cascode stages to help improve gain and reverse isolation when compared to common source stages. Results show that the cascode LNA is able to produce an excellent compromise between ease of de-sign, gain and noise. After optimizing transistor sizes to produce minimum noise, the single-ended amplifier produces a simulated noise figure of only 4. 9 dB and a gain of 17. 4 dB. The differential LNA uses two capacitively <b>neutralized</b> <b>stages</b> to improve reverse isolation. Chip production has been delayed by the foundry, but simulated results of the differential LNA show an excellent noise figure of 4. 2 and a gain of 12. 3 dB.

50|$|Only {{two of the}} pre race favourites would {{eventually}} start the race. Bart Brentjens {{pulled out of the}} event before the first stage due to an illness.

[...] The loss of his compatriot weighed heavily on Vinokourov, but he rallied and declared that he was more motivated than ever to win.

2500|$|A {{great number}} of early breakaways were {{attempted}} and <b>neutralized</b> in the <b>stage's</b> first hour. Finally, seven broke away at the [...] mark. The seven, Addy Engels, Maxim Gourov, Patxi Vila, Franck Renier, Eric Berthou, Pedro Horrillo and Mikhail Ignatiev, got a maximum advantage of 2'30", but the peloton easily caught them [...] from the finish line. [...] tried {{to set up the}} sprint for Alexandre Usov, as did [...] for Matteo Tosatto, who lived in the town where the stage finished. AG2R's leadout train took a left-hand turn in the final kilometer too sharply, and left a handful of riders to contest the stage alone. Since the crash occurred within the final , no time was counted as lost. Alessandro Petacchi easily held off Maximiliano Richeze and Matti Breschel for the victory, though this was one of his many 2007 wins that was later stripped due to his irregular salbutamol levels in a test given earlier in the race. The overall standings were unchanged by the day's results.|$|R
50|$|The {{team was}} very {{successful}} in stage 2, {{on a day when}} nearly every other team came away with riders nursing injuries. Chavanel made the morning breakaway and started a solo move for victory about 20 kilometers from the finish. Pineau had also made the breakaway and won the first four climbs, giving him the polka-dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification, before he pulled up and rejoined the peloton behind them. After Chavanel had attacked the leading group and gotten free, fellow breakaway rider Francesco Gavazzi crashed on the Col du Stockeu and set off a chain reaction of crashes that involved some 60 riders from just about every team in the race. Uninvolved and likely unaware, Chavanel rode to an uncontested stage win. Race leader Fabian Cancellara negotiated with Tour officials to <b>neutralize</b> the <b>stage</b> behind Chavanel, and there was no aggressive riding from the peloton for the final few kilometers of the race, and no sprint for second place. Chavanel's nearly four-minute gap over the peloton nonetheless stood, giving him the yellow jersey as well as the stage win. Points classification points for all but Chavanel were also negated, meaning the Frenchman also took the green jersey. The squad also took the lead in the teams classification with this result, making it a very successful day for them. Chavanel was unable to maintain the race lead the next day in stage 3, which due to its inclusion of several cobbled sectors was expected to be very difficult and crash-ridden. He and Pineau both finished in the sixth large group on the road, losing four minutes to the stage winner. He slipped to fifth overall with this result.|$|R
40|$|Pushed by the {{availability}} of large fractional bandwidths, many well-established applications are focusing mm-wave spectrum for product deployment. Generation of broadband power at mm-waves is challenging because a key target such as the efficiency trades with the gain-bandwidth (GBW) product. The major limit is the capacitive parasitics at the interstage between driver and power devices. The latter are designed with a large form factor so as to deliver the desired output power and are commonly biased in class-AB to achieve high drain efficiency, penalizing GBW. In this paper, a design methodology for interstage and output matching networks targeting large fractional bandwidth and high efficiency is proposed. Leveraging inductively coupled resonators, we apply Norton transformations for impedance scaling. In both networks, topological transformations are employed to include a transformer, achieve the desired load impedance and minimize the number of components. A two-stage differential PA with <b>neutralized</b> common source <b>stages</b> has been realized in 28 nm CMOS using low-power devices. The PA delivers 13 dBm saturated output power over the 40 – 67 GHz bandwidth with a peak power-added efficiency of 16 % without power combining.

2500|$|The team {{time trial}} went {{about as well}} as the squad could have hoped. They set the best time at the {{intermediate}} time check and at the finish line, the first and only squad to finish under 21 minutes. Though they finished with only five riders, five was all they needed, as the squad's time was taken for the fifth man to cross the line. Pinotti indeed was the first over, and took the first pink jersey. It was the second time in his career he held the Giro race lead, having previously held it for four days in the 2008 Giro d'Italia. He made it clear after the stage that the team's focus for stage 2 would be Cavendish, in the sprint. Given that the Giro awards time bonuses for the first three riders to finish a road race stage, that made it extremely likely that Cavendish would take the pink jersey the next day. The team did work for Cavendish in stage 2, and he did become the new race leader, but he missed out on the stage win. 's Alessandro Petacchi opened the sprint first, to the right of Cavendish's last leadout man Renshaw, leaving Cavendish to take the line to Renshaw's left. Just as Cavendish occupied a position with open road in front of him, Petacchi deviated from his line and rode directly in front of Cavendish for a few meters. When Cavendish tried to go around Petacchi, the Italian again changed his line to stay in front of Cavendish. After a moment, both sprinted with open road in front of them, and Petacchi came across the line first by a matter of millimeters. Cavendish was visibly upset, shouting and gesticulating at Petacchi after they crossed the finish line. Cavendish later explained that his frustration was not directed at Petacchi, but at race officials, since he felt he would be relegated if he had sprinted in a similar manner. However, he also said that he never had the intention of appealing the result. His sporting director Valerio Piva also took that stance, stating that Petacchi's sprint was [...] "not really fair play." [...] The next day, Cavendish made a point of apologizing to Petacchi via Twitter for his outburst after crossing the finish line. Cavendish then rode as race leader on stage 3, the day Wouter Weylandt died, finishing well back after repeated mechanical trouble. Sivtsov, Pinotti, and Lewis remained highly placed overall, staying so after the <b>neutralized</b> fourth <b>stage</b> had no effect on any of the race's standings.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of mobile data and the u se of smart phones are making {{unprecedented}} challe nges for wireless service providers to overcomea g lobal bandwidth shortage. Millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) technology is widely considered {{as one of the}} ke y technologies that will continue to serve the con sumer demand for increased wireless data capacity. ¨Meanwhile, the advanced CMOS can now well operate ¨in mm-Wave bands, permitting the integration of a ¨full transceiver in a low-cost, high-yield techno logy. However, the design of a mm-Wave¨ transceiver in advanced CMOS still poses many chal lenges at device, circuit and architecture levels. ¨In addition to generic difficulties, such as high -frequency operation and low active gain, mm-Wave¨ designers must deal with issues like low breakdown¨voltage, high interconnect loss, unwanted mutual¨ coupling, poor device matching, inaccurate PDK hig h-frequency models, strict design rules, long EM-s imulation time, etc. At transmitter side, all thes e critical issues limit the output power and effic iency, prolong the design time and make it difficu lt to guarantee the success of tape-out. This doctoral work focuses on realizing compact¨ CMOS mm-Wave transmitters (TXs) and power amplifie rs (PAs) towards more output power, higher efficie ncy and broader bandwidth. To address design chall enges at mm-Wave, novel design techniques have bee n proposed in this thesis, such as optimal transis tor layout, enhanced amplifier stage and broadband ¨power combiner. Design methodologies will be pres ented to deal with the long EM-simulation time and ¨strict design rules. In addition, detailed design ¨issues, such ascommon-mode stability and magnetic ¨mutual coupling, will also be covered in the thes is. All the proposed design techniques will be app lied to five prior-art designs that are implemente d and measured {{in the context of this}} doctoral wor k. These designs include (1) a 60 -GHz outphasing T X which is the first application and implementatio n of outphasing techniqueat mm-Wave; (2) a 60 -GHz¨ dual-mode Class AB PA which is the first dual-mode ¨PA presented at 60 GHz and achieves a recorded PAE of 30 %; (3) an E-band direct-conversion TX that ¨shows measured 4. 5 -Gb/s 64 -QAM and 14 -Gb/s 16 -QAM; (4) a broadband 4 -way E-band PA which is the fir st reported silicon-based PA achieving uniform gai n, output power and PAE across complete E-band and ¨(5) a 4 -way E-band PA based on neutralized bootst rappedamplifier topology that shows highest report ed power gain per stage.
