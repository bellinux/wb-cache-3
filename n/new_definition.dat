5|$|The {{definition}} of the kilogram is undergoing a fundamental change—the current definition defines the kilogram as being {{the mass of the}} international prototype kilogram which is an artefact, not a constant of nature while the <b>new</b> <b>definition</b> relates it to the equivalent energy of a photon via the Planck constant.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are seeing}} far greater {{variability}} in the prototypes than previously believed. The increasing divergence in the masses of the world's prototypes and the short-term instability in the IPK has prompted research into improved methods to obtain a smooth surface finish using diamond turning on newly manufactured replicas and has intensified {{the search for a}} <b>new</b> <b>definition</b> of the kilogram.

5|$|MSE {{provides}} real-time protection, constantly monitoring {{activities on}} the computer and scanning new files as they are downloaded or created. It disables detected threats and prompts for user input {{on how to deal}} with them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the <b>new</b> <b>definition</b> is downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E

5|$|More recently, a 2007 {{analysis}} by paleontologist William G. Parker {{resulted in a}} larger tree of aetosaur phylogenetics with the inclusion of Heliocanthus. Based on the tree, Parker defined the clades Typothoracisinae and Paratypothoracisini, both within Aetosaurinae. Parker also gave a revised phylogenetic definition of Aetosauria, mentioning that the previous definition, made by Heckert and Lucas in 2000, was somewhat ambiguous. Heckert & Lucas (2000) defined Aetosauria as a stem-based taxon, claiming that Aetosauria included all crurotarsans that were {{more closely related to}} Desmatosuchus than to the immediate sister group of Aetosauria. Because the immediate sister group of Aetosauria was uncertain, Parker offered a <b>new</b> <b>definition</b> with several non-aetosaur crurotarsan genera rather than one sister group. According to Parker, Aetosauria included all taxa more closely related to Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus than to Leptosuchus, Postosuchus, Prestosuchus, Poposaurus, Sphenosuchus, Alligator, Gracilisuchus, and Revueltosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{commonly}} understood Tyrannosauroidea {{to include}} the tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors. With the advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology, however, the clade has received several more explicit definitions. The first was by Paul Sereno in 1998, where Tyrannosauroidea {{was defined as a}} stem-based taxon including all species sharing a more recent common ancestor with Tyrannosaurus rex than with neornithean birds. To make the family more exclusive, Thomas Holtz redefined it in 2004 to include all species more closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex than to Ornithomimus velox, Deinonychus antirrhopus or Allosaurus fragilis. Sereno published a <b>new</b> <b>definition</b> in 2005, using Ornithomimus edmontonicus, Velociraptor mongoliensis and Troodon formosus as external specifiers. The Sereno definition was adopted in a 2010 review.|$|E
5|$|Each route was {{extended}} to Sacramento in 1933 over the aforementioned county highways, taking Route 50 southeast from Rumsey to Woodland near Cache Creek and then alongside the Sacramento River to the I Street Bridge, and Route 54 west from the county line to Route 11 just outside Sacramento. The entirety of both routes, from SR 20 near Wilbur Springs through Sacramento to State Route 49 just north of Drytown (and initially overlapping SR 49 to Jackson), {{was included in the}} initial state sign route system in 1934 as Sign Route 16. Through downtown Sacramento, SR 16 followed U.S. 40 (Legislative Route 6) and U.S. 50 (Legislative Route 11), mostly on Capitol Avenue, while Legislative Route 50 continued south on 5th Street (later a one-way pair of 3rd and 5th Streets) and turned east on Broadway, carrying Sign Route 24 most of the way to Freeport Boulevard. In the 1964 renumbering, Route 16 became the new legislative designation, and Sign Route 24 through Sacramento was replaced with State Route 99 and State Route 160. As neither of these used what had been Sign Route 24 along 3rd and 5th Streets and Broadway, part of Route 16's <b>new</b> <b>definition</b> ("Route 5 near Woodland to Sacramento") was used for several years on this alignment until it became part of State Route 99 later that decade. This left the western segment of SR 16 ending at Interstate 5 near the east end of the I Street Bridge until 1984, when the Woodland-Sacramento portion, which had become redundant with the parallel Interstate 5 complete, was deleted from the legislative definition. After this, SR 16 was rerouted from the intersection with County Route E7 to continue north on a bypass of Woodland instead of east to Interstate 5.|$|E
40|$|<b>New</b> <b>definitions</b> are {{proposed}} for the concepts 'innovation' and 'organization' {{by looking at the}} concepts in terms of value and competition and using the framework of the selection system. Also, <b>new</b> <b>definitions</b> {{are proposed}} for 'importance of an innovation' and 'stylistic innovation'. Some results can be directly derived from the definitions, such as that economic entities can exist that are organizations in the perception of the individual members and groups of competing actors in the perception of others. Together the <b>new</b> <b>definitions</b> provide a foundation for a better understanding of not just the concepts themselves but also of the relationships between the type and importance of innovations and the most likely characteristics of successful innovators...|$|R

40|$|At {{any level}} of {{computer}} networks, interoperability testing generally deals with several components that communicate while trying to provide a designated service. When a component remains silent, the assigned testing verdict is generally Fail, assuming that its behavior is non-conformant. Sometimes, this silence may be anticipated given the component's specifications. In these cases, the fail verdict is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we show that ``quiescence management'' improves interoperability testing. Based on formal definitions of interoperability testing, we introduce <b>new</b> <b>definitions</b> that {{take into account the}} possible quiescence of components under test. Through several examples and scenarios, we show that these <b>new</b> <b>definitions</b> detect non-interoperability cases with higher precision. Moreover, these <b>new</b> <b>definitions</b> more clearly distinguish specification-driven quiescences from others, leading to unbiased interoperability tests with accurate verdicts...|$|R

25|$|In the United Kingdom an {{absolute}} drought currently {{defined as a}} period of at least 15 consecutive days or more where there is less than 0.2mm (0.008inches) of rainfall., although before the 1990s a drought was defined as 15 consecutive days with less than 0.25mm (0.01inches) rain on any one day. This previous definition sometimes led to confusion, as many argued that if less than 0.25mm of rain fell in 30 days, is that 2 droughts and if 0.26mm fell after 25 days, is the drought over? This led to the <b>new</b> <b>definition</b> but many believe hindsight {{is the best way}} to judge if a drought has occurred.|$|E
25|$|This new figure elongates the {{established}} timeline: The Flight of the Noldor took 5 Valian Years (~50 of our years); {{with the new}} figure this would be 'translated' into ~700 of our years.

In contrast, Tolkien described time as having flowed more slowly in Aman, such that a Valian year there would 'feel' like {{the passage of a}} single solar year in Middle-earth despite being much longer.|$|E
40|$|Bellare et al. {{provided}} <b>new</b> <b>definitions</b> {{of anonymous}} signature and several constructions {{that meet the}} <b>new</b> <b>definitions.</b> They also presented a generic method to transform any standard signature scheme into an anonymous signature scheme by commitment functionality. As there are standard signature schemes as well as commitment schemes in the standard model, their generic transform yields anonymous signature schemes in the standard model. When applying this generic transform to Waters signature scheme, some additional communication overhead are incurred since one has to commit a long bit-string which is the concatenation of a standard signature and the corresponding public key. To address this efficiency issue, we directly transform Waters signature scheme into an efficient anonymous signature scheme. We prove that our construction meets the <b>new</b> <b>definitions</b> by use of code-based games...|$|R
