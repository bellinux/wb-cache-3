Photosynthetic {{capacity}} of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica was determined in two contrasting <b>nutrient</b> <b>zones</b> along a bathymetric gradient. Photosynthetic capacity was two times higher in the relatively eutrophic zone compared to the highly oligotrophic zone. The same trend was observed in the chlorophyll a+b and tissue nitrogen content. Photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll a+b decreased with irradiance in the oligotrophic zone while increased in the eutrophic zone. Tissue nitrogen content followed the same trend in the oligotrophic zone and did not present any trend in the eutrophic zone. Overall, {{this study has shown}} the importance of large scale sampling when assessing metabolic parameters such as photosynthetic capacity where large differences have been observed associated to the nutrient regime. According to our results, in oligotrophic zones nitrogen seems to govern photosynthetic capacity and there is a coherent pattern between nitrogen content, pigments and photosynthetic capacities. In eutrophic zones, light is the dominant regulator and there is a coherent pattern between light and photosynthetic capacities.

We tested {{the hypothesis that}} interactions between <b>nutrient</b> accumulation <b>zones</b> due to exudation by different roots can lead to intra-plant inter-root facilitation. Methods: We used the PARIS model (Raynaud et al. 2008) to simulate phosphorus uptake by a population of roots {{that are able to}} increase phosphorus availability by exuding citrate. We carried out several simulations with the same parameters but with increasing root density in order to study out if changes in root densities would alter nutrient uptake per unit root. Results: Emerging relationships between root uptake efficiency and root length density indicated cases of inter-root competition or facilitation. The sizes of the accumulation and depletion zones were calculated to explain these results. Our simulations showed a continuum between cases of inter-root competition and facilitation. Facilitation occurred at low exudation rates, when phosphorus supply was not saturated within the phosphorus depletion zone surrounding roots. Low exudation systems led to a lower phosphorus uptake per unit root length, but minimized phosphorus losses in the process. Conclusions: Based on our model, we derived conditions that allowed predicting whether competition, facilitation or no interaction, is the dominant interaction between roots within a root system, based on the different distances to which an isolated root alters P concentration and supply...|$|R

Further to this Canterbury has also created water management zones where zone committees collaboratively arrive at nutrient rules specific to their zone.

30|$|Water is a {{key factor}} of plant growth, {{especially}} for the arid mining area where water loss is serious. Mycorrhiza can enhance nutrient acquisition and water absorption of host plants by extending hyphae beyond the <b>nutrient</b> depletion <b>zone</b> of roots (Wu et al. 2015). Through the development of hyphae network from mycorrhizal roots into the surrounding soil, hyphae directly enmesh soil particles. Besides AMF could release glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) into soils, which could improve soil structure and improve water retention of rhizosphere (Bedini et al. 2009; Matthiasc et al. 2010). In this study, rhizosphere soil moisture content increase than control, {{probably due to the}} increase of soil organic matter and soil water holding capacity. After mycorrhizal inoculation, plant rhizosphere environment has also changed soil pH value and conductivity changed after mycorrhizal inoculation for 1  year, which {{may be due to the}} secretion caused a certain effect on rhizosphere soil biochemical reaction after mycorrhizal inoculation. Meanwhile, the content of available P for different inoculation treatments showed higher than that of non-inoculated treatment, which may be the result of higher soil acid phosphatase activities, which could promote the transformation of soil insoluble phosphorus into plant available phosphorus.|$|R

The bacterioplankton was composed predominantly of Alphaproteobacteria (PB), comprising SAR 11, Roseobacter spp. and SAR 116 groups, followed by Sphingobacteria/Flavobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, including SAR 86.

40|$|Bioremediation of {{aromatic}} pollutants {{using the}} ligninolytic enzymes {{of the white}} rot fungi has been thoroughly researched and {{has been shown to}} have considerable potential for industrial application. However, little success in scale-up and industrialisation of this technology has been attained due to problems associated with the continuous production of the pollutant-degrading enzymes using conventional bioreactor systems. The low productivities reported result from the incompatibility of conventional submerged culture reactor techniques with the physiological requirements of these fungi which have evolved on a solid-air interface, viz. wood. The enzymes are also produced only during the stationary phase of growth and can therefore be regarded as secondary metabolites. This study reports the conceptualisation, characterisation and evaluation of a novel bioreactor system as a solution to the continuous production of idiophasic pollutant degrading enzymes by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chlysosporium. The reactor concept evolved from observation of these fungi in their native state, i. e. the metabolism of lignocellulosic material and involves the immobilisation of the organism onto a capillary ultrafiltration membrane. Nutrient gradients established across the biofilm, an inherent characteristic of fixed bed perfusion reactors, are exploited to provide both nutrient rich and <b>nutrient</b> poor <b>zones</b> across the biofilm. This allows growth or primary metabolism in the <b>nutrient</b> rich <b>zone,</b> pushing older biomass into the <b>nutrient</b> poor <b>zone</b> where secondary metabolism is induced by nutrient starvation. In effect, this represents a transformation of the events of a batch culture from a temporal to a spatial domain, allowing continuous production of secondary metabolites over time. Direct contact of the outer part of the biofilm with an air stream simulated the solid-air interface of the native state of the fungus. In order to facilitate the practical application of the membrane gradostat reactor (MGR) concept, conventional capillary membranes and membrane bioreactor modules were first evaluated. These were found to be unsuitable for application of the MGR concept. However, critical analysis of the shortcomings of the conventional systems resulted in the formulation of a set of design criteria {{for the development of a}} suitable membrane and module. These design criteria were satisfied by the development of a novel capillary membrane for membrane bioreactors, as well as a transverse flow membrane module, which is a novel approach in membrane bioreactor configuration. For the physiological characterisation of the MGR concept, a single fibre bioreactor unit was designed, which allowed destructive sampling of the biofilm for analysis. Using this system, it was shown that distinct morphological zones could be observed radially across the mature biofilm obtained through MGR operation. That these morphotypes do represent the temporal events of a typical batch culture in a spatial domain was confirmed by following the morphological changes occurring during batch culture of the immobilised fungus where the onset of primary and secondary metabolic conditions were manipulated through control of the nutrient supply. The different morphotypes were correlated to distinct growth phases by comparison of the morphology to the secretion of known enzymatic markers for secondary metabolism, viz. succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome C oxidoreductase. Detailed structure-function analysis of the biofilm using transmission electron microscopy and adapted enzyme cytochemical staining techniques showed that the biofilm appeared to operate as a co-ordinated unit, with primary and secondary metabolism apparently linked in one thallus through nutrient translocation. This study provided new insights into the physiology of P. chrysosp,o rium and a detailed descriptive model was formulated which correlates well to existing models of wood degradation by the white rot fungi (WRF). Evaluation of the process on a laboratory scale using a novel transverse flow membrane bioreactor showed that a volumetric productivity of 1916 U. L. ⁻¹day⁻¹ for manganese peroxidase, one of the pollutant degrading enzymes, could be attained, corresponding to a final concentration of 2 361 U. L. ⁻¹ This may be compared to the best reported system (Moreira el at. 1997), where a volumetric productivity of 202 U. L. ⁻¹day⁻¹was achieved with a final concentration of 250 U. L. ⁻¹ However, MGR productivity is yet to be subjected to rigorous optimisation studies. The process could be operated continuously for 60 days. However, peak productivity could not be maintained for long periods. This was found to be due to physical phenomena relating to the fluid dynamics of the system which caused fluid flow maldistribution, which would have to be resolved through engineering analysis. In evaluation of the MGR concept for aromatic pollutant removal, in this case ρ- cresol, from growth medium, good performance was also achieved. The VmaxKm calculated by linear regression for the MGR was 0. 8 (R² = 0. 93), which compared favourably to that reported by Lewandowski et al. (1990), who obtained a Vmax/Km of 0. 34 for a packed bed reactor treating chlorophenol. It was concluded that the MGR showed suitable potential to warrant further development, and that the descriptive characterisation of the biofilm physiology provided a sufficient basis for process analysis once engineering aspects ofthe system could be resolved. ...|$|R
30|$|Grain yield {{among various}} {{treatments}} {{was related to}} their photosynthetic activity and the soil conditions. Though plants were more responsive to N fertilizer applications, deficiency in soil P limited the efficient use of applied N by the plants. Owing to the spatial variability in soil nutrients in the area, site-specific recommendation of fertilizer application is suggested for efficient fertilizer use. Though the cultivars were different, they reacted similarly to N and P inorganic fertilizer application. The Obatanpa maize cultivar, however, was more responsive to inorganic fertilizer by producing higher grain yield than Dorke.

5000|$|Littoral {{zones are}} at {{particular}} risk for two reasons. First, human settlement is often attracted to shorelines, and settlement often disrupts breeding habitats for littoral zone species. For example, many turtles are killed on roads {{when they leave}} the water to lay their eggs in upland sites. Fish can be negatively affected by docks and retaining walls which remove breeding habitat in shallow water. Some shoreline communities even deliberately try to remove wetlands since they may interfere with activities like swimming. Overall, the presence of human settlement has a demonstrated negative impact upon adjoining wetlands. An equally serious problem is the tendency to stabilize lake or river levels with dams. Dams removed the spring flood which carries <b>nutrients</b> into littoral <b>zones,</b> and reduces the natural fluctuation of water levels upon which many wetland plants and animals depend.

The <b>nutrient</b> poor <b>zone</b> in the road verges should be maximalized with mosaics of low vegetations. This should be done by fine scale and phased management. If large scale management is necessary, like the removal of most vegetation or the top soil, vegetation refugia should be left intact, from which ants can spread again. The habitat around red wood ant nests should always be left intact.

5000|$|The root of this {{approach}} to a global organisation of the biological seascape is by construction of a typology for seasonal cycles of pelagic production and consumption.

However, the accumulation or loss of phytoplankton biomass is influenced by secondary processes, such as variation {{in the size of the}} herbivore population at the start of the bloom.

It is {{one of thousands of}} different photosynthetic plankton that freely drift in the euphotic zone of the ocean, forming the basis of virtually all marine food webs. It is studied for the extensive blooms it forms in nutrient-depleted waters after the reformation of the summer thermocline. Like other coccolithophores, E. huxleyi is a single-celled phytoplankton covered with uniquely ornamented calcite disks called coccoliths (also informally known as liths or scales). Individual coccoliths are abundant in marine sediments although complete coccospheres are more unusual. In the case of E. huxleyi, not only the shell, but also the soft part of the organism may be recorded in sediments. It produces a group of chemical compounds that are very resistant to decomposition. These chemical compounds, known as alkenones, can be found in marine sediments long after other soft parts of the organisms have decomposed. Alkenones are most commonly used by earth scientists as a means to estimate past sea surface temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Managing {{riparian}} buffer zones is {{a potentially}} important approach to protecting streams from agricultural pollution. This {{study was conducted}} to determine if a pasture, a hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x deltoides) stand, or a native oak (Quercus garryana) forest, had the greatest potential to serve as a <b>nutrient</b> buffer <b>zone.</b> The effects of fertilizer treatments and vegetation type on denitrification and vegetative uptake were investigated in the Willamette Valley riparian area of Oak Creek, near Corvallis, Oregon. Field and potential denitrification rates measured in the pasture and poplar stand were between 2 and 83 times greater than in the native forest. Two possible explanations exist: (1) lack of a readily degradable C source may be limiting denitrification in the organic C rich native forest plots, or (2) denitrifying microbial populations may be smaller in the native forest {{due to a lack of}} soil NO. While field denitrification rates peaked in the winter and were at a minimum in the summer, denitrification potentials, a reflection of the site's accumulative in situ denitrification over time, were greatest in the fall, suggesting that more favorable conditions for actual denitrification may occur during this season. Vegetative uptake of N (as measured by litterfall N) was greatest in the native oak forest, with values 1. 5 and 2 times greater than poplar and pasture sites, respectively, and primarily occurred from early spring through summer To optimize nutrient removal rates, vegetation in riparian buffer zones should be able to take up entering excess nutrients as well as provide a readily degradable C source for denitrifying microorganisms. Because the native oak forest took up more N and the pasture and poplar sites denitrified more N, an integrated riparian buffer area with all three vegetation types may serve as the best riparian nutrient removal solution. In areas devoid of native forest, establishment of a poplar plantation can provide for significant uptake and good denitrification potential in a relatively short time...|$|R

Macroalgae and turfs were removed from half of the zone (zone M, "modified") {{and the other half}} was left as control (zone C). In December 1994, despite similar salinity and <b>nutrient</b> concentrations in <b>zones</b> M and C (0. 70 ~ 0. 04 ~ DIN, 0. 110 ~ 0. 006 ~ DIP on average), rnacroalgae and turfs had not recovered in zone M (10 % and 14 % cv respectively) compared to zone C (42 % and 35 % cv), whereas crustose algal coverage and urchin densities were far higher in zone M than in C (M: 23 % cv and 37 ind/m 2; C: 2 % cv and 8 ind/m 2). Our experiment suggested that the removal of whole fleshy algae induced the formation of a new algal community controlled by herbivorous organisms, specially sea urchins.

Surface seawater samples filter-fractionated into 0. 8 μm particulate and 0. 2 m planktonic fractions were investigated with different molecular techniques. The abundance of particle-associated Flavobacteria, ascertained with real-time PCR and DGGE band analysis using Flavobacteria-specific primers, {{was found to be}} significantly higher in Polar Front Zone (PFZ) and Antarctic Zone (AZ) water samples than in <b>nutrient</b> limited Temperate <b>Zone</b> (TZ) and Sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ) waters. Abundance of particle-associated Flavobacteria correlated positively with seawater chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations, suggesting that increased Flavobacteria abundance may relate to enhanced primary production in the PFZ and AZ. This is supported by comparison of DGGE profiles that demonstrated significant differences in the total Flavobacteria community structure and 16 S rRNA gene diversity between samples from the PFZ and AZ and those from TZ and SAZ. Sequence analysis revealed a broad diversity amongst class Flavobacteria in the Southern Ocean with several Flavobacteria clades detected in PFZ and AZ waters not detected in TZ and SAZ waters that putatively represent psychrophilic taxa. Sequence data included a large, so far uncultivated, cosmopolitan phylogenetic clade ("DE cluster 2 ") that is distributed throughout the Southern Ocean...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Drip {{fertigation}} {{provides an}} efficient method of fertilizer delivery and if properly managed and can reduce overall fertilizer application rates and minimizes the adverse environmental impact on crop production. The availability of <b>nutrients</b> at root <b>zone</b> of the crops influences the uptake and yield of the crop. The nitrogen availability steadily increased with increased depth upto 30 cm after that declined {{in all the}} distances. The highest available phosphorus in soil was confined to 0 - 15 cm of soil layer under all fertigation levels. The available phosphorous decreased with increase in distance and soil depth. With regards to potassium, soil K content was significantly higher in the surface soil than in the subsoil, this {{might be due to}} majority of applied K was held in the surface soil and the downward movement was slow. Among the different treatments, drip fertigation with 100 % RDF in which 50 % P and K as WSF increased the maize grain yield to the tune of 15. 5 % as compared to drip fertigation of 100 % RDF with normal fertilizer. The increase in yield under 100 % RDF with P and K as WSF might be {{due to the fact that}} fertigation with more readily available form obviously resulted in higher availability of all the three (NPK) major nutrients in the soil solution which led to higher uptake and better translocation of assimilates from source to sink thus in turn increased the yield...|$|R
40|$|In {{the coming}} years, more {{sustainable}} horticultural practices {{should be developed}} to guarantee greater yield and yield stability, {{in order to meet}} the increasing food global demand. An environmentally-friendly way to achieve the former objectives is represented by the biostimulant functions displayed by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF support plant nutrition by absorbing and translocating mineral <b>nutrients</b> beyond depletion <b>zones</b> of plant rhizosphere (biofertilisers) and induce changes in secondary metabolism leading to improved nutraceutical compounds. In addition, AMF interfere with the phytohormone balance of host plant, thereby influencing plant development (bioregulators) and inducing tolerance to soil and environmental stresses (bioprotector). Maximum benefits from AMF activity will be achieved by adopting beneficial farming practices (e. g. reduction of chemical fertilisers and biocides), by inoculating efficient AMF strains and also by the appropriate selection of plant host/fungus combinations. This review gives an up to date overview of the recent advances in the production of quality AMF inocula and in the biostimulant properties of AMF on plant health, nutrition and quality of horticultural crops (fruit trees, vegetables, flower crops and ornamentals). The agronomical, physiological and biochemical processes conferring tolerance to drought, salinity, nutrient deficiency, heavy metal contaminations and adverse soil pH in mycorrhizal plants are encompassed. In addition, the influence of bacterial interactions and farm management on AMF is discussed. Finally, the review identifies several future researche areas relevant to AMF to exploit and improve the biostimulant effects of AMF in horticultur...|$|R
40|$|A {{study to}} assess the {{contribution}} of impala (Aepyceros melampus) to nutrient cycling was conducted in Mukuvisi woodland, a Nature reserve in Harare. The {{aim of this study}} was {{to assess the}} contribution of impala faecal pellets to nutrient cycle of Mukuvisi Woodland. In this study stratified random sampling method was used to assess decomposition rate of impala faecal pellets in two seasons (summer and winter), and also to determine the amount of soil nutrients contributed by impala faecal pellets into the <b>nutrient</b> cycle. Two <b>zones</b> were sampled and these zones were selected according to soil type, 10 samples were selected in each zone. The mean decomposition rates showed that there was high decomposition rate in sand zone than in the gravel zone. Also overally soil nutrient content was observed to be high in the sand zone than in the gravel zone. This showed that impala faecal pellets contribute to soil nutrients. The t-test results indicated that soil type significantly influences (p< 0. 05) rate of impala pellet decomposition. Thus the hypothesis that soil type does not influence impala faecal pellet decomposition rate was rejected in favour of the hypothesis that soil type influences decomposition rate. This research recommends that Mukuvisi Woodlands staff and National Parks Authorities should further studies focusing on the influence of animal wastes of various species on soil nutrient within the woodland so that they know which animal species to keep in order to enhance soil nutrient content since itâ€™s a small woodland...|$|R
40|$|It is {{customary}} that growers apply {{high doses}} of nutrients to the soil {{in order to achieve}} high yields, with detrimental consequences for the environment; but no information exists with regards to the crop response to high fertilization levels. To evaluate the physiological response of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) to various root <b>zone</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations (expressed as electrical conductivity, from 0. 6 to 10 dS m- 1), a replicated experiment was conducted using increasing concentrations of macronutrients applied to the root zone in an aeroponic system. Leaf photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer attached with a fluorometer. Leaf nutrient content was analyzed by mass spectrometry and NO 3 -N was determined by flow injection analysis. Leaf photosynthetic rates increased when the solution concentration was raised from 0. 6 to 4. 8 dS m- 1, but further increases in solution concentration did not result in any differences. The enhancement in photosynthetic rates was related to higher concentrations of N, P, Mg, and S in leaves. Leaf K content was correlated with stomatal conductance. Maximum growth was achieved with solution concentrations between 1. 2 and 4. 8 dS m- 1 while at 10. 0 dS m- 1 leaf production was reduced by 30 %. It is concluded that at high concentration of nutrients supplied in the root zone, yield reduces because of a combination of decreased stomatal conductance and leaf area...|$|R

Nearly 79 % of sorghum, 60 % of cotton, 45 % of pigeonpea and 41 % of groundnut are grown in these soils. Because of their high water holding capacity these soils were considered productive and were under cultivation since hundreds of years. Most of these soils are low in nitrogen and to a Jesser extent deficient in phosphorus. Zinc is also becoming important in these soils. It has been shown both on farmers' fields {{as well as on}} research stations that most of the crops significantly respond to applied N However, only cash crops like cotton, chillies, tobacco or irrigated crops like rice and sugarcane are well fertilised in these soils. Staple food crops like sorghum or millet hardly receive 18 kg/ha of nutrients. In order to achieve improved and sustained productivity a balanced nutrient management is a must. We suggest that after demarketing different agroclimatic zones in the Vertisol area, we have to calculate the nutrient requirement of suitable crops for these <b>zones.</b> <b>Nutrient</b> supplying capacity of these zones is estimated either through soil tests or using GIS and modelling approach. After taking into account the farm available nutrient sources, fertilizer application can be made to achieve balanced nutrient supply.

The post-ischemic {{recovery of the}} CSER was followed an additional 60 min in 19 of these animals divided into 2 groups. Ten dogs were subjected to glass-wool filtration of their blood by extracorporeal shunting from femoral artery to femoral vein for one hr prior to infusing air. Nine dogs did not receive glass-wool filtration. Post-ischemic recovery of CSER amplitude, a quantifiable electrophysiologic index of neuronal function, was significantly greater in the filtered group than in the non-filtered group. "C-antipyrine autoradiographic blood flow studies were performed in 3 dogs. One was studied {{at the end of}} a 60 min ischemic CSER suppression period and showed severe flow disruption by air embolism. Two dogs, one from each group, were studied at the conclusion of the 60 min recovery period. In the filtered animal, cortical blood flow exceeded the threshold for CSER maintenance while cortical flow rates in the unfiltered animal fell below this threshold. The enhanced post-ischemic neuronal recovery in the filtered group as indicated by the CSER is attributed to the preservation of injury <b>zone</b> <b>nutrient</b> blood flow that is supported by collateral circulation.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of how environmental changes affect organic matter fluxes in Arctic marine ecosystems is sorely needed. Here we combine mooring times series, ship-based measurements and remote sensing to assess the variability and forcing factors of vertical fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) across the Mackenzie Shelf in 2009. We developed a geospatial model of these fluxes to proceed to an integrative analysis of their determinants in summer. Flux data were obtained with sediment traps moored around 125 m and via a regional empirical algorithm applied to particle size distributions (17 classes from 0. 08 – 4. 2 mm) measured by an Underwater Vision Profiler 5. The low fractal dimension (i. e., porous, fluffy particles) derived from the algorithm (1. 26 ± 0. 34) and the dominance (~ 77 %) of rapidly sinking small aggregates (p r 2 cum. = 0. 37). Bacteria were correlated with small aggregates, while northeasterly wind was associated with large size classes (> 1 mm ESD), but these two factors were weakly related with each other. Copepod biomass was overall negatively correlated (p < 0. 05) with vertical POC fluxes, implying that metazoans acted as regulators of export fluxes, even if their role was minor given that our study spanned the onset of diapause. Our results demonstrate that on interior Arctic shelves where productivity is low in mid-summer, localized upwelling <b>zones</b> (<b>nutrient</b> enrichment) may result in the formation of large filamentous phytoaggregates that are not substantially retained by copepod and bacterial communities...|$|R
