50|$|As {{the mold}} disk is turning, the first {{elevator}} simultaneously rises to its upper {{position and the}} space bands and matrices are vertically aligned {{in preparation for the}} second transfer. The matrices have a series of teeth in a V-shaped notch on top, and as the transfer is completed, the matrices slide onto the second elevator bar which carries the matrices by these V-shaped notches. The space bands, having no such notches, remain in the second transfer channel and are soon gathered by two levers and pushed back into the space band box. While the space bands are being pushed into their box, the second elevator continues rising towards the distributing mechanism {{at the top of the}} machine, which returns the molds to their proper places in the magazine. At the top of the machine, a lever (the distributor shifter) moves left to get in position to push the incoming line of matrices off the second elevator and into the distributor box. This mechanism feeds the matrices at precise intervals such that they travel between three rotating screws. Each matrix is carried along a <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> between the three screws until the notches on the bar and matrix match, whereupon the matrix drops down into its proper channel in the magazine.|$|E

The effect of notch radius, r, and notch depth, d, on fracture mode of E 50 solder was studied. The experimental results demonstrate that cracks initiate {{at the center of}} notch section and the <b>notched</b> <b>bars</b> fracture at the notch section at low temperature. The fracture mode is cleavage fracture and the fracture sections are coarse. Specimens with a sharper notch radius (a smaller r) and a larger notch depth (a smaller d) show poor ductility, but high fracture strength. The stress-strain curve of E 50 solder tested on standard specimen at low temperature (- 47 °C~- 43 °C) exhibits the character of yielding, hardening and necking.

40|$|The {{state of}} stress {{in the core of}} a <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> is {{analysed}} at the moment when pronounced plastic yielding begins. The theory is two-dimensional and an ideal plastic-rigid material is assumed. Following a general analysis of the problem, the magnitude of the constraint factor is calculated for a deep notch with a semi-circular root. The correct approach to problems of plane plastic strain is discussed, and is further illustrated by a re-examination of the classical work of Frandtl on indentation (which is closely related in principle with the <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> problem). 1. General considerations THE paper is concerned with the {{state of stress}} in the core of a <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> under an applied load sufficient to cause plastic flow. It is known that the fairly well-defined bend in the load-extension relation for a <b>notched</b> <b>bar</b> corresponds to a mean stress in the core that is greater than the yield stress in a tensile test of an unnotched specimen. The " investiga-tion will be directed particularly to a calculation of the magnitude of this effect in relation to the shape of the notch. The problem will be treated as one of plane strain, so that the specimen is a wide rectangular block, symmetrically notched through the thickness on two sides. The notch is shown in Fig. 1, the plane of the paper representing a plane of flow. Let it be supposed that the applied load at the ends of the specimen is statically equivalent to a tension along the central longitudinal axis. It is also supposed that a distribution of stress, suitable to ensure plane strain, is applied to the two lateral surfaces of the block which are parallel to the planes of flow. The specimen is assumed so long that the state of stress in the neighbourhood of the notch is, to any desired approximation, independent of the precise distribution of the end load. It is further assumed that the notch is of sufficient depth to ensure that the plastic region is localized in and around the core (this will be discussed more carefully later). If the curvature of the notch is greatest at the root, the yield limit is first attained at that point. As the applied end-load is further increased, the plastic region can be expected to spread in thn manner shown i...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} two {{specific}} subjects {{related to the}} fatigue strength and life of <b>notched</b> <b>bars</b> under combined torsional and axial loading. The first subject is the fatigue thresholds of materials with small defects. The fatigue threshold of materials with small defects or sharp notches is not controlled by the initiation of fatigue cracks, but by their propagation. The R-curve method is very useful to predict the fatigue thresholds of notched components. Small cracks nucleated at the notch root becomes nonpropagating when the applied stress intensity factor drops below {{the resistance of the}} material. It is important that the R curve is independent of loading conditions and only the applied stress intensity factor depends on loading conditions. In the present paper, the R-curve method was successfully applied to predict the fatigue thresholds of holed tubes made of carbon steels under in-phase and outof-phase combinations of cyclic torsion and axial loading. The second subject is an anomalous phenomenon of notch strengthening found in torsional fatigue of circumferentially <b>notched</b> round <b>bars</b> of austenitic stainless steel. In torsional fatigue of circumferentially <b>notched</b> <b>bars</b> of austenitic stainless steel, the fatigue life of <b>notched</b> <b>bars</b> was found to be longer than that of smooth bars and to increase with increasing stress concentration under the same amplitude of the nominal torsional stress. On the basis of the electrical potential monitoring of the initiation and propagation of small cracks at the notch root, the crack initiation life decreased with increasing stress concentration, while the crack propagation life increased. The anomalous behavior of the notch-strengthening effect was ascribed to the larger retardation of fatigue crack propagation by crack surface contact for the cases of sharper notches. The superposition of static tension reduced the retardation due to the smaller amount of crack surface contact, which gave rise well-known notch-weakening of the fatigue strength. The crack initiation life is controlled not by the peak strain amplitude at the notch root, but by the strain amplitude about 0. 1 mm distant from the notch root where the strain distribution was calculated by the elasticplastic finite element method using cyclic stress-strain relation. The propagation rate of cracks can be predicted using the J-integral range when the static tension is superposed on cyclic torsion. The shielding by crack face sliding contact greatly reduced the crack propagation rate under cyclic torsion without static tension...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} low-cycle fatigue {{behaviour}} of CMS- 4. The {{focus is on}} R= 0 load controlled fatigue, {{with an emphasis on}} deformation at 750 °C. A particular aim of this research is to identify how fatigue proceeds at stress concentrators. Here, high stresses in plain bars have been compared with similar maximum stresses around the known stress concentration of a Kt- 2 notch. Fatigue tests were conducted on both plain and notched specimens, across a range of stresses and temperatures, and the deformation has been imaged using TEM. The plain bars show a range of deformation mechanisms, which have been described and analysed. Of particular interest is the presence of widely spaced dipoles of single dislocations, previously noted in tensile studies. These have been imaged on slip planes, and it is shown that they are not formed by the mutual attraction of two independent dislocations, as has been previously thought. Rather, they are two sides of an á 110 ñ loop, separated by a region of APB. These loops are expected to expand and contract within the precipitates, and it is shown that this could account for a significant degree of plastic strain within the plain bars. Although the fracture patterns and lifetimes are very similar to those seen in the plain bars, no microstructural evidence of significant deformation is seen from TEM examination of the <b>notched</b> <b>bars.</b> Visible dislocation density is consistently extremely low, and it is seen that there is no correlation between deformation in the bulk of the plain <b>bars,</b> the <b>notched</b> <b>bars,</b> and failure. Hence, a new mechanism of initiation is proposed for failure below 950 °C. It is proposed that initiation below 950 °C is related to the extrusion of g channels at the surface of internal porosity, and the concomitant formation of subsurface voids.
