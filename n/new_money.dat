5|$|The National Assembly for Wales {{announced}} on 6 November 2007 {{that it was}} {{to pay off the}} outstanding loan of £13.5million from HSBC and also increase the annual funding. From April 2008, the National Assembly for Wales have given a grant to the Wales Millennium Centre with £3.5million per annum for 3 years. This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the Centre remains profitable. The money used to pay the debt came from unallocated funds from the Assembly's previous budget and it was said by the Minister for Heritage, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, that the <b>new</b> <b>money</b> allocation would not {{come at the expense of}} other art projects from other parts of Wales.|$|E
5|$|The writer Ratazyayev, who {{jokes about}} using Devushkin as a {{character}} {{in one of his}} stories offends him, but genuinely seems to like him. Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement they seem to be destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her <b>new</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, <b>new</b> <b>money</b> that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of <b>new</b> <b>money</b> enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E

25|$|Often, {{instead of}} declaring insolvency, the company negotiates a debt {{restructuring}} with its lenders.

25|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} {{the spread of}} {{videocassette}} recorders {{and the arrival of}} private TV channels such as RTL Television provided new competition for theatrical film distribution.

Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; pathos depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and family honour; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry. The story revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families—the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing <b>new</b> <b>money</b> and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.|$|E
