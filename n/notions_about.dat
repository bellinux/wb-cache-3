5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{developed}} {{the concept of}} jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series. He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to dispel preconceived <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> ninja popularized by other manga and to bring an original take to the presentation of ninja in manga. The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games. The hand seals are based upon the characters of the Chinese zodiac, which is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and Kishimoto used them specifically to draw upon that tradition.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{effect of the}} war was a psychological one. The heavy losses deeply affected many directly, and war memorials were built all over the country as people sought to remember those that had been killed. However, despite the size of Australia's contribution to the fighting, there were many Australians who had had no actual experience of it. Realising this, and having witnessed the impact of the war first hand, Charles Bean, who was instrumental in editing and writing the official history of Australia's involvement in the war, advocated the need for a national memorial {{and was one of the}} main architects in establishing the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The experience of the war also perpetuated many <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> the Australian character and national identity that endure to this day. For many Australians the performance of their soldiers—particularly during the failed Gallipoli campaign—served to highlight the nation's emergence as a member of the international community, while bringing to the fore a belief in Australians' natural ability as soldiers. The attitudes of many Australians towards war itself were also greatly affected. There was a widespread revulsion at the large-scale destruction and loss of life that had occurred and a desire that it should never occur again. In many regards this led to a general complacency towards defence and military matters after the war and arguably led to the nation's lack of preparedness for the next major conflict, while it may still be evident in Australian strategic behaviour to this day.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that sexual violence is also a learnt behavior in some adults, particularly as regards child sexual abuse. Studies on sexually abused boys have shown that around one in five continue in later life to molest children themselves. Such experiences may lead to a pattern of behavior where the man regularly justifies being violent, denies doing wrong, and has false and unhealthy <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> sexuality.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a part of}} the research the goal of which was to study the <b>notion</b> <b>about</b> syntax as one of the meta-linguistic abilities that contributes to adoption of reading. Research comprised two hundred children of pre-school age, divided into two groups, balanced according to gender, intelligence and socioeconomic status. The research was conducted by an experimental method test-retest. In the initial measuring, experimental and control group were given the list comprising three kinds of experimental tasks for determining the level of development of <b>notion</b> <b>about</b> syntax, constructed by the author of the research. Experimental program consisted of tasks for stimulation of development of <b>notion</b> <b>about</b> syntax, which children practiced in the course of ten days (up to 30 minutes a day), with the help of previously trained pre-school teachers. After the ten-day training, final measuring in both groups was performed in both groups of respondents, by parallel form of tasks. The goal of the research was to determine whether it is possible to encourage the development of <b>notion</b> <b>about</b> syntax in children of pre-school age by systematic practice. The results of final measuring indicate that both in experimental and control group there have been significant improvements with respect to development of <b>notion</b> <b>about</b> syntax, and that the number of answers in which judgement was based on the semantic criterion (experience and meaning) was significantly reduced. In making judgements based on consequences (content of the sentence points to something which is a good or not a good thing to do, moral or immoral) {{there were no significant differences}} in the final compared to the initial measuring in both groups. Significant differences in retest were found in making judgements based on meaning. The mere experience with test material at pre-school age brings about the improvement of the <b>notion</b> <b>about</b> language, and practice contributes considerably to shifting the focus from the semantic to the grammatical criterion of judgement...|$|R

Aberhart's government was re-elected in the 1940 election, carrying 43% of the vote. The prosperity of the Second World War relieved the economic fears and hatreds that had fuelled farmer unrest. Aberhart died in 1943, and was succeeded as Premier by his student at the Prophetic Bible Institute and lifelong close disciple, Ernest C. Manning (1908–1996).|$|E
25|$|During Houston's first presidency, the Texas Congress {{passed laws}} opening up all Indian lands to white {{settlement}}, and overrode Houston's veto. The settlement frontier quickly moved {{north along the}} Brazos, Colorado, and Guadalupe rivers, into Comanche hunting ranges and the borders of Comancheria. Soon the Texan-Comanche relationship was turning violent. Houston made efforts to restore peace and the Comanches, alarmed at the vigor of Texan settlement, began to consider demanding a fixed boundary, contrary to their traditional <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> borders. However, Houston was forbidden by Texas law to yield any land claimed by the Republic. He still made peace with the Comanche in 1838.|$|E

For Andersen, she indicates, [...] "true" [...] nobility derived not from an individual's birth but from their sensitivity. Andersen's insistence upon sensitivity as the exclusive privilege of nobility challenges modern <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> character and social worth. The princess's sensitivity, however, may be a metaphor for her depth of feeling and compassion.|$|E

500|$|The {{growth of}} lesbian {{feminism}} in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused {{to work with}} gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> women as they saw in heterosexual men. The issues most important to gay men—entrapment and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized {{as an alternative to}} sharing gay men's issues, especially what Adrienne Rich termed [...] "the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars".

500|$|Amongst {{individual}} Australian soldiers, {{the news}} of the victory helped to dispel some of the <b>notions</b> <b>about</b> the invincibility of the Japanese soldier that had developed in the psyche of Allied soldiers following the defeats of early 1942, and which had impacted on Allied planning up to that point. Some of these notions would remain {{until the end of the}} war, but {{the news of}} Milne Bay allowed some soldiers to rationalise the Japanese soldiers' past victories as being the result of tangible factors, such as numerical superiority, that could be overcome, rather than innate factors associated with the intangible qualities of the Japanese soldier that were not so easily overcome. After this, amongst the Allies there was [...] "a sense that fortune's wheel was turning", and although leaders such as Blamey emphasised the difficulties that lay ahead, a feeling of confidence in eventual victory emerged. MacArthur warned the War Department that success was attributable to good intelligence that allowed him to concentrate a superior force at Milne Bay, and might not be repeatable.|$|E
