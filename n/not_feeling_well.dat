5|$|Chapter 5 of the Varaha Upanishad is {{dedicated}} to Yoga, as a discussion between Ribhu and his student Nidagha. There are three types of Yoga, states the text, and these are Laya (soft), Mantra (mystic), and Hatha (middle), recommending Hatha Yoga as foremost of three. It discusses various aspects of Yoga, ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities, in small portions, several times a day, to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well</b> or is very hungry. The goal of Yoga, states Varaha, is manifold, including the gain of body strength and suppleness, acquisition of knowledge of one's own body and its auras, meditation, and Self (soul) knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In Liverpool, at 8:30 am on 17 May, Saturday, {{the twins}} went into St Anne Street Police Station to report {{concerns}} over Sabina's children. At midday the pair boarded a National Express coach to London. A police report {{stated that the}} twins suddenly disembarked from the coach at Keele services, a motorway service station, as they were <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well.</b> The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed the twins clinging tightly to their bags and did not let them re-board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items. The manager of the service station was informed and, also feeling suspicious of the pair, called the police. Officers arrived {{to talk to them}} but left after deeming the women harmless.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in {{the summer}} of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe's house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked {{cashmere}} sweater and tailored skirt. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her daughter at work and told her Sutcliffe was <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well,</b> had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Robert Dollar's last public {{appearance}} {{was at the}} Commencement Exercises at the Theological Seminary.

25|$|After her husband's {{arrest on}} April 12, 1963, King {{tried to make}} direct contact with President Kennedy at the advisement of Wyatt Tee Walker, and succeeded in {{speaking}} with Robert F. Kennedy. President Kennedy was with his father Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr, who was <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well.</b> In what has been noted as making Kennedy seem less sympathetic towards the Kings, the president redirected Mrs. King's call to the White House switchboard.|$|E

Her best finish was a 15th-place tie at the LPGA Corning Classic. In the 2008 LPGA Championship, she shot an opening round 66, her career low, to tie for the lead despite <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well.</b> She shot 76 in the second round to make the cut, her only in an LPGA major, but withdrew from the tournament. After failing to regain her card at qualifying school, Bastel retired from professional golf.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{you call}} that {{practically}} the same! No, I am the one {{that will have to}} do the refusing now, and it is all off your shoulders. And you knew I was <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> very <b>well,</b> either! Basil, how could you?" ...|$|R
25|$|On 14 September 2011, {{a report}} in the {{newspaper}} Moskovsky Komsomolets, quoting a source in the aviation industry, claimed that the parking brake of the aircraft was on during the take-off, which significantly slowed it down and prevented it from accelerating properly. According to this theory, the captain had turned over control to the co-pilot before take-off, as he was <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well.</b> As it is the captain's duty to release the brake, the co-pilot may not have been aware that it had not been done, or had forgotten to do so. Another newspaper, Lifenews.ru, reported that investigators were investigating the pilots' professional history, and that the pilots did not have sufficient experience on the Yak-42.|$|E

He {{died of a heart attack}} shortly after the doctor arrived. He was survived by his father, and his wife and four daughters.

At the beach camp, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) hears Claire Littleton's baby, Aaron, crying and wakes up Claire. Claire says she is <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well,</b> so Charlie offers to take care of Aaron. James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) sees Jack, Kate, and Sayid returning.

She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well</b> when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane." ...|$|E
500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well.</b> Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E

Luckily the Super Wills Cup was going on, {{and there was a}} match between United Bank and Delhi XI. Saleem Jaffar got injured, and I got the opportunity to play that game. Imran watched me on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met me and told me that I will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify me of my selection was just out of this world." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 1977, Orbison was <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well</b> {{and decided}} to overwinter in Hawaii. While there, he checked into a {{hospital}} where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed coronary arteries. On January 18, 1978, Orbison underwent a triple coronary bypass. He had suffered from duodenal ulcers since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence. He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated {{for the remainder of}} his life. When Orbison felt strong enough to perform again, Scott Mathews took him into the recording studio and produced a version of [...] "Oh, Pretty Woman" [...] for a national radio and television advertising campaign for Tone Soap, a woman's beauty bar. This proved to be a much needed financial windfall for Orbison, as Mathews saw to it that the company paid well to license the use of Orbison's original composition and for Orbison's services.|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's mother, Janet Arvizo, {{testified that}} on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she [...] "saw Michael licking Gavin's head" [...] while he was asleep. Before she testified about it, {{she turned to the}} jury and said, [...] "please don't judge me." [...] Jackson {{allegedly}} had an arm around the boy and licked his hair [...] "over and over" [...] while everyone else on the plane was asleep. Janet said she didn't tell any one what she'd seen, and she continued to let her children stay at Neverland, and she later testified that at a point weeks after that incident, she still didn't have [...] "any concerns about Mr. Jackson at all". Star contradicted his mother when he testified that he had been awake to also witness Jackson lick Gavin's head on the plane; he didn't say anyone was asleep, just that the accuser was <b>not</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>well</b> and had leaned against Jackson's chest. Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant on that flight, said she had not seen Jackson [...] "cuddling" [...] with Arvizo during the flight, but testified that she had seen Jackson put his arm around the accuser while he was listening to music.|$|E

Prince was seen bicycling {{the next day in}} his hometown of Chanhassen. He shopped that evening at the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis for Record Store Day and made a brief appearance at an impromptu dance party at his Paisley Park recording studio complex, stating that he was feeling fine. On April 19, he attended a performance by singer Lizz Wright at the Dakota Jazz Club.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a man}} {{smoking a}} peculiarly mellow and {{unctuous}} cigar on deck when I got there. I don't believe he smoked it because he enjoyed it. He did not {{look as if he}} enjoyed it.
