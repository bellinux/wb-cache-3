It neither aims to stifle nor intimidate dissenting voices. Defendants in such cases will go through <b>normal</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>process,</b> with police as the main investigator...trials will be conducted in civilian courts, not military ones. Moreover, this order does not deprive the right of the defendants to file complaints against military officers who have abused their power." ...|$|E
50|$|A bill of {{attainder}} (also {{known as}} an act of attainder or writ of attainder or bill of pains and penalties) is an act of a legislature declaring a person or group of persons guilty of some crime and punishing them, often without a trial. As with attainder resulting from the <b>normal</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>process,</b> the effect of such a bill is to nullify the targeted person's civil rights, most notably the right to own property (and thus pass it on to heirs), the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least the original usage, the right to life itself. Bills of attainder passed in Parliament by Henry Vlll on 29 January 1542 resulted in the executions of a number of notable historical figures.|$|E
40|$|Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s {{procedures}} for the civil commitment {{of the mentally ill}} are lacking in protections for the rights of those individuals who become involved in the process and thus are constitutionally suspect. The statutes are loosely drafted and unclear as to procedural steps within the commitment proceedings. It is true that such procedures are subject to unique problems that are not readily adaptable to <b>normal</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>processes.</b> It is submitted, however, that individual liberties need not be subordinate to a workable commitment process. While medical and legal views of the process are to a certain extent conflicting, they are by no means mutually exclusive. An attempt should be made to reconcile the views in a more suitable code for the state...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{in these}} {{circumstances}} that the Government has decided that more drastic steps {{must be taken to}} protect the public from the activities of these gangs, and that since, for the reasons I have given, {{it is not possible to}} achieve that protection through the <b>normal</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>processes</b> of the Courts, these safeguards, which are adequate in ordinary times, must, in the present abnormal crime-wave, be supplemented by executive action. It is not only the duty of the Government to do this in discharge of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and good order, but I believe that there is a wide public demand that such action should be taken and that it will meet with wholehearted support from all law-abiding members of the community.|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction {{ought to}} be {{considered}} as a unit, ” 1 then the politics of Reconstruction began the moment that Abraham Lincoln and other Northern leaders chose war over the Lower South’s secession. WAR, POLITICS, AND PEACE Lincoln’s delusion that the South was full of Unionists loyal to the government over which he presided emboldened him to call for volunteers to suppress “combinations ” too numerous to be dealt with by <b>normal</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>processes.</b> His call precipitated most of the Upper South into secession, and Kentucky proclaimed its neutrality if war should break out between the two federations. Only swift federal coercion held Maryland, along with parts of Kentucky and Missouri, for the Union. Many in the North were hesitant to risk war, especially when they could not find a Constitutional power whereby the general government could coerce whole states. For a time, Northern Democrats even discussed setting up a Middle Atlantic confederation, since the old Union had evidently outlived its usefulness. 2 Historian-in-Residence at the Ludwig von Mises Institute...|$|R
500|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} Bastille {{became part of}} the system of wider {{policing}} in Paris. Although appointed by the king, the governor reported to the lieutenant general of police: the first of these, Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, made only occasional visits to the Bastille, but his successor, Marquis d'Argenson, and subsequent officers used the facility extensively and took a close interest in inspections of the prison. The lieutenant general reported in turn to the secretary of the [...] "Maison du Roi", largely responsible for order in the capital; in practice together they controlled the issuing of the [...] "lettres" [...] in the king's name. The Bastille was unusual among Parisian prisons in that it acted on behalf of the king – prisoners could therefore be imprisoned secretly, for longer, and without <b>normal</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>processes</b> being applied, making it a useful facility for the police authorities. The Bastille was a preferred location for holding prisoners who needed extensive questioning or where a case required the analysis of extensive documents. The Bastille was also used to store the Parisian police archives; public order equipment such as chains and flags; and illegal goods, seized by order of the crown using a version of the [...] "lettre de cachet", such as banned books and illicit printing presses.|$|R
5000|$|Flagellation at {{the hands}} of the Romans is {{mentioned}} in three of the four canonical Gospels: John 19:1, Mark 14:65, and Matthew 27:26, and was the usual prelude to crucifixion under Roman law. [...] None of three accounts are more detailed than John's [...] "Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged" [...] (NIV). Luke's comparable account, Luke 22:63-65 is of the High Priest's guards beating and mocking Jesus. In the Passion of Christ the episode precedes the Mocking of Christ and the Crowning with thorns, which the Gospels happened at the same time or immediately after. Unlike the flogging, these were not part of the <b>normal</b> Roman <b>judicial</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
