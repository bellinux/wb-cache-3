5|$|Minton {{informed}} Eisenhower of {{his intention}} to retire in a letter on September 7, 1956, in which he dryly stated his retirement was authorized by law. Eisenhower responded with a brief note wishing him a happy retirement. Although he did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> president, Minton informed {{the members of the}} Court that his duties were too taxing on his health. His anemia had steadily worsened, slowing him physically and mentally. Minton served as a Justice until October 15, 1956, retiring after 7years and 3days of service. He was succeeded by William J. Brennan, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, {{if there were any}} delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published {{before the end of the}} school year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> students about the decision, and they did not find out about it until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E
5|$|Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Ridley Scott {{asked him to}} play Millburn. Trying to {{duplicate}} {{the reaction of the}} Alien cast to the chestburster scene, the director did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Prometheus cast that a Hammerpede puppet was in the silicon replica of Spall's body; Kate Dickie's scream is genuine. The character of Milburn was criticized, since no biologist would touch an unidentified, extraterrestrial organism displaying hostility. Spall defended his character, citing a deleted scene where Millburn holds a smaller, docile Hammerpede.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these bylaws did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> full story about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, {{he was able}} to tease out what the organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Roder was not replaced, with punter Dave Green {{taking over}} his duties. Rick Jennings spent the {{shortest}} {{amount of time}} with the club of all players that season; picked up on waivers from the Raiders on a Tuesday, he was released the same Thursday. New uniforms had to be ordered for the team when it was discovered that the fans could <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> players apart because the numerals on the white uniforms could not be seen from the stands. Many local Miami Dolphins fans were angered when the NFL upheld the Buccaneers’ demand that Dolphin games not be broadcast in the Tampa Bay area on days that the Buccaneers play at home. The timing of the decision led to the firing of Director of Administration Curt Mosher after the season.|$|E
5|$|When Archie destroys Zoe's film project, {{essential}} for her graduation, lecturer Adrian P. Kennedy (Richard Lawrence) gives her an extension. Zoe finds a script belonging to Mike {{which he wrote}} 20 years ago about his decision to give Sarah up for adoption. Zoe uses the script and films it, and Adrian screens it in the SU Bar. At the screening, Sarah discovers the planned adoption and is in turmoil. Mike goes to see Adrian to tell him of the plagiarism. Adrian says that if she sleeps with him, he will <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> university. Zoe considers Adrian's offer but later claims she would rather be a failure than sleep with him, leading to him failing her project. Zoe then has a brief relationship with Natty (Danny Tennant).|$|E

5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, though he did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate {{with him for the}} greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward {{and did not want to}} see him gain high office.|$|E
5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} and most {{powerful}} supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.|$|E
5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> controller this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E
5000|$|In September, in a {{televised}} interview with Charles Gibson of ABC News, Palin reiterated her position that she had dismissed Monegan because of his job performance and that neither she nor her husband pressured him to fire Wooten. Palin said [...] "I never pressured him to hire or fire anybody … I know that Todd, too, never pressured … Monegan." [...] In response, Monegan said: [...] "She's <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth when she told ABC neither she nor her husband pressured me to fire Trooper Wooten. And she's <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth to the media about her reasons for firing me." ...|$|R

5|$|Only two Fortresses {{had left}} Bedek's storage {{facility}} {{by the time}} hostilities commenced on October 29, 1956. The squadron had not flown a single training sortie before fighting began and had only two full crews ready for battle. Israeli piston-engined aircraft flew few missions {{in the first two}} days of the war, but on October 31, 69 Squadron received an order to bomb Rafah in support of IDF Brigade 27 operations. Arriving over the target early on November 1, the aircraft could <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> location of friendly troops and without being able to communicate with the forces on the ground, were forced to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean. The B-17s were back in action the following night, to attack retreating Egyptian forces. A repeat of the previous night's lack of communications with Israeli forces operating in the same area once again prevented the strike, and the bombers dropped their loads on the outskirts of Gaza. With the threat of Egyptian air power curtailed by Anglo-French strikes against Egyptian air bases, the B-17s began flying daylight operations. On November 2 the squadron supported the Israeli push towards Sharm el Sheikh, on the southern tip of the Sinai. Two aircraft bombed the local barracks but were met with effective anti-aircraft fire which damaged the lead aircraft. The damaged aircraft managed to return to Ramat David, just as the third B-17 returned from storage at Bedek. Two aircraft were therefore available for the B-17s' final combat sorties with the IAF, another failed strike on Sharm el Sheikh on November 4.|$|E

25|$|The British Government {{had decided}} on 15 June to demilitarise the islands, so all {{military}} personnel, weapons and equipment {{had been taken}} to England.
