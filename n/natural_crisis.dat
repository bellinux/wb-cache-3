40|$|On 22 February 2011, Christchurch New Zealand (population 367, 700) {{experienced}} a devastating earthquake, causing extensive damage and killing {{one hundred and}} eighty-five people. The earthquake and aftershocks occurred between the 2009 and 2011 waves of a longitudinal probability sample conducted in New Zealand, enabling us to examine how a natural disaster of this magnitude affected deeply held commitments and global ratings of personal health, depending on earthquake exposure. We first investigated whether the earthquake-affected {{were more likely to}} believe in God. Consistent with the Religious Comfort Hypothesis, religious faith increased among the earthquake-affected, despite an overall decline in religious faith elsewhere. This result offers the first population-level demonstration that secular people turn to religion at times of <b>natural</b> <b>crisis.</b> We then examined whether religious affiliation was associated with differences in subjective ratings of personal health. We found no evidence for superior buffering from having religious faith. Among those affected by the earthquake, however, a loss of faith was associated with significant subjective health declines. Those who lost faith elsewhere in the country did not experience similar health declines. Our findings suggest that religious conversion after a natural disaster is unlikely to improve subjective well-being, yet upholding faith might be an important step on the road to recovery...|$|E

In the context of situation assessment as initial reaction to man made or <b>natural</b> <b>crisis</b> events, information extraction methodologies relying on data which {{can be derived from}} operational civilian spaceborne sensors are of special importance. In this paper, we present a novel 3 D reconstruction methodology using hybrid VHR optical and detected SAR imagery that is able to estimate the height of a generic man made structure from a single power VHR SAR image. The proposed approach is based on the combined application of a radar simulator and a matching procedure, which evaluates the match between the actual SAR scene and the simulations of an object with different heights. The estimated height corresponds to the height of the object, whose simulation matches best with the actual scene. The efficiency and the generic aspect of the pro-posed method, is demonstrated for the height estimation of the pyramids in Giza, Egypt from VHR TerraSAR-X data. JRC.

So in this research have been defined new mechanisms and policies in order to modification of destructive mechanism by studying of effective mechanisms and identifying cause-effect structure. In this study, at first was determined system boundary and effective endogenous and exogenous variables. Then, was studied reference variable behavior. After that were determined dynamic assumptions and was prepared conceptual model and cause-effect diagrams.
