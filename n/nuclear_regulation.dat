40|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>{{regulations}}</b> are {{a subset}} of social regulations (laws to control activities that may negatively impact the environment, health, and safety) that concern control of ionizing radiation from radiation-producing equipment and from radioactive materials. The impressive safety record among nuclear technologies is due, in no small part, {{to the work of}} radiation safety professionals and to a protection system that has kept pace with the rapid technologic advancements in electric power generation, engineering, and medicine. The price of success, however, has led to a regulatory organization and philosophy characterized by complexity, confusion, public fear, and increasing economic costs. Over the past 20 years, regulatory costs in the nuclear sector have increased more than 250 % in constant 1995 U. S. dollars. Costs of regulatory compliance can be reduced sharply, particularly when health and environmental benefits of risk reduction are questionable. Three key regulatory areas should be closely examined and modified to improve regulatory effectiveness and efficiency: a) radiation protection should be changed from a risk-based to dose-based system; b) the U. S. government should adopt the modern metric system (International System of Units), and radiation quantities and units should be simplified to facilitate international communication and public understanding; and c) a single, independent office is needed to coordinate <b>nuclear</b> <b>regulations</b> established by U. S. federal agencies and departments. Key words: dose, economic costs, <b>nuclear</b> <b>regulations,</b> radiation quantities, regulatory framework, risk.

2500|$|In 1974, Hart {{ran for the}} United States Senate, {{challenging}} two-term incumbent Republican Peter Dominick. Hart was {{aided by}} Colorado's trend toward Democrats during the early 1970s, as well as Dominick's continued support for the unpopular President Richard Nixon and concerns about the senator's age and health. In the general election, Hart won {{by a wide margin}} (57.2% to Dominick's 39.5%) and was immediately labeled a rising star. He got a seat on the Armed Services Committee, and was an early supporter of reforming the bidding for military contracts, as well as an advocate for the military using smaller, more mobile weapons and equipment, as opposed to the traditional large scale items. He also served on the Environment and Public Work Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee. From 1975 to 1976, Hart {{was a member of the}} post-Watergate [...] "Church Committee" [...] that investigated abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service. Hart served as the chairman of Senate Subcommittee on <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Regulation.</b> He flew over the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in an Army helicopter several times with minority member Alan K. Simpson during the metonymic nuclear accident and led the subsequent Senate investigation into the incident.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 March 2013 at 6:57p.m., {{the cooling}} {{system for the}} spent fuel pools of the No. 1, 3 and 4 {{reactors}} stopped, after the electricity instantaneously went out at the plant's accident response center. TEPCO suspects that the problem was situated in one makeshift power switchboard controlling the cooling system. The injection of water into the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactors was not affected. According to TEPCO, restoring the cooling system of the spent fuel pool of reactor No. 4 had the [...] "highest priority", {{because the number of}} fuel assemblies stored in that tank was larger than in the pools of unit 1, 2 and 3. On 19 March at 10 a.m., the temperatures ranged between 15.9 C and 30.5 C, and it would take about four days until the temperature of the water inside the No. 4 spent fuel pool reaches the upper safety limit of 65 C. TEPCO was prepared to inject water into the pool whenever needed in case the water warmed up and started to evaporate. On 19 March around 1:20p.m., one of the two lines forming the cooling system of the No. 4 spent fuel pool was restored. Around 8 p.m. TEPCO was expecting to get the other line in operation. The cooling system of the No. 1 spent fuel pool was put back in action at 2:20p.m. The power loss caused anxiety and questions among residents of the region. The news was communicated by the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Regulation</b> Authority around three hours after the incident happened. On 22 March 2013, the evacuation zones were to be reclassified, and some residents would be allowed to make day trips to their homes. Some people thought that all was under control, and others with little children were afraid for yet another evacuation. Electricity went out simultaneously at nine facilities of the plant in total, a filter system to remove radioactive materials from cooling water for the reactors, and a cooling system for yet another pool were affected too. TEPCO admitted, that this was the first occasion that such a power failure happened at so critical facilities at the site since the plant was brought under control in December 2011. On 20 March before 1:00a.m. all systems were online again. The cooling system of pool no. 4 was restored as last. TEPCO blamed a provisional power switchboard to be the cause of the troubles. According to TEPCO, this was the last remaining makeshift power switchboard at the plant, installed after the nuclear crisis. Criticism was there from the central and prefectural government, the late announcement three hours after the power loss had caused [...] "significant anxiety" [...] among local people. TEPCO promised that it would seek to communicate relevant information more quickly on issues that could stir public concern. During the investigation to find the cause of the power loss, a 6-inch rat was found electrocuted near a switch board. Further investigations were needed to find out whether this was the only cause.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to show that}} while environmental shocks can lead to major institutional change, typically this change is not radical. Even in situations of institutional breakdown, due to violent and disruptive events such as disasters, {{it is possible to}} find institutional persistence which constraints and shapes the process of change. In this sense, the paper portrays institutional change and institutional persistence more as coexisting than as contrasting. Focusing on the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island (1979), which "ended the first nuclear era in the U. S. (Weinberg, 1985 : 1) "divided nuclear power history in two parts [...] before and after Three Mile Island (Rees, 1994 : l), the paper examines forms of major institutional change that originated from it, but have also revealed themselves as consistent with institutional persistence. A new path in <b>nuclear</b> safety <b>regulation</b> developed near the accident at Three Mile Island (TMI). Yet, this new path has been consistent with an old path in <b>nuclear</b> safety <b>regulation</b> that TMI did not break down, and to a certain extent strengthened. Emphasizing institutional persistence, the paper takes a historical perspective, paying attention both to the long-term institutional implications of the nuclear plant accident at TMI, and to its historical roots. History represents a basic framework for understanding the kind of institutional transformation developed in <b>nuclear</b> safety <b>regulation</b> after TMI. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is the main institution we investigate in this paper. The NRC is a case of institutional continuity in itself. It was established in 1974, but it inherited its structure, staff and regulatory system from its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) established in 1946. The paper looks at the process of the NRC's transformation that developed because of TMI. That transformation has been constrained and mediated by the AEC's institutional legacy. A second institution we focus on is <b>nuclear</b> safety <b>regulation.</b> The whole concept of nuclear safety, its culture and approach have changed because of TMI. The main institutional breakdown that TMI produced was precisely in the body of assumptions, values, rules and procedures which had guided <b>nuclear</b> safety <b>regulation</b> until then. The paper then describes and analyzes the main changes which took place in the institutional environment of the NRC as a result of TMI. More specifically, the paper focuses on the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), the private regulatory agency set up by the nuclear industry in the afermath of TMI, and on its partnership with the NRC. The INPO itself, and especially the partnership between INPO and NRC, represent a major institutional change in <b>nuclear</b> safety <b>regulation.</b> This change also built upon persistent institutional arrangements which originated {{in the early days of}} nuclear power development...|$|R
