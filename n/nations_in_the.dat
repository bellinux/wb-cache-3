Marco also contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica, which had already caused a total of $3million in damage to roads and left 170families without shelter. After significant damage from Hurricane Lili in the previous month, minimal effects occurred in Cuba. Large amounts of precipitation also fell across Cuba, especially on the Isle of Youth and in Pinar del Río Province. Heavy rains caused thousands to flee their homes.

5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public and multilateral underwriters, private insurance firms accounted for {{approximately half of}} the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E

5|$|By mid-2012 Iceland was {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It has had two years of economic growth. Unemployment was down to 6.3% and Iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs. Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations.

The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling {{began in the early}} eighteenth century. By 1880 it had declined by an estimated 29 percent. From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased, and after World War II, the whale population increases to 33 percent of the pre-whaling population. Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed by the various whaling <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century, while in the twentieth century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals were hunted by coastal {{aboriginal}} humans historically {{for food}} and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several <b>nations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took this to a much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the †Steller's sea cow (along with subsistence hunting) and the †Caribbean monk seal. Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, are slow to reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow.|$|E
