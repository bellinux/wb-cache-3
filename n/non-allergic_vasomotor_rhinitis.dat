40|$|Paranasal sinuses, which {{communicate}} with the nasal passages through the sinus ostia, are essentially sterile structures, sterility being maintained by a healthy epithelium with normal actively beating cilia. Irritants, including viruses and bacteria, are trapped in mucus and cilia to allow the clearance of sinuses through the natural ostia into the nasal cavity. Interference with this normal physiological function results in inflammation and infection within the sinus cavities. All of the sinuses are subjected to the same environmental as well as physiological stimuli; thus it is uncommon for a single sinus to be infected and for the others to remain entirely normal. Allergic and <b>non-allergic</b> <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> should be differentiated from chronic bacterial rhinosinusitis.

40|$|CONCLUSION: This study {{demonstrates}} that, in {{the nasal}} respiratory mucosa {{of patients with}} <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> oxidative stress following peroxynitrite formation is confined to the respiratory epithelium. This suggests {{that the role of}} peroxynitrite in <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> differs from its role in other diseases of the respiratory tract. The results of this study also support the concept that different pathogenetic mechanisms are probably involved in <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> OBJECTIVE: Previous studies indicated that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the pathogenesis of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> strong expression of NO synthase being detected in the smooth muscle cells of the cavernous sinuses and in the respiratory epithelium. However, most adverse effects of high levels of NO originate from the reaction of NO with superoxide anions to form peroxynitrite. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the involvement of peroxynitrite in the pathogenesis of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sites of peroxynitrite formation were identified by immunolabelling for 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 NT), its footprint in tissues. Samples of nasal mucosa were obtained from <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> patients and from control subjects who had undergone corrective surgery of the nasal septum. All samples were obtained by reduction of the inferior turbinate. RESULTS: Examination of specimens from <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> patients revealed that 3 NT is absent in epithelium with a normal appearance, cells of the subepithelial connective tissue, the glands and the blood vessels, including the cavernous sinuses. In contrast, intense 3 NT immunolabelling was found in the disrupted respiratory epithelium. 3 NT was not present in any of the specimens from control subjects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Many {{patients}} have nasal syndromes that are nonallergic and noninfectious and {{not caused by}} mechanical or anatomic ab-normalities. There are at least 8 recognized nonallergic rhinitis syndromes: drug-induced rhinitis including rhinitis medicamentosa, gustatory rhinitis, hormonally induced rhinitis including the rhinitis of pregnancy, nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome, senile rhinitis, atrophic rhinitis, cerebral spinal fluid leak, and <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> Few studies have explored etiologic causes. These syn-dromes are distinguished by clinical characteristics, recognized triggering conditions, and concomitant observations such as nasal eosinophilia or cerebral spinal fluid leak.

40|$|Background: The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> is not under-stood. It {{is unlikely}} that antihistamines, based on their H 1 antagonist activity alone, would be effective in this disorder. Methods: Nonetheless, at least one double-blind, placebo-con-trolled multicenter trial has found that intranasal azelastine relieves symptoms of this disorder better than placebo. The mechanism responsible for its beneficial effect in nonallergic rhinitis is unclear but probably relates to “anti-inflammatory/antiallergic ” activities. Results: Such mechanisms have been demonstrated {{for a number of}} different oral antihistamines, but often the concentrations required in vitro are higher than those that are normally achieved in vivo using recommended dosing. It has been postulated that intranasal administration, which can achieve high local levels, might be a factor responsible for enhancing the “anti-inflamma-tory/antiallergic ” properties. Conclusions: Interpreting this information allows one to conclude that antihistamines may be potentially effective agents in <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> {{and are more likely to}} be so when administered intranasally, despite the fact that data documenting this beneficial effect are sparse.

METHODS: A total of nine patients with symptoms of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> underwent 14 endoscopic vidian neurectomies between 1998 and 2001. All patients had negative screening for allergies on their serum or on skin-prick tests. The surgical technique for endoscopic vidian neurectomy is presented. The outcomes for the patients were retrospectively assessed with patients asked to score their pre- and postoperative symptoms rating these symptoms on a scale of 1 - 10 after a mean follow-up of 25 months (range, 21 - 36 months). RESULTS: On this retrospective analysis there was a significant improvement in the symptoms of rhinorrhea (p = 0. 018) and nasal obstruction (p = 0. 011). There {{was no significant difference between}} the pre- to postoperative symptoms for postnasal drip or sneezing.

40|$|Conclusions Sphenopalatine artery {{ligation}} relieves {{symptoms of}} rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal itching {{in patients with}} <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> associated with nasal polyps. Objectives. Nasal polyps often arise in a setting of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> Responsible for the accompanying symptoms of rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal itching are dysfunctions in nerve fiber activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sphenopalatine pedicle resection with autonomic denervation could potentially reduce related symptoms. Methods In a prospective, double-blind setting, 60 patients with <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> and bilateral nasal polyps randomly assigned to functional endoscopic surgery either with (Group A) or without sphenopalatine artery ligation (Group B) completed a 3 -year follow-up. Pre-operative and post-operative (at 1 and 3 years) evaluations included symptom score, fiberendoscopy, and active anterior rhinomanometry. Results. In both treatment groups nasal breathing had improved at 1 -year and 3 -year follow-up (P< 0. 001), whereas a improvement in rhinorrhea (P< 0. 001), sneezing and itching (P< 0. 01) was attained only in group A. The inter-group comparison showed that a statistically significant improvement in rhinorrhea and nasal itching (P= 0. 002) and in sneezing (P< 0. 001) was present in Group A at both follow-up controls. Rhinomanometry improved in both treatment groups (P< 0. 01). Inter-group comparison showed a significant difference only at the 3 -year follow-up visit (P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Topical {{treatment}} of allergic or <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> is possible {{by means of}} pressurized metered dose inhalers, aqueous spray, or dry powder inhalers. In children, {{little is known about}} nasal drug delivery by dry powder inhalation. The airflow through the device is critical for the drug release and a sufficient nasal inspiratory flow is needed for intranasal drug delivery from a dry powder inhaler. In order to investigate from what age children with allergic or <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> can reliably use such a device, device-dependent nasal peak inspiratory flow (DnPIF) was measured. The maximal DnPIF was measured in children aged 4 - 13 years making use of a dry powder inhaler (Turbuhaler(R)) connected to a spirometer (Vitalograph(R)). In the clinically relevant context, instructions from the doctor and one week's use of a Turbuhaler at home were found to be sufficient to obtain a good inhalation technique and were shown to improve DnPIF at least as effectively as visual feedback training at the clinic. Children with rhinitis, as well as healthy children from the age of 6 years, were able to generate a DnPIF sufficient to obtain a reliable nasal delivery of a dry powder drug dose. DnPIF values correlated with age. Consequently, a recommendation to use a nasal Turbuhaler from the age of 6 for topical drug delivery in the {{treatment of}} allergic or <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> seems reasonable...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundThere {{has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in monitoring the fractional concentrations of exhaled NO (FeNO) levels in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. In the present study, we examined whether the nasal FeNO measurement might reflect the degree of local allergic inflammation as well as subjective symptoms. MethodsThe FeNO measurement was performed using a handheld electrochemical analyzer (NObreath®) with a nose adaptor. In the cross-sectional study, 56 patients with perennial AR patients, 18 AR patients with bronchial asthma (BA), 12 patients with <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> and 30 normal subjects were enrolled. For the follow-up study, 12 seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients against Japanese cedar and 10 perennial AR patients who underwent laser surgery were examined. ResultsThe AR patients and <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> patients showed significantly higher oral FeNO levels {{as compared with the}} normal subjects. The nasal FeNO levels were significantly higher in the perennial AR patients with or without BA than in the normal subjects and <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> patients. There were positive correlations between the nasal symptom scores and FeNO levels. The SAR patients showed a significant decrease in the nasal FeNO level after the pollen dispersion season. In addition, the therapeutic effects of laser surgery in the AR patients accompanied a significant reduction in the nasal FeNO levels one month after treatment. ConclusionsThe nasal FeNO measurement by NObreath® is easy to perform and suitable for monitoring AR patients in various treatment modalities. Furthermore, it may have potential usefulness as a tool to improve daily clinical care...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Intranasal steroids (INS) {{are firmly}} {{established}} as the therapy for choice for allergic rhinitis, but {{their role in}} <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> (VMR) is not fully characterized. This review examines the potential mechanisms of action and reported efficacy of INS in patients with VMR. Results: INS, through intracellular activation of the glucocorticoid receptor, down-regulate the recruitment and activation of inflamma-tory cells (T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, neu-trophils, macrophages), increase degradation of neuropeptides, and reduce epithelial cell activity, vascular permeability, and chemokine secretion. It is likely that more than vasoconstriction {{is responsible for the}} clinical effects of INS. Eight INS can be prescribed for rhinitis in the US; only 4 have been studied for VMR. Seventy-four percent of patients treated with beclomethasone dipropionate considered themselves symptom-free or greatly improved versus 31 % with placebo. Budesonide signifi-cantly reduced rhinitis symptoms and methacholine-induced nasal secretions compared with placebo. Fluticasone propionate compared with placebo provided significantly greater relief from nasal obstruc-tion; computed tomographic scans showed significant reductions in the mucosal area of the lower turbinates.
