40|$|<b>Nature</b> <b>reserves</b> {{are widely}} {{considered}} as one available strategy for protecting biodiversity, which is threatened by habitat fragmentation, and wildlife extinction. The Chinese government has established a goal of protecting 15 % of its land area by 2015. We quantitated the characteristics and distribution of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> in mainland China and evaluated the expansion process for national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> National <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> occupy 64. 15 % of the total area of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> Steppe and meadow ecosystem, ocean and seacoast ecosystem, and wild plant <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> represent lower percentages, particularly in national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> in which they comprised 0. 76 %, 0. 54 %, and 0. 69 %, respectively, of the area. Furthermore, medium and small <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> compose 92. 32 % of all <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> The land area under any legal protection has reached 14. 80 %, although only 9. 78 % is strictly protected. However, if 9 super-large national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> located in Southwest and Northwest China were removed, the percentage of strictly protected area decreases to 2. 66 % of the land area of China. The areas contained in <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> in each province are not proportional to {{the areas of the}} provinces, particularly for national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> with higher protection rates in Southwest and Northwest China than in other regions. Of the 31 provinces, 22 provinces feature strict protection of less than 4 % of their areas by national nature reserves; these provinces are mainly located in East, Central, South, and North China. Moreover, the unevenness indexes of the distribution of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> and national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> are 0. 39 and 0. 58, respectively. The construction of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> has entered a steady development stage after a period of rapid expansion in mainland China. In recent years, the total area of national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> has increased slowly, while the total area of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> has not increased, although the number of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> continues increase...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-one typical coupled large {{samples were}} chosen from areas within and {{surrounding}} <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> on the Tibetan Plateau using the large sample comparison method (LSCM). To {{evaluate the effectiveness}} of the <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> in protecting the ecological environment, the alpine grassland net primary production (NPP) of these coupled samples were compared and the differences between them before and after their establishment as protected areas were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) With respect to the alpine grassland NPP, the ecological and environmental conditions of most <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> were more fragile than those of the surrounding areas and also lower than the average values for the Tibetan Plateau. (2) Of the 11 typical <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> selected, the positive trend in the NPP for Manzetang was the most significant, whereas there was no obvious trend in Taxkorgan. With the exception of Selincuo, the annual NPP growth rate in the <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> covered by alpine meadow and wetland was higher than that in <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> consisting of alpine steppe and alpine desert. (3) There were notable findings in 21 typical coupled samples: (a) After the establishment of the <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> the annual rate of increase in the NPP in 76 % of samples inside <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> and 82 % of samples inside national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> was higher than that of the corresponding samples outside <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> (b) The effectiveness of ecological protection of the Mid-Kunlun, Changshagongma, Zoige and Selincuo (Selin Co) <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> was significant; the effectiveness of protection was relatively significant {{in most parts of the}} Sanjiangyuan and Qiangtang <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> whereas in south-east Manzetang and north Taxkorgan the protection effectiveness was not obvious. (c) The ecological protection effectiveness was significant in <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> consisting of alpine meadow, but was weak in <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> covered by alpine steppe. This study also shows that the advantage of large sample comparison method in evaluating regional ecology change.

40|$|Assessing the {{distribution}} of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> {{is an important step}} for conserving biodiversity. We used geographic information system (GIS) to assess the conservation status of vegetation types, endangered plant and animal species, and biodiversity hotspots in China, based on the area, endangered species list and geographic position of 2, 047 <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> in China. The results showed that, while the proportion of total area protected as <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> is higher in China than the world average, of the 47 natural vegetation types in China, 21 (45 % of the total) were deficiently protected, with less than 10 % of their area included in <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> suggesting that these vegetation types have not been perfectly protected. According to the Dobson complementary algorithm, among 216 <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> the top five priority <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> i. e., Xishuangbanna, Mt. Wuyi, Mt. Changbai, Mt. Gaoligong and Mt. Qilian, contained 381 protected species (~ 50 % of the total), and the top 21 priority <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> contained 590 protected species (~ 75 % of the total). <b>Nature</b> <b>reserves</b> covered nearly all the hotspots selected by different approaches.

40|$|The current, {{dominating}} {{strategy of}} nature conservation within urban landscapes is to formally protect remaining patches of unexploited <b>nature</b> in <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> However, integration of nature conservation frameworks into urban planning requires reconsideration of key issues, such as why, where, {{and how to}} protect nature in a purposeful way. As part of that process I statistically evaluate current nature conservation in 209 municipalities in southern Sweden by analysing the number, size, age, and land cover patterns of 1869 <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> {{in relation to the}} degree of urbanisation. The analyses reveal that in urban municipalities the <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> are fewer, but larger, and have a higher diversity of land covers. Having large <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> may be especially important in urban landscapes, since it is often highly fragmented. The land cover compositions show no differences between urban and rural <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> However, urban <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> differ more from their surroundings compared with rural <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> according to the identified changes in representation of land cover types with an increasing degree of urbanisation. The most urgent future challenge identified is to develop urban nature conservation strategies that are integrated into the urban context including other green areas and built-up areas, the land-use history, and the requirements for local ecosystem services across the landscape. ...|$|R
