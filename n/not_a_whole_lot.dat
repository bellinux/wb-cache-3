500|$|MTV's Josh Wigler {{thought the}} episode was [...] "a touching, sad tale {{with a healthy}} mix of mythological advancement," [...] and couldn't wait for more episodes about the Observers. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode 7.6/10, writing that despite the hype, the episode was [...] "just plain average". He did however {{appreciate}} the new revelations about the Observers. After previewing the episode, Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker graded the episode an A-, explaining Fringe had become [...] "one of the fastest, smartest, wittiest shows on television now". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "good story peppered {{with a lot of}} great details... 'August' showed a greater connection to the larger Fringe universe". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded it with a B+, praising the [...] "wonderfully moody" [...] episode and how it was able to make the halting Observer dialogue work. Murray found some aspects lacking however, as he thought it was [...] "a very sketchy episode, plot-wise and mythology-wise. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> happened". Website blogger io9 listed [...] "August" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E

He also applauded the writing staff for not feeling the need to highlight {{all members of the}} team in the episode, noted by the absence of May and Ward. Brian Lowry of Variety was generally positive about the episode, stating, [...] "Television obviously can’t compete with the budgets and action found in summer blockbusters... but it has an advantage in being able to explore characters. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. obviously possesses a core audience drawn to those attributes, and showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have admirably kept the plot moving ahead — engaging in larger serialized narratives — while grappling with the logistics of those ancillary considerations, which include plans for an Inhumans movie," [...] though concluded with [...] "there’s still <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> that feels particularly super about it." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, [...] "“Laws of Nature” feels at once the show’s most confident, ambitious swing yet, its action-packed opening minutes a clear mission statement with an even more specific focus than Season 2." ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed [...] "Argus", {{noting that}} it was [...] "entertaining, funny and had some killer one-liners" [...] and that it {{featured}} [...] "all kinds of silly but in a very winning way." [...] Rabin enjoyed all the plots featured here, and praised Will Forte's role as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator. Emily Exton from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the peacock storyline [...] "felt too silly", and that Forte [...] "was too underused as Paul", nonetheless said that despite not being the greatest 30 Rock episode of all time [...] "there were still some hilarious lines." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning liked Grizz's dilemma plot, commenting that Grizz not trying to hurt Tracy's feelings while Tracy tried to keep Dot Com away from Grizz's bride-to-be [...] "offered up some inspired lunacy."

A review in TV Guide by Adam Mersel said [...] "...Fey and the gang {{live up to the}} challenge, and produce [...] a hilarious, quite snotty episode that holds up to any comedy around." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive towards the episode, reasoning that the writing [...] "is just so deliciously absurd that I can't help but giggle the whole way through", and that the plots featured here were [...] "sublimely inconsequential. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> happened, but it was all very funny." [...] Nick Catucci from New York magazine, who did not enjoy the two other stories, appreciated Jenna's, explaining that by having the character date one of her own impersonator was [...] "outrageous and funny without relying on any cheap insults to trannies." [...] Sean Gandert from Paste magazine reported that [...] "Argus" [...] was an episode that [...] " [...] us back to the show's roots", explaining that recapturing the [...] "old tone" [...] also worked to [...] "recapture the old joke-writing expertise.

When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: [...] "There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A for and only one professional job that I've ever had any interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers.

On March 9, Perry scored two more goals, his 32nd and 33rd goal of the season, surpassing his previous career-high, single-season goal tally. Perry scored another goal in a win against Colorado. In the next game, he scored the only two goals as the Ducks lost to the Phoenix Coyotes. From March 19 through April 6, Perry recorded a least a point in ten consecutive games, later taking the League scoring lead from Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning when he scored two goals against the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. He then recorded his third career hat-trick in a game against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, with his third of the game giving him 50 for the year. After reaching the mark, he became just the third Ducks player to record a 50-goal season, joining Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya.

The destruction of wooded areas, loss and contamination of topsoil, depletion and pollution of surface and ground water, and air pollutants have all contributed to the poor health of rural America. The pressure to boost yields with modem chemicals and to plant to the edge of the water in the face of ever-declining crop prices is at least as compelling today as it was then. Perhaps the largest factor in the demise of biodiversity nation-wide, though, is the loss of open space to sprawling suburban subdivisions.

On PopMatters, Matt Cibula noted [...] "Every song here is pretty amazing. Byers’ arrangements are like simple rings on which Hawkins’ solos are beautiful diamonds. It might get a little soupy at times but there is nothing sentimental about any of these tracks, and there is real wit and verve and intelligence behind every choice here. And when they swing, they swing it hard. “I Never Knew” rocks along very nicely, as do a couple more Hawkins originals; “His Very Own Blues” and a new version of “Bean and the Boys” entitled ” 39”-25”-39” ” must have set many a late-‘50s dancefloor on fire.

40|$|To {{describe}} what economists {{think about the}} recent boom in the “economics of happiness ” research is perhaps no different to quoting the now famous tagline from Marmite © commercials – which, {{if you happen to}} be living outside Great Britain, is a well-known food spread made purely from yeast-extract: You either love it or hate it. The negative attitudes many traditional economists have towards the use of “subjective well-being data ” in economic analysis is predictable. Despite having been taught to put people’s welfare at heart, economists are trained to ignore what people say about their well-being. Happiness or satisfaction data are criticized for being too subjective, too interpersonally incomparable, and too insensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions such as GDP and unemployment rates to be of any real use to economists (see, for example, Johns and Ormerod, 2008). Then along came Happiness Quantified – a book that could perhaps challenge the way many of us view happiness research for good.
