There were numerous difficulties to overcome, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was devising a means of detonating the lenses with the required speed. Robert F.

5|$|These {{expenses}} {{were not}} the sole cause of the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which Kalākaua was forced to sign, but representative of a pattern of excessive spending and grand schemes, under the helm of Walter Murray Gibson, that did lead to it. Gibson was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs for two non-consecutive terms, on May 20, 1882, and again on October 13, 1886. He became Minister of the Interior and Prime Minister of Hawaii on June 30, 1886. Gibson encouraged and approved the King's excessive expenditures, and {{is thought to have}} been the driving force behind some of them, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was the $100,000 purchase of a state steamboat for travel to the Samoan Islands as part of Kalākaua's plan to form a Polynesian Confederation.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids display {{high levels}} of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the {{tendency}} of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and {{has been used to}} show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began the}} {{following}} April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was {{the firing of}} the original lead actor, Shintaro Katsu—creator of the very popular Zatoichi character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his own performance. (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed {{only a few weeks}} behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent {{much of the rest of}} the year in Europe and America promoting Kagemusha, collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.|$|E

25|$|Piezoelectric {{speakers}} {{can have}} extended high frequency output, {{and this is}} useful in some specialized circumstances; for instance, sonar applications in which piezoelectric variants are used as both output devices (generating underwater sound) and as input devices (acting as the sensing components of underwater microphones).

In 2006, Wintersun began work on their second and third albums, Time I and Time II, which were initially intended to be released as a single album. Recording began in May of that year, but the albums would be the recipient of years-long delays for a multitude of reasons, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was the complexity of each song's mix.|$|E
25|$|The drummers and {{the rhythms}} they played served as accompaniment for dance bands, which played ragtime and various dances, with jazz coming later. It was common in these bands {{to have two}} drummers, one playing snare drum, the other bass. Eventually, however, due to various factors (<b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> being the {{financial}} motivation), the number of drummers was reduced to one, and this created {{the need for a}} percussionist to play multiple instruments, hence the drum set. The first drum sets also began with military drums, though various other accessories were added later {{in order to create a}} larger range of sounds, and also for novelty appeal.|$|E

Its prologue, format, illustrations, and text are all {{very similar to the}} Ms. M.383, though it's largely free of silver enamel. The text takes the form of descriptive paragraphs set in poor Italian verse, which are nevertheless fairly clear and informative. Despite its shared characteristics with the Ms. M.383, there are important differences, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> is the vastly different order of the information.

25|$|Wager of law was a {{possible}} defense, {{at least in}} certain cases of detinue sur trover. Wager of law was a complicated medieval legal procedure which was used when other forms of proof were lacking. It involved the bringing forth of witnesses who would swear under oath, to God that the facts alleged in the writ or bill of complaint were true. Lacking such witnesses, the action would fail. This was locked into the old methods of proof, which were in turn, tied to the old forms of action. The records show a certain hardening of the courts toward this defense in the mid-fourteenth century. Wager of law was not used in debt on a covenant. Wager of law was abolished by statute in 1833. Prosser describes trover and wager of law in this way: Trover, as it developed, had certain definite procedural advantages over the older forms of action, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was that it avoided wager of law, a form of licensed perjury which made detinue singularly unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{reviews for}} The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket were {{generally}} unfavorable.

500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow.

McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, environmental organisation Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think {{you can imagine how}} Greenpeace views this material.

She also noted that Marvel had now lost [...] "the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and added that despite making [...] "leaps and bounds for women in the MCU, the same [...] be said for people of color," [...] wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like Hazel Ying Lee, one of 38 Women Airforce Service Pilots who died in the line of duty, or Black women like Harriet Ida Pikens and Frances Wills, the first two Black members of the United States Naval Reserve.|$|E
