25|$|The Dowding {{system is}} {{considered}} {{key to the}} success of the RAF against the German air force (Luftwaffe) during the Battle of Britain. The combination of early detection and rapid dissemination of that information acted as a force multiplier, allowing the fighter force to be used at extremely high rates of effectiveness. In the pre-war period, interception rates of 30% to 50% were considered excellent; that meant that over half the sorties sent out would return without having encountered the enemy. During the Battle, average rates were around 90%, and several raids were met with 100% success rates. Lacking their own direction system, Luftwaffe fighters had little information on the location of their RAF counterparts, and often returned to base having <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them.</b> When they did, the RAF fighters were almost always in an advantageous position.|$|E

Rousseau reveals that she was part of a science team, and they were shipwrecked on the island about three days after leaving Tahiti. She {{identifies}} the [...] "Others" [...] as the carriers of a sickness that her companions caught, and says that the Others whisper in the jungle, although she has <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them.</b> Sayid does not believe her, but continues to fix the music box. After finishing the repairs, much to Rousseau's joy, he asks her to let him go. The duo hear a growl outside, and Rousseau pursues it, leaving Sayid alone.|$|E

500|$|While {{working in}} the United States, Saria familiarised himself with the {{independent}} American cinema, which greatly influenced his work. He also listed such directors as the Dardenne brothers, Eric Rohmer and Hrishikesh Mukherjee as influential during his formative years as a filmmaker himself. Critics and commentators drew similarities between Loev and Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005), as explained by Jha that the similarity [...] "in the way the rocky terrain is used to define the theme of forbidden love is palpable". The film {{was thought to be}} visually and structurally similar to Andrew Haigh’s Weekend (2011), and Wong Kar Wai’s Happy Together (1997), although Saria admitted to have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them.</b> However, Ford thought that Loev was more subtle in its portrayal of samesex affection (when compared to Weekend), which made it [...] "quite novel for Bollywood".|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{approved}} the court's findings, {{but they were}} not the full refutation of Jackson's report that many Kentuckians—including Adair—had wanted. [...] In a letter that was quickly made public, Adair—formerly one of Jackson's close friends—insisted that Jackson withdraw or modify his official report, but Jackson refused. [...] This ended the matter until June 1815 when H. P. Helm, secretary to John Thomas, forwarded to a Frankfort newspaper remarks from [...] "the general" [...] that had been annexed to the official report. [...] "The remarks" [...] stated that the general was now convinced that the initial reports of cowardice by Davis's men [...] "had been misrepresented" [...] and that their retreat had been [...] "not only excusable, but absolutely justifiable." [...] The remarks, popularly believed to be from Jackson in response to Adair's letter, were subsequently reprinted across Kentucky. The [...] "general" [...] referenced was in fact General John Thomas; Jackson had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Helm claimed he sent a subsequent correction to the newspaper that published the remarks, but it was never printed.|$|E
500|$|Steven Moffat {{contacted}} Chris Chibnall, {{asking him}} to return to writing for Doctor Who. Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode [...] "42" [...] as well as episodes of the spin-off series Torchwood. Moffat and executive producer Piers Wenger gave him the brief of Silurians, a drill, and that it was a two-parter. The Silurians were villains who had previously appeared in the 1970 serial Doctor Who and the Silurians and the 1984 serial Warriors of the Deep. For research, Chibnall read the original novel Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters and watched the original serial, noting the freedom writer Malcolm Hulke took with the novel in things he could not have done in the television format. Chibnall wanted there to be a large Silurian city in contrast to the small human village on the surface. Knowing that the Silurians were not as popular and recurring as other villains, Moffat instructed Chibnall to bring the creatures to a new audience, and Chibnall decided to start out with knowing nothing about them and then introducing them in [...] "the most exciting and scary way possible for people who've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> before". Chibnall also considered bringing back the Silurians' amphibious cousins the Sea Devils, but decided that doing two races of monster was much tougher and the story was [...] "so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want".|$|E

2500|$|Before {{reaching}} Tlaxcala, the scanty Spanish forces {{arrived at}} the plain of Otumba Valley (Otompan), where they were met by a vast Aztec army intent on their destruction. The Aztecs intended to cut short the Spanish retreat from Tenochtitlan. [...] The Aztecs had underestimated the shock value of the Spanish caballeros because all they had seen was the horses traveling on the wet paved streets of Tenochtitlan. They had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> used in open battle on the plains.|$|E
2500|$|Director Rick Sloane {{was shocked}} at his {{treatment}} {{at the conclusion of}} Hobgoblins, in which Sloane himself was mercilessly mocked over the film's end credits. In a 2008 interview, however, Sloane clarified his comments, saying that [...] "I laughed through the entire MST3K episode, until the very end. I wasn't expecting the humor to suddenly be at my own expense. I was mortified when they dragged out the cardboard cutout and pretended to do an interview with me. I was caught off guard. I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> rip apart any other director before on the show." [...] However, he credits the success of the MST3K episode with inspiring him to make a sequel to Hobgoblins, released in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the natural}} course of events, species become extinct {{for a number}} of reasons, {{including}} but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by transporting animals and plants from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. livestock released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. rats escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an invasive alien species does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect native species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing pathogens or parasites that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the [...] "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the megafauna in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), North and South America (12,000 years before present), Madagascar, Hawaii (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.|$|E
