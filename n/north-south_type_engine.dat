50|$|The {{advantage}} of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke engine's intake timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port <b>type</b> <b>engines.</b> The piston-port <b>type</b> <b>engine's</b> intake timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|R

50|$|In September, 1966, {{production}} of the <b>Type</b> II <b>engine</b> and gearbox began. It was not until 1972 that the <b>Type</b> II <b>engine</b> replaced the <b>Type</b> I in general use. Continued use of the <b>Type</b> I <b>engine</b> in 1966-72 {{was the result of}} a surplus of Type I components. With so many <b>Type</b> I <b>engines</b> in use, parts remained in production until the early seventies. When the military serviced Type I bikes, they would replace the engines and/or gearboxes with Type II components. This was done for ease of maintenance, parts availability, and improved engine characteristics. Bikes with <b>Type</b> I <b>engines</b> often had their original gearboxes replaced with a <b>Type</b> II. <b>Engines</b> manufactured with a serial number of 661802 and higher are Type II.|$|R

5000|$|In 1915, an American named Charles J. McHugh filed {{a patent}} {{application}} for the diaphragm <b>type</b> of <b>engine,</b> {{which was an}} improvement to Piot's design. In 1920, William Purcell filed a patent for the coiled tube <b>type</b> of <b>engine.</b> This <b>type</b> of <b>engine</b> has been very common {{over the years in}} homemade pop pop boats, due to its simplicity of construction. The Cub Scout book (published by the Boy Scouts of America) contained a project called a [...] "Jet Boat" [...] for many years. This project used a coil <b>type</b> of <b>engine</b> based on Purcell's design which was placed in a wooden hull. Many commercial pop pop boats have also used this <b>type</b> of <b>engine,</b> due to its low cost.|$|R
5000|$|In the Type 2, the Volkswagen <b>Type</b> 4 <b>engine</b> was {{an option}} from 1972. This engine was {{standard}} in models {{destined for the}} US and Canada.

Both engines displaced 1.7 litres, rated at [...] with the manual transmission, and [...] with the automatic. The <b>Type</b> 4 <b>engine</b> was enlarged to 1.8 litres and [...] in 1974, and again to 2.0 litres and [...] in 1976. As with all Transporter engines, the focus in development was not on motive power, but on low-end torque. The <b>Type</b> 4 <b>engines</b> were considerably more robust and durable than the <b>Type</b> 1 <b>engines,</b> particularly in Transporter service.|$|R
50|$|In {{this period}} Diesel and hot bulb engines were four stroke. In 1902 F. Rundlof invented the {{two-stroke}} crankcase scavenged engine {{that went on}} to become the prevalent hot bulb <b>type</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
