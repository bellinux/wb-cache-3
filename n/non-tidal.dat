5|$|Coinciding {{with its}} {{classification}} as {{a tropical storm}}, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for {{the west coast of}} Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach, with a tropical storm watch declared from Keaton Beach northward to Saint Marks. An inland tropical storm warning was also issued for non-coastal and <b>non-tidal</b> areas of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The passage of the storm resulted in an increased threat for rip currents, with officials recommending that swimmers stay out of the water until the storm leaves the area. A tornado watch was also posted for the southern portion of the state, though was dropped after the storm weakened.|$|E
5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the <b>non-tidal</b> portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a {{river is}} made entirely <b>non-tidal</b> by {{constructing}} a sea lock {{directly into the}} estuary.|$|E
25|$|This is {{so small}} that other larger effects {{completely}} mask any tide, and as such these lakes are considered <b>non-tidal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The B.N.A. Act {{states that}} the federal Government has sole {{authority}} in coastal and inland fishery matters. Provinces have rights over <b>non-tidal</b> waters and fishing practices there only.|$|E
25|$|Water {{from the}} tidal River Ouse is {{prevented}} {{from entering the}} Derwent {{by means of a}} barrage at Barmby on the Marsh. The Derwent has been kept <b>non-tidal</b> since the 1970s because water is abstracted at Loftsome Bridge water treatment works to supply the City of Hull.|$|E
25|$|The <b>non-tidal</b> {{reaches of}} the river are used for leisure boating, but remain largely {{separated}} {{from the rest of}} the British inland waterway system. Several of its tributaries are navigable, including the River Cam, the River Lark, the River Little Ouse and the River Wissey. Close to Denver sluice, Salters Lode lock gives access to the Middle Level Navigations, but the intervening section is tidal, and deters many boaters. Access to the Middle Level Navigations is also possible via the Old Bedford River and Welches Dam lock, but this route is only open for a few weekends each year, and was heavily silted in 2009. The proposed Fens Waterways Link, which aims to improve navigation from Lincoln to Cambridge may result in this section being upgraded, or a <b>non-tidal</b> link being created at Denver.|$|E
25|$|The second {{scheme is}} for an {{extension}} of the Great Ouse Relief Channel to link it to the River Nar, and provide a <b>non-tidal</b> link to King's Lynn. The project would include a large marina, and would be part of a much larger regeneration project for {{the south side of the}} town. Two locks would be required to raise boats from the Relief Channel to the River Nar.|$|E
25|$|There were {{plans to}} make the final part of the river navigable again, {{as part of a}} scheme to create a <b>non-tidal</b> route from King's Lynn to the Great Ouse, which {{included}} a marina at Boal Quay and a sea lock near the final sluice. It would have been part of a much larger regeneration project for the south of the town, and the river would have been linked to the Great Ouse Flood Relief Channel, which currently terminates at a sluice a little to the south of the A47 road. Various routes for the connecting link were considered, but the preferred route was to utilise the flood diversion channel, constructed in 2001. This would have been enlarged, and the two bridges, located on Thiefgate Lane and the bank of the Flood Relief Channel, would have been rebuilt to provide more headroom. However, the <b>non-tidal</b> link was eventually abandoned, as there were concerns over environmental issues, the channel was thought to be too narrow to accommodate boats travelling in opposite directions, and some of the bridges would not have provided sufficient headroom. The scheme was modified to include a lock {{from the end of the}} flood relief channel back into the Ouse, with the sea lock and marina being retained. These plans have since been deferred, due to the change in the financial situation and the collapse of land values.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, the engineer, William Jessop was engaged by the Bristol Dock Company to create a <b>non-tidal</b> Floating Harbour to combat {{continuing}} problems with ships being grounded at low tide. With his system, which was completed in 1809, water was trapped behind lock gates so ships could remain floating at all times, unaffected {{by the state of}} the tide on the river. Part of the project included building a dam at the Underfall Yard with a weir, known as the overfall, to allow surplus river water to flow into the New Cut, an excavation that by-passed the Floating Harbour and joined the River Avon near Temple Meads.|$|E
25|$|Narragansett Bay {{circulation}} {{is made up}} {{of forces}} provided by the winds, tides, and changes in water density within the watershed. Its circulation {{is the result of the}} flow of fresh water at the head interacting with salt water at the point where the bay meets the open ocean. Residence time of water due to the circulation of Narragansett Bay is 10–40 days, with an average of 26 days. Tidal mixing is the dominant driver of circulation patterns in the bay, where currents can reach up to 2.5 feet per second. <b>Non-tidal</b> currents such as the flow of low salinity water at the surface out of the bay and high salinity deep water into the bay contribute to a current of about 0.33 feet per second.|$|E
25|$|An {{elliptical}} orbit calculated by Sekanina and Chodas in 2012 indicates that Comet Lovejoy is {{a fragment of}} an unrecorded sungrazer that reached perihelion around 1329. The fragmentation history suggested by these authors is that a parent sungrazer, likely the comet observed in 467CE, split near the Sun due to tidal forces during its pass. The principal fragmentor a non-tidally fragmented portion of itreturned as the Great Comet of 1106, but a secondary fragment was imparted a longer orbital period and returned about 1329. This secondary also split at perihelion and its principal fragment will return around 2200, likely as a cluster of further fragments. A secondary fragment of this event left on a shorter period that theoretically should {{bring it back to}} the inner solar system {{during the early years of}} the 21st century. At some point after perihelion, this secondary fragment broke apart due to <b>non-tidal</b> forces and one of the resulting fragments became Comet Lovejoy. Other similar fragments may also exist and might return as sungrazers in the near future.|$|E
500|$|When {{completed}} in 1766, Edwards' Grand Sluice {{consisted of three}} channels each [...] wide, fitted with pointed gates on both sides, and a lock adjacent to the north bank, {{which could be used}} as an additional flood relief channel if required. The lock was originally very small, but was lengthened to its current [...] in 1881. The pointed doors on the <b>non-tidal</b> side of the sluice were replaced by steel guillotine gates between 1979 and 1982.|$|E
2500|$|A {{tidal lock}} is {{generally}} any lock that connects tidal with <b>non-tidal</b> water. This includes a lock between a tidal {{river and the}} <b>non-tidal</b> reaches, or between a tidal river and a canal, or a sea lock. However, the term usually refers specifically to a lock whose method of operation {{is affected by the}} state of the tide. Examples: ...|$|E

2500|$|A diked, <b>non-tidal</b> area of 145 acres (0.6km2), {{adjacent}} to {{the eastern end of}} Tinicum marsh, was donated by the Gulf Oil Corporation to the City of Philadelphia in 1955. This area, administered for the benefit of wildlife and people, was known as Tinicum Wildlife Preserve. [...] The areas of open water along with the adjacent heavily vegetated tidal wetlands, formed an ideal habitat for thousands of migratory waterfowl.|$|E

[...] By 8 February 2014, approximately half of homes had been chosen to be evacuated by Fire and Rescue Services.|$|E
2500|$|The Clifton Suspension Bridge (designed in 1831, {{completed}} in 1864 [...] with a 214 m central span) {{is one of}} the longest of the parabolic arc chain type. The current Marlow suspension bridge was designed by William Tierney Clark and was built between 1829 and 1832, replacing a wooden bridge further downstream which collapsed in 1828. [...] It is the only suspension bridge across the <b>non-tidal</b> Thames. The Széchenyi Chain Bridge, spanning the River Danube in Budapest, was also designed by William Clark and it is a larger scale version of Marlow bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Down {{river of}} Shardlow, the <b>non-tidal</b> river is navigable {{as far as}} the Cromwell Lock near Newark, except in Nottingham (Beeston Cut & Nottingham Canal) and just west of Nottingham, where there are two lengths of canal, Sawley and Cranfleet cuts. [...] Below Cromwell lock, the Trent is tidal, and {{therefore}} only navigable by experienced, well-equipped boaters. [...] Navigation lights and a proper anchor and cable are compulsory. [...] Associated British Ports, the navigation authority for the river from Gainsborough to Trent Falls, insist that anyone in charge of a boat must be experienced at navigating in tidal waters.|$|E
2500|$|Drift bottle {{studies have}} {{provided}} {{a simple way to}} learn about <b>non-tidal</b> movement of waters containing eggs and larvae of commercially important fishes, for sharing among fisheries scientists and oceanographers. [...] Such experiments simulate the travel of pollutants such as oil spills, study formation of ocean gyre [...] "garbage patches," [...] and suggest travel paths of invasive species. Persistent currents are detected to allow ships to ride favorable currents and avoid opposing currents. Projected travel paths of navigation hazards, such as naval mines, advise safer shipping routes. Outside science, many launch bottled messages to find pen pals, [...] "bottle preachers" [...] have sent [...] "sermon bottles," [...] and propaganda-bearing bottles have been directed at foreign shores. It was estimated in 2009 that since the mid-1900s, six million bottled messages had been released, including 500,000 from oceanographers.|$|E
2500|$|India {{supports}} its stance {{by citing}} the thalweg doctrine in international law. The law states that river boundaries between two states may be, {{if the two}} states agree, divided by the mid-channel. Though Pakistan does not dispute the 1925 map, it maintains that the doctrine is not applicable in this case as it most commonly applies to <b>non-tidal</b> rivers, and Sir Creek is a tidal estuary. [...] India rejects the Pakistani stance by maintaining {{the fact that the}} creek is navigable at high tide and that the thalweg principle is used for some international boundaries in tidal waters, and that fishing trawlers use Sir Creek to go out to sea. [...] Another point of concern for Pakistan is that Sir Creek has changed its course considerably over the years. If the boundary line is demarcated according to the thalweg principle applied to the current channel, Pakistan and India would both lose small amounts of wetlands territory that was historically part of their provinces. [...] More significantly, acceding to India's stance would result in the shifting of the land/sea terminus point several kilometres to the detriment of Pakistan, leading in turn to a loss of several thousand square kilometres of its Exclusive Economic Zone under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea.|$|E

50|$|Walbrook is {{the first}} <b>non-tidal</b> club on the weir-controlled Thames. The key feature of the <b>non-tidal</b> Thames {{compared}} to complex rules along the Tideway is that navigation {{is always on the}} right. In all but exceptional stream the water resembles the middle sections of a few wide rivers in the UK, being long weir-controlled rowing rivers in the UK capable of handing more than three large vessels side-by-side.|$|E
50|$|The <b>non-tidal</b> {{section of}} the river is owned and managed by the Environment Agency, which is {{responsible}} for managing the flow of water to help prevent and mitigate flooding, and providing for navigation: the volume and speed of water downstream is managed by adjusting the sluices at each of the weirs and, at peak high water, levels are generally dissipated over preferred flood plains adjacent to the river. Occasionally, flooding of inhabited areas is unavoidable and the agency issues flood warnings. Due to stiff penalties applicable on the <b>non-tidal</b> river, which is a drinking water source before treatment, sanitary sewer overflow from the many sewage treatment plants covering the upper Thames basin is rare in the <b>non-tidal</b> Thames, which ensures clearer water compared to the river's tideway.|$|E
