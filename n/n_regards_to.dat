The system selects the k top-performing agents from each group, where k< n. The agents selected from each group are the winners of that group. The proportion of winning agents is k/ <b>n</b> with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the initial population (time t). Thus, if a group in a type A environment has more A-agents than vacancies available (i.e. [...] x> k) then all the agents selected from that group are A-agents, and {{the proportion}} of A-agents selected is k/nb(a_t,x)p. However, if x<k then only a number x of A-agents are selected and some B-agents have to be randomly chosen to fill the k-x vacancies, so {{the proportion of}} A-agents selected is x/nb(a_t,x)p. Consequently, in this case, the total proportion of A-agents selected will be: [...] EA_t^a=∑ _x= 0 ^k- 1 x/nb(a_t,x)p+∑ _x=k^nk/nb(a_t,x)p=∑ _x= 0 ^nmin[x,k] 1 /nb(a_t,x)p. Analogously, a fraction (1 -p) of groups will face a type B environment and similar reasoning applies.

30|$|The {{study showed}} that the {{greatest}} absolute yield effects of faecal matter biochar addition (with or without N) were seen in moderately fertile silty loam soil than less fertile sandy loam soil. However, the greatest biochar addition effects (with or without <b>N)</b> with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> relative yield were seen in less fertile sandy loam soil. For both soils, the biochar application rates of 20 and 30  t ha− 1 with 50  kg N ha− 1 were found to significantly increase above ground biomass when compared to most treatment combinations and control. Therefore, faecal matter biochar application {{at a rate of}} 20  t ha− 1 is recommended for considerable shoot yield under the conditions of these experiments. Although both biochar alone and biochar with N classes induced significant residual yield increase, the yield response of the two classes was non-significant, suggesting the low residual effect of N in yield response of lettuce. Generally, our results suggest that biochar from faecal matter could be used as an effective fertilizer to achieve high yield of lettuce in less fertile sandy loam and moderately fertile silty loam soils. Moreover, the conversion of the faecal matter feedstock into charred product may offer additional waste management benefit as it offers an additional (microbiologically safe) product compared to the more common co-composting. However, cost assessments are required to calculate the net benefit of the biochar production (on farm) and applications from farmers’ perspective.|$|R

The study was conducted in two beech forests (Fagus sylvatica) in nature reserves, the first located in the Northern Apennines (Riserva Naturale Guadine Pradaccio, Parma province) and the second in the Southern Apennines (Laceno, Monte Raiamagra, Avellino province). In each area, 6 sub-sites were identified and 12 soil cores, 6 (10 x 10 x 10 cm) for mesofauna investigation and 6 (to a depth of 40 cm) for chemical-physical and microbial analysis, were recovered from each of them in autumn 2010 and spring 2011. Litter horizon (O) was sampled distinguishing different phases of decomposition. Microarthropod extraction was performed using Berlese-Tüllgren funnels, the obtained specimens were identified and counted. Soil biological quality was estimated using the QBS-ar and QBS-c indices (based on the arthropods and collembolans communities respectively); the biodiversity of soil communities was evaluated using the Shannon diversity index (H’) and Pielou’s evenness index (J). The results revealed some important differences. The Pradaccio site showed a higher C content along the soil profile and displayed a greater quantity of soluble fraction and a lower C/N ratio in the organic matter.

Both N. viennensis and N. gargensis were insensitive to concentrations of octyne that cause complete and irreversible inactivation of nitrite production by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. However, octyne concentrations (≥ 20 μM) that did not inhibit N. maritimus partially inhibited nitrite production in N. viennensis and N. gargensis in a manner that did not show the characteristics of irreversible inactivation. In contrast to previous studies with an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea, octyne inhibition of N. viennensis was: (i) fully and immediately reversible, (ii) not competitive with NH₄⁺, and (iii) without effect on the competitive interaction between NH₄⁺ and acetylene.

In the analysis that addressed SPS differences between groups, general negative affectivity and prior history of cardiac disease served as covariates and revealed that individuals with NCCP were characterized by less effective problem solving on three of five dimensions assessed as compared with their matched counterparts.

The ANoVA for the number of kernels per ear showed that the lowest kernels per ear (497. 86) were obtained from no N application and the highest kernels per ear (588) were obtained from the application of 92 kg N ha- 1 although {{there was no significant difference}} between the application of 69 and 92 kg <b>N</b> ha- 1. <b>Regarding</b> <b>to</b> ear length the data showed that the longest ear (23. 63 cm) was obtained from the application of 92 kg N ha- 1. The effect of N on grain yield indicated that there is no significant difference between the application of 69 and 92 kg N ha- 1 even if there is a slight difference on yield. Generally, maximum N fertilization level (92 Kg N/ha) in this study area showed increase in growth and yield components (number of kernels per ear and ear length). However the application of 69 kg N ha- 1 seems adequate to get the optimum yield...|$|R

Such teeth, as well as endodontically treated teeth, during reconstructive prosthodontic therapy need {{to be treated with}} posts and cores. The aim of the investigation was to measure and compare the dynamic loading resistance of endodontically treated teeth with cast metal and prefabricated posts and cores, under dynamic loading fatigue of 800 N- 1000 <b>N,</b> with specific <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> variable root preparation width. The investigation included 48 human lower second premolars of similar dimensions, divided in 4 groups according to type of post and core system (each 6 mm long) which they received. 1) prefabricated narrow post and core (Maillefer Switzerland, Size 1) 2) prefabricated wide post and core (Maillefer Switzerland, Size 3 B) 3) cast metal narrow post and core 4) cast metal wide post and core. Modified Voss & Meiners dynamic loading tests were performed within a field of 800 N- 1000 N in high frequency pulsator. Teeth with prefabricated narrow posts demonstrated the highest average dynamic loading resistance of 9. 050. 622 cycles under 800 N until fracture, while teeth with cast metal wide posts demonstrated the lowest average dynamic loading resistance of 3. 522. 611 cycles under 1000 N until fracture. Significant influence of root preparation width on dynamic loading resistance for all types of posts was determined by ANOVA (p< 0. 05), with narrow posts demonstrating more fracture resistance. Prefabricated posts and cores demonstrate stable dynamic loading resistance and better intraradicular retention than cast metal posts and cores...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} a {{secondary}} contact zone between two sister species of woodrat, Neotoma fuscipes (dusky-footed woodrat) and N. macrotis (big-eared woodrat). Along the Nacimiento River, {{on the border of}} southern Monterey and northern San Luis Obispo counties, the ranges of these sister species of woodrats meet and overlap forming a secondary contact zone. The zone of secondary contact is estimated to include a 500 -meter (1, 650 linear feet) portion of the Nacimiento River riparian corridor. This research examines quantifiable morphological change that is likely associated with heightened inter-specific competition within the contact zone. When in sympatry the sister species may compete for resources indirectly through exploitative competition, or directly through contest competition, or through a combination of these two processes. The prediction that heightened competition has resulted in distinctive morphological character shifts between allopatric and sympatric populations was tested my examining size and shape of adult woodrats along a 20 -kilometer transect. It was confirmed that adults woodrats of the two sister taxa are morphologically distinct (N = 602) and that the phallus morphology was indeed a reliable means to identify adult male woodrats as to species (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, N = 331). A two model approach was used to examine convergence and divergence in size and shape of woodrats across the transect. Neotoma fuscipes exhibited a statistically significant divergerence from <b>N.</b> macrotis with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> breadth of rostrum (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, N = 414) in a region of sympatry along the Nacimiento River. Based on the results on one statistical model, N. macrotis exhibited a statistically significant convergence with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> body-size (p = 0. 0240, N = 587) and length of hind foot (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001, N = 563) towards those of N. fuscipes between zones of sympatry and allopatry. Alternatively, {{based on the results of}} a second statistical model that accounted for environmental variation within the system both species exhibited a statistically significant divergence with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> body-size (p = 0. 0054, N = 587) and towards that of N. fuscipes between zones of sympatry and allopatry. Also, N. macrotis exhibited a statistically significant convergence with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> length of ear (p = 0. 0022, N = 563) towards that of N. fuscipes. Based on the results of both models, detectable re-patterning of size-independent traits was observed to varying degrees. The morphological character shifts between sympatric populations and allopatric populations of woodrats suggest that ecological interactions between the species are occuring. Specifically, across the contact zone, patterns of variation in body-size and other morphological character traits are consistent with expectations of a combination of contest and exploitative competition...|$|R
40|$|On {{a global}} scale the ratio of fixed {{nitrogen}} (N) and phosphate (P) {{is characterized by a}} deficit of <b>N</b> with <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the classical Redfield ratio of N : P = 16 : 1 reflecting the impact of N loss occurring in the oceanic oxygen minimum zones. The northern Benguela upwelling system (NBUS) is known for losses of N and the accumulation of P in sub- and anoxic bottom waters and sediments of the Namibian shelf resulting in low N : P ratios in the water column. To study the impact of the N : P anomalies on the regional carbon cycle and their consequences for the export of nutrients from the NBUS into the oligotrophic subtropical gyre of the South Atlantic, we measured dissolved inorganic carbon (C T), total alkalinity (A T), oxygen (O 2) and nutrient concentrations in February 2011. The results indicate increased P concentrations over the Namibian shelf due to P efflux from sediments resulting in a C : N : P : -O 2 ratio of 106 : 16 : 1. 6 : 138. N reduction further increase C : N and reduce N : P ratios in those regions where O 2 concentrations in bottom waters are − 1. However, off the shelf along the continental margin, the mean C : N : P : -O 2 ratio is again close to the Redfield stoichiometry. Additional nutrient data measured during two cruises in 2008 and 2009 imply that the amount of excess P, which is created in the bottom waters on the shelf, and its export into the subtropical gyre after upwelling varies through time. The results further reveal an inter-annual variability of excess N within the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) that flows from the north into the NBUS, with highest N values observed in 2008. It is postulated that the N excess in SACW occurred due to the impact of remineralized organic matter produced by N 2 fixation and that the magnitude of excess P formation and its export is governed by inputs of excess N along with SACW flowing into the NBUS. Factors controlling N 2 fixation north of the BUS need to be addressed in future studies to better understand the role of the NBUS as a P source and N sink in the coupled C : N : P cycles...|$|R
40|$|The natural abundances {{of stable}} {{isotopes}} in our environment serve as intrinsic tracers that {{are incorporated into}} biological compounds and create unique isotopic signatures that record molecular history. Use of stable isotopes {{in the investigation of}} biochemical, geological, and forensic applications has become increasingly popular in the past two decades, in large part due to the recent development of requisite instrumentation capable of measuring the subtle variations of naturally occurring isotope ratios. Progress towards a universal model describing the behavior of isotopes in physiology has seen little consolidation due to the empirical nature of isotopic response. Elucidation of underlying mechanisms requires tightly controlled experiments with careful isotopic characterization of specific physiological states. We exploit the environmentally-relevant and nutritionally versatile bacteria, Paracoccus denitrificans, to assess the fractionation of nitrogen in the metabolism of amino acids as a means to deduce physiological state. The manipulation of respiratory state and osmotic stress yields distinctive distributions of relative isotopic enrichment which is indicative of changes in metabolic pathways. We report the first in vivo position-specific measurement of the poly-nitrogenous amino acid, Lysine, and note a dramatic deviation in isotope ratios between sidechain and peptide nitrogen, which is correlated with respiratory state. In aerobic cells, the lysine intramolecular delta-delta- 15 N was negligible, but in anaerobic cells it was a remarkable delta-delta- 15 N = + 11. 0 permil, driven predominantly by enrichment at the peptide <b>N.</b> With <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> osmotic stress, we report a linear response with salt concentration in nitrogen isotope ratios of several amino acids, indicating an isotopic enrichment in amino acids which exhibit known osmoprotective properties. Bulk 15 N/ 14 N increased by delta-delta- 15 N = + 5. 603 ? 0. 79 permil from 1 % to 1. 75 % NaCl and significant linear trends of delta-delta- 15 N values with salt concentration between 1 % and 1. 75 % (p< 0. 05) were found for five amino acids, Ala (delta-delta- 15 N = 4. 66 ? 0. 23 permil), Gly (delta-delta- 15 N = 4. 03 ? 0. 84 permil), Val (delta-delta- 15 N = 3. 59 ? 0. 32 permil), Pro (delta-delta- 15 N = 6. 13 ? 0. 76 permil), and Asx (delta-delta- 15 N = 5. 27 ? 0. 56 permil). These findings illustrate the sensitivity of isotope ratios in amino acids to physiological state and establish a premise for diagnostic techniques to assess metabolism...|$|R
