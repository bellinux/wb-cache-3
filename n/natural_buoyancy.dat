5|$|The {{vertebral}} column in bowfin is ossified and {{in comparison to}} earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the {{vertebral column}} allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with <b>natural</b> <b>buoyancy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns {{and brown}} {{pelicans}} all engage in plunge diving, taking fast moving prey by diving {{into the water}} from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from {{the momentum of the}} dive to combat <b>natural</b> <b>buoyancy</b> (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20m (70ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E

Particle-phase viscous effects are included in the model. While proper boundary conditions for a particle phase are unknown at present, boundary conditions borrowed from rarefied gas dynamics are employed for the particle-phase wall velocity conditions.

2500|$|Efforts {{have been}} under way for several years to develop a {{solution}} to remove the gas from these lakes and prevent a build-up {{that could lead to}} another catastrophe. A team led by the French scientist Michel Halbwachs began experimenting at Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos in 1990 using siphons to degas the waters of these lakes in a controlled manner. A pipe is positioned vertically in the lake with its upper end above the water's surface. [...] Water saturated with CO2 enters the bottom of the pipe and rises to the top. [...] The lower pressure at the surface allows the gas to come out of solution. [...] Only a small amount of water has to be mechanically pumped initially through the pipe to start the flow. [...] As the saturated water rises, the CO2 comes out of solution and forms bubbles. [...] The <b>natural</b> <b>buoyancy</b> of the bubbles draws the water up the pipe at high velocity causing a large fountain at the surface. [...] The degassifying water acts as a pump, drawing more water {{into the bottom of the}} pipe, and creating a self-sustaining flow.

A series of KC- 135 flights with this experiment on board are scheduled for summer/fall 1984. The acquisition of the aforementioned data using interferometry and beam deflection optical techniques is anticipated.

No experimental {{study has been}} reported for radiative ignition of paper at irradiances below 10 Watts/sq. cm. An experimental study of radiative ignition of paper at these low irradiances is reported. Experimental parameters investigated and discussed include radiant power levels incident on the sample, the method of applying the radiation (focussed vs. diffuse Gaussian source), the presence and relative position of a separate pilot ignition source, {{and the effects of}} <b>natural</b> convection (<b>buoyancy)</b> on the ignition process in a normal gravity environment. It is observed that the incident radiative flux (in W/sq. cm) has the greatest influence on ignition time. For a given flux level, a focussed Gaussian source is found to be advantageous to a more diffuse, lower amplitude, thermal source. The precise positioning of a pilot igniter relative to gravity and to the fuel sample affects the ignition process, but the precise effects are not fully understood. Ignition was more readily achieved and sustained with a horizontal fuel sample, indicating the buoyancy plays a role in the ignition process of cellulosic paper.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a mean field dynamo {{model for the}} generation of galactic magnetic fields, in which the driving mechanism for the alpha-effect is the buoyancy-driven Parker instability, rather than the conventional cyclonic turbulence. The dominant quenching mechanism is a buoyant velocity, which lifts field away from the disc plane. Our modified alpha-effect is essentially nonlinear, as its magnitude depends on the magnetic field strength. The dynamo thus exhibits threshold behaviour – the marginal dynamo number depends on the seed field geometry and strength. We investigate a basic one-dimensional ‘slab’ model both analytically and numerically, and also present results from a three dimensional calculation. In some ways our steady solutions resemble conventional galactic dynamo solutions, but the fields do not decrease so markedly away from the disc midplane, remaining strong out to the boundary of the dynamo region. The latter property is quite <b>natural</b> for a <b>buoyancy</b> driven system and may possibly be related to strong horizontal magnetic fields detected in the halos of some spiral galaxies...|$|R

A clean cookstove, designed to make the combustion process less polluting and more thermally efficient, could significantly mitigate the detrimental health and environmental effects of biomass burning.

In particular, an empirical correlation is developed between combustion rate and bulk fluid flow in a forced convection stove case. This is coupled with computational models of stove operation in which fluid flow is a function of a constant heat flux. A parameter study between both cases gives sufficient data to determine where one would expect operating conditions to stabilize in a <b>natural</b> draft (<b>buoyancy</b> driven) cookstove. The second part of this work focuses on developing a quantification model for metal oxide type semiconductor sensors.

50|$|Natural {{convection}} is a mechanism, or type of heat transport, {{in which}} the fluid motion is not generated by any external source (like a pump, fan, suction device, etc.) but only by density differences in the fluid occurring due to temperature gradients. In natural convection, fluid surrounding a heat source receives heat, becomes less dense and rises. The surrounding, cooler fluid then moves to replace it. This cooler fluid is then heated and the process continues, forming a convection current; this process transfers heat energy {{from the bottom of}} the convection cell to top. The driving force for <b>natural</b> convection is <b>buoyancy,</b> a result of differences in fluid density. Because of this, the presence of a proper acceleration such as arises from resistance to gravity, or an equivalent force (arising from acceleration, centrifugal force or Coriolis effect), is essential for natural convection. For example, natural convection essentially does not operate in free-fall (inertial) environments, such as that of the orbiting International Space Station, where other heat transfer mechanisms are required to prevent electronic components from overheating.|$|R
