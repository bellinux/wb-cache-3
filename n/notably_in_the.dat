5|$|Caspar Bartholin, a 17th-century Danish anatomist, {{dismissed}} Colombo's and Falloppio's {{claims that}} they discovered the clitoris, {{arguing that the}} clitoris had been widely known to medical science since the second century. Although 17th-century midwives recommended {{to men and women}} that women should aspire to achieve orgasms to help them get pregnant for general health and well-being and to keep their relationships healthy, debate {{about the importance of the}} clitoris persisted, <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work of Regnier de Graaf in the 17th century and Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the 19th.|$|E

5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout of many of his piano works, <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral.

5|$|Living {{things like}} orchids, hummingbirds, and the peacock's tail have {{abstract}} designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match. The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living {{things in the}} effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.|$|E

5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most <b>notably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed {{to have made a}} conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
