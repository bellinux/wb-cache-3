The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in the processing of the specified calculation. Xgrid is targeted towards time consuming computations that can be easily segregated into smaller tasks, sometimes called embarrassingly parallel tasks. This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{computer}} scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in its design; it was (effectively) designed {{from the ground}} up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the first MediEvil, Sony Computer Entertainment {{commissioned}} SCE Cambridge to develop a sequel that would be released {{before the end of the}} PlayStation's lifespan. Chris Sorrell, who previously served as director of the first game, was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in development so the project was handed over to James Shepherd instead.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young lawyer}} Chelvanayakam was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in {{politics}} but when the ACTC was established in 1944 {{he became one of}} its principal organisers.

Chelvanayakam stood as the ACTC candidate for Kankesanthurai in the 1947 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament.|$|E

5|$|As {{second in}} command of the SS and then Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> with Nazi Party {{policy-making}} decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.|$|E
5|$|At 9a.m. on July4, Berger {{left her}} {{apartment}} for the Mother Earth offices. Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place. The bomb had exploded prematurely, shaking the sixth story of Berger's tenement building, wrecking the three upper floors and killing Berg, Caron, Hanson, and a woman, Marie Chavez, who apparently was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in the conspiracy. Berkman arranged the dead men's funerals.|$|E

There are no memorials or headstones dedicated to him today, and his Victoria Cross is not on public display.|$|E
5|$|For {{the film}} score, Mizoguchi relied on {{composer}} Fumio Hayasaka and the assistant directors, and was <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in their creative process. Fumio Hayasaka {{was a strong}} proponent of using Japanese music in Japanese films. For Ugetsu, he employed geza music, common in Kabuki theatre. Additional, uncredited composers were Ichiro Saito and Tamekichi Mochizuki, whose music was blended with Hayasaka's, and could provide accurate music reflective of the period.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is <b>not</b> <b>involved.</b> It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E

A case of poisoning that may have been caused by S.thiersii has been reported from the state of Puebla, Mexico. The outcome of this case is unknown. Symptoms of poisoning in humans include reversible impairment of kidney function. A Meixner test revealed that amatoxins were <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in the Puebla case.|$|E
