40|$|Background: Increasing incidences of {{dementia}} necessitate {{the improvement of}} supportive measures for patients suffering from this disease and their proxies. Clinicians without psychiatric backgrounds and others involved in appraising the supportive needs {{of dementia}} patients, such as those who allocate <b>nursing</b> <b>insurance,</b> base their appraisals {{on the ability of}} patients to perform basic and instrumental activities of daily living (B-ADL, iADL). Our aim was to investigate whether a reduced ability of the patient to perform ADL is sufficient to adequately assess the supportive needs of family caregivers. Methods: Cross-sectional baseline data were obtained from dementia patients and their proxies {{in the context of a}} nationwide prospective cohort study on non-pharmacological treatment of dementia. To our knowledge, the present study is the first country-wide study to assess patients and proxies in their domestic surroundings (e. g. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Behave-AD, B-ADL and iADL for patients; Quality of Life (QOL) and depression of the proxy). Results: Logistic and linear regression analysis show that the allocation of nursing care allowance provided by German mandatory <b>nursing</b> <b>insurance</b> is associated with scores on the B-ADL- and iADL scales, but not with the severity of behavioural symptoms or the supportive time the proxies spend on caring. However, the severity of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of dementia patients, correlate with each other and both parameter...|$|E

The major results are the following: 1. The home care service industry is well underway, {{and as a result}} many major private companies have strengthened their day care service and facilities care service businesses that have a high profit ratio. 2. There are still many non-specialized care service companies which are advancing into the care service industry, making use of management resources such as know-how, talented personnel, capital, equipment and facilities, distribution channels, and information. 3. Almost all of the major private companies that have used a large amount of funds resulting from stock market activities to expand their businesses have rid themselves of money-losing management practices, and are capitalizing with current large account surpluses. 4. An effective future business strategy for the elderly care market is the following: (1) Establish service-providing centers in areas that have a high rate of increase in the elderly population. (2) Offer services other than public <b>nursing</b> care <b>insurance</b> services. (3) Offer care prevention services, and small-scale and multi-role services that take root in the local area.

40|$|The troubled {{financing}} {{situation of}} Germany's statutory health insurance (SHI) {{is a subject}} widely debated in the public. A further reform for 2006 {{is now in the}} offing, only three years after the Act on the Modernisation of Statutory Health Insurance came into force. So far, though, little notice has been taken of the need to reform the country's statutory <b>nursing</b> <b>insurance</b> (SNI) - doubtlessly also on account of its smaller volume of contributions compared with SHI. But funding problems similar to those of SHI emerged already back in 1999, the year when expenditure first outstripped revenue. Right now the gap can only be closed with the capital reserve established with the inception of the SNI. But the reserve will be exhausted in only a few years. So it was against this background that a first, albeit modest, reform came in 2005 with the contribution rate being raised by 0. 25 percentage points for persons without children. However, no efforts for a lasting solution have been undertaken so far. This is something that is badly needed as the capital reserve of the SNI dwindles and as the gap between revenue and expenditure widens further with the greying of the population. The SNI moreover faces far greater burdens from the demographic trend than does SHI. H 4 cker/Raffelh (2004) expect the contribution rate to go from 1. 7...|$|E
40|$|A rapid ageing {{population}} {{coupled with}} changes in family structure has brought about profound implications to social policy in China. Although {{the past decade has}} seen a steady increase in public funding to long-term care (LTC), the narrow financing base and vast population have created significant unmet demand, calling for reforms in financing. This paper focuses on the financing of institutional LTC care by examining new models that have emerged from local policy experiments against two policy goals: equity and efficiency. Three emerging models are explored: Social Health Insurance (SHI) in Shanghai, LTC <b>Nursing</b> <b>Insurance</b> (LTCNI) in Qingdao and a means-tested model in Nanjing. A focused systematic narrative review of academic and grey literature is conducted to identify and assess these models, supplemented with qualitative interviews with government officials from relevant departments, care home staff and service users. This paper argues that, although SHI appears to be a convenient solution to fund LTC, this model has led to systematic bias in affordable access among participants of different insurance schemes, and has created a powerful incentive for the over-provision of unnecessary services. The means-tested method has been remarkably constrained by narrow eligibility and insufficiency of funding resources. The LTCNI model {{is by far the most}} desirable policy option among the three studied here, but the narrow definition of eligibility has substantively excluded a large proportion of elders in need from access to care, which needs to be addressed in future reforms. This paper proposes three lines of LTC financing reforms for policy-makers: (1) the establishment of a prepaid financing mechanism pooled specifically for LTC costs; (2) the incorporation of more stringent eligibility rules and needs assessment; and (3) reforming the dominant fee-for-service methods in paying LTC service providers...|$|E
40|$|Using an overlapping, multigenerational, dynamic, general {{equilibrium}} model {{incorporating a}} benefit assessment of government expenditure, this paper examines {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of funding methods for public health insurance and <b>nursing</b> <b>insurance.</b> In addition, in regard to the parameters that must be laid down exogenously in order to conduct simulation computations, we did not conform blindly to previous research but instead attempted to redefine core elements after detailed reconsideration. As a result of analyses through a model derived from the development and extension of existing research in this way, we conclude that the optimal funding method for medical and nursing benefits is consumption tax rather than social insurance premiums and interest tax. This conclusion arises from the fact that the disruptive effect of consumption tax is the weakest from the perspective of obstructing the accumulation of capital, and that it is in conformity with the findings of a considerable body of prior research and standard macroeconomic theory. However, the extent to which consumption tax is superior depends heavily on the setting of the parameters, and we cannot exclude the possibility that the measurements conducted in previous research were excessive regarding the advantage attributed to consumption tax. We also focused on the degree of aging of society, in which a comparison of the stationary state in 2005 and the stationary state in 2050 showed that the degree of improvement in social welfare caused by a shift of the revenue source to consumption tax was markedly greater in 2050. In view of this, it is possible to conclude that although care should be taken in setting the parameters, in a society that has aged to an advanced degree, a shift from social insurance premiums and interest tax to consumption tax is more desirable. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To prospectively {{evaluate}} the health economic burden {{of patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD) in Germany over a 6 -month observation period and to identify the predictors of these costs. Study design and methods: Direct and indirect costs were evaluated in 145 patients with PD (mean age 67. 3 +- 9. 6 years). PD patients were recruited from an outpatient department for movement disorders, a specialised PD clinic, two office-based neurologists and general practitioners, all located in Germany, and were enrolled between January and June 2000. Relevant economic data were documented in a patient diary over the 6 -month period. Clinical evaluations (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]) were performed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Costs were derived from various German medical economic resources. Costs were calculated {{from the perspective of}} healthcare and transfer payment providers and the individual patient. Indirect costs for lost productivity were also calculated. Costs are presented as means +- standard deviation (SD). Multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify independent cost predictors. Costs are in year 2000 - 02 values. Results: We estimated average per patient direct, indirect and total costs for the 6 -month observation period. The costs from the perspective of statutory health insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenkversicherung [GKV]) consisted of direct medical costs _ 1370 +- _ 3240, including rehabilitation (_ 420 +- _ 1630), hospitalisation (_ 710 +- _ 2520), outpatient treatment (_ 40 +- _ 30), ancillary treatment (_ 190 +- _ 280) and ambulatory diagnostic procedures (_ 10 +- _ 30). In addition, parkinsonian drug costs were _ 1520 +- _ 1250. Non-medical direct costs calculated from the GKV perspective were estimated to be _ 480 +- _ 1710, which included transportation (_ 10 +- _ 20), special equipment (_ 420 +- _ 1640), social/home-help services (_ 10 +- _ 110) and sickness benefit (_ 40 +- _ 540). The total medical (including drug costs) and non-medical direct costs for the GKV were _ 3380 +- _ 4230. Univariate predictors for GKV direct costs included occurrence of motor complications and falls, disease severity, nightmares and dementia. However, multivariate analyses only suggested disease severity and health-related quality of life as significant predictors. For <b>nursing</b> <b>insurance,</b> payments of _ 1330 +- _ 2890 were calculated. For retirement insurance, payments were _ 650 +- _ 1510 and there were patient (or caregiver) costs of _ 1490 +- _ 2730. Total indirect costs amounted to _ 3180 +- _ 6480.
