50|$|The distinctions {{above are}} {{enforced}} in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes {{differences between the}} controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words bolt and screw have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously {{in response to the}} technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) <b>Non-threaded</b> <b>fasteners</b> predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.|$|E
