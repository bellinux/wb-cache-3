25|$|In 2007, {{a genetic}} linkage test became {{available}} which appears promising. This {{is not a}} test which confirms if a dog has, or {{does not have the}} disease; <b>nor</b> <b>will</b> <b>it</b> definitively predict the disease, as even if a dog is a JDC carrier this does not guarantee its offspring will suffer the disease. It only links certain strains of DNA as carriers of JDC. This is significant in that these strains can now largely be deselected for in the breeding process, as has been successful with GM1 Storage Disease (see above). The test is not yet complete for every bloodline, and why the identified strains are implicated is still unknown, and so in essence the cause of the condition remains a mystery to be solved.|$|E

500|$|The OdioWorks {{case was}} one of the first {{high-profile}} cases illustrating Apple's attempts to employ federal police power in its litigation practices by invoking the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a means of shielding its intellectual property from reverse engineering. In November 2008, Apple sent a cease-and-desist letter to BluWiki, a non-commercial wiki provider, alleging BluWiki infringed Apple's copyrights in publishing a discussion of how to make the latest iPods interoperate with other software and that, by so doing, violated the DMCA. [...] In April 2009, OdioWorks, the operators of BluWiki, backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), defensively sued Apple seeking a declaration of non-infringement and non-circumvention. In July 2009, Apple ceased claiming infringement, stating it was [...] "withdrawing [...] takedown notifications" [...] and that [...] "Apple no longer has, <b>nor</b> <b>will</b> <b>it</b> have in the future, any objection to the publication of the itunesDB Pages which are the subject of the OdioWorks complaint". After Apple withdrew its complaint and cited code obsolescence as a contributing factor in its decision to withdraw, BluWiki then republished its discussion of the issue. The EFF noted, [...] "While we are glad that Apple retracted its baseless legal threats, we are disappointed that it only came after 7 months of censorship and a lawsuit".|$|E

Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment. The new Individualism, for whose service Socialism, whether <b>it</b> <b>wills</b> <b>it</b> or not, is working, will be perfect harmony. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> be what the Greeks sought for, but could not, except in Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed them; <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not realise completely except in Art, because they had slaves, and starved them. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> be complete, and through <b>it</b> each man <b>will</b> attain to his perfection.
