But for the <b>N-Tier</b> <b>architecture</b> there is no such type of mechanism is implemented for security till now. <b>N-tier</b> <b>architecture</b> has number of levels or tier, and for each tier security is essential. For providing the security to the data transferred on the network, NTRU algorithm is seen as fast and best algorithm. NTRU is patented and an open source public-key cryptosystem in which lattice-based cryptography system is used for encryption and decryption of files. Many applications make use of extensive databases to store the data and are accessible from anywhere by the multiple people simultaneously via World Wide Web. Applications that use this type of database can be implemented using 3 -tier architectural model. There are different types of architectures like 1, 2, 3 or more tier architectures. This paper represents the implementation of the NTRU algorithm for security of such application that is <b>N-tier</b> <b>architecture</b> and showed that this algorithm provides the best security at each tier. The keys generated by the server are used for encryption/decryption of files and encrypted files are stored in the database. This paper focuses on the comparison of proposed work with previous on the basis of parameters like encryption and decryption time, throughput...|$|E

It proposes an integration of web-based applications under the Balanced Scorecard management approach as a solution. Specifications are included for fiber optic LAN Infrastructure design, network client workstations, network servers and IT- 21 compliant network operating systems, producing applications and web augmentation tools. A description of relational database design is provided that encompasses database objects, data types and table relationships. Web design issues and network security issues are examined. Complete code for a prototype of the system in Microsoft Access is appended. Recommendations are made for using an n-tier network architecture to automate the submarine training and readiness processes in small project modules using an incremental Prototype development approach. An <b>n-tier</b> <b>architecture</b> supports custom applications and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, supports component reuse and encapsulation, provides a consistent, secure and auditable access to data and will allow faster production at less risk.

Again, Varanus due to its peer to peer, resource aware design consumes more resources than the other monitoring architectures. Worthy of note is the resource consumption of the two variable <b>n-tier</b> <b>architectures</b> which consume greater resources than the other monitoring architectures. As noted in previous experiments, these architectures have the lowest monitoring latency of set of evaluated architectures. They achieve lower latency by provisioning additional VMs to perform monitoring, this in turn results in a greater CPU usage. Varanus provisions no additional VMs (at least in this experiment) and achieves lower monitoring latency than the other monitoring architectures.|$|R

40|$|Layered {{software}} architecture contains several intra-layer and inter-layer dependencies. Each layer depends on shared components {{making it difficult}} to release a code change, bug fix or feature without exhaustive testing and having to build the entire software code base. This paper proposed self-contained, cross-cutting pipeline architecture (SCPA) that is independent of existing layers. We chose 2 open source projects and 3 internal intern projects that used <b>n-tier</b> <b>architecture</b> and applied the SCPA to release subsequent feature additions and any bug fixes. The SCPA decreased the release time by 42. 99 %. The lines of delivered code (LOC), increased by 22. 58 %. The number of defects found in existing functionality decreased by 85. 54 %. The SCPA also provided ability to roll back or switch off the new feature quickly. SCPA proved a suitable architecture for agile software development and continuous deployment.

5000|$|The {{interaction}} of any two software programs involves {{keeping track of}} the interaction-specific data as each subsequent interaction may depend upon the outcome of the previous interaction. This becomes more important in distributed architectures where the client and the server do not exist physically on the same machine. In two-tier architectures, the responsibility of tracking this interaction-specific data rested upon the rich clients, which was not an issue as each client used to reside on an individual computer. However, within <b>n-tier</b> <b>architectures,</b> the state management responsibility shifted from the client to the application or the web server. This introduced the need for some middleware state management extensions so that the server could handle multiple concurrent client requests by deferring the actual activity-specific state data to such extensions e.g. storing session data in a database in ASP [...]NET applications. This helps freeing up the memory resources in favor of increasing server responsiveness and the ability to entertain more client requests.|$|R

However, adapting the traditional application architectures is not enough {{in order to take}} advantage of this environment in effective ways. On the contrary, it is necessary to develop new approaches so as to reach the environment’s full potential, as in the case of the “distributed software components on <b>n-tier</b> <b>architectures</b> ” model. Due to its complexity, this model requires technological platforms –like J 2 EE – in order to support the development of such applications. In spite of the power that the J 2 EE platform provides, some organizations refuse to develop applications under this platform because it requires a deep knowledge of the J 2 EE technology and its design patterns. In this article we propose a model based on the Model-View-Controller paradigm and built over the integration of open source frameworks (StrutsEJB-Cocoon-Struts) which are used by a wide community but have not been managed as a global solution.
