5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha was a {{streamlined}} {{passenger train}} operated by Amtrak between Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington, in the United States. It operated from 1971 to 1979. The train was {{a successor to}} the Northern Pacific Railway's <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Limited and Mainstreeter, although it used {{the route of the}} Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad ("Milwaukee Road") east of Minneapolis–Saint Paul. The train's name combined the <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Limited with the Milwaukee Road's famed Hiawathas. Created {{at the behest of the}} United States Congress, the <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha enjoyed an uncertain existence before being discontinued in 1979. Since then there have been several attempts to restore the service, without success.|$|E

5|$|On November 14, 1971, Amtrak {{formally}} named {{this service}} the <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha, with a tri-weekly schedule between Chicago and Spokane {{independent of the}} Empire Builder. In Spokane it combined with the Empire Builder {{for the trip to}} Seattle. On the other four days of the week the train terminated in Minneapolis. Amtrak initially named the Minneapolis train Hiawatha, but adopted the Twin Cities Hiawatha name on January 16, 1972. Amtrak reverted to Hiawatha on October 29, and this name remained until the <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha went daily {{for the first time on}} May 19, 1974.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} subspecies macrantha {{is found}} in two distinct regions on the far <b>north</b> <b>coast</b> of New South Wales; the first from Crowdy Bay on the Mid <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> northwards to Hat Head National Park north of Port Macquarie, and then from Yuraygir National Park north to Kingscliff {{just south of the}} Queensland border. This variety is more strictly coastal with most populations being found within two kilometres of the coast, or in swampy areas. It may be associated with Banksia oblongifolia.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that the <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} Santo Domingo early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the <b>north</b> <b>coast</b> of Honduras, where he was beset by a storm. In order to lighten the load of his ships, he ordered that a number of horses be thrown overboard. This event resulted in the place being named Puerto de Caballos ("Port of Horses"). González Dávila landed on the <b>north</b> <b>coast,</b> with authorisation to conquer Honduras from the king, after having sent the royal fifth of his proceeds from campaigns in Panama and Nicaragua, a sum totalling 112,524 gold castellanos. Puerto de Caballos later developed into an important staging point for the colonisation of the region.|$|E

5|$|In July {{an attempt}} by Representative (and future Vice President) Al Gore (D-Tennessee) to impose a one-year {{moratorium}} on the proposed system-wide cuts failed 214-197. In the end the Senate approved a smaller cutback, citing a 24% spike in Amtrak ridership after an oil shock during the summer, but the <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha remained on the chopping block. In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) and Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E

5|$|As the 1950s began, {{demand on}} the Colorado River – which forms {{the border of}} California and Arizona and {{provided}} most of Southern California's water – was moving toward unsustainable levels. The Bureau of Reclamation restarted its surveys of the Trinity River basin {{as part of a}} larger proposal to move water from northern to southern parts of the state, and compensate for the shortages on the Colorado. The United Western Investigation, in 1951, proposed the damming of nearly every river in the <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> region of California, chiefly the Trinity, Klamath and Eel. The Ah Pah Dam would have flooded the canyons of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers to form the largest reservoir in California. These grandiose plans culminated in the Pacific Southwest Water Plan of 1964, which sought to comprehensively link the water systems of California and the rest of the Colorado River Basin. One of the key projects was an aqueduct to transport <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> water to the Imperial Valley, reducing its reliance on water from the Colorado River. However, with the exception of the upper Trinity River project, none of these dam and diversion projects were ever realized.|$|E
