40|$|A design {{technique}} {{based on}} optimizing the supply voltage for simultaneously achieving {{energy efficiency and}} temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is proposed in this paper. The supply voltages that suppress the propagation delay variations when the temperature fluctuates are identified for a diverse set of circuits in 180 and 65 nm CMOS technologies. Circuits display temperature variation insensitive propagation delay when operated at a supply voltage 44 - 47 % lower than the <b>nominal</b> supply <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> DD = 1. 8 V) in a 180 nm CMOS technology. Similarly, the optimum supply voltages are 67 - 68 % lower than the <b>nominal</b> supply <b>voltage</b> (<b>V</b> DD = 1. 0 V) in a 65 nm CMOS technology. At scaled supply voltages, integrated circuits consume lower power {{at the cost of}} reduced speed. The proposed design methodology of optimizing the supply voltage for temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is, therefore, particularly attractive for low-power applications with relaxed speed requirements. A new design methodology based on threshold voltage optimization for achieving temperature variation insensitive circuit speed is also evaluated. The energy per cycle and the propagation delay at the supply and threshold voltages providing temperature variation insensitive circuit performance, minimum energy-delay product, and minimum energy are compared. Results indicate that low-power operation and temperature variation tolerance can be simultaneously achieved with the proposed techniques. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|As {{the world}} moves toward {{greenhouse}} gas reduction, there is increasingly active work around Li-ion chemistry-based batteries as an energy source for electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and smart grids. In these applications, the battery management system (BMS) requires an accurate online {{estimation of the}} state of charge (SOC) in a battery pack. This estimation is difficult, especially after substantial battery aging. In order to address this problem, this paper utilizes SOC estimation of Li-ion battery packs using a fuzzy-improved extended Kalman filter (fuzzy-IEKF) for Li-ion cells, regardless of their age. The proposed approach introduces a fuzzy method with a new class and associated membership function that determines an approximate initial value applied to SOC estimation. Subsequently, the EKF method is used by considering the single unit model for the battery pack to estimate the SOC for following periods of battery use. This approach uses an adaptive model algorithm to update the model for each single cell in the battery pack. To verify the accuracy of the estimation method, tests are done on a LiFePO 4 aged battery pack consisting of 120 cells connected in series with a <b>nominal</b> <b>voltage</b> of 432 <b>V...</b>|$|R

40|$|Future {{neutrino}} physics experiments {{intend to}} use unprecedented volumes of liquid argon to fill a time projection chamber in an underground facility. To increase performance, integrated readout electronics should work inside the cryostat. Due to the scale and cost associated with evacuating and filling the cryostat, the electronics will be unserviceable {{for the duration of}} the experiment. Therefore, the lifetimes of these circuits must be well in excess of 20 years. The principle mechanism for lifetime degradation of MOSFET devices and circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures is via hot carrier degradation. Choosing a process technology that is, as much as possible, immune to such degradation and developing design techniques to avoid exposure to such damage are the goals. This requires careful investigation and a basic understanding of the mechanisms that underlie hot carrier degradation and the secondary effects they cause in circuits. In this work, commercially available 130 nm nMOS transistors operating at cryogenic temperatures are investigated. The results show that the difference in lifetime for room temperature operation and cryogenic operation for this process are not great and the lifetimes at both 300 K and at 77 K can be projected to more than 20 years at the <b>nominal</b> <b>voltage</b> (1. 5 <b>V)</b> for this technology...|$|R

Many parameters like temperature have an influence on the characteristic of the battery and this phenomenon becomes more serious in an electric vehicle. In this paper, the application of a boost DC/DC converter to the battery system of high power for online AC impedance identification is proposed. The function of the converter is to inject a current excitation signal into the battery at work and the normal output current is drawn by a load. Through analyzing the average state space equations and deriving the small signal model of the converter, the gain function is deduced of the fluctuated current signal against the fluctuated duty cycle which controls the converter. The control algorithm is designed and the system model is verified using Matlab/Simulink with respect to the disturbance current signal generation, the gain function and its variation with frequency range. Then the converter is designed and implemented to conduct the experiment on a power battery of 175 Ah and the <b>nominal</b> <b>voltage</b> is 100 <b>V.</b> The measured AC impedance of several single cells is presented and it demonstrates the feasibility of applying this DC/DC converter to the practical electric vehicle...|$|R
