500|$|Duff {{explained}} of the album's title, [...] "I'm {{older and}} more mature <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was when I made my last record, but I don't think I know it all. Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. I hope I always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's not {{something that you can}} be given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's something that you have to work on." ...|$|E
500|$|Crane {{pushed himself}} to write feverishly {{during the first}} months at Brede; he told his {{publisher}} that he was [...] "doing more work <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> have at any other period in my life". [...] His health worsened, and by late 1899 he was asking friends about health resorts. [...] The Monster and Other Stories was in production and War Is Kind, his second collection of poems, {{was published in the}} United States in May. [...] None of his books after The Red Badge of Courage had sold well, and he bought a typewriter to spur output. [...] Active Service, a novella based on Crane's correspondence experience, was published in October. [...] The New York Times reviewer questioned [...] "whether the author of 'Active Service' himself really sees anything remarkable in his newspapery hero." ...|$|E
500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

500|$|The next {{task was}} to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, or SIC, a {{computer}} that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While {{the failure of the}} SIC did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major {{task was to}} install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the [...] Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope {{at the end of its}} life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was when I came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E

[...] In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, he responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: [...] "My analysis was wrong and I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm not pleased about it at all." [...] With regard to his trust in the government, he said, [...] "I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was at that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 29, 2011 Walker {{announced}} that he was considering a return to the NFL. [...] "I've told everyone that at 50 I might try football again to show people I can do that," [...] Walker said. [...] "I want to be the George Foreman of football, come back and do that one more time... The two teams I would come back to play for are Minnesota or Atlanta. It would probably be Atlanta because that's home for me." [...] According to Walker, his mixed martial arts training made him, [...] "a much better-conditioned athlete now than when I was playing football. I'm 48 and in better shape <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was when I was in my early 20s, playing football." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2014 The Juliana Hatfield Three was {{reformed}} {{after two}} decades of hiatus, and Hatfield, drummer Todd Philips, and bassist Dean Fisher began practicing new material for an album. The album marked the band's first release in twenty two years, since their LP Become What You Are in 1993. Stated Hatfield about the new album, [...] "We haven’t totally reinvented the wheel or anything," [...] and that the tracks exhibit the [...] "stuff I am sort of known for, I guess. But I am a lot more confident <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was then with the first album. And I had more fun recording this one." [...] The twelve tracks for Whatever, My Love were recorded at Nuthouse Recording in Hoboken, New Jersey, with Beaujour and Hatfield co-producing the project.|$|E
