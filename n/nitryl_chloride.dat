Significant quantities of ClNO 2, up to 800 pptv, were measured at a mountaintop field site in Hessen, southwest Germany.

ClNO 2 persisted in measurable quantities until early afternoons on days with low photolysis frequencies. As a consequence, early morning production rates of Cl atoms could significantly exceed the production of OH via ozone photolysis, likely leading to increased O- 3 production. Citation: Phillips, G.

40|$|The cycling of halogen {{compounds}} {{in the lower}} atmosphere is poorly understood. It is known that halogens such as chlorine, bromine and iodine are converted from halides, which are relatively inert, to reactive radicals.

However, the processes by which halides are converted to reactive halogens are uncertain. Here, we report atmospheric measurements of <b>nitryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> an active halogen, along the southeast coastline of the United States and near Houston, Texas.

Both of these heterogeneous reactions proceed at the liquid/vapor interface by an S N 2 mechanism where the nucleophile is chloride ion formed from the ionization of HCl on the aqueous surface. The film of water enhances the otherwise very slow gas phase reaction to occur by (1) stabilizing and localizing the adsorbed N 2 O 5 or NO 2 dimer so it is physically accessible for reaction, (2) ionizing the impinging HCl, and (3) activating the adsorbed oxide for nucleophilic attack by chloride. Though both nitrogen oxychloride products are produced by S N 2 reactions, the N 2 O 5 mechanism is unusual in that the electrophilic N atom to be attacked oscillates between the two normally equivalent NO 2 groups. Chloride ion is found to react with N 2 O 5 less efficiently than with N 2 O 4. The simulations provide an explanation for this. These substitution/elimination mechanisms are new for NO x/y chemistry on thin water films and cannot be derived from small cluster models...|$|E

Wind and waves kick up spray, and bits of sodium {{chloride}} [...] common table salt [...] can permeate the air. It is believed {{that as much as}} 10 billion metric tons of chloride enters the air mass through this process each year, but just a tiny fraction [...] perhaps one-third of 1 percent [...] does anything but fall back to the surface. The bit of chloride lingering in the air can react with nitrogen oxides, formed when fuel is burned at high temperature, to form <b>nitryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> a forerunner of chlorine atoms, the most reactive form of chlorine. Those atoms can contribute to smog formation in coastal areas. Now, in a surprise, researchers have found that this chemistry thought to be restricted to sea spray occurs at similar rates in air above Boulder, Colo., nearly 900 miles away from any ocean. What's more, local air quality measurements taken in a number of national parks across the United States imply similar conditions in or near other non-coastal metropolitan areas. "It's there. We know it's there. But we don't have a good handle on where that chloride comes from, " said Joel Thornton, a University of Washington associate professor of atmospheric sciences and lead author of a paper documenting the findings, published March 11 in Nature...|$|E
40|$|The {{unimolecular}} {{decomposition of}} <b>nitryl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{was investigated in}} the pressure range 10 to 500 mm. and the temperature range 141 to 205 °C. Relative efficiencies of foreign gases were found to vary slightly, if at all, over this range of conditions. The reaction was observed to be partially heterogeneous in the Pyrex reaction cell used. The results of this work are in agreement with those of Volpe and Cordes at low pressures and with those of Casaletto at high pressures. The discrepancies between the relative efficiencies obtained by Volpe and those obtained Schumacher and Sprenger are probably due to effects of heterogeneity {{in the work of}} Schumacher and Sprenger. The data obtained in this work were interpreted in terms of the Lindemann mechanisms. Relative efficiencies were calculated by means of the Schwartz-Slavsky-Herzfeld theory and the Landau Teller theory; the latter theory gave results in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Relative efficiencies of the noble gases and of carbon tetrachloride for the decomposition of nitrogen pentoxide at 50 °C in the pressure range 0. 1 to 3. 0 mm., are reported in Part Two of this thesis. It was found that deactivation of activated reactant molecules does not occur on every collision. Part Three of this thesis, "Theoretical Pre-exponential Factors for Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactions," contains its own abstract. Pre-exponential factors were calculated by means of Eyring's activated complex theory for ten bimolecular reactions.

40|$|The {{chlorine}} atom (Cl·) {{has a high}} potential to perturb atmospheric photochemistry by oxidizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but the exact role it plays in the polluted troposphere remains unclear. The Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) is a near explicit mechanism that has been widely applied in the atmospheric chemistry research. While it addresses comprehensively the chemistry initiated by the OH, O 3 and NO 3 radicals, its representation of the Cl· chemistry is incomplete as it only considers the reactions for alkanes. In this paper, we develop a more comprehensive Cl· chemistry module that can be directly incorporated within the MCM framework. A suite of 199 chemical reactions describes the Cl·-initiated degradation of alkenes, aromatics, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and some organic acids and nitrates, along with the inorganic chemistry involving Cl· and its precursors. To demonstrate the potential influence of the new chemistry module, it was incorporated into a MCM box model to evaluate the impacts of <b>nitryl</b> <b>chloride</b> (ClNO 2), a product of nocturnal halogen activation by nitrogen oxides (NO x), on the following-day's atmospheric photochemistry. With constraints of recent observations collected at a coastal site in Hong Kong, southern China, the modeling analyses suggest that the Cl· produced from ClNO 2 photolysis may substantially enhance the atmospheric oxidative capacity, VOC oxidation, and O 3 formation, particularly {{in the early morning}} period. The results demonstrate the critical need for photochemical models to include more fully chlorine chemistry in order to better understand the atmospheric photochemistry in polluted environments subject to intense emissions of NO x, VOCs and chlorine-containing constituents...|$|E
40|$|Dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5) and its {{heterogeneous}} uptake product, <b>nitryl</b> <b>chloride</b> (ClNO 2), play {{important roles}} in the nocturnal boundary layer chemistry. To understand the abundances and chemistry of N 2 O 5 and ClNO 2 in the polluted urban atmosphere in North China, field measurements were conducted by deploying a chemical ionization mass spectrometer in urban Ji'nan in September 2014. The observed surface N 2 O 5 concentrations were relatively low, with an average nocturnal value of 22 pptv, although the source of NO 3 was rather strong, i. e., the NO 2 and O- 3 were at very high levels. The,N 2 O 5 concentration peaked in the early evening, which was associated with thermal power plant plumes and residual 03. Nocturnal N 2 O 5 was lost very rapidly, mainly through heterogeneous reactions on aerosol surfaces. The estimated N 2 O 5 uptake coefficient was {{in the range of}} 0. 042 - 0. 092, among the highest values obtained from ground based field measurements. The fast heterogeneous reaction of N 2 O 5 on high loadings of aerosols generated relatively high levels of ClNO 2, with an average nocturnal concentration of 132 pptv. Despite the rich chloride content in aerosols, the ClNO 2 product yield was low, 0. 014 and 0. 082 in two nighttime cases, much lower than the calculated values from the experiment-derived parameterization. The suppressed chlorine activation in polluted urban atmospheres was possibly associated with the reduced hygroscopicity, solubility, and activity of chloride in complex ambient aerosols.

40|$|Dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅), {{a primary}} nocturnal {{reservoir}} for NOx (NOx [equivalence] NO + NO₂), readily undergoes heterogeneous reaction on aqueous interfaces. These reactions potentially alter the chemical, physical, and hygroscopic properties of ambient particles, and ultimately their climate impact. Upon reacting with aqueous chloride-containing surfaces, such as sea spray, <b>nitryl</b> <b>chloride</b> (ClNO₂) is produced. ClNO₂ {{is capable of}} extending the lifetime of NOx and inducing ozone production in high NOx environments via chlorine radical creation. The extent to which N₂O₅ reactivity impacts atmospheric oxidant loadings depends on the heterogeneous reaction rate of N₂O₅ with a given surface. This, in turn, is directly influenced by interfacial chemical composition, morphology, and phase state. In this dissertation, I describe advances {{in the understanding of}} how organic and inorganic constituents at atmospheric interfaces regulate N₂O₅ reactivity. First, I developed an observation-based framework for assessing the aerosol particle mixing state role on N₂O₅ heterogeneous reaction kinetics using simultaneous measurements of the N₂O₅ reactive uptake coefficient to ambient aerosol with direct measurements of aerosol mixing state before and after reaction. Second, as part of the NSF Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment, I extended the use of a novel Marine Aerosol Reference Tank (MART) capable of generating nascent sea-spray aerosol, to determine heterogeneous reaction kinetics. Here, the MART was doped with ocean organic mimics to assess how organics present in the sea surface microlayer (SSML), and subsequently ejected into sea-spray, impact N₂O₅ reaction kinetics. Third, I conducted laboratory studies to investigate suppressed ClNO₂ production rates at the ocean surface, using ambient seawater from various locations and under varied biological conditions, along with model sea salt solutions with proxy organics. This study was designed to determine the role of unsaturated organics and surface-enhanced inorganic ions in the SSML in altering ClNO₂ production rate...|$|E
