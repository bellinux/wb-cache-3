25|$|Prostate MRI is {{also used}} for {{surgical}} planning for men undergoing robotic prostatectomy. It has also shown to help surgeons decide whether to resect or spare the <b>neurovascular</b> bundle, determine return to urinary continence, and help assess surgical difficulty.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neurovascular.</b> This {{syndrome}} typically {{occurs at}} absorbed doses greater than 30Gy (3000rad), {{though it may}} occur at 10Gy (1000 rad). It presents with neurological symptoms such as dizziness, headache, or decreased level of consciousness, occurring within minutes to a few hours, and with an absence of vomiting. It is invariably fatal.|$|E
25|$|Concentrations of oxy- and {{deoxyhemoglobin}} can {{be measured}} continuously, regionally and noninvasively using NIRS. NIRS can be used both on the head as on muscles. This technique is often used for research in e.g. elite sports training, ergonomics, rehabilitation, patient monitoring, neonatal research, functional brain monitoring, brain computer interface, urology (bladder contraction), neurology (<b>Neurovascular</b> coupling) and more.|$|E
25|$|Several {{national}} and international organizations have been created to further the research and dissemination of the CCSVI theory, such as the International Society for <b>Neurovascular</b> Disease and the National CCSVI Society of Canada. They are working together with already existing organizations like the International Union of Phlebology (Union internationale de phlébologie-UIP- in French, its original working language) of which Zamboni is a member. The UIP for example proposed that developmental abnormalities were {{the primary cause of}} CCSVI.|$|E
25|$|The {{brachial plexus}} is {{formed by the}} ventral rami of C5-C6-C7-C8-T1, {{occasionally}} with small contributions by C4 and T2. There are multiple approaches to blockade of the brachial plexus, beginning proximally with the interscalene block and continuing distally with the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks. The concept behind all of these approaches to the brachial plexus is {{the existence of a}} sheath encompassing the <b>neurovascular</b> bundle extending from the deep cervical fascia to slightly beyond the borders of the axilla.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{application}} of piezoelectric ultrasound sources is piezoelectric surgery, {{also known as}} piezosurgery. Piezosurgery is a minimally invasive technique that aims to cut a target tissue with little damage to neighboring tissues. For example, Hoigne et al. reported its use in hand surgery for the cutting of bone, using frequencies in the range 25–29kHz, causing microvibrations of 60–210μm. It {{has the ability to}} cut mineralized tissue without cutting <b>neurovascular</b> tissue and other soft tissue, thereby maintaining a blood-free operating area, better visibility and greater precision.|$|E
25|$|The newest, 41st {{edition of}} Gray's Anatomy was {{published}} on 25 September 2015 by Elsevier in both print and on-line versions, {{and is the}} first edition to have enhanced on-line content including anatomical videos and a bonus Gray's imaging library. The latest edition also has 24 specially invited on-line commentaries on controversial anatomical topics as diverse as advances in electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy; the <b>neurovascular</b> bundles of the prostate; stem cells in regenerative medicine; the anatomy of facial ageing; and technical aspects and applications of diagnostic radiology.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{aforementioned}} descriptions {{are of the}} incisions used to address the breast skin envelope, the surgical management of the breast tissue (parenchyma) is a separate consideration, including maintenance of the <b>neurovascular</b> integrity of the nipple-areola complex. The degree of hemispheric elevation of the nipple-areola complex determines the type of pedicle (superior, inferior, medial) that will provide the best venous and arterial vascular supply to the nipple-areola complex. Therefore, {{the application of the}} superior pedicle approach affords the surgeon greater procedural flexibility in determining the incision site for emplacing the breast implant, but it limits the possible degree of elevation of the nipple. Application of the inferior pedicle approach affords a greater degree of nipple-areola complex elevation, but makes difficult emplacing the breast implant, and the subsequent contouring of the breast. Application of the medial pedicle approach preserves breast sensation with a reliable venous and arterial vascular supply, and avoids the technical and procedural limitations of the superior pedicle and the inferior pedicle approaches.|$|E
500|$|Non-dental {{causes of}} {{toothache}} {{are much less}} common as compared with dental causes. [...] In a toothache of <b>neurovascular</b> origin, pain is reported in the teeth {{in conjunction with a}} migraine. Local and distant structures (such as ear, brain, carotid artery, or heart) can also refer pain to the teeth. Other non-dental causes of toothache include myofascial pain (muscle pain) and angina pectoris (which classically refers pain to the lower jaw). [...] Very rarely, toothache can be psychogenic in origin.|$|E
500|$|The {{axillary}} arch is an arch-shaped anatomical {{variant of}} the latissimus dorsi muscle of the human back. Its shape varies, but its defining characteristics are its origin from the latissimus dorsi muscle, its insertion close to or on the upper [...] part of the humerus, and that it crosses the <b>neurovascular</b> bundle associated with the axillary nerve from dorsomedial to ventrolateral. Its size may vary from [...] in length and [...] in width. The axillary arch may be seen when the arm is abducted and the palms put {{on the back of}} the head. An impression can be seen on the medial side of the axilla.|$|E
500|$|The pudendal nerve is {{difficult}} to visualize on routine CT or MR imaging, however under CT guidance, a needle may be placed adjacent to the pudendal <b>neurovascular</b> bundle. [...] The ischial spine, an easily identifiable structure on CT, is used {{as the level of}} injection. [...] A spinal needle is advanced via the gluteal muscles and advanced within several millimeters of the ischial spine. [...] Contrast (X-ray dye) is then injected, highlighting the nerve in the canal and allowing for confirmation of correct needle placement. [...] The nerve may then be injected with cortisone and local anesthetic to confirm and also treat chronic pain of the external genitalia (known as vulvodynia in females), pelvic and anorectal pain.|$|E

2500|$|Classically acute {{radiation}} syndrome {{is divided into}} three main presentations: hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and neurological/vascular. These syndromes {{may or may not be}} preceded by a prodrome. The speed of onset of symptoms is related to radiation exposure, with greater doses resulting in a shorter delay in symptom onset. These presentations presume whole-body exposure and many of them are markers which are not valid if the entire body has not been exposed. Each syndrome requires that the tissue showing the syndrome itself be exposed. The hematopoietic syndrome requires exposure of the areas of bone marrow actively forming blood elements (i.e., the pelvis and sternum in adults). The <b>neurovascular</b> symptoms require exposure of the brain. The gastrointestinal syndrome is not seen if the stomach and intestines are not exposed to radiation. Some areas affected are: ...|$|E
2500|$|Scientists and bioethicists have {{debated whether}} it is {{acceptable}} to continue to use the atlas for instructional purposes in light of its possible provenance. Opponents have asserted that any use of the atlas makes the user complicit in Nazi crimes and that modern technology, such as the Visible Human Project (based on the tomographic dissection of a man executed in the United States), will make the atlas redundant if it has not done so already. Proponents have countered that the knowledge gained from the atlas can be ethically separated from its origins nor can it be in some cases easily replaced by modern technology or other atlases. [...] " [...] atlas {{is still one of}} the very best in terms of accuracy, showing levels of detail concerning fascia and <b>neurovascular</b> structures that are of direct relevance for the actual dissection process," [...] says Sabine Hildebrandt, a Michigan anatomy professor and German native who has researched him and other Nazi-era anatomists thoroughly.|$|E
