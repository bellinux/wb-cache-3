There {{he was able to}} save the lives of two children during a period he volunteered one day a week. But he found he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> more substantial than just be one doctor in one place of need. He initiated Project Concern to organize the work and it was incorporated in 1961. He first focused on Casa de Todos.|$|E
25|$|The {{investors in}} the Lowell textile {{companies}} decided they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about their transportation situation. They looked toward the railroads budding in England, and now in America, for inspiration and took operations on the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad and the construction ongoing on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Baltimore & Ohio {{and a handful of}} other ventures as omens and inspiration. A railroad could run year round, was expandable with as many tracks as they might need, and could use the new locomotives that were being highly praised in England at the heart of recent news stories. By 1829 the B was testing a locally produced steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb, and opened for passenger operations in May 1830. With well-publicized and ambitious plans to scale one of the gaps of the Allegheny and cross the Ohio River, and New York and Pennsylvania's canal mania sprinkled with railroads, Massachusetts and New England investors were looking at bold plans everywhere.|$|E
25|$|England {{obviously}} <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> {{to maintain}} their hold on the Ashes and three changes {{were made to the}} team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his finger at Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.|$|E

500|$|On March 31, 1967, {{while the}} Experience waited {{to perform at}} the London Astoria, Hendrix and Chandler {{discussed}} {{ways in which they}} could increase the band's media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> more dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: [...] "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: [...] "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar". Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid. During the show, Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire {{at the end of a}} 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt, members of London's press labeled Hendrix the [...] "Black Elvis" [...] and the [...] "Wild Man of Borneo".|$|E
500|$|By 1970, the Who had {{obtained}} significant critical and commercial success, {{but they had}} started to become detached from their original audience. The mod movement had vanished, and the original followers from Shepherd's Bush had grown up and acquired jobs and families. The group had started to drift apart from manager Kit Lambert due to his preoccupation with their label, Track Records. They had been touring since the release of Tommy the previous May, with a set that contained most of that album, but realized that millions had now seen their live performances, and Pete Townshend in particular recognized that they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new. A single, [...] "The Seeker", and a live album, Live at Leeds were released in 1970, and an EP of new material ("Water", [...] "Naked Eye", [...] "I Don't Even Know Myself", [...] "Postcard" [...] and [...] "Now I'm a Farmer") was recorded, but not released as the band felt {{it would not be}} a satisfactory follow-up to Tommy.|$|E
500|$|The Grande Armée d'Allemagne {{was now in}} {{a perilous}} {{position}} of two wings separated by [...] and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Berthier, the French marshals, and the rank-and-file were all evidently frustrated at the seemingly pointless marches and counter marches. On the 16th, the Austrian advance guard had beaten back the Bavarians near Landshut and had secured a good crossing place over the Isar by evening. Napoleon finally arrived in Donauwörth on the 17th after a furious trip from Paris. Charles congratulated himself on a successful opening to the campaign and planned to destroy Davout's and Lefebvre's isolated corps in a double-pincer manoeuvre. When Napoleon realised that significant Austrian forces were already over the Isar and were marching towards the Danube, he insisted that the entire French army deploy behind the Ilm River in a bataillon carré within 48 hours, all in hopes of undoing Berthier's mistakes and achieving a successful concentration. His orders were unrealistic because he underestimated the number of Austrian troops that were heading for Davout; Napoleon believed Charles only had a single corps over the Isar, but in fact, the Austrians had five corps lumbering towards Regensburg, {{a grand total of}} 80,000 men. Napoleon <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> quickly to save his left flank from collapsing.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the Ottoman sources do {{not give}} credit to these claims. They present the {{argument}} that the system of [...] "Millet" [...] and State and Religion preserved the Empire for centuries. A strong argument behind rejecting the [...] "clash of civilizations" [...] originated from the analysis of the activity timetable. The clashes collected in distinct events. Each event had high density with distinct beginning and an end. There was no single period that a thousand deaths were spread {{over a long period of}} time. This fact supports the [...] "revolutionary view" [...] instead of clash of civilizations, which showed the European powers the true nature of Ottoman rule. European powers <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about these events through the international agreements. Assuredly Europe would do nothing if those thousand deaths were spread over years.|$|E
2500|$|His driver, Bobby Unser, {{had been}} testing a new Gurney-designed car at Phoenix International Raceway, and {{was unhappy with}} the car's {{performance}} on the track. Gurney <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to restore his driver's confidence before the race, and recalled experiments conducted in the 1950s by certain racing teams with spoilers affixed {{to the rear of}} the bodywork to cancel lift. (At that level of development, the spoilers were not thought of as potential performance enhancers—merely devices to cancel out destabilizing and potentially deadly aerodynamic lift.) Gurney decided to try adding a [...] "spoiler" [...] to the trailing edge of the rear wing. The device was fabricated and fitted in under an hour, but Unser's test laps with the modified wing turned in equally poor times. When Unser was able to speak to Gurney in confidence, he disclosed that the lap times with the new wing were slowed because it was now producing so much downforce that the car was understeering. All that was needed was to balance this by adding additional downforce in front.|$|E
2500|$|Things {{changed for}} O'Brien in 1991, when in quick succession, an {{engagement}} fell through; Lookwell was not picked up; and, burned out, he quit Saturday Night Live. [...] "I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't {{come back to}} work and I just <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else," [...] O'Brien recalled. [...] "I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me." [...] Mike Reiss and Al Jean, then dual showrunners of The Simpsons, called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls [...] "everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired." [...] O'Brien {{was one of the first}} hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills. He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000, O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show.|$|E

2500|$|The {{function}} of genes {{is to provide}} the information <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make molecules called proteins in cells. Cells are the smallest independent parts of organisms: the human body contains about 100 trillion cells, while very small organisms like bacteria are just one single cell. A cell is like a miniature and very complex factory that {{can make all the}} parts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> produce a copy of itself, which happens when cells divide. There is a simple division of labor in cells—genes give instructions and proteins carry out these instructions, tasks [...] like building a new copy of a cell, or repairing damage. Each type of protein is a specialist that only does one job, so if a cell <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new, it must make a new protein <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this job. Similarly, if a cell <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> faster or slower than before, it makes more or less of the protein responsible. Genes tell cells what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> by telling them which proteins to make and in what amounts.|$|R

50|$|Life {{for women}} in the early 1880s was difficult. Jobs were scarce, and {{prostitution}} was rampant. Girls as young as 13 were selling themselves or being sold for money.

5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|R
50|$|Gaffney is more idealistic than Kibre.
