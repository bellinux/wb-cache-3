5|$|Leaving 12,000 {{troops to}} guard Mannheim, Charles repositioned his troops among his two armies and swiftly moved north against Jourdan. The Archduke {{defeated}} the Army of Sambre and Meuse at the Battle of Wetzlar on 15 June 1796 and Jourdan lost <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> recrossing {{to the safety}} of the west shore of the Rhine at Neuwied. Following up, the Austrians clashed with Kléber's divisions at Uckerath, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the French for a loss of only 600. After his success, Charles left 35,000 men with Wartensleben, 30,000 more in Mainz and the other fortresses and moved south with 20,000 troops to help Latour. Kléber withdrew into the Düsseldorf defenses.|$|E
5|$|Ole Miss wasted <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> scoring, as Steve Hindman {{turned the}} first play {{of the second half}} into a 79-yard for a touchdown. The Rebels now held a 2117 lead, and Virginia Tech never {{threatened}} afterward. Ole Miss defender Bob Bailey intercepted a Virginia Tech pass {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter and returned it 70 yards for another Mississippi touchdown. The Rebels also added a pair of field goals to their score, and rolled to a 3417 victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Riley had {{previously}} presented a fictionalized version of Mary Alice Smith in his short story “Where Is Mary Alice Smith?,” published in The Indianapolis Journal of 30 September 1882. In it, Mary Alice arrives at her benefactor family’s home and wastes <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> telling the children a grisly story of murder by decapitation {{and then later}} introduces them to her soldier friend Dave who is soon killed upon going off to war. The plot of this short story was heavily incorporated into the 1918 movie adaptation as well as Johnny Gruelle’s 1921 storybook.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan wasted <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> organising his new ministry, taking several {{portfolios}} for himself, {{and again}} taking {{the position of}} Treasurer of South Australia. Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became {{the face of the}} Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans. Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the next day, 15 September, Belisarius drew up the army for battle before the city walls, but as no enemy appeared, he led his army into the city, after again exhorting his troops to show discipline. The Roman army {{received}} a warm welcome from the populace, which was favourably impressed by its restraint. While Belisarius himself took possession of the royal palace, seated himself on the king's throne, and consumed the dinner which Gelimer had confidently ordered to be ready for his own victorious return, the fleet entered the Lake of Tunis and the army was billeted throughout the city. The remaining Vandals were rounded up and placed under guard to prevent them from causing trouble. Belisarius dispatched Solomon to Constantinople to bear the emperor news of the victory, but expecting an imminent re-appearance of Gelimer with his army, he lost <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> repairing the largely ruined walls of the city and rendering it capable of sustaining a siege.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{competition}} between {{the kingdom of the}} western Deccan and those of the Tamil country came to the fore in the 11th century over the acutely contested fertile river valleys in the doab region of the Krishna and Godavari River called Vengi (modern coastal Andhra Pradesh). The Western Chalukyas and the Chola Dynasty fought many bitter wars over control of this strategic resource. The imperial Cholas gained power {{during the time of the}} famous king Rajaraja Chola I and the crown prince Rajendra Chola I. The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi were cousins of the Western Chalukyas but became increasingly influenced by the Cholas through their marital ties with the Tamil kingdom. As this was against the interests of the Western Chalukyas, they wasted <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> involving themselves politically and militarily in Vengi. When King Satyashraya succeeded Tailapa II to the throne, he was able to protect his kingdom from Chola aggression as well as his northern territories in Konkan and Gujarat although his control over Vengi was shaky. His successor, Jayasimha II, fought many battles with the Cholas in the south around c. 1020–21 when both these powerful kingdoms struggled to choose the Vengi king. Shortly thereafter in c. 1024, Jayasimha II subdued the Paramara of central India and the rebellious Yadava King Bhillama.|$|E
