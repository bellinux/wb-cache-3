5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder <b>network</b> <b>topology</b> using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E

By embedding the market {{into a larger}} collection of <b>network</b> <b>topologies,</b> in particular, a class of scale-free networks, we ex-tend the early analysis built upon a class of ring networks. To facilitate {{the study of the}} impacts of <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> upon market demand, various measures concerning social welfare (the consumer’s surplus), the avalanche effect, and the hysteresis effect, are formally established. Com-parisons based on these measures show that <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> matter, and their implied differences will remain even when the network size be-comes large...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we first conduct {{simulations}} of the parallel evolutionary peer-to-peer (P 2 P) networking technique (referred to as P-EP 2 P) that we previously proposed using models of realistic environments to examine if P-EP 2 P is practical. Environments are here represented by what users have and want in the network, and P-EP 2 P adapts the P 2 P <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> to the present environment in an evolutionary manner. The simulation results show that P-EP 2 P is hard to adapt the <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> to some realistic environments. Then, based on the discussions of the results, we propose a strategy for better adaptability of P-EP 2 P to the realistic environments. The strategy first judges if evolutionary adaptation of the <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> is {{likely to occur in}} the present environment, and if it judges so, it actually tries to achieve evolutionary adaptation of the <b>network</b> <b>topologies.</b> Otherwise, it brings random change to the <b>network</b> <b>topologies.</b> The simulation results indicate that P-EP 2 P with the proposed strategy can better adapt the <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> to the realistic environments. The main contribution of the study is to present such a promising way to realize an evolvable network in which the evolution direction is given by users...|$|R

40|$|Many complex {{networks}} {{demonstrate a}} phenomenon of striking degree correlations, i. e., a node tends to link to other nodes with similar (or dissimilar) degrees. From the perspective of degree correlations, this paper attempts to characterize topological structures of urban street networks. We adopted six urban street networks (three European and three North American), and converted them into <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> in which nodes and edges respectively represent individual streets and street intersections, and compared the <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> to three reference <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> (biological, technological, and social). The urban street <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> (with the exception of Manhattan) showed a consistent pattern that distinctly differs from the three reference <b>networks.</b> The <b>topologies</b> of urban street networks lack striking degree correlations in general. Through reshuffling the <b>network</b> <b>topologies</b> towards for example maximum or minimum degree correlations while retaining the initial degree distributions, we found that all the surrogate topologies of the urban street networks, {{as well as the}} reference ones, tended to deviate from small world properties. This implies that the initial degree correlations do not have any positive or negative effect on the networks' performance or functions.

Guideways are arranged in a <b>network</b> <b>topology,</b> with all stations located on sidings, and with frequent merge/diverge points.

25|$|There are {{primarily}} two ways that networks can evolve, {{both of which}} can occur simultaneously. The first is that <b>network</b> <b>topology</b> can be changed by the addition or subtraction of nodes (genes) or parts of the network (modules) may be expressed in different contexts. The Drosophila Hippo signaling pathway provides a good example. The Hippo signaling pathway controls both mitotic growth and post-mitotic cellular differentiation. Recently {{it was found that}} the network the Hippo signaling pathway operates in differs between these two functions which in turn changes the behavior of the Hippo signaling pathway. This suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context. Thus, changing <b>network</b> <b>topology</b> can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the final output of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element. Such variation in strength of network edges has been shown to underlie between species variation in vulva cell fate patterning of Caenorhabditis worms.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{regulatory}} {{networks are}} generally {{thought to be}} made up of a few highly connected nodes (hubs) and many poorly connected nodes nested within a hierarchical regulatory regime. Thus gene regulatory networks approximate a hierarchical scale free <b>network</b> <b>topology.</b> This is consistent with the view that most genes have limited pleiotropy and operate within regulatory modules. This structure is thought to evolve due to the preferential attachment of duplicated genes to more highly connected genes. Recent work has also shown that natural selection tends to favor networks with sparse connectivity.|$|E

Genomics and proteomics techniques are used worldwide to identify mutations related to each specific cancer and their treatments. Computational tools are used to predict growth and surface antigens on cancerous cells. There are publications explaining a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk. Algorithm CanPredict was used to indicate how closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes. Cancer immunology has been given so much importance that the data related to it is growing rapidly. Protein–protein interaction networks provide valuable information on tumorigenesis in humans. Cancer proteins exhibit a <b>network</b> <b>topology</b> that is different from normal proteins in the human interactome.
