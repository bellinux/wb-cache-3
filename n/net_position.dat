When <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> are decomposed into expected and unexpected components, we find that expected <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> by type of trader generally do not co-vary with volatility. However, volatility is positively associated with shocks (in either direction) in <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> of speculators and small traders, and negatively related to shocks (in either direction) in <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> of hedgers. This evidence suggests that changes in speculative positions destabilize the market. Consistent with dispersion of beliefs models and noise trading theories, hedgers appear to possess private information, whereas speculators and small traders are less informed in these markets. ...|$|R

Although non-commercials comprise a relatively small percent of the tested markets' open interest (10 % to 22 %), they have the most volatile <b>net</b> <b>positions.</b> The data demonstrates a statistically (positive) negative contemporaneous correlation between <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> held by (non) commercials and market returns. However, traders' <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> do not lead (Granger cause) market returns. In fact, returns lead traders' <b>net</b> <b>positions.</b> Positive returns result in an (increase) decrease in (non) commercials <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> the following week.

50|$|On the {{day that}} an option expires—for U.S. {{exchange}} traded equity options this is the Saturday following the third Friday of the month—if an option's underlier is close to pinning, the trader must pay close attention. A small movement of the underlier's price through the strike (e.g. from below the strike price to above, or vice versa) can have a large impact on the trader's <b>net</b> <b>position</b> in the underlier on the trading day after expiration. For instance, if an option goes from being in the money to out of the money, the trader must rapidly trade enough of the underlier so that the position after expiration will be flat.|$|E

We find that the peaks and troughs of <b>net</b> <b>positions</b> are generally useful predictors to the evolution of spot exchange rates but other trader position measures are less correlated with future market movements. In addition, speculative position measures usually forecast price-continuations in spot rates while hedging position measures forecast price-reversals in these markets.

50|$|In July 2006, Leor sold {{approximately}} 3360 acre net in its {{holdings in}} the Amoruso Prospect to its joint-venture partner, EnCana, for $242.9 million. The transaction resulted in Leor and EnCana each having a 50% {{stake in the}} prospect. After the transaction Leor held a 23725 acre <b>net</b> <b>position</b> in the prospect. Leor used part of the proceeds to redeem its $30.0 million Senior Secured Note. In December 2006, Leor entered into a $150.0 million three-year senior secured, revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank as lead agent. In March 2007, Leor and JPMorgan amended the credit facility, adding BNP Paribas as a lender. While to date {{there has been no}} draw-down of the facility, Leor currently has the ability to draw $50.0 million of the $150.0 million revolving credit facility. The new credit facility included provisions that allowed Leor, subject to certain restrictions and lender approval over its term, to increase the revolving credit commitment borrowing base.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, {{the central}} bank could let markets do the work. The bank would offer {{to buy and sell}} NGDP futures {{contracts}} at a price that would change {{at the same rate as}} the NGDP target. Investors would initiate trades as long as they saw profit opportunities from NGDP growth above (or below) the target. The money supply and interest rates would adjust to the point where markets expected NGDP to reach the target. These [...] "open market operation"s (OMOs) would automatically tighten or loosen the money supply and raise or lower interest rates. The bank's role is purely passive, buying or selling the contracts. This would partially or completely replace other bank's use of interest rates, quantitative easing, etc., to intervene in the economy. Brad DeLong objects to this approach, writing, [...] "The Federal Reserve would then become truly the lender of not just last but first resort." [...] Bill Woolsey offers several alternatives for the structure of such a futures market, suggesting an approach in which the Fed maintains a fixed price for the futures contract, hedging any resulting short or long position by conducting OMOs to match its <b>net</b> <b>position</b> and using other traditional techniques such as changing reserve requirements. He further recommends that private parties collateralize their positions using only securities such as treasury bills to prevent perverse effects from adjustments to margin accounts as the market moves.|$|E

In a simple accounting framework, we find supportive evidence of the adjustment role of the <b>net</b> external-debt <b>positions</b> on the current account balances. Our findings show that net external-debt holdings affect current account imbalances through their effect on private consumption. Government expenditure and domestic investment, on the other hand, are not negatively affected by net external-debt holdings. We show that, on average, developing countries in the sample would have run a 2. 7 percentage points wider current account deficit {{in the absence of the}} negative impact of net external debts. <b>Net</b> external-debt <b>positions,</b> therefore, reduce the dispersions of current account imbalances and thus increase the correlation of investment and saving ratios. ...|$|R

On the serving side: the server rotates to the <b>net</b> <b>position,</b> the net player sits out, and a new player steps in to serve the ball. On the returning side: the return player rotates to the service line, service line player sits out, and a new player steps in to return the ball. The same team serves the ball until the game is over. The game is played until a team reaches seven or eleven points. Variations in the game include a drop hit to start the point or a coach feeding the ball to start the point.
