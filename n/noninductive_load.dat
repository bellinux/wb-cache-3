40|$|The {{investigation}} on the spark quenching circuits had {{been limited to}} D. C. circuit, {{but it has been}} carried out little by little in A. C. circuit by the development of thyristors. In this paper, first, the author suggested new spark quenching circuits for inductive load, and, second, showed the spark quenching conditions. The conclusions obtained were as follows. (1) In the spark quenching circuits for <b>noninductive</b> <b>load,</b> the spark quenching conditions need not be considered except the area of large current. But there are the sphere that can not extinguish arcs in arc conditions. (2) In the spark quenching circuits for inductive load, the spark quenching conditions needs to be considered only re-discharge conditions, and other conditions need not be considered except the area of large current...|$|E
