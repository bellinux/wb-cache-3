500|$|The USGS {{found that}} the {{farthest}} landslide from the 2011 Virginia earthquake was [...] from the epicenter. This {{is by far the}} greatest landslide distance recorded from any other earthquake of similar magnitude. Previous studies of worldwide earthquakes indicated that landslides occurred no farther than [...] from the epicenter of a magnitude 5.8 earthquake. The study suggested that the added information about East Coast earthquakes may prompt a revision of equations that predict ground shaking. [...] "What makes this new study so unique is that it provides direct observational evidence from the largest earthquake to occur in more than 100 years in the eastern U.S. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> more about the power of East Coast earthquakes, equations that predict ground shaking might need to be revised." ...|$|E

In 2013 the American writer Shai Afsai invited two of the Igbo Jewish leaders, Azuka Ogbukaa (Pinchas) and Elder Ovadiah Agbai, to Rhode Island in the United States. [...] Afsai wrote: “Their 12-day visit has helped solidify a budding relationship between the Rhode Island and Abuja communities. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> each other a little better, we may consider what further joys and responsibilities this relationship entails”.|$|E

60|$|His son Jim snarled {{something}} {{up at him}} on this, and his father struck him a blow with his clenched fist {{on the side of}} his head, which sent the boy's chin forward upon his breast as though he had been stunned. My father shook his head, for he had a liking for Jim; but we all walked up to the house again, nodding and blinking, and hardly able to keep our eyes open <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> all was safe, but with a thrill of joy at our hearts such as I have only matched once or twice in my lifetime.|$|R

6000|$|<b>Now</b> about <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> nothing. St. Paul himself never {{says that}} hell {{is below the}} earth. Indeed (and {{this is a very}} {{noteworthy}} thing) St. Paul never, in his epistles, mentions in plain words hell at all; so what St. Paul thought about the matter, <b>we</b> can never <b>know.</b> Whether by Christ's descending into the lower parts of the earth, he meant descending into hell, or merely that our Lord came down on this earth of ours, poor, humble, and despised, laying his glory by for a while, this we cannot tell. Some wise men think one thing, some another. Two of the wisest and best of the great old fathers of the Church think that he meant only Christ's death and burial. So how dare I give a positive opinion, where wiser men than I differ? ...|$|R

50|$|Kant ends {{this chapter}} by {{discussing}} Hume's refutation of causation. Hume argued <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can never see one event cause another, {{but only the}} constant conjunction of events. Kant suggests that Hume was confusing the phenomenal and noumenal worlds.

This knowledge, however, is only practical and not theoretical. Therefore, it does not affect {{our knowledge of the}} things in themselves. Metaphysical speculation on the noumenal world is avoided.|$|R

30|$|Pandora {{had been}} given a large jar (rather than a box) and {{instruction}} by Zeus to keep it closed, but she had also been given the gift of curiosity, and ultimately opened it. When she did so, all of the evils, ills, diseases, and burdensome labor that mankind had not known previously, escaped from the jar, but it is said, that at the very bottom of her jar, there lay hope [71]. <b>We</b> do believe <b>that</b> there definitely is hope, {{at the bottom of the}} unknowns, potential misdiagnoses, and iatrogenic harm that may occur from knowing without understanding, and that POC ultrasound is simply the latter—understanding our patients better. This understanding occurs on many levels, however, such as having a greater fidelity of imaging. No longer does a PTX need to be simply there or not there. POC ultrasound has the ability to discern in real-time how big in terms of chest topography the PTX is, and whether it is expanding or decreasing in size [44, 72]. This understanding also requires detailed studies on outcomes; <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will <b>know</b> more about our patients; <b>we</b> need to <b>know</b> what maters and what does not. It is in this realm that evidence-based medicine becomes critical.|$|R
60|$|If {{it were a}} plant {{propagated}} by seed, {{one would}} suppose that it was carried across by wind or waves, wafted on the feet of birds, or accidentally introduced in the crannies of drift timber. So the coco-nut made the tour of the world ages before either of the famous Cooks--the Captain or the excursion agent--had rendered the same feat easy and practicable; and so, too, a number of American plants have fixed their home in the tarns of the Hebrides or among the lonely bogs of Western Galway. But the banana must have been carried by man, because it is unknown in the wild state in the Western Continent; and, as it is practically seedless, it can only have been transported entire, {{in the form of}} a root or sucker. An exactly similar proof of ancient intercourse between the two worlds is afforded us by the sweet potato, a plant of undoubted American origin, which was nevertheless naturalised in China as early as the first centuries of the Christian era. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all <b>know</b> how the Scandinavians of the eleventh century went to Massachusetts, which they called Vineland, and how the Mexican empire had some knowledge of Accadian astronomy, people are beginning to discover that Columbus himself was after all an egregious humbug.|$|R
