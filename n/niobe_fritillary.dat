40|$|Annotation Populations of two {{sympatric}} large fritillary species, the High Brown Fritillary (Argynnis adippe) and the <b>Niobe</b> <b>Fritillary</b> (A. niobe), {{were studied}} using microsatellite markers {{to assess and}} compare potential population subdivision in a relatively preserved landscape of the Czech part of the Carpathians. The results are confronted with data obtained from a smaller-scale mark-release-recapture study, with species? known life histories and namely with their conservation status, {{all of which is}} also considered in explaining the obtained patterns of genetic diversity...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} state of the <b>Niobe</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis niobe) in Europe, both in terms of (a) current {{knowledge}} of its distributional changes and of (b) the genetics of the surviving populations. It uses mitochondrial sequences and microsatellite markers to assess the phylogeographic history of the species, and the impact of the multiple local extinctions at the same time. The data are evaluated by a standard set of methods genetics and phylogeography population and a brief synthesis including recommendations for conservation management is given...|$|E
