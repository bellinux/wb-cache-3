40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} in hot-melt impregnation, extrusion, and thermoforming offer multiple avenues {{for the design}} and manufacture of low-cost thermoplastic composites for mass transit and automotive applications. Fiber reinforced thermoplastics such as glass/polypropylene (glass/PP) have found their applications in front-end bumper beams, under body shields, and other automotive applications. These materials also have potential usage in mass transit vehicles, such as buses. The present study focuses on the design and manufacture of {{a segment of the}} floor of a mass transit bus using glass/PP <b>woven</b> <b>tape</b> forms developed through a hot-melt impregnation process. An initial study on the existing mass transit buses found that a metal skeletal frame and plywood panels are used {{in the construction of the}} floor structure.

Kapton® polyimide was chosen as reference substrate material, was characterized regarding mechanical and electrical properties and was used as a basis for a comparison with several textile substrates. Samples were fabricated using physical vapour deposition (thermal evaporation) to deposit a thin layer of aluminium on top of Kapton and textile substrates. The measurement of electrical resistance of the thin aluminum films was carried out using the Kelvin method. To characterize the mechanical behaviour of the substrate and aluminum film, several mechanical tests were performed and results were compared between Kapton and these textile materials. The chemical composition of the textile substrates and aluminum films as well as the continuity of the films was characterized. This selection process identified the material that was closer to the behaviour of polyimide, a flexible, but <b>non-elastic</b> <b>woven</b> textile coated on both sides with PVC.

Shear strength values were lower in these panels. But tensile strengths were not affected by the delaminations because of the relation between the tensile loading direction and the delaminations. Composite tensile strength was found to be proportional to the volume percent boron and the aluminum matrix rather than to the tape used or fabrication technique.

This mill was adjacent to another, Speedwell Mill, owned by John Dalley, a local merchant.

Harding stated explicitly in The Pianoforte that Wornum [...] "neither invented or patented" [...] the tape and credited the invention to piano manufacturer Herman Lichtenthal of Brussels (and later Saint Petersburg), who received a patent for improvement in 1832 that shows an action which differs from the 1840 illustration primarily in the form and position of the damper lever and its mechanism. In 1836 French piano tuner, and later manufacturer, Claude Montal described in L'art d'accorder soi-même son piano that Camille Pleyel had introduced improvements to the design of Wornum's small uprights when he introduced the pianino in France in 1830, but although Montal describes the action and flexible tie in detail he did not specify whether they were among the changes. Both of these examples can also be distinguished for employing leather for the flexible tie rather than <b>woven</b> <b>tape,</b> which Harding tentatively credited to Wornum.

The fabric is wound and placed on the mold. The fluid flows radially into the reinforcement along the through-thickness direction. The new method avoids racetracking, and it is easy to view the flow front. The measurement of through-thickness permeability is translated into an in-plane measurement of radial technique.

With such an elastic model, the only solution to decrease these deformations has been so far to increase the stiffness of the deformed springs, but we show that it dramatically increases the cost of the algorithm. We present therefore a new method to adapt our model to the particularly stiff properties of textiles, inspired from dynamic inverse procedures...|$|R

High strength co-extruded PP tapes have potential processing advantages over mono-extruded fibres or tapes as they allow for a larger temperature processing window for consolidation.

Thermoforming studies show that direct forming is an interesting alternative to stamping of pre-consolidated sheets, as it eliminates an expensive belt-pressing step which is normally needed for the manufacturing of semi-finished sheets products.

Its retrieval provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of the low-Earth-orbit environment on a functional solar array. The intact solar array underwent scientific inspections and preliminary tests by a joint team of U. S. and Russian investigators to evaluate the effects of long-term space exposure. Upon initial examination, significant contamination was observed over most components of the array. One panel, panel 8, was provided to the U. S. scientists for further evaluation. As part of the U.

In the first investigation, {{a series of tests}} was run to characterize the through-the-thickness tensile strength for a variety of composites that included 2 D braids, 2 D and 3 D <b>weaves,</b> and prepreg <b>tapes.</b> A new test method based on a curved beam was evaluated. Failures were significantly different between the 2 D materials and the 3 D weaves. The 2 D materials delaminated between layers due to out-of-plane tensile stresses while the 3 D weaves failed due to the formation of radial cracks between the surface plies caused by high circumferential stresses along the inner radius. The strength of the 2 D textile composites did not increase relative to the tapes. Final failure in the 3 D weaves was caused by a circumferential crack similar to the 2 D materials and occurred at a lower bending moment than in other materials. The early failures in the 3 D weaves were caused by radial crack formation rather than a low through-the-thickness strength. The second investigation focused on the development of a standard impact test method to measure impact damage resistance. The only impact tests that currently exist are compression after impact (CAI) tests which incorporate elements of both damage resistance and damage tolerance. A new impact test method is under development which uses a quasi-static indentation (QSI) test to directly measure damage resistance. Damage resistance is quantified in terms of the contact force to produce a unit of damage where a metric for damage may be area in C-scan, depth of residual dent, penetration, damage growth, etc. A final draft of an impact standard that uses a QSI test method will be presented to the ASTM Impact Task Group on impact. In the third investigation, the impact damage resistance behavior of a variety of textile materials was studied using the QSI test method. In this study, the force where large damage initiates was measured and the delamination size as a function of force was determined. The force to initiate large damage was significantly lower in braids and weaves. The delamination diameter - impact forace relationship was quanitfied using a damage resistance parameter, Q(*), which related delamination diameter to imapct force over a range of delamination sizes. Using this Q(*) parameter to rate the materials, the stitched uniweaves, toughened epoxy tapes, and through-the-thickness orthogonal interlock weave were the most damage resistant...|$|R
