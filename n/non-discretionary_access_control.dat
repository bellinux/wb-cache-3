In this model, an administrator assigns a user to a role that has certain predetermined right and privileges. Because of the user's association with the role, the user can access certain resources and perform specific tasks. RBAC is also known as <b>Non-Discretionary</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control.</b> The roles assigned to users are centrally administered.Dynamic Disclosure Monitor Architecture uses this MAC to detect any direct security violation, if any direct security violation is detected the query is rejected then and there, otherwise it is passed through inference engine to disclose data that can be inferred. All the disclosed data obtained from inference engine is again sent to MAC to detect any direct security violation. If any violation is detected the query is rejected, otherwise answered.|$|E

Part of the insecurity {{can be attributed to}} the common-used but flawed mechanisms for discretionary <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> which is coarsegrained and based on user's privileges. Many alternative mechanisms have been investigated to provide mandatory <b>access</b> <b>control</b> that is fine-grained and specific to individual {{software components}}. A predominate approach to this end is to classify processes into domains and roles, and to configure <b>access</b> <b>control</b> accordingly.

This position paper introduces a new approach to address the limitation.

40|$|Access control models play an {{important}} role in database management systems. In general, there are three basic access control models: Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and <b>Non-Discretionary</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (NAC). Currently, the majority of commercial DBMSs provide only DAC, and some temporal access control models have been derived based on either DAC or NAC. In the context of video database applications, since the structure of video data is complex in nature, it requires a specific and tailor-made access control mechanism which should include MAC as well as DAC and NAC. However, only few efforts have been put on access control models for video database systems. In this paper, a transitive and temporal access control mechanism for collaborative video database production applications has been proposed, which subsumes the properties of DAC, MAC, and NAC. Moreover, our proposed mechanism is integrated with the intellectual property concerns by constructing an access control hierarchy of video data with authorization rules. In particular, our mechanism can derive novel authorization rules not only on conventional client-data access control, but also on data-data access control. Besides video data, the proposed model is applicable to other data types which exhibit a hierarchical data structure...|$|E

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND <b>Access</b> <b>control</b> is one of the fundamental security mechanisms in information systems. It concerns with who can access which information under what circumstances. The need of <b>access</b> <b>control</b> arises naturally when a multi-user system offers selective access to shared information. As one of the oldest problems in security, <b>access</b> <b>control</b> has been studied extensively in a variety of contexts, including operating systems, databases, and computer networks. The most influential policy models today are discretional <b>access</b> <b>control</b> (DAC), mandatory <b>access</b> <b>control</b> (MAC), and role-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> (RBAC) models.

The more recent Attribute-Based <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (ABAC,[11]) generalizes previous models and expresses <b>access</b> <b>control</b> policies in terms of key-value properties called attributes of the subject (e.g., the subject id, username or roles), the object (e.g., the object id, location or content) and the environment (e.g., the time, physical location or usage context). Attributes provide increased expressivity with regard to previous models and offer a unit of data transport between the different components or parties involved in <b>access</b> <b>control.</b> For both reasons, this work builds upon ABAC.|$|R

These <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models are user-centric and do {{not take into account}} additional parameters such as resource information, relationship between the user (the requesting entity) and the resource, and dynamic information e.g. time of the day or user IP.ABAC tries to address this by defining <b>access</b> <b>control</b> based on attributes which describe the requesting entity (the user), the targeted object or resource, the desired action (view, edit, delete...), and environmental or contextual information.
