5000|$|In {{the first}} example, {{which is the}} handle for the HANDLE.NET {{software}} license, [...] is the prefix assigned to the <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> (in this case, Handle.net itself) and [...] is the local name within that namespace. The local name may consist of any characters from the Unicode UCS-2 character set. The prefix also consists of any UCS-2 characters, other than [...] "/". The prefixes consist {{of one or more}} <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> segments, separated by periods, representing a hierarchy of naming authorities. Thus, in the example [...] is the <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> prefix for CNRI, while [...] designates a subordinate <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> within the 20 prefix. Other examples of top-level prefixes for the federated naming authorities of the DONA Foundation are [...] for DOI handles; [...] for handles assigned by the ITU; [...] for handles issued by the German Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH Göttingen (GWDG), the scientific computing center of the University of Göttingen; and [...] for the Coalition of Handle Services [...] - [...] China. Older [...] "legacy" [...] prefixes issued by CNRI before the [...] "multi-primary administrator" [...] (MPA) structure was instituted are typically four of five digits, as in the second example above, a handle administered by the University of Leicester. All prefixes must be registered in the Global Handle Registry through an DONA Foundation approved registrar, normally for a fee.|$|E

5000|$|The NWG and Feinler's team {{defined a}} simple text file format for host names in 1974, and revised the format several times as the {{networks}} evolved. The host table itself was continuously updated on almost a daily basis. In 1975, the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) took operational control and support, {{and over time}} split the ARPANET into research and military networks. DCA used the name Defense Data Network {{to refer to the}} combination, and the NIC served as its information center. When e-mail and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) became available around 1976, the NIC used them to deliver information to users via the network. In 1977, Postel moved to the Information Sciences Institute, and the RFC editor and number assignment functions moved with him, while the NIC stayed at SRI. By 1979, Feinler and her group were working on ways to scale up the name service. In 1982, an Internet protocol was defined by Ken Harrenstien and Vic White in her group to access the online directory of people, called Whois. As the Internet expanded, the Domain Name System was designed to handle the growth by delegating <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> to distributed name servers. Her group became the overall <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> of the Internet, developing and managing the name registries of the top-level domains of [...]mil, [...]gov, [...]edu, [...]org, and [...]com. Even the names of the top-level domains, based on generic categories such as [...]com were suggestions of the NIC team, approved by the Internet developer community.|$|E

5000|$|Danish placenames {{dating from}} the colonial era exist for almost all major {{settlements}} in Greenland. Some of the places in question were founded as settlements under a Danish name, while others were originally Greenlandic toponyms. Very frequently, the Danish and Greenlandic names have different etymologies; while the former are often named after settlers or explorers, the latter usually describe geographical features. In 1983, a Danish law officially transferred the <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> to the Greenlandic Home Rule. During the years before and after that, {{a complete set of}} Greenlandic placenames have ousted the former traditional Danish names. Danish names in Greenland are now mostly known or used by older-generation Danish-speakers or by Danes living in Greenland. Until recently, Greenland was still - both officially and de facto - bilingual, but Greenlandic has assumed the status of sole official language in Greenland, following the island's recent change from [...] "hjemmestyre" [...] (home rule) to [...] "selvstyre" [...] (autonomy).|$|E

50|$|Giovanni Domenico Nardo (4 March 1802 - 7 April 1877) was an Italian naturalist from Venice, {{although}} {{he spent most}} of his life in Chioggia, home port of the biggest fishing flotilla of the Adriatic.He learned taxidermy and specimen preparation from his uncle, an Abbot. He went in a high school in Udineand studied medicine in Padua, where he reorganized the zoological collections. In 1832 he reorganized the invertebrate collection at the Imperial Natural History Museum in Vienna and in 1840 he became Fellow of the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, an academy whose aim is “to increase, promulgate, and safeguard the sciences, literature and the arts”. Nardo wrote hundreds of scientific publications ranging from medicine and social sciences, philology, technology, physics, but mostly on Venetian and Adriatic zoology. In marine biology Nardo wrote on algae, marine invertebrates, fishes and sea turtles. A vast collection of his manuscripts and his personal library is preserved in Natural History Museum of Venice.According to WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species, Nardo is the <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> for 144 marine taxa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{focus of}} web search is {{moving away from}} {{returning}} relevant documents towards returning structured data as results to user queries. A vital part in the architecture of search engines are link-based ranking algorithms, which however are targeted towards hypertext documents. Existing ranking algorithms for structured data, on the other hand, require manual input of a domain expert and are thus not applicable in cases where data integrated from {{a large number of}} sources exhibits enormous variance in vocabularies used. In such environments, the authority of data sources is an important signal that the ranking algorithm has to take into account. This paper presents algorithms for prioritising data returned by queries over web datasets expressed in RDF. We introduce the notion of <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> which provides a correspondence between identifiers and the sources which can speak authoritatively for these identifiers. Our algorithm uses the original PageRank method to assign authority values to data sources based on a <b>naming</b> <b>authority</b> graph, and then propagates the authority values to identifiers referenced in the sources. We conduct performance and quality evaluations of the method on a large web dataset. Our method is schema-independent, requires no manual input, and has applications in search, query processing, reasoning, and user interfaces over integrated datasets. ...|$|E
