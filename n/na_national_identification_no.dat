40|$|The {{stronger}} young immigrants {{identify with}} the host country, the more native friends they have–and vice versa. While this association between emotional and social integration has been well established by cross-sectional studies, {{little is known about}} how and why it emerges. Do immigrants select their friends based on their <b>national</b> <b>identification?</b> Or does having native friends influence immigrants’ identification with the host country? This cumulative dissertation offers four longitudinal studies in order to answer these overarching questions and respective follow-up questions. In the first study, four broad theoretical scenarios are introduced and longitudinally examined using three-wave panel data for adolescents of Turkish origin in Germany. Lagged first-difference models that account both for stable unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality reveal that changes in immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and the share of native friends did not affect one another. This finding cautions researchers to interpret the cross-sectional association between immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and their friendships with natives in a causal manner. The second study tries to get closer to the micro-level processes underlying the ambiguous association between friends and identification. For this purpose, two respective selection and influence mechanisms are distinguished and empirically tested with two waves of Dutch social network data. Stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) for the co-evolution of networks and behavior show that strong <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> did not make immigrants more likely to befriend native peers. Native students, however, preferred to befriend immigrants with stronger rather than weaker <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> There was <b>no</b> evidence of any kind of social influence. The third study suggests that earlier research may have failed to identify social influence mechanisms because these might be conditional on the nature of ethnic boundaries. Related hypotheses are developed and tested for Turkish and ethnic German adolescents, for whom ethnic boundaries are particularly bright and blurred, respectively. Using lagged first-difference models on two three-wave German panel data sets, the results confirm that Turkish students’ <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> was not affected by their native friends. There is some indication, however, that friends did affect the development of ethnic Germans <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> The fourth and final study revisits the unexpected findings of the second study. For one thing, the analysis is replicated with newly collected three-wave German network panel data that have various advantages over earlier datasets. For another, a theoretical argument is developed and tested about the role of opportunity structure in the form of relative group size. Using SAOM, it is found that in ethnically highly diverse schools, immigrants with stronger host country identification were more likely to befriend native peers; but there were no respective selection effects for natives. Again, friends did not influence immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> In sum, the key conclusion of this dissertation is that the association between immigrants’ friendships with natives and their <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> is mainly a selection story. Depending on relative group size, immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> seems to affect friendship choices of both immigrants and natives. However, except under very specific favorable social conditions, {{there is little evidence that}} friends in turn influence immigrants’ <b>national</b> <b>identification...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} immigrants' {{identification with the}} host country. We use survey data of more than 1, 700 Turkish and Moroccan immigrants and more than 2, 200 natives in the Netherlands. We answer four main questions in this study. First, do immigrants have lower <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> than natives? Second, does the level of <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> differ between immigrant groups? Third, do economic and social integration similarly affect <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> among immigrants and natives? And fourth, what are important additional determinants of <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> among immigrants? The results show that, compared to Dutch natives, Turkish but not Moroccan immigrants have lower <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> Being employed and socially integrated is associated with higher <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> among immigrants as well as natives, but only among immigrants is higher occupational status associated with higher <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> For immigrants, Dutch language proficiency, perceived discrimination, and contact with natives proved to be important conditions for <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> © 2014 by the Center for Migration Studies of New York.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified ethnic group identification as a moderator {{in the relationship}} between perceived ethnic discrimination and problem behaviors in ethnic minority children. However, {{little is known about the}} influence of religious and host <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> on this relationship. This study investigated the moderating role of ethnic, religious, and host <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> on the relationship between perceived discrimination and problem behaviors in Muslim immigrant early adolescents living in the Netherlands. Analyses revealed gender-specific moderating effects for ethnic and religious group <b>identification.</b> For boys, <b>no</b> moderating effects were found. For girls, strong religious group identification increased the relationship between perceived ethnic discrimination and problem behaviors, whereas a strong ethnic identification served a buffering role. No moderating effects were found for host <b>national</b> <b>identification.</b> The findings underline the importance of including different types of group identification in research on the relation between perceived discrimination and immigrant adolescent problem behaviors. status: publishe...|$|R

Consistent with our predictions, both majority group members and immigrants whose <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> was strong experienced greater psychological ownership of Finland; as expected, this relationship was more pronounced among majority group members. Higher psychological ownership, in turn, was associated with less positive attitudes towards Russian-speaking immigrants among majority Finns but more positive attitudes towards Finns among immigrants. The findings also showed that among immigrants, the relationship between <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> and psychological ownership {{is likely to be}} reciprocal, with <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> similarly mediating the association between psychological ownership and attitudes towards members of the national group.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{effective}} <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> {{system is}} a necessity in any national government for the proper implementation and execution of its governmental policies and duties. This thesis aims at restructuring Nigeria <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> system {{so as to make}} it effective in addressing its political and civil problems, which ranges from manipulated census count figures and electoral fraud to economic fraud and civil problems. These problems are arguably due to Nigeria’s ineffective <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> system. We proposed in this thesis, a restructured Nigeria <b>national</b> <b>identification</b> system to help address these political and civil problems. The proposed identification system is designed such that it will help to address identification problems in general, reduce elections and census count fraud to a minimum and be useful for the execution of policies in sectors of the economy...|$|R
