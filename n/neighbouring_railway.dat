As he expanded in body he developed {{in mind and}} in heart, for his little mother, although profoundly ignorant of electricity and its effects, was deeply learned in the Scriptures. But Robin did not hunger in vain after scientific knowledge. By good fortune he had a cousin--cousin Sam Shipton--who was fourteen years older than himself, and a clerk at a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>railway</b> station, {{where there was a}} telegraphic instrument.|$|E

50|$|The railway, {{built in}} {{standard}} gauge {{which consisted of}} four lines, known as Railway No. 1, Railway No. 2, Railway No. 3 and Railway No. 4, was {{owned and operated by}} the Birmingham Corporation Water Department (now Birmingham City Council) which also owned the dams and associated works. The railway was mainly operated using a fleet of steam locomotives owned by the Corporation, with occasional assistance from locomotives borrowed from <b>neighbouring</b> <b>railways.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{closed on}} 4 October 1926, however the trams {{continued}} until July 1930, before the station closed for good. In common with many former railways in the area, {{it is now}} a public footpath. The <b>neighbouring</b> <b>Railway</b> Inn is now called the Woodend Inn.|$|E

The bridge design has three spans comprising a small central arch flanked by two larger outer arches, supported by four piers. The maximum height of the bridge is 18.41m AOD, rising approximately 4.5m above the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>railway</b> bridge. The primary structure material is painted structural steel and the deck is shared between pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E
50|$|Killarney {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in the Irish War of Independence. The town, and indeed the entire county, had strong republican ties, and skirmishes with the British forces happened on a regular basis.The Great Southern Hotel, (now renamed as the Malton Hotel) was for a while {{taken over by the}} British, both as an office and barracks, and to protect the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>railway</b> station. One notable event during the war was the Headford Ambush when the IRA attacked a railway train a few miles from town.|$|E

This is the first film to use the SE&CR for the Wind in the Willows - the railway in most adaptations of the story is the Great Western Railway (although the book itself does not specify this).|$|E
50|$|From time to {{time there}} had been {{consideration}} of selling the Company {{to one of the}} <b>neighbouring</b> <b>railways,</b> the Midland Railway or the GWR. Now a definite proposal to sell to them jointly was tabled and in October 1893 the Board approved an arrangement. The sale, to include the Severn Bridge section of the merged company, was to realise a price of £477,300. The sum was about half of the capital expended in building the system, and after paying debts £131,381 was distributed among shareholders. The sale went forward and on 1 July 1894 the sale was effected: the new owners were the Midland Railway and the Great Western Railway jointly.|$|R

25|$|The {{stations}} were exceptionally narrow, again {{because of the}} geography of the line, and all were {{on the east side}} of the rails, so the carriages and locomotives had doors on that side only, as on the <b>neighbouring</b> Talyllyn <b>Railway.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first half}} of the line was opened by the French company Brig-Furka-Disentis Bahn (BFD) in 1914. Trains could go as far as Gletsch, {{starting}} from Brig. Construction of the second part over the Furka Pass and Oberalp Pass was well under way when the war situation in France halted all works by 1915. The company lingered on, but was finally bankrupt in 1923. Two years later the railway had a new owner, called Furka Oberalp Bahn, founded by the cantons and the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>railway</b> companies. Construction work resumed, now with important federal funds, and on 4 July 1926 regular through services between Brig and Disentis could start. RhB trains reached Disentis under electric traction in 1922.|$|E

50|$|In 1881, the Midland <b>Railway</b> {{acquired}} the <b>neighbouring</b> smaller <b>railways</b> and built two links important to Lindsay. One was between Wick (Blackwater) Jct., and Cresswell (Manilla Jct.) in early 1883 for a direct route between Lindsay and Toronto (hitherto via Lorneville Jct.); {{and the other}} (“the Missing Link”) between Peterborough and Omemee in late 1883, for a direct Lindsay - Peterborough connection (hitherto via Millbrook Jct.).|$|R

The Ffestiniog's bridges and tunnels were built to a {{restrictive}} loading gauge. The work entailed lowering Russell's chimney, steam dome and cab; however the locomotive was still too wide and could not pass through the long Moelwyn tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The South Eastern and Chatham Railway Companies Joint Management Committee (SE&CRCJMC), {{known as}} the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR), was a working union of two <b>neighbouring</b> rival <b>railways,</b> the South Eastern Railway (SER) and London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR), which {{operated}} between London and south-east England. Between 1899 and 1923, the SE&CR had a monopoly of railway services in Kent and to the main Channel ports for ferries to France and Belgium.|$|R
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the bankers Overend, Gurney and Company in 1866 and the financial crisis the following year brought the LB {{to the brink of}} bankruptcy. A special meeting of shareholders was adjourned, and the powers {{of the board of directors}} were suspended pending receipt of a report into the financial affairs of the company and its prospects. The report made clear that the LB had over-extended itself with large capital projects sustained by profits from passengers, which suddenly declined as a result of the crisis. Several country lines were losing money– most notably between Horsham and Guildford, East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells, and Banstead and Epsom– and the LB was committed to building or acquiring others with equally poor prospects. The report was extremely critical of the policies of Schuster and the company secretary, Frederick Slight, both of whom resigned. It did however point out that these lines had been built or acquired as a means for preventing competition from <b>neighbouring</b> <b>railways.</b> The committee recommended the abandonment of several projects, and that the LB should enter into a working agreement with the SER.|$|R
60|$|The most {{remarkable}} of all Telford's designs, however, {{and the one}} which most immediately {{paved the way for}} the railway system, was his magnificent Holyhead Road. This wonderful highway he carried through the very midst of the Welsh mountains, at a comparatively level height for its whole distance, in order to form a main road from London to Ireland. On this road occurs Telford's masterpiece of engineering, the Menai suspension bridge, long regarded as one of the wonders of the world, and still one of the most beautiful suspension bridges in all Europe. Hardly less admirable, however, in its own way is the other suspension bridge which he erected at Conway, to carry his road across the mouth of the estuary, beside the grey old castle, with which its charming design harmonizes so well. Even now it is impossible to drive or walk along this famous and picturesque highway without being struck at every turn by the splendid engineering triumphs which it displays throughout its entire length. The contrast, indeed, between the noble grandeur of Telford's bridges, and the works on the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>railways,</b> is by no means flattering in every respect to our too exclusively practical modern civilization.|$|R
50|$|The Moss Branch {{was created}} from the Ffrwd Branch opening on 11 May 1882.
