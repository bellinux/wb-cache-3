One such composition, [...] "I'm <b>Not</b> <b>Quite</b> <b>Sure</b> (<b>what's</b> happening right now)" [...] was a modest commercial success, featuring Ben on a saxophone solo.

It may have been made ... when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays. When they had a matinee, and I suspected they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch. And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theatre, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage. I had no use for that kind of actor.|$|R

Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter also praised the film's look, and felt [...] "A well-matched ensemble rises {{to the challenge of}} launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style, abundant thrills and no shortage of humor." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin said, [...] "A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be, but it plays by old, half-forgotten rules; trimming out the clutter and cross-referencing for snappy, streamlined, Saturday-cartoon fun". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what's</b> going on, the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind, in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes this side of the Mos Eisley Cantina." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "While Guardians takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn, it also pulls you into – and, for the most part, keeps you in – a fully realized other world." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy is a late summer treat — a mostly lighthearted and self-referential comic-book movie with loads of whiz-bang action, some laugh-out-loud moments and a couple of surprisingly beautiful and touching scenes as well," [...] calling it [...] "a refreshing confection of entertainment."

Men of my nation have been in these regions before now, {{and some of them}} have said that the Polar Sea is open, others that it is covered always with ice so thick that it never melts. Some have said it is a `sea of ancient ice' so rough that no man can travel over it, and that it is not {{possible}} to reach the North Pole. I don't agree with that. I had been led to expect to fall in with this sea of ancient ice before I had got thus far, but it is not to be found. The sea indeed is partly blocked with ordinary ice, but there is nothing to be seen of this vast collection of mighty blocks, some of them thirty feet high--this wild chaos of ice which so effectually stopped some of those who went before me." ...|$|R

Why, of the [...] "inexplicable {{in-and-out}} running of horses," [...] as the [...] "Standard" [...] says, and as will often happen, you, perhaps, having a likely dark one {{as you want}} to get light into a high-class autumn handicap. The days is long past since Nicholas was nuts on the game little Lecturer, but still has the interests of the Turf at heart; and, my dear young friend, if horses never ran in and out, where would be [...] "the glorious uncertainty of the sport"? On the whole, then, if asked my opinion on this affair, the Prophet would say--putting it ambiguous-like-- [...] "Gentlemen, when there's so much dirty linen to wash, can't you remember that we're all pretty much tarred with the same brush?" [...] A great politician--which a lot of his family is here, Coningsby, and the Young Duke, and many other sportsmen--used to say as what the Turf was [...] "a gigantic engine of national demoralisation;" [...] which Nicholas is <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> but <b>what</b> he was right for him, though his language on rather a large scale. Horses running in and out is inexplicable! Why, gents all, which of us WOULDN'T do it, if he had the chance to put the pot on handsome, human nature being what it is, especially considering the lowness of the market odds as you have often and often to be content with. In short, the more you stir it the more it won't exactly remind you of gales from Araby the Blest; than which a more delightful country, only not to be found on any atlas as Nicholas ever cast a glance at the map, however large.|$|R
