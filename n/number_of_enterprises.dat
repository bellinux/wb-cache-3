5|$|By 1838 it {{had become}} clear that {{construction}} costs for the town were spiralling out of control. To make matters worse, the railway's engineer informed Hesketh-Fleetwood {{that the cost of}} the railway was expected to exceed £300,000. The company had also sold far fewer shares than had been hoped. Frederick Kemp was collecting rents and rates from tenants, and Hesketh-Fleetwood repeatedly asked him for money to pay some of the mounting bills. Kemp, a more forceful character than his employer, kept claiming that there was no money. Hesketh-Fleetwood turned to his brother Charles and asked him to get £4,000 out of Kemp. Charles was more assertive, but Kemp said that the money had been spent on workers' wages and produced yet more invoices that needed to be paid. During Hesketh-Fleetwood's many absences from the Fylde, Kemp managed to involve himself in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the town, to his own financial advantage. The railway was taking longer than expected and, with mounting debts, Hesketh-Fleetwood grew increasingly depressed and began to withdraw from society.|$|E

The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{increased}} from 600–700 in 1762 to over 2,000 when her reign ended. Russian agriculture grew during Catherine's reign due to the economic pressure put upon the gentry that needed more wealth in order to indulge in Western European tastes. The gentry used potentially arable land in old areas {{as well as new}} land on the peripheries of the empire. This expansion occurred during the 1780s and 90s.|$|E

A spokesman for the company acknowledged that part of the reason to build the plant was the existence of a General Motors plant in the same area as well as the existence of the Parque Industrial Puerto Interior which offers access to different transportation modes. The Centro de Innovación (Innovation Center) of Microsoft was inaugurated in 2010 in León. This establishment is meant to support businesses and governments to form software and technology enterprises with the goal of starting fifty new businesses with ten to twenty employees each.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Paris {{suffered}} {{an economic crisis}} in the early 1870s, followed by a long, slow recovery {{that led to a}} period of rapid growth beginning in 1895 until the First World War. Between 1872 and 1895, 139 large enterprises closed their doors in Paris, particularly textile and furniture factories, metallurgy concerns, and printing houses, four industries had been the major employers in the city for sixty years. Most of these enterprises had employed between 100 and 200 workers each. Half of the large enterprises on the center of the city's Right Bank moved out, {{in part because of the}} high cost of real estate, and also to get better access to transportation on the river and railroads. Several moved to less-expensive areas at the edges of the city, around Montparnasse and La Salpêtriére, while others went to the 18th arrondissement, La Villette and the Canal Saint-Denis to be closer to the river ports and the new railroad freight yards. Still others relocated to Picpus and Charonne in the southeast, or near Grenelle and Javel in the southwest. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Paris dropped from 76,000 in 1872 to 60,000 in 1896, while in the suburbs their number grew from 11,000 to 13,000. In the heart of Paris, many workers were still employed in traditional industries such as textiles (18,000 workers), garment production (45,000 workers), and in new industries which required highly skilled workers, such as mechanical and electrical engineering and automobile manufacturing.|$|E

500|$|In June 1967, Aubrey {{agreed to}} a two-year {{contract}} to produce films for Columbia Pictures. Despite being frequently rumored {{as a candidate for}} many posts in the entertainment industry, Aubrey told Vincent Canby of The New York Times he had [...] "no desire ever again to become involved in the corporate side of the entertainment business" [...] and had been, in Canby's words, [...] "dabbling in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprises,</b> including the acquisition of films for TV, real estate, and cultured pearls." [...] In 1965, Oulahan and Lambert had noted he had [...] "extensive investments in everything from copper mines to a chain of waffle shops." [...] His first project for Columbia was to be an adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith book, Those Who Walk Away. [...] "The criteria is profitable entertainment," [...] he told Canby. Before the deal collapsed on January 1, 1968, Aubrey had been rumored to be the leading candidate to be hired as ABC television entertainment chief if International Telephone and Telegraph's takeover of ABC, which was announced in March 1966, had been completed.|$|E
2500|$|The faring {{traditions of}} Jämtland {{are also very}} characteristic. The Jamts were known to neglect the {{agriculture}} and instead take on long trading journeys all over Scandinavia to various markets such as the ancients ones in Levanger and Gregorius market on Frösön. This was regarded as sheer pleasure in itself and not as something they were obligated to do. In {{the middle of the}} 18th century Jämtland's population was roughly [...] and it was common that over [...] were present during Marsimartnan in Levanger, it is also claimed that the city was built solely on spikes from Jämtland before the fire in the 19th century. The journeys took place during the winters when the landscape was more accessible (when swamps, lakes and tarns froze to ice) and was conducted by males, which left the females in complete charge of the household and the property. The journeys were well-organized expeditions and no one traveled alone. These traditions has awarded the Jamt with traits such as enterprising and energetic. The Jamts' attempts to avoid tariffs were very successful which greatly angered Swedish officials through time. These journeys eventually stopped once the railway came, though it has recently been renewed by locals. Some say that the heritage from this age lives on, given the high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprises</b> per capita.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, a {{consortium}} led by Iberia and Austral's owner Cielos del Sur S.A. acquired an 85% stake in Aerolíneas Argentinas for [...] in cash, {{the same amount}} to be injected within a ten-month period, and a debt-equity exchange worth billion. Another consortium led by Alitalia, American Airlines, KLM and Varig had earlier pulled out from the process. Paradoxically, {{one of the first}} actions taken by the new Peronist government was to privatise the carrier, after airily opposing to the privatisation propositions of its predecessor. The sale of the airline followed the divestiture of the government shareholding in the national telephone company, which took place earlier that month during the Carlos Menem presidency's privatisation wave, intended to divest the participation of the State in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{in order to reduce the}} debt to foreign banks from US$40billion to billion. Aimed at favouring the privatisation process, the government absorbed a million debt the company took between 1981 and 1982 for capitalisation purposes. Despite the carrier being regarded as overstaffed and bureaucratic, it was debt-free at that time, having an average profitability of million a year; it actually had million in revenues for the year prior to the privatisation. The privatisation contract, which specified the buyer should pay million in cash and million in external debt bonds, was ratified by the Supreme Court. Furthermore, a clause enabled the buyer to indebt Aerolíneas Argentinas for the buyout process; this was reflected in the airline's 1991 balance, which included debts worth millions for its own acquisition. It was not until 2009 that this privatisation process would be ruled as illegal.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate current situation regarding the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprise</b> in Thailand. From 2015 ，Thai BOI (Board of Investment) will switch its promotion policy to foreign countries. In particular, it will focus especially on promising industry. In the past, it has sought to accomplish a regionally balanced development while differentiating its promotion policy by region. We correct data from Thai industrial census 2007 ，which we can download via internet. Using the data, we conducted nested ANOVA to test whether region affects the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the <b>enterprise</b> by type <b>of</b> <b>enterprise,</b> operation period, and capital class, proportion of foreign shareholder and existence of BOI promotion. The results show in the following. First, other than BOI existence, region is significantly affects the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Based on qualitative consideration, distribution <b>of</b> <b>enterprise</b> is different between Bangkok and its surroundings and others. We concluded that disparity between regions still remains from a viewpoint of geographic distribution. Besides, except for Bangkok area and its surroundings, lack of variety of occupation exists. It is likely that these characteristics are one of reasons why regional economic disparity and labor movement to Bangkok.

2500|$|While UK law {{creates a}} [...] "charter of rights" [...] for minimum {{standards}} at work, {{the goal of}} fair standards requires the right {{to participate in an}} enterprise's management. In law, this means the right to vote for managers, or on important issues, and the right to collective bargaining. Trade unions are the main way that workers organise their own voice. Unions aim to improve their members' lives at work. They are founded on contract, but members must have the right to elect the executive, not be excluded without good reason, and not be discriminated against by employers. Unions' main functions are organising and representing a workforce through statutory participation channels, collective bargaining, providing mutual assistance, and being a forum for social deliberation and activism. Collective agreements, which unions make with employers, usually aim to set fair scales of pay and working hours, require pensions, training and workplace facilities, and update standards as the enterprise changes. Trade union bargaining power rests, in the last resort, on collective action. To balance employer power to change the employment relation's terms, or dismiss staff, an official trade union has been protected by law in its right to strike. Since the 1875, UK law has said collective action, including the right to strike, is lawful if it is [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". Since the 1980s, there have also been a number of requirements for balloting the workforce and warning the employer, suppression of sympathy strikes and picketing. In these respects UK law is considered by some to have fallen below international labour standards. There are legal rights to information about workplace changes and consultation on redundancies, business restructuring and management generally. Finally, there are a small number of rights for direct participation in workplace and company affairs, particularly pension management. In a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>enterprises,</b> such as universities, staff have the right to vote for representatives on boards that manage the organisation.|$|E
