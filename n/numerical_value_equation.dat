50|$|The {{following}} example concerns {{definitions of}} quantities and units. The (average) velocity (v) {{of an object}} {{is defined as the}} quantitative physical property of the object that is directly proportional to the distance (d) traveled by the object and inversely proportional to the time (t) of travel, i.e., v = kd/t, where k is a constant that depends on the units used. Suppose that the meter (m) and the second (s) are base units; then the kilometer (km) and the hour (h) are noncoherent derived units. The meter per second (mps) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one meter in one second, and the kilometer per hour (kmph) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one kilometer in one hour. Substituting from the definitions of the units into the defining equation of velocity we obtain, 1 mps = k m/s and 1 kmph = k km/h = 1/3.6 k m/s = 1/3.6 mps. Now choose k = 1; then the meter per second is a coherent derived unit, and the kilometer per hour is a noncoherent derived unit. Suppose that we choose to use the kilometer per hour as the unit of velocity in the system. Then the system becomes noncoherent, and the <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> <b>equation</b> for velocity becomes {v} = 3.6 {d}/{t}. Coherence may be restored, without changing the units, by choosing k = 3.6; then the kilometer per hour is a coherent derived unit, with 1 kmph = 1 m/s, and the meter per second is a noncoherent derived unit, with 1 mps = 3.6 m/s.|$|E

We find new {{solutions}} for the "classical" perfect fluid model {{as well as for}} the vacuum model although they are really restrictive for the equation of state.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the exact {{solution}} of Einstein's field equations {{which has been}} given by Curzon in 1924 representing the field of a static binary system is reviewed. An adapted version of this solution is obtained to describe a dynamical binaries in a rotating coordinate system. It is shown that {{this version of the}} solution is time-dependent. It reduces to the later one in the static case if the rotation goes to zero. The original Curzon solution shows that there are two singularities at the two masses, while in the modified version the singularities become on the world-line of the two masses. The solution shows no additional coordinate singularities. The killing vector field of the axial symmetry is obtained in the modified version. In addition, the rotation admits a further rotational symmetry, so a rotation killing vector field is also obtained and discussed. The equations of motion for a test particle in the field of a binary system are formulated and solved. Such equations have been used to study the gravitational time delay of arrival (Shapiro delay) of signals from binary pulsar systems resulted from our suggested modifications containing additional terms. These terms are interpreted as higher order corrections to the masses. In particular we investigate the gravito-magnetic effect due to orbital angular motion of the double pulsars. We give numerical estimates of this type of the time delay {{in the case of the}} double-pulsar system PSR J 0737 - 3039 A/B. We draw a model curve for the gravito-magnetic time delay during one orbital revolution. We suggest that this type of delay will have a larger contribution during the last phase of the system evolution. Comment: 24 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 1 diagram.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{demonstrate}} how some of the simplest concepts in physics affect us in our everyday life, but not just anyone, in particular dancers. Dancers will complete combinations across the floor without really thinking about how they accomplish them. They learn the combination and apply the correct technique to each movement. It is common in dance for certain steps to inevitably go together in certain types of combinations. The dancers don't realize that the reason this is done is to cancel out or create forces and momentum as needed for a given combination. I will be addressing this very topic. While with the acquisition of data that I measured {{it is possible to}} "plug and chug" the <b>numerical</b> <b>values</b> into force <b>equations</b> and get out a number, the number is not really that important. It is very hard to attach a significance to the idea of experiencing 4000 lbs. of force. The number, although useful for physicists, is not as important as the theory behind the forces themselves. It is sometimes possible to attach a physical meaning to a concept in physics. One example would be what physicists refer to as the normal force but what everyone else terms weight. So with a slight introduction into the laws of physics I hope that dancers will better understand how their movements relate to each other. For anyone else I hope to introduce a window into the realm of physics and ballet. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

To account for this finding, Walsh's (2003) A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM) model suggests that magnitude of time is not differentiated from magnitude of other nontemporal stimulus characteristics and collectively processed by a generalized magnitude system. In Experiment 1, we investigated the combined effects of stimulus size and numerical quantity, as two nontemporal stimulus dimensions covered by the ATOM model, on duration judgments. Participants were required to reproduce the duration of target intervals marked by Arabic digits varying in physical size and <b>numerical</b> <b>value.</b> While the effect of stimulus size was effectively moderated by target duration, the effect of <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> appeared to require attentional resources directed to the <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> in order to become effective.
