5|$|Dead Island, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, {{it was a}} game about killing zombies, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Barker {{hosted a}} series called That's My Line for Goodson-Todman.

The show's second season in 1981 focused more on unusual stunts, and was {{cancelled}} in September.|$|E

25|$|The next year, {{hobbyist}} Harry Dodgson {{released the}} first homebrew cartridge, titled 7800/2600 Monitor Cartridge. The cartridge was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> {{but rather a}} diagnostic tool that Dodgson hoped to persuade Atari Corp to market to customers interested in programming their own Atari 7800 games. As Atari no longer manufactured the keyboard controller required by the cartridge, they declined, so Dodgson decided to manufacture and market the cartridge on his own.|$|E
25|$|Like intuitionism, constructivism {{involves}} the regulative principle that only mathematical entities {{which can be}} explicitly constructed {{in a certain sense}} should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a proof by contradiction.|$|E
25|$|Quiz shows {{virtually}} {{disappeared from}} prime time American television for decades. Those that continued to air had substantially reduced prizes, and many shows adopted {{limits on the}} number of games a player could win (usually five). Quiz shows became game shows, shifting focus from knowledge to puzzles and word games. NBC's comedy/game show Jackpot Bowling and ABC's more serious Make That Spare! were the only big-money game shows still on television after the fallout; as bowling is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> that can easily be rigged for television, those shows continued to air into the early 1960s. A quiz for big money would not return until ABC premiered 100 Grand in 1963; it went off the air after three weeks.|$|E

25|$|The First Test between Australia and England {{is played}} {{nowadays}} a Brisbane. Nobody {{seems to know}} why, {{and all sorts of}} arguments are ventilated for and against more cricket Tests on the Woolloongabba ground. I am all in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a concentration camp! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt...The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains. Then it is a strip of turf with thousands of demons prancing up and down...at Brisbane only a Hutton could stay, let alone score runs.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reception}} of the QuakeCon 2014 trailer accumulated considerable acclaim among fans, and initial {{reception of}} the E3 2015 trailer was also positive, despite receiving criticisms by some critics, who considered the game to be too violent. Pete Hines from Bethesda Softworks responded {{by saying that the}} game is designed to allow players to apply violence on demons instead of humans. Hines added that, [...] "if you're not into violent, bloody games... Doom probably <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> for you." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{interviews}} {{during the}} writing and filming of season 2 showrunner Beau Willimon {{said he had}} drawn inspiration for the series {{from a variety of}} sources including Robert Caro's The Years of Lyndon Johnson and Jeremy Larner's Nobody Knows. Lyndon B. Johnson was a repeated source for themes and issues. Willimon also commented on the fictional world of politics that the show represented: [...] "It's a rough-and-tumble game whenever power is involved—people's ambitions, their desires, their competitive spirit will often push them to play outside the rules." [...] Willimon noted that [...] "I don't think about topping things ... The evolution of character is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of one-upmanship. It is about change. Souls are vast and so the opportunity to explore ways in which characters contradict themselves and evolve is also vast" [...] and that season 2 provided the opportunity [...] "to expand the world and more deeply explore the characters".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{tells of the}} protagonist's devotion to her lover, proclaiming that while she knows [...] "you've got me", she'll be [...] "lovin' him long time". The first verse begins with [...] "You ain't even got to worry / About a thing, I've got you babe / And ain't nobody takin' me away / Its <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> I'm here to stay", {{describing}} her strong emotional attachment to him. As the verse continues, Carey makes references and comparisons to their love and drugs powerful effect over the body and its senses. Carey describes the limits of her love during the chorus, singing [...] "As long as I can breathe" [...] and [...] "Eternally". During the second verse, she sings how no matter what others say about their relationship, they will continue being together, and describing a private moment they shared, their [...] "Little spot where no one knows".|$|E
500|$|Following {{a scratch}} match {{at the start}} of the 1859 {{football}} season, the Melbourne Football Club officially came into being on 14 May. Three days later, Wills and three other members—Hammersley, journalist J. B. Thompson and teacher Thomas H. Smith—met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, to devise and codify the club's rules. The men went over the rules of four English schools; Hammersley recalled Wills' preference for the Rugby game, but it was found to be confusing and too violent. Subsequently, they rejected common features such as [...] "hacking" [...] (shin-kicking) and produced a signed document listing ten simple rules suited to grown men and Australian conditions. Heading the list of signatories, Wills, too, saw the need for compromise. He wrote to his brother Horace: [...] "Rugby was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> for us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground so we thought differently." [...] Thompson and Hammersley's promotion of the new code, together with Wills' star power, encouraged the spread of football throughout Victoria.|$|E

500|$|The Toronto Stars William Burrill {{called it}} [...] "the best fantasy ... {{role-playing}} game in this (or any parallel) world." [...] He praised its automap and noted its increased graphical fidelity. However, {{he found that}} the control system took time to learn, and he stated, [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> you can master quickly or play in a night. It has its frustrations and its flaws, despite its brilliance of design". He summarized that [...] "those who are patient will be richly rewarded with a game like no other." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds Doug Sencat enjoyed the game's graphics and praised the plot, conversations and 3D world for giving a sense of [...] "being there". However, he noted that the game's movement controls were [...] "a pain" [...] and that navigating the environment was initially [...] "frustrating". Sencat was unfavorable toward the linearity of the plot and dialogue trees, and toward NPCs' inability to take actions independent of the player. He described the game as [...] "a long and grueling quest" [...] that often [...] "seems more frustrating than enjoyable". Although Semcat called it [...] "a relatively high-quality game", he finished, [...] "By the time I finally saw daylight again, emerging from the Labyrinth, I must admit that it wasn't exultation I felt, but sheer relief." [...] The magazine's Scorpia was more positive, calling the game [...] "a good follow-up to the previous entry".|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Manhunt reached a peak on July 28, 2004, {{when the game}} {{was linked to the}} murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah by his 17-year-old friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc's bedroom, which police had seized as evidence, and Giselle Pakeerah, the victim's mother, stated [...] "I think that I heard some of Warren's friends say that he was obsessed by this game. To quote from the website that promotes it, it calls it a psychological experience, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> and it encourages brutal killing. If he was obsessed by it, it could well be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy." [...] Stefan's father, Patrick, added [...] "they were playing a game called Manhunt. The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out, killing people using weapons like hammers and knives. There is some connection between the game and what he has done." [...] Patrick continued [...] "The object of Manhunt is not just to go out and kill people. It's a point-scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is. That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then we do not want them in the shops." [...] A spokesman for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers' Association (ELSPA) responded to the accusations by stating [...] "We sympathize enormously with the family and parents of Stefan Pakeerah. However, we reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of the video game Manhunt. The game in question is classified 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore its copies should not be in the possession of a minor. Simply being in someone's possession does not and should not lead to the conclusion that a game is responsible for these tragic events." ...|$|E

On the contrary, Enlightenment salonnières were {{precisely}} those women who fought the general malaise of the period by taking up their métier." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{biological}} literature, {{this game is}} known as Hawk–Dove. [...] The earliest presentation of a form of the Hawk–Dove game was by John Maynard Smith and George Price in their paper, [...] "The logic of animal conflict". [...] The traditional [...] payoff matrix for the Hawk–Dove game is given in Figure 3, where V {{is the value of}} the contested resource, and C is the cost of an escalated fight. [...] It is (almost always) assumed that the value of the resource is less than the cost of a fight, i.e., C>V>0. If C≤V, the resulting game is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of Chicken but is instead a Prisoner's Dilemma.|$|E
2500|$|Bawer also {{published}} {{a collection of}} essays on poetry, Prophets and Professors, in 1995. “Running through these critical commentaries,” wrote Publishers Weekly, “is the theme that too many younger poets are caught up in romantic excess, that the influence of Allen Ginsberg and the Beats and the confessional self-destruction of Sylvia Plath have excused so much of the sloppy, informal and poured-out emotion of today's poets... He {{is on the side of}} the formalists and those for whom poetry is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of literary gossip.
