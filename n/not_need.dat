5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to be transported.|$|E

5|$|Aposematic species do <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to hide or stay {{still as}} cryptic organisms do, so aposematic {{individuals}} benefit from more freedom in exposed areas and can {{spend more time}} foraging, allowing them to find more and better quality food.
