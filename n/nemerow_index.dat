40|$|The {{heavy metals}} {{pollution}} in farm soil around the transportation skeleton line in Jiaoke was investigated. 14 soil {{samples were collected}} and treated with HNO 3 -HF-HCLO 4,then the contents of Cd、Cr、Cu、Ni、Pb 、Zn and As were determined by ICP-MS and assessed systematically, forms of the heavy metals were analyzed by Tessier method. The results indicted that the soil belonged to polymetalic compound pollution in which As、Cd and Pb were the most serious pollutants. The pollution was the heaviest in farm soil that 15 m apart from the transportation line, with <b>Nemerow</b> <b>index</b> 6. 1465. We found that the <b>Nemerow</b> <b>index</b> reduced {{with the increase of}} the distance. Forms of the heavy metals showed: the valid state percentage of heavy metal in soil followed the order of Pb＞ Ni＞Cr＞Cu＞Cd＞Zn＞As. The forms of Ni,Cd,Zn and Pb in farm soil showed: residual fraction ＞Fe-Mn oxidizable fraction＞organic fraction＞exchangeable fraction＞acid extractable fraction, The forms of Cu and As in farm soil showed: residual fraction＞organic fraction＞Fe-Mn oxidizable fraction＞exchangeable fraction＞acid extractable fraction; The forms of Cr in farm soil showed: residual fraction ＞ Fe-Mn oxidizable fraction ＞ organic fraction ＞ acid extractable fraction ＞ exchangeable fraction. The higher valid state and lower residual fraction percentage of Pb in soil implied that it should be paid attention to potential effects of heavy metals on regional ecosystem. 特集 : 「資源、新エネルギー、環境、防災研究国際セミナー...|$|E

In the study, Hakason index, <b>Nemerow</b> <b>index</b> (P), the hazard index (HI) and the cancer risk index (RI) were calculated to assess the potential risk. The sequence of potential ecological risk based on Hakason index was arsenic (As) > cadmium (Cd) > lead (Pb) > copper (Cu) > chromium (Cr), in particular, As and Cd were regarded as high polluted metals. While the results of extraction of TCLP were assessed using P, the sequence was As > Pb > Cd > Cr > Cu, which mean that As and Pb should be low polluted, and Cd, Cr and Cu would barely not polluted. For human health, total carcinogenic risk {{for children and adults}} was 2. 01 × 10 (- 3) and 1. 05 × 10 (- 3), respectively.

Our study proposed geochemical baseline values for heavy metals in a natural region (La Zanja) from samples collected {{during the period of}} the environmental impact study (2006), that is, from an earlier period which occurred {{at the beginning of the}} exploitation of the current gold mine. The baseline values obtained were as follows: 8. 26 mg kg− 1 for Cr; 56. 97 mg kg− 1 for Ni; 22, 20 mg kg− 1 for the Cu; 47. 42 mg kg− 1 for Zn; 27. 50 mg kg− 1 for As; 4. 36 mg kg− 1 for Cd; 4. 89 mg kg− 1 for Hg, and 44. 87 mg kg− 1 for Pb. Through the use of different indices of heavy metal contamination (geo-accumulation index (Igeo), improved <b>Nemerow</b> <b>index</b> (IIN) and potential ecological risk index (RI)), the degree of pollution caused by mining activities in two areas, Colquirrumi and Julcani, which have a high density of mining sites in operation, was determined.

The water samples were collected on monthly basis from June 2009 to March 2010 from 10 sites. The WQI was calculated based on different water standards for different uses. Excellent water has WQI value of 50 – 100, where WQI {{is calculated based on}} 29 parameters. The permissible range of %Na in water used for irrigation purpose should be between 40 % and 60 %. On the other hand, if 0 <NPI< 1. 0, then the water is regarded as being in a good condition. In this study, WQI ranged from 34 to 513 with an average of 282, thereby indicating mild pollution at some sites. The %Na value ranged between 19 and 66, with an average value of 46 indicating that the water is suitable for irrigation at most of the sites. The NPI ranged between 1 and 11 with an average value of 5, which indicates that water in most of the sites is in a good condition.

In this study, water quality impairment was assessed {{on the basis of}} 7 hydrochemical variables that were monitored bimonthly at 17 sites in 2010 along the rural-suburban-urban portion of the Wen-Rui Tang River in eastern China. Seven methods were used to assess water quality in the river system. These methods included single-factor assessment, water quality grading, comprehensive pollution <b>index,</b> the <b>Nemerow</b> pollution <b>index,</b> principle component analysis, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and comprehensive water quality identification index. Our analysis showed that the comprehensive water quality identification index was the best method for assessing water quality in the Wen-Rui Tang River due to its ability to effectively characterize highly polluted waters with multiple impairments. Furthermore, a guideline for the applications of these methods was presented based on their characteristics and efficacy. Results indicated that the dominant pollutant impairing water quality was total nitrogen comprised mainly of ammonium. The temporal variation of water quality was closely related to precipitation as a result of dilution. The spatial variation of water quality was associated with anthropogenic influences (urban, industrial, and agriculture activities) and water flow direction (downstream segments experiencing cumulative effects of upstream inputs).

Single pollution index is lower than 1, and the <b>Nemerow</b> integrated pollution <b>index</b> is 0. 305, which means that study area has not been polluted. The semivariograms of soil heavy metal single pollution index fitted spherical and exponential models. The variable ratio of single pollution index showed moderately spatial dependence. Heavy metal contents showed relative safety in the study area...|$|R
40|$|The Sarno River is {{considered}} the most polluted river in Europe {{and one of the}} ten most polluted rivers in the world. So far, its quality has been usually evaluated by water and sediment analyses of either inorganic or organic pollutants. However, a biomonitoring approach would be of paramount importance in the evaluation of river quality, since it integrates pollutant temporal fluctuations, {{as in the case of}} discontinuous inputs from urban, industrial and agricultural activities. To this end, a passive biomonitoring study of the Sarno River was carried out, using two native aquatic plants accumulators of inorganic pollutants. The spring area was monitored analysing the roots of the semi-submerged Apium nodiflorum, whereas the whole river course was monitored analysing the shoots of the submerged Potamogeton pectinatus. The information on the four macronutrient (Ca, K, Mg, P), the six micronutrient (Cu, Fe, Mn, Na, Ni, Zn) and the four toxic element (Cd, Cr, Pb, V) concentrations were separately combined in the <b>Nemerow</b> Pollution <b>Index.</b> Results evidenced a severe pollution degree of the Sarno River, attributable to toxic elements>micronutrients>macronutrients. In particular, the spring area showed high K concentrations, as well as high concentrations of several micronutrients and toxic elements. A generalized Zn contamination and a progressive macronutrient (above all Ca and P), micronutrient (above all Ni, Cu and Fe) and toxic element (above all Cr and Pb) accumulation toward the mouth was related to pollution from agricultural and urban activities. Industrial sources, especially tanneries along the Solofrana tributary, accounted for high Mn concentrations, whereas the volcanic origin of the substrate accounted for a generalized V contamination...|$|R
40|$|Northeast China is an {{intensive}} area of resource-exhausted city, which {{is facing the}} chal-lenges of industry conversion and sustainable development. In order to evaluate the soil environmental quality influenced by mining activities over decades, the concentration and spatial distribution of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) in surface soils (0 - 20 cm) of a typical resource-exhausted city were investigated by analyzing 306 soil samples. The {{results showed that the}} average concentra-tions in the samples were 6. 17 mg/kg for As, 0. 19 mg/kg for Cd, 51. 08 mg/kg for Cr, 23. 27 mg/kg for Cu, 31. 15 mg/kg for Ni, 22. 17 mg/kg for Pb, and 54. 21 mg/kg for Zn. Metals distri-bution maps produced by using the inverse distance weighted interpolation method and results revealed that all investigated metals showed distinct geographical patterns, and the concentrations were higher in urban and industrial areas than in farmland. Pearson correla-tion and principal component analysis showed that there were significant positive correla-tions (p< 0. 05) between all of the metals, and As, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were closely associated with the first principal component (PC 1), which explained 39. 81 % of the total variance. Cu and As were mainly associated with the second component (PC 2). Based on the calculated <b>Nemerow</b> pollution <b>index,</b> percentage for slightly polluted (1 <P 2) surface soils were reached 57. 33 %, while 42. 65 % topsoil samples are moderate polluted (2 <P 3). According to the results above-mentioned, different soil environmental function areas were classified and proper soil environmental management policy was proposed to decrease the environmental risks in the process of industrial city transformation...|$|R
40|$|Contamination by {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) of historic wastewater-irrigated agricultural topsoil (0 - 5 cm) and the contribution of groundwater irrigation and atmospheric deposition to soil PAHs were studied in a typical agricultural region, i. e. Hunpu region, Liaoning, China. Concentrations of total PAHs ranged from 0. 43 to 2. 64 mg kg(- 1) in topsoil, being lower than those found in other wastewater-irrigated areas. The levels of PAHs in soil declined as the distance from a water source increased. Concentrations of individual PAHs were generally higher in upland than in paddy topsoils. The calculated <b>nemerow</b> composite <b>index</b> showed that agricultural soil in the region was "polluted" by PAHs. A human health risk assessment based on the total toxic equivalent concentration showed {{that the presence of}} elevated concentrations of PAHs in the soil might pose a great threat to the health of local residents. Ratios of pairs of PAHs and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that pyrogenesis, such as coal combustion, was the main source of PAHs, while petroleum, to some extent, also had a strong influence on PAHs contamination in upland soil. The distribution patterns of individual PAHs and composition of PAHs differed between irrigation groundwater and topsoil, but were similar between atmospheric deposition and topsoil. There were significant linear correlations (r = 0. 90; p < 0. 01) between atmospheric deposition rates and average concentrations of the 16 individual PAHs in soils, while no significant relationships were observed between irrigation groundwater and topsoil in levels of PAHs. These suggested that PAHs in agricultural soils were mainly introduced from atmospheric deposition, rather than from groundwater irrigation after the phasing out of wastewater irrigation in the region since 2002. This study provides a reference to ensure agricultural product safety, pollution control, and proper soil management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{concentration}} of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn and Fe) were studied around coal mine spoil piles in Shiguai district of Baotou located in Inner Mongolia grassland and desert transition zone. Aim {{of the study}} is to control soil heavy metal pollution of coal mining area and provide the basic data information. The results indicated that concentrations of Cu, Cr, Ni and Zn in the soil along the roadsides were higher than other sampling areas. The pollution characteristic and the elements of heavy metal contamination were corresponding with the concentrations of the different types of coal mine spoils. According to the single factor pollution index, soils from different regions were contaminated by Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn and Fe in varying degree. The pollution degree was in order: Cu> Cr> Fe> Zn> Ni> Mn. <b>Nemerow’s</b> synthetical pollution <b>index</b> indicated that soils from the roadsides had the most serious heavy metal contamination, the index was 3. 11. The order of pollution level in different regions was: roadsides> flood land> farmland> woodland. The health and stabilization of environmental quality are being threatened by soil heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|The {{exposure}} of heavy metals to lake bed sediment of scenic areas may pose risks on aquatic ecosystems and human health, however very few studies on risk assessment {{have been reported}} for scenic areas. Accordingly, this study determined concentration levels, and assessed contamination characteristics and risks, of heavy metals in lake bed sediment of National Scenic Areas Songhuahu (NSAS) in China. The concentrations of Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu were determined in 29 bed sediment samples. Results showed that the mean values of Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu were 92. 69, 90. 73, 38. 29, 46. 77, and 49. 44 mg/kg, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated that organic matter was a major factor influencing distribution of heavy metals. The results for enrichment factors indicated that contamination rates and anthropogenic inputs of single heavy metals decreased in the order Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > Zn; results of <b>Nemerow</b> integrated pollution <b>index</b> suggested that 72. 41 % of sampling sites were exposed to low to moderately integrated pollution, and 27. 59 % of sampling sites were exposed to strongly integrated pollution. According to results for potential ecological risk index, ecological risks of single and all the heavy metals in bed sediment from all the sampling sites were low. Human risks were assessed with hazardous quotients, and the results suggested that {{exposure of}} heavy metals to bed sediment posed no or little risk to human health, and the pathway of ingestion significantly contributed to human health risks...|$|R
40|$|Land use {{of sewage}} sludge is the primary {{disposal}} method in Shanxi, accounting for 42. 66 % of all. To determine the ecological risk of heavy metals in sewage sludge, contents of seven heavy metals in sewage sludge from 9 municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) that had the highest application for land use were determined. The order of the measured concentrations was: Zn > Cr > Cu > Ni > Pb > As > Cd, and all heavy metals contents were within the threshold limit values of the Chinese Control Standards for Pollutants in Sludge from Agriculture Use (GB 4284 - 84). Four indices {{were used to assess}} the pollution and the ecological risk of heavy metals. By the mean values of the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), heavy metals were ranked in the following order: Cd > Zn > Cu > As > Cr > Ni > Pb. The values showed that the pollution of Zn in station 3 and Cd in station 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 were heavily; Cu in station 8 and 9, Zn in station 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 and Cd in station 5 and 7 were moderately to heavily, and the accumulation of other heavy metals were not significant. The single-factor pollution index (PI) suggested that none of the stations had heavy metals contamination, except for Cu in station 9, Zn in station 3 and 8, and Cd in station 1 and 9, which were at a moderate level. According to the results of the <b>Nemerow’s</b> synthetic pollution <b>index</b> (PN), sewage sludge from all stations was safe for land use with respect to heavy metals contamination, except for stations 3, 8 and 9, which were at the warning line. The monomial potential ecological risk coefficient (Eri) revealed that heavy metals ecological risks in most stations were low. However, station 9 had a moderate risk for Cu; station 6 had a moderate risk, stations 5 and 7 had high risk, other stations had very high risk for Cd. According to the results of the potential ecological risk index (RI), station 1, 8 and 9 had high risk; station 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 had a moderate risk, and station 6 had a low risk. The preliminary results indicated that the potential risk of land exposure to heavy metals in sewage sludge was relatively low, with Zn and Cd as the main contributor to the ecological risk for the applying {{of sewage sludge}} on land. Additionally, stations 3, 8 and 9 require more attention regarding the land applications related to heavy metals pollution...|$|R
