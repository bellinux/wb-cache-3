5|$|Mad Maxs quest design also {{received}} mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised {{the content and}} activities scattered across the world, calling the activities engaging for most players. However, he disliked the repetition which dragged down their replay value. Hurley found it easy for players to become confused in the game's early stages, since the objectives are unclear. Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity. Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that the game brought <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the genre, and its quests and features were too similar to typical Ubisoft open-world design.|$|E
5|$|Siliconera writer Rolando again {{echoed the}} {{necessity}} for understanding Japanese due to the game's text-heavy nature while noting the plot was quite simple and in common with other Monolith Soft titles, but otherwise generally praised the gameplay mechanics and noted that multiplayer would be fun {{despite the lack of}} WiFi functionality. In conclusion, he positively compared Soma Bringer to console turn-based role-playing game Lost Odyssey: while it brought <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the genre, it was a nostalgic experience that reminded players of the genre's worth. English previews positively compared the gameplay to the Mana series, with 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish also noting it feeling familiar to gameplay from the Diablo series. These comparisons were also shared by other reviewers.|$|E
25|$|It {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews, with critics finding the gameplay unoriginal, {{and the overall}} game as bringing <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the genre. Originally intended as the first game in a franchise to bear the Ancient Wars name, no further titles were made, although a spiritual successor with the same game engine was released in 2008, Fate of Hellas (released in North America as Great War Nations: The Spartans).|$|E

This was Evans' second album as a leader, since New Jazz Conceptions, recorded two years earlier.

25|$|Although the {{existence}} of dictionaries and encyclopedias spanned into ancient times, and would be <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> Enlightenment readers, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century encyclopedic dictionaries. The works {{were part of an}} Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the educated elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers’ tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on secular affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of theology.|$|E
25|$|Human {{sacrifice}} {{and other forms}} of torture—self-inflicted or otherwise—were common to many parts of Mesoamerica. Thus the rite was <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the Aztecs when they arrived to the Valley of Mexico, nor was it something unique to pre-Columbian Mexico. Other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Purépechas and Toltecs, performed human sacrifices as well and from archaeological evidence, it probably existed since the time of the Olmecs (1200–400 BC), and perhaps even throughout the early farming cultures of the region. Although the extent of human sacrifice is unknown among several Mesoamerican civilizations, such as Teotihuacán, what distinguished Maya and Aztec human sacrifice was the importance with which it was embedded in everyday life.|$|E

25|$|Though <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the {{economic}} history of Argentina, {{he is often}} accused of implementing financial policies that may have allowed Argentina's main private enterprises to transfer their debts to the state, transforming their private debt into public obligations. During 1982 and 1983, more than 200 firms (30 economic groups and 106 transnational enterprises) transferred {{a great part of}} their 17 billion dollar debt to the federal government, thanks to secured exchange rates on loan installments. This fraud took place both before and after his very brief turn at the Central Bank, but not while he was in charge. In a speech in September 1982 he was forced renounce and express his opposition to the transfer of debt to the state. He inherited this practice from Martínez de Hoz himself (whose chief interest, steelmaker Acindar, had unloaded US$700 million of its debts in this way). Moreover, Cavallo subjected payments covered by these exchange rate guarantees to indexation; this latter stipulation was dropped by his successor, Julio González del Solar. In either case, the mechanism turning private debt into liabilities of the state continued even after the advent of democracy under Raúl Alfonsín (1983–89) and into {{the economic}} crisis that surrounded the peso's last sharp devaluation in early 2002.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks reached #20 on the Japan Oricon charts. It {{received}} mixed reviews.

[...] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 63 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews".

500|$|The {{concept of}} dual rulership was <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the Roman Empire. Augustus, the first Emperor, had {{nominally}} shared power with his colleagues, and more formal offices of Co-Emperor had existed from Marcus Aurelius on. Most recently, Emperor Carus {{and his sons}} had ruled together, albeit unsuccessfully. Diocletian was in a less comfortable position than most of his predecessors, as he had a daughter, Valeria, but no sons. His co-ruler had to be from outside his family, raising the question of trust. Some historians state that Diocletian adopted Maximian as his filius Augusti, his [...] "Augustan son", upon his appointment to the throne, following the precedent of some previous Emperors.

The actor heavily resisted the film, claiming that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> create and that people would be watching the film to see the shark, not him. According to his biographer, Scheider was so desperate to be relieved from the role that he [...] "pleaded insanity and went crazy in The Beverly Hills Hotel". However, he was given an attractive financial package for appearing in Jaws 2; he quadrupled his base salary from the first film, and negotiated points (a percentage of the film's net profits). The Star newspaper reported that Scheider received $500,000 for 12 weeks work, plus $35,000 for each additional week that the schedule ran over.|$|E

Ananth Krishnan, another review from The Hindu, {{a month after the}} film's release, said that the film [...] "... presents an effective diagnosis of entrenched corruption but the rather disturbing remedy it offers is, good old vigilantism." [...] It concluded by saying that, though the film did well at the box-office, the message of rejecting the corrupt system instead of reforming it was troubling. T. S. V. Hari of Hindustan Times said that the director, Shankar, was not creative enough for the film and added this by saying [...] "Sivaji {{turns out to be a}} rehash of all his previous jingoistic claptrap efforts".
