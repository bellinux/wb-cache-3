A particular pattern was printed on PET film by means of roll-to-roll gravure printing machine. The calendering process was applied {{to a set of}} samples and the effect was analyzed after measuring the surface roughness and the thickness of pattern. Although only mechanical pressure provided by a <b>nip</b> <b>roll</b> was applied during the calendering process, the experimental results indicate that the calendering process should be useful for enhancing the surface quality of roll-to-roll printed electronics products...|$|E

Calendering {{is a traditional}} surface finishing technique widely used in the paper industry to give the paper surface a smoother and glossier look [23]. In calendering nip, paperboard web is compressed between rolls with controllable temperature, pressure, nip time (web speed), and <b>nip</b> <b>roll</b> materials. Compressibility of the nanoparticle coating will affect surface properties such as wettability. Individual nanoparticle compressibility has been studied [24 – 26] under high-pressure by X-ray diffraction. However, {{as far as the}} authors know, a systematic study of porous nanoparticle coating compressibility has not been presented until now.|$|E

PLA nanocomposites containing 1, 3 and 5 phr of nanoclay were compounded in a co-rotating twin screw extruder, to study the effect of nanoclay content on film processibility of composites as well as properties of blown films. Film blowing processing conditions such as temperature, rpm, feed rate, air pressure and <b>nip</b> <b>roll</b> speed were optimized. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data showed that the cold crystallization and melting temperatures were influenced {{by the presence of}} nanoclay. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed increase in the decomposition temperature for all the nanocomposites. The measurement of rheological properties of Polylactide/nanoclay helped in understand the processability as well structure-property relationship in nanocomposites. Temperature dependent (DMTA) and Frequency dependent (Oscillatory shear Rheology) viscoelastic spectra showed an increase in the storage and loss moduli with the increase in the organoclay content. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to determine the degree of intercalation and exfoliation as a function of nanoclay content of nanocomposites. XRD data showed complete exfoliation in the film at lower nanoclay content. On increasing the nanoclay content both the exfoliated and partially intercalated structures were obtained. Nanocomposites blown film specimen showed the improvement in tensile properties...|$|E

50|$|Tension {{adjustment}} is necessary due to several mechanical factors: oscillations caused by mechanical misalignments, differing inertial response (lag) of mechanical elements during web acceleration, out-of-round unwind and tension <b>rolls,</b> slipping through <b>nip</b> <b>rolls,</b> and over-aggressive web-guide correction. Several technical process and control issues also affect tension: tension setpoint changes, phase offset on driven rolls, tension bleed from one zone to another, and thermal effect (contraction/expansion) as the substrate passes through various processes. It {{is impossible to}} eliminate all factors requiring tension adjustment. Variance in any one factor in a zone necessitates changes in tension control and web speed. Consequently, with coupled tension zone control, jitter is inevitable in a continuous web where the controllers cause a feedback loop.|$|R
50|$|Reverse {{roll coating}} is a roll-to-roll coating method for wet coatings. It is {{distinguished}} from other roll coating methods by having two reverse-running <b>nips.</b> The metering <b>roll</b> and the applicator roll contra-rotate, with an accurate gap between them. The {{surface of the}} applicator roll is loaded with an excess of coating prior to the metering nip, so its surface emerges from the metering nip with a precise thickness of coating equal to the gap. At the application <b>nip,</b> the applicator <b>roll</b> transfers all of this coating to the substrate, by running {{in the opposite direction}} to the movement of the substrate, wiping the coating onto the substrate.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of biaxially oriented films {{can be performed}} with two techniques: the tenter frame and the double bubble process. The most important {{difference between the two}} processes is that in tubular orientation the MD and TD stretching are simultaneous. This event is very important specially in the case of biaxially oriented polyamide films to avoid hydrogen bonding which occur during the first stretching stage of tenter frame process and cause resistance to subsequent transverse direction orientation (1 - 4). Double bubble process consists in the stretching of a tubular film where the stretching ratios in the machine and transverse directions are determined by inside bubble pressure and the difference in roll speeds between the two sets of <b>nips</b> <b>rolls</b> that contain the bubble. The work presented here reports some results about double bubble polyamide films realised with a laboratory scale system. The study concerns the processability (5 - 6) of two different polyamides: a nylon 6 (PA 6) and a copolymer of the nylon 6 with isophthalic acid and isophorondiamine (PA 6 - IPA. IPD) at 5 % w/w of comonomer. Two main process arrangements where adopted differing for first bubble cooling technique: a water cooling and a air cooling. The films produced in both conditions were then characterised with a particular regard to mechanical and barrier performances. Morphological analyses were also carried out in order to correlate the process conditions to structure and properties of films...|$|R

40|$|Powder-formed coating {{materials}} applicable for dry surface treatment (DST) {{of paper and}} board have been under study the recent few years. DST involves {{the application of the}} powdery coating components onto the paper surface by electrostatic deposition and thermomechanical smoothening and fixation of the deposited layer in a heated <b>roll</b> <b>nip.</b> Two types of {{coating materials}} have been considered; pigment coatings and polymer coatings. Drying of conventional pigment-latex slurries to powdery materials was primarily used in order to compare the effects of the treatments on the coating layer. The performance of DST-papers was studied in relation to the structure of the coating particles and to the viscoelastic properties of the polymeric binders. Particle aggregation was recognized to be a dominant factor influencing the structure and hence the characteristics of the DST-papers. To avoid the drying-related aggregation, formation of the binder polymer in water-free conditions was targeted. Within this approach, the polymerization of binder particles {{in the presence of the}} pigments in supercritical carbon dioxide was examined and found in principle to be a practical route for the manufacture of dry-processed hybrid particles. For the polymer coating, the experimental grades of polyethylene were obtained directly from the polymerization reactor and ground to finer sizes. A fine particle size and sufficiently high melt flow improved the sealing of the paper surface and thus the performance of polymer coated DST-papers against their extrusion-coated counterparts...|$|R
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{trend in}} paper machines is towards an increased running speed. At the same time, the paper produced {{must have a}} higher and more even quality. In printing papers the main end-use properties and quality components are runnability, printability, and print quality. These coexistent requirements create new demands for the behaviour of rolls under production conditions. High quality printing paper grades are coated. In blade coating {{the thickness of the}} coating film on the paper surface is found to be heavily dependent on the run-out of the backing roll which supports the paper web against the metering blade. The run-out tolerance of backing rolls at running speed has lately been 50  µm and should be substantially reduced in the future. The new tolerances can no longer be met by tightening the traditional roll manufacturing tolerances. A new predictive 3 D grinding method has been developed to improve roll behaviour in the paper production environment. It consists of a measuring system, which can verify the rotational and geometry errors of the roll at running speed, and a 3 D grinding system, which controls the grinding process according to the information gained by these measurements. In this study, the new method was applied to the backing rolls of a coating station. The experiments were carried out in a paper mill, on a medium-weight coated (MWC) paper production line. The paper was analysed before and after the predictive 3 D grinding. The predictive 3 D grinding reduced the machine direction (MD) ash variation caused by the backing rolls by an average of 76  %. Ash variation correlates well with coating variation. As a result of a more even coating film, MD gloss variation was reduced by 82  %. Reduced gloss variation improves the print quality of LWC paper. The variation in thickness caused by the backing rolls was reduced by 74  %. More even paper thickness reduces excitations and therefore improves runnability in calendering, winding, and printing. A new paradigm for roll grinding was set. The applications of the technology are not limited to high-speed paper machine rolls; the method can also be applied to different kinds of <b>nips</b> of <b>rolls.</b> The method can compensate for a systematic error causing nip force variation, such as uneven thermal expansion or the uneven flexural stiffness of a roll. The technology can be applied in different industries, such as the steel, plastics, or aluminium industries. With this method, it is also possible to use rolls in applications which have requirements too high to be met by traditional technology. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT During calendering, {{which is}} done {{in order to improve}} its {{printing}} properties, the paper is compressed in one or more <b>roll</b> <b>nips.</b> Paper is a viscoelastic material and this will influence its performance during calendering. At least for woodfree paper, the imposed compressive stress has a much greater influence on the remaining deformation (after unloading) than the duration of the compression. A consequence of this is that a soft calender nip will produce a lower deformation than a hard calender nip at a given line load. Furthermore, a soft nip does not suppress surface topography in a size region corresponding to fibre flocs as much as a hard nip. In this perspective, soft-nip calendering constitutes a more uniform treatment than hard-nip calendering. However, the in-plane density variations increased with both types of calender nips, although less pronounced in the case of soft nip calendering. 	Calendering at a high temperature leads to a selective deformation of the surface region. This phenomenon can be used to optimise the relationship between mechanical and surface properties. At a given degree of deformation, properties like stiffness and gloss depends on the conditions at which the deformation was achieved. Calculations of an effective bending modulus can be used to characterise the stratification of the structure induced by the high-temperature calendering. A similar effect can in principle also be attained by establishing a moisture gradient in the thickness direction of the sheet. Moisture is more difficult to use (than temperature) for such a purpose. A water box application directly on a calender was one working strategy employed here in order to obtain moisture gradient calendering. 	A positive effect of precalendering a woodfree sheet with regard to surface smoothness could be seen also after coating and final calendering, although it is expected that some of the precalendering effect is offset due to contact with the aqueous phase. Final calendering led to some development of gloss variations. This might indicate an uneven surface porosity, which may have a negative influence on printing properties. However, the precalendering facilitated a more uniform coating layer, which is expected to {{have a positive effect on}} printing properties. In total, it seemed that precalendering was on the whole beneficial for the final properties of the paper product. The degree of precalender deformation controlled the final properties. Speed, type of nip or temperature as such in the precalender operation, appeared not to have major influence on the final properties. 	Water/paper interactions is a common denominator in many cases of interplay between process steps in papermaking. Minimising these interactions appears in many cases to be a useful route to improve the relation beneficial between mechanical and surface properties, since water exposure can lead to an irreversible deformation of the surface structure. Penetration of water and water-based fluids appeared to be controlled mostly by the openness, or porosity of the surface and on the external pressure used when applying the fluid. Wet-pressing and calendering are processes that lead to closure of the surface, which helps to minimise the water penetration in subsequent process steps, e. g. surface sizing and coating...|$|R
