It has also been studied to investigate the effects of these waste materials on the aquatic life. [...] Natural and synthetic oestrogens, such as oestradiol and oestrone, are present in sewage treatment works effluents. In male fathead minnows, exposure to these steroidal compounds leads to an increase in plasma vitellogenin levels exceeding that of even mature female fathead minnows. Vitellogenin blood plasma levels are an indicator for determining if chemicals have an oestrogenic activity to fish. This is also accompanied by an inhibition of testicular growth, even if the exposure is in low concentrations or {{for a short period of}} time.

Relative risk of women on replacement therapy compared to those without such therapy is around 0. 55; there is a gradient which expresses itself by an inverse correlation between the length of the hormonal replacement therapy and risk of coronary heart disease; this substitution therapy is most probably an independent protective factor; there are numerous possible pathogenetic mechanisms, the most important being likely a significant increase of HDL-cholesterol; animal experiments confirm the favourable effects of <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogens</b> on atherogenesis.

40|$|The only study so far {{recorded}} of {{the chemical}} composition of milk produced by ruminants artificially brought into lactation by treatment with synthetic oestrogens, carried out by Folley, Scott Watson & Bottomley [1941 b], showed that the milk from virgin goats receiving regular udder inunctions with 1 % diethylstilboestrol ointment underwent changes qualitatively similar to those occurring after parturition during the transition from colostrum to normal milk. These changes, which took place more gradually in oestrogen-treated than in normal parturient animals, follow the initial secretion of fluids characterized by high fat and non-fatty solid (S. N.

The substitution H 524 A in the ligand binding domain conferred the pesticide-specific peptide recognition pattern and transactivation activity to the oestradiol- and the 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen-complexed receptors, indicating that one important determinant of the pesticide-induced conformation is a lack of stabilisation of any one particular receptor conformation by ligand interaction with H 524, which is known to interact with both oestradiol and 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen.

Water was collected every two days and tested for the concentration of 4 -nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP), known to have estrogenic effects. Fish were exposed to graded concentrations of Lambro water in a flow-through system. Five aquaria, respectively containing tap unchlorinated water (negative control), 10 %, 20 % and 40 % Lambro and 20 % sewage effluent (positive control) were set up (C, L 10, L 20, L 40 and EF 20, respectively).

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{literature}} survey into the consequences of hormone disrupting, and more in particular oestrogenic, substances for human health are summarized.

Available data indicate {{that a large number of}} these substances does not elicit their effects, if any, through interaction with the oestrogen receptor. The attention for the xenoestrogenic substances follows a reported possible decline in the quality of the human sperm. For other phenomena, e. g. breast and testicular cancers an increase in occurrence is reported. It is thought that these phenomena might be related to an increased exposure to oestrogenic substances. However, experimental data, supporting this hypothesis do not exist. A preliminary estimation indicates that exposure to anthropogenic environmental oestrogens contributes much less to the total exposure to oestrogens than exposure to endogenous or almost inevitable exposure to <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogens</b> via the food.

However, {{there are no}} established universal housekeeping miRNAs for the normalisation of miRNAs in body fluids. We have previously identified an oestrogen-responsive miRNA, miR- 494, in regulating the anticoagulant, Protein S, in HuH- 7 liver cells. Moreover, increased thrombotic risk associated with elevated circulating oestrogen levels is frequently observed in pregnant women and oral contraceptive users. In order to identify other oestrogen-responsive miRNAs, including miR- 494, that may be indicative of increased thrombotic risk in plasma, we used nanoString analysis to identify robust and stable endogenous reference miRNAs {{for the study of}} oestrogen-responsive miRNAs in plasma. Results We compared the plasma miRNA expression profile of individuals with: (1) Low circulating oestrogens (healthy men and non-pregnant women not taking oral contraceptives), (2) High circulating synthetic oestrogens, (women taking oral contraceptives) and (3) High circulating <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogens</b> (pregnant females > 14 weeks gestation). From the nanoString analyses, 11 candidate reference miRNAs which exhibited high counts and not significantly differentially expressed between groups were selected for validation using realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and digital droplet PCR (DDPCR) in pooled plasma samples, and the stability of their expression evaluated using NormFinder and BestKeeper algorithms. Four miRNAs (miR- 25 - 5 p, miR- 188 - 5 p, miR- 222 - 3 p and miR- 520 f) demonstrated detectable stable expression between groups and were further analysed by RT-qPCR in individual plasma samples, where miR- 188 - 5 p and miR- 222 - 3 p expression were identified as a stable pair of reference genes.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{incidence}} of HIV, {{there is a}} desperate need to develop simple, cheap and effective new ways of preventing HIV infection. Male circumcision {{reduces the risk of}} infection by about 60 %, probably because of the removal of the Langerhans cells which are abundant in the inner foreskin and are the primary route by which HIV enters the penis. Langerhans cells form {{a vital part of the}} body’s natural defence against HIV and only cause infection when they are exposed to high levels of HIV virions. Rather than removing this natural defence mechanism by circumcision, it may be better to enhance it by thickening the layer of keratin overlying the Langerhans cells, thereby reducing the viral load to which they are exposed. We have investigated the ability of topically administered oestrogen to induce keratinization of the epithelium of the inner foreskin. Histochemically, the whole of the foreskin is richly supplied with oestrogen receptors. The epithelium of the inner foreskin, like the vagina, responds within 24 hours to the topical administration of oestriol by keratinization, and the response persists for at least 5 days after the cessation of the treatment. Oestriol, a cheap, readily available <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen</b> metabolite, rapidly keratinizes the inner foreskin, the site of HIV entry into the penis. This thickening of the overlying protective layer of keratin should reduce the exposure of the underlying Langerhans cells to HIV virions.

Moreover, {{a study of the}} plant substances responsible for these effects revealed the presence of phyto-anti-oestrogens in these plant extracts. In order to explain the mechanism by which these substances exert their antifertility actions, the interaction of the plant extract with oestrogen and progesterone receptors was studied. All crude extracts exerted inhibition of ((3) H) -oestradiol or ((3) H) -Organon binding to their respective receptors but their relative affinities were much lower than those of oestradiol or progesterone. Respective efficiencies of plant extracts in competing for the oestrogen receptor were as follows: A. laxiflora > P. erinaceus > C. macrocarpum > C. nitida. The efficiency order of competition for the progestin receptor was different to that of oestrogen. The most potent competitor was C. macrocarpum extract, followed by P. erinaceus, C. nitida and A. laxiflora. Moreover, the interaction between oestradiol and plant extracts with the oestrogen receptor was determined to be competitive only for C. macrocarpum and A. laxiflora, whereas all compounds produced a competitive inhibition on the progestin receptor binding.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. The {{purpose of}} this project was to review {{possible}} inputs to UK headwater streams of steroid hormones originating from livestock, to investigate hormone contamination in some streams in which concentrations {{were expected to be}} maximal, and to draw conclusions about possible risks that these hormones may pose to aquatic organisms. 2. The review concluded that although livestock in the UK excretes more steroid sex hormones (oestradiol and testosterone) than the human population, almost all of the material deposited on soil by livestock and by manure/slurry spreading is likely to be adsorbed and/or degraded in soil before reaching surface waters. Concentrations of oestrogens in field drains are unlikely to exceed 1 ng/l (expressed as 17 β-oestradiol equivalents), a concentration that is probably harmless. However, it is possible that direct excretion by livestock into unfenced streams, and direct run-off to surface waters from slurry stores and hard-standing in livestock farms, may contribute higher concentrations. In other words, poor farming practice may lead to significant steroid hormone pollution. 3. The review also concluded that surface waters in some other countries are contaminated with oestrogens at potentially active concentrations, so it was considered that a survey of UK headwater streams for hormonal activity was justified. The literature search clearly showed that pregnant cattle are the single most important source of <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogens</b> on livestock farms. 4. The chosen sampling strategy was to focus on a limited number of predominantly dairy farms that were considered to represent worst-case conditions for hormone translocation to small headwater streams. Criteria that contributed towards the choice of field sites included stocking type and density, soil type and slope, access of livestock to the stream, application of manure or slurry to the land, possible direct drainage to the stream of waste from leaking slurry stores and hard-standing areas used by livestock, and access permission from the land-owner. Confounding factors such as upstream inputs of hormonally active material from sewage treatment works, septic tank soak-aways, and industrial discharges, were excluded as far as possible from the study. 5. In order to obtain semi-quantitative, time-integrated samples of hormones in water, locations up- and downstream of livestock activity were sampled on 10 farms using a passive, solid-phase device known as a Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS). These were deployed between November 2004 and January 2005 for 3 to 10 weeks (mean = 39 days). At an eleventh site, a field drain issuing from an experimental plot of cracking clay soil treated solely with dairy cow slurry was also sampled with POCIS. At one site, an automatic flow-driven water sampler was deployed alongside the POCIS to capture water soon after heavy rainfall. 6. POCIS and water extracts were assayed for estrogenic and androgenic activity using the in vitro yeast estrogen screen (YES) and yeast androgen screen (YAS), respectively. As part of a separate project, POCIS extracts were also analysed chemically for oestrone (E 1), 17 β-oestradiol (E 2) and 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) by the Environment Agency. 7. The flow from only one rainfall event was captured in its entirety by the autosampler, but this revealed a background concentration (E 2 equivalents) of 0 - 0. 3 ng/l, rising to a transient peak of 9. 4 ng/l. Average E 2 activity at this site as determined from the POCIS samplers was 1. 8 - 2. 7 ng E 2 equiv. /litre, which provides confidence that the POCIS results are reliable. 8. Estimated oestrogenic activity across all sites (with one exception) lay in the range zero- 26. 5 ng E 2 equiv. /litre (mean = 2. 0 ng/l; standard deviation = 5. 1), based on the POCIS samples. The outlier was 292 ng/l, but this could not be specifically linked with intensive livestock rearing. 92...|$|E

Male and female rats were exposed to low doses of the pure oestrogen, ethynyloestradiol, during development, by oral administration to their mothers during pregnancy and lactation, and to them until puberty. We evaluated the effects of the exposure on development and reproductive physiology of individuals, and on fertility and fecundity of pairs in which both members had been exposed to the same treatment. We found that low doses caused major reproductive deficits in the experimental animals. Very low, environmentally relevant doses did not have evident effects on exposed animals; however, the fecundity of exposed pairs was substantially altered.

The women were randomly allocated to two groups and given either three months' hormone treatment followed by three months' placebo or vice versa. An appreciable amelioration of all symptoms on placebo made it difficult to asses the genuine value of oestrogen treatment during the period of study. Both groups made a dramatic clinical improvement during the first three months. Nevertheless, the symptoms of the 15 women who received oestrogen first returned after the cross-over to placebo without any suggestion of a placebo response. In contrast, the other group who took placebo first did not deteriorate after changing to oestrogen. The menopausal index and the karyopyknotic index were not reliable guides to the need for oestrogen treatment. Hot flushes, however, were proportionately reduced on oestrogen and they seemed to be more readily eliminated in individual cases by oestrogen. The results of blood clotting studies indicated that <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen</b> administration raised the levels of the extrinsic clotting factors VII and X and accelerated the prothrombin time.

40|$|Because of {{the concern}} about {{environmental}} chemicals with oestrogenic and anti-oestrogenic effects, {{there is a need}} to construct biosensors for classifying such chemicals according to their effect on oestrogen receptor conformation. The conformation of the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of oestrogen receptor-alpha and -beta determine their transcription regulation activity. Some ligands, i. e., the <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen</b> oestradiol, induce an active conformation allowing interaction with co-activators. In contrast, antagonists like ICI 182, 780, because of their bulky side chains, do not allow an alpha-helix 12 positioning compatible with co-activator binding. Another type of oestrogen receptor-ligand interactions, termed "passive antagonism", was first defined by X-ray crystal structure analysis of receptors in complex with the side chain-less 5, 11 -cis-diethyl- 5, 6, 11, 12 -tetrahydrochrysene- 2, 8 -diol (THC). We have now used the ability of peptides selected from phage-displayed peptide libraries to bind conformation specifically to oestrogen receptor-alpha and -beta LBDs to analyse conformations induced by THC and a group of chlorinated biphenyls and their aryl-hydroxylated metabolites, suspected of being environmental chemical disruptors. In oestrogen receptor-P, THC defined a "passive antagonist" peptide recognition pattern, which was also induced by several antagonistic hydroxylated biphenyls, while a clearly different peptide recognition pattern was induced by their chlorinated agonistic counterparts. In oestrogen receptor-alpha, THC induced a conformation similar to that induced by oestriol and other oestrogen receptor-alpha agonists, which, as evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis, have a functionally important interaction with oestrogen receptor-a residue His 524.

SETTING [...] Referral based endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS [...] 88 Consecutive menopausal women, 63 complaining of frequent hot flushes and 25 who had not flushed for at least a year. INTERVENTION [...] Treatment with vaginal oestriol 0. 5 mg at night for six weeks in 18 of the women who had hot flushes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Peripheral blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography at rest and in response to stressful mental arithmetic and anoxic forearm exercises. Blood flow in the forearm and its variability were significantly higher in flushing than in non-flushing women (4. 1 (SD 1. 7) and 3. 1 (0. 9) ml/ 100 ml tissue/min and 17 % and 13 % respectively). Blood pressure, heart rate, and blood flow in the hand were, however, similar in the two groups. No difference was found in the peripheral incremental response to either stress or anoxic exercise. Vaginal oestriol significantly lowered forearm blood flow from 4. 4 (1. 5) to 3. 3 (1. 1) ml/ 100 ml tissue/min but dilator responsiveness was unaffected.

By cycle 6, {{the frequencies of}} unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting and absence of withdrawal bleeding were {{the lowest in the}} 15 mg E 4 /DRSP group (33. 8 % and 3. 5 %, respectively). In the E 2 V/DNG reference group, these frequencies were 47. 8 % and 27. 1 %, respectively. By cycle 6, the frequency of women with absence of withdrawal bleeding was < 20 % for all E 4 treatment groups: 3. 5 – 3. 8 % combined with DRSP and 14. 0 – 18. 5 % combined with LNG. By cycle 6, unscheduled intracyclic bleeding was reported by < 20 % of women in the 20 mg E 4 /LNG group (18. 9 %) and in the 15 mg E 4 /DRSP group (16. 9 %). ConclusionThis study showed that, of the four treatment modalities investigated, the 15 mg E 4 /DRSP combination has the most favourable bleeding pattern and cycle control. ImplicationsDue to its favourable bleeding pattern and cycle control, the 15 mg E 4 /DRSP combination is the preferred combination for further phase III clinical development...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Certain {{anthropogenic}} chemicals, {{most notably}} xeno-oestrogens, {{are known to}} have the potential to disrupt vertebrate endocrine systems. For example, induction of the female-specific protein, vitellogenin, in male fish is a well-known effect of exposure to xeno-oestrogens and serves as a biomarker of such ex-posure. There have been few comparable studies of putative biomarkers of endocrine disruption in inver-tebrates. An exception is the upregulation of vitellin-like larval storage protein (LSP) expression in the barnacle cypris larva following exposure to oestrogenic chemicals. The current study aimed to establish whether larvae of the glass prawn, Palaemon elegans, are likewise susceptible to xeno-oestrogen exposure. Using a polyclonal antiserum to P. elegans apolipovitellin, an 86 kDa polypeptide was detected by western blotting in the larval and early postlarval stages of this species. An indirect ELISA applied to the soluble protein fraction of larval homogenates determined that the titre of this putative LSP ranged, depending on larval stage, from 0. 48 – 0. 67 ng mg 21. Exposure of P. elegans larvae to the xeno-oestrogen 4 -n-nonylphenol (4 -NP), at 0. 2 – 20 mg L 21, resulted in a significant, concentration-independent increase in putative LSP levels of 5 – 18 %. Conversely, exposure to the <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen,</b> 17 b-oestradiol (E 2), at 0. 2 and 20 mg L 21, led to a significant concentration-independent decline (up to 11 %) in LSP levels. Whether the effect of 4 -NP results from endocrine disruption is not known, however, an oestrogen receptor-mediated effect is unlikely. Other than a slight increase in larval mortality when exposed to 4 -NP at 2 mg L 21, neither 4 -NP nor E 2 significantly affected development, growth or survival of P. elegans larvae...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAquatic environments are {{especially}} susceptible to anthropogenic chemical pollution. Yet although knowledge on the biological effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms is increasing, far less {{is known about}} how ecologically-important interspecific interactions are affected by chemicals. In particular, the consequences of anthropogenic pollution for the interaction of hosts and parasites are poorly understood. Here, we examine how exposure to 17 β-oestradiol (E 2) —a <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen</b> and a model endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) —affects infection susceptibility and emergent infection phenotypes in an experimental host–parasite system; three spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) infected with the common, debilitating cestode Schistocephalus solidus. We exposed individual sticklebacks to a 0 ngl− 1 (control), 10 ngl− 1 or 100 ngl− 1 E 2 treatment before feeding them infective stages of S. solidus. E 2 exposure significantly elevated vitellogenin (VTG) levels—a biomarker of exposure to xenoestrogens—in both female and male fish, and reduced their body condition. Susceptibility to parasite infection was unaffected by EDC exposure; however, E 2 treatment and fish sex interacted significantly to determine {{the growth rate of}} parasites, which grew quickest in male hosts held under the higher (100 ngl− 1) E 2 treatment. Tissue VTG levels and parasite mass correlated positively across the whole sample of experimentally infected fish, but separate regressions run on the male and female datasets demonstrated a significant relationship only among male fish. Hence, among males—but not females—elevated VTG levels elicited by E 2 exposure led to more rapid parasite growth. We outline plausible physiological mechanisms that could explain these results. Our results demonstrate that oestrogenic pollutants can alter host–parasite interactions by promoting parasite growth, and that male hosts may be disproportionately affected. Because ecologically-relevant effects of infection on host antipredator responses, growth, energetics and reproductive development all depend on parasite mass in this host–parasite system, our results indicate that EDCs can mediate the ecological consequences of infections. We therefore consider the implications of our results for the ecology of hosts and parasites in polluted environments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceProduced water (PW) {{contains}} numerous toxic compounds {{of natural}} origin, such as dispersed oil, metals, alkylphenols (APs), and {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs). In addition, PW also contains many different chemicals which have been added during the oil production process. In the study described here, cod were exposed to real PW collected from an oil production platform in the North Sea. This was done in order to best recreate the most realistic field-exposure regime in which fish {{will be affected by}} a wide range of chemicals. The biological effects found in this study therefore cannot be assigned to one group of chemicals alone, but are the result of exposure to the complex chemical mixture found in real PW. Since APs are well known to cause endocrine disruption in marine organisms, we focused our chemical analysis on APs in an attempt to better understand the long term effects of APs from PW on the biology of fish. In this study, cod were exposed to several concentrations of real PW and 17 β-oestradiol (E), a <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen,</b> at different developmental stages. Cod were exposed to PW either during the embryo and early larvae stage (up to 3 months of age) or during the early juvenile stage (from 3 - 6 months of age). Results showed that, in general, APs bioconcentrate in fish tissue in a dose and developmental stage dependent manner during PW exposure. However, juveniles appeared able to effectively metabolise the short chain APs. Importantly, PW exposure had no effect on embryo survival or hatching success. However, 1 % PW clearly interfered with the development of normal larval pigmentation. After hatching most of the larvae exposed to 1 % PW failed to begin feeding and died of starvation. This inability to feed may be linked to the increased incidence of jaw deformities seen in these larvae. In addition, cod exposed to 1 % PW, had significantly higher levels of the biomarkers vitellogenin and CYP 1 A in plasma and liver, respectively. No similar effects were seen in cod exposed to either 0. 1 % or 0. 01 % PW...|$|R

40|$|The {{three-spined stickleback}} (Gasterosteus aculeatus) {{possesses}} biomarkers for both androgenic (spiggin) and oestrogenic (VTG) exposure which are both easily measured using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISAs). It is therefore uniquely qualified {{as a model}} test-species for investigating the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and could represent a suitable test species {{for inclusion in the}} OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) endocrine disrupting fish-screening protocol. As part of an inter-calibration exercise, this thesis examined the response of both male and female stickleback, following exposure to the <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen,</b> 17 β-oestradiol (E 2) and a synthetic androgen, trenbolone (Tb). The endpoints used were VTG and spiggin induction, gross morphology (including gonad somatic index) and gonadal histology. Individuals were exposed to one of either E 2 at 10, 32 and 100 ng/L, Tb at 50, 500 and 5000 ng/L or to a solvent control over a period of 14 and 21 days under flow-through conditions. VTG immunoassays detected the oestrogenic activity of E 2 in both male and female stickleback (both at 32 ng/L after 14 days of exposure). The spiggin ELISA detected the androgenic activity of Tb in female stickleback following 14 days of exposure to 5000 ng/L. The VTG ELISA also detected the anti-oestrogenic activity of Tb in female stickleback following 21 days of exposure to 50 ng/L. This exercise is the first to develop and validate a method for both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the stickleback gonads. Although no significant adverse effects following E 2 or Tb treatment was observed, the method presents a suitable technique that can be utilised in future EDC-related investigations. The results from this study suggest that the stickleback is as equally sensitive in detecting the oestrogenic activity of E 2 as the current OECD-approved test-species, furthermore the androgenic and anti-oestrogenic activity of Tb. Moreover, due to the presence of both androgenic and oestrogenic biomarkers, only half the numbers of sticklebacks are required for an ED-screening assay and thus the stickleback is a more ethically acceptable test-species. Additionally, the stickleback is the only test species that is endemic and ubiquitous in Europe. Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), Weymout...|$|R

40|$|<b>Natural</b> steroidal <b>oestrogens</b> are hormones {{produced}} by the endocrine systems of humans and livestock that elicit specific effects on endocrine activity at very low concentration. Synthetic oestrogens are structurally similar, man-made pharmaceuticals designed to mimic natural hormones. Both forms of oestrogen are organic, persistent and regularly detected as pollutants of surface waters and sewage sludges due to incomplete removal during water and sewage treatment processes. Numerous studies have shown oestrogens in the environment to be potent endocrine disrupters, unintentionally disturbing the biological development/functioning of many species (eg causing feminisation). As global water demand necessitates reuse of wastewaters and food scarcity encourages use of manures/sewage sludges as fertilisers, oestrogens - given their range of effects at low-dose - {{pose a threat to}} all consumers. Biochar is a form of charcoal created through pyrolysis or gasification of carbon-based biomass, predominantly of plant origin. The resultant carbon-rich product can potentially enrich soils by helping to retain essential nutrients, whilst simultaneously storing carbon. This research seeks to determine whether biochar may act as a suitable, low-tech, low-cost medium to sequester environmental oestrogens from wastewaters and soils.

40|$|Many {{anthropogenic}} chemicals, {{most notably}} xeno-oestrogens, {{are known to}} have the potential to disrupt vertebrate endocrine systems. Induction of the female-specific protein vitellogenin (Vtg) in male fish, for example, is a well-known effect of exposure to xeno-oestrogens and serves as a biomarker of such exposure. There have been few comparable studies of putative biomarkers of endocrine disruption in decapods. The current study aimed to establish if reproduction and development of two decapods, the prawn, Palaemon elegans and the crab, Carcinus maenas, were affected following exposure to known oestrogenic chemicals and whether a biomarker approach, analogous to that for vertebrates, could be adopted. The xeno-oestrogen 4 -n-nonylphenol (4 -NP) was acutely toxic to P. elegans (48 h-LC 5 o, 34. 3 - 96. 1 µg Lˉ¹) and C. maenas larvae (48 h-LC 50, 116 - 507. 3 µg Lˉ¹), with P. elegans among the most sensitive species reported. Other than a small, but significant, increase in the mortality of P. elegans larvae exposed to 4 -NP at 2 µg Lˉ¹, neither 4 -NP nor the <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen,</b> 17 β-oestradiol (E 2) significantly affected growth, development or survival of P. elegans at environmentally realistic concentrations (< 0. 2 - 20 µg Lˉ¹). Similar results were obtained with C. maenas larvae, but they must be viewed with caution as survival, including that of the controls, was poor. Vitellin-like proteins were identified in the adults and larval stages of both P. elegans and C. maenas using polyclonal antisera to lipovitellin and apolipovitellin. Vtg was female-specific in both species and expression was restricted to females undergoing vitellogenesis. No induction of Vtg was observed in males, from either species, following laboratory exposure to E 2, and 4 -NP. Likewise, no Vtg was detected in the haemolymph of male C. maenas which had been collected from sites known to be contaminated with oestrogenic chemicals. The titres of the vitellin-like proteins in P. elegans larvae, determined using an indirect ELISA, were significantly affected, in a concentration-independent manner, following exposure to both E 2 and 4 - NP. Exposure to 4 -NP, at 0. 2 - 20 µg Lˉ¹, resulted in a 5 - 18 % increase in the levels of vitellin-like proteins. Exposure to E 2, at 0. 2 and 20 µg Lˉ¹ however, reduced levels by up to 11 %. Further development of the ELISA is required to assess comparable effects in C. maenas larvae. Overall, while it remains questionable whether these effects result from endocrine disruption, an oestrogen receptor-mediated effect is unlikely. Increased mortality may have been due to toxic effects and no causal link has been established between the parent/exposure compounds and the induced alterations in protein profiles. This study emphasised the necessity for long term multi-faceted studies to determine the real impacts of pollutants at distinct organisational levels.

40|$|A {{plethora of}} naturally-produced steroid hormones, or {{artificial}} homologues of them, are being {{introduced into the}} aquatic and terrestrial environments each year. Two examples of these are the <b>natural</b> <b>oestrogen</b> 17 ï 8 ̆ 1 ¢-oestradiol (E 2) and the oestrogen receptor antagonist, Bisphenol A (BPA), both of which target the ribonucleoprotein telomerase through upregulation of its telomerase reverse transcriptase component, TERT. The main objectives {{of this study were}} firstly to isolate and characterize the actual mRNA sequence for the telomerase catalytic subuninit, Tert, in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (Walbaum, 1792) and European purple sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) (Lamarck, 1816), with the aim of developing qPCR assays for the amplification and quantification of Tert. Further objectives were to use these assays in controlled exposure studies to establish whether and to what extent the aforementioned chemicals regulate Tert transcription and by doing so further understand the mechanism of Telomerase gene expression {{and the extent to which}} environmental oestrogen can interfere. The initial step of sequence characterization and assay devlopment was successful in the case of rainbow trout where two possible splice variants of Tert mRNA are identified, omTertShort and omTertLong. Two qPCR assays were developed for the relative quantification of both of these splice variants in rainbow trout samples, the latter of these successfully amplifying its target in test samples. In order to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo modulation of telomerase activity and mRNA expression, early life-stages of rainbow trout and purple sea urchin, as well as rainbow trout hepatocytes, were exposed to a range of concentrations of E 2 and BPA. Purple sea urchin embryos were exposed to 200, 20 and 2 ng E 2 /ml for 28 hours until they had reached the stage of pluteus larvaes. Rainbow trout embryos were exposed to 500, 20 and 0. 1 ng E 2 /ml and 600 and 150 ng BPA/ml for 167 days from immediately after fertilization. Rainbow trout hepatocytes were exposed to 20 and 2 ng E 2 /ml for 48 hours. The results from this study show that telomerase activity as well as TERT mRNA expression can be significantly modulated by exposure to oestrogens and other oestrogenic chemicals. E 2 concentrations as low as 20 ng/ml lead to an increase in telomerase activity early-life stages of purple sea urchin and upregulation in the transcription of Tert mRNA in unhatched rainbow trout embryos. BPA induced similar response (600 ng/ml) in hatched rainbow trout alevins larvae. Very high exposures to E 2 (500 ng/ml) do however lead to downregulation of Tert mRNA in hatched alevins larvae. Differential regulatory response can be observed between different tissue types of 167 day old fry, with an upregulatory response observed at 0. 1 ng E 2 /ml in liver and muscle tissues, but not in brain. Similarly, brain tissues were observed expressing significantly less mRNA than liver and muscle samples when exposed to BPA (150 ng/ml). It is evident that the previously observed link between environmental oestrogens and telomerase is also present in the two test species examined; purple sea urchin and rainbow trout.

In general, cognitive control is suggested to be modulated by <b>natural</b> fluctuations in <b>oestrogen.</b> However, whether oestrogen exerts beneficial effects on meta-memory has not yet been investigated. The present study sought to provide evidence that high levels of schizotypy are associated with increased false memory rates and overconfidence in false memories, and that these processes may be modulated by natural differences in estradiol levels. Using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm, it was found that highly schizotypal participants with high estradiol produced significantly fewer false memories than those with low estradiol. No such difference was found within the low schizotypy participants. Highly schizotypal participants with high estradiol were also less confident in their false memories than those with low estradiol; low schizotypy participants with high estradiol were more confident. However, these differences only approached significance. These findings suggest that the beneficial effect of estradiol on memory and meta-memory observed in healthy participants is specific to highly schizotypal individuals and might be related to individual differences in baseline dopaminergic activity...|$|R
