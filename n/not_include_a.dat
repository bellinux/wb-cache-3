Lieberman's demand that the bill <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> public option was met, although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.|$|E

5|$|Early federal {{plans for}} a {{nationwide}} system of interregional highways did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> route along or near the present turnpike, instead connecting Oklahoma City and Kansas City via southeastern Kansas and U.S. Route 69. By the mid-1940s, this route had shifted to roughly the present Interstate 35 alignment, serving Wichita. The only major difference from the present route was between Wichita and Emporia, where the highway ran north to Newton before turning northeast along U.S. Route 50.|$|E

5|$|After {{sufficiently}} {{upgrading the}} ship and exploring the map, the player is allowed to buy the three powerful artifacts, which then spawn at random ports. Defeating the Ancient Guardian in a card minigame awards the player additional loot and previously unavailable upgrades. Ancient Trader does <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> saving feature, which means that all progress is lost if the game is closed. An online multiplayer mode allows for several players to simultaneously play the same map, chase the artifacts, and defeat the Guardian. The prices of the artifacts increase as other players buy them. The players can check the wealth and artifacts gained by other players. The game also includes several alternative game modes, which focus on reaching a set total wealth or cash tally before other players. The multiplayer does not include an online scoreboard.|$|E
5|$|Baseball, {{widely known}} as America's pastime, is well {{established}} in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked {{with that of the}} sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals.|$|E

5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E

5|$|In 1862, Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, {{published}} an early form of periodic table, {{which he called}} the telluric helix or screw. He {{was the first person}} to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E

In {{contrast to his}} touring for The Way I See It, Saadiq did <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> horn section for certain shows and played on guitar for a more rock-oriented sound. While travelling between concert dates, Saadiq and his bandmates watched music documentaries for inspiration, including a documentary on Bob Marley & The Wailers and the 1973 film Wattstax. He expanded his touring in promotion of the album into August 2011, with concerts alternating between North American headlining dates and European music festivals.|$|E
5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E
