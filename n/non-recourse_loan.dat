40|$|We {{investigate}} the market prices of assets in fixed supply whose purchase is typically financed through <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loans.</b> The {{largest and most}} common asset in this category is real estate. We demonstrate that within these markets, lenders’ underpricing of the put option contained in <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loans</b> leads to inflated asset prices within efficient markets, and that lenders with short-term horizons have incentives to underprice the put option. This persistent underpricing of the put option {{is one of the}} reasons for the cycles experienced in real estate markets. These results hold when participants in both equity and debt markets are rational. The model also allows for management compensation that is aligned with maximizing bank shareholders’ value. Using real estate transaction data we find empirical evidence consistent with the predictions of the model. ...|$|R

5000|$|Economist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman {{has been}} very {{critical}} of this program arguing the <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loans</b> lead to a hidden subsidy that will be split by asset managers, banks' shareholders and creditors. Mr. Krugman argues that this will lead to wild overbidding for assets. Yet, research into {{the structure of the}} program shows that the overbidding incentives in <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loans</b> are subtle. If there are overbidding incentives, they depend on the amount of leverage, the interest rates and guarantee fees charged by the Federal Reserve or the FDIC, respectively, and the volatility of the toxic assets. [...] Banking analyst Meridith Whitney argues that banks will not sell bad assets at fair market values because they are reluctant to take asset write downs. [...] Removing toxic assets would also reduce the volatility of banks' stock prices. Because stock is a call option on a firm's assets, this lost volatility will hurt the stock price of distressed banks. Therefore, such banks will only sell toxic assets at above market prices. The program has been hampered by the announcement by Standard & Poor's that many eligible assets would be downgraded by the rating agency, making them ineligible for the program. Federal Reserve of New York president William Dudley stated on June 4 that [...] "there's a huge administrative hurdle" [...] to implementing the program.|$|R

50|$|An IRA can {{purchase}} {{any type of}} real estate {{as long as the}} provider (aka custodian) of that IRA handles real estate. IRA providers that handle real estate are often called self-directed IRA providers. If the IRA does not have enough cash to pay the full purchase price, then the IRA can partner with a person, company/entity or another IRA, or it can secure a <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loan</b> to buy real estate. Whether the IRA is whole or part owner, IRA funds are used for purchase, maintenance, and expenses. When the property generates cash either with rental income or from sale, those funds go directly back to the IRA. The IRS prohibits certain actions. For example, neither the IRA holder nor any disqualified persons to that plan may live in or vacation in the property. The IRA holder makes the decisions about how the asset is maintained but cannot do the work themselves.|$|E

50|$|Project finance is the {{long-term}} financing of infrastructure and industrial projects {{based upon the}} projected cash flows of the project rather than the balance sheets of its sponsors. Usually, a project financing structure involves a number of equity investors, known as 'sponsors', a 'syndicate' of banks or other lending institutions that provide loans to the operation. They are most commonly <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loans,</b> which are secured by the project assets and paid entirely from project cash flow, {{rather than from the}} general assets or creditworthiness of the project sponsors, a decision in part supported by financial modeling. The financing is typically secured by all of the project assets, including the revenue-producing contracts. Project lenders are given a lien on all of these assets and are able to assume control of a project if the project company has difficulties complying with the loan terms.|$|R

Shortly thereafter the Federal Reserve Bank of New York {{had a change of heart}} and told Bear Stearns that the 28-day loan was unavailable to them. The deal was then changed to where the NY FED would create a company to buy $30 billion worth of Bear Stearns assets. Two days later, on March 16, 2008, Bear Stearns signed a merger agreement with JP Morgan Chase in a stock swap worth $2 a share or less than 7 percent of Bear Stearns' market value just two days before. [...] This sale price represented a staggering loss as its stock had traded at $172 a share as late as January 2007, and $93 a share as late as February 2008.

The funds will come in many instances in equal parts from the U.S. Treasury's TARP monies, private investors, and from loans from the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). The initial size of the Public Private Investment Partnership is projected to be $500 billion. Economist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman has been very critical of this program arguing the non-recourse loans lead to a hidden subsidy that will be split by asset managers, banks' shareholders and creditors. Banking analyst Meredith Whitney argues that banks will not sell bad assets at fair market values because they are reluctant to take asset write downs.

40|$|The recent global {{financial}} crisis, sparked by {{developments in the}} American mortgage market, provides a timely opportunity for a thorough analysis of the standard model for financing home purchases. The United States residential mortgage market has two prominent aspects: first, {{a significant part of}} mortgages are de facto <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loans</b> that allow the borrower to limit his liability solely to the collateral securing the loan; second, residential mortgages confer the aforementioned advantage on borrowers while requiring merely a minimal down payment, or no down payment at all. This article examines the implications of each of these aspects, as well as the interplay between them. The findings of this examination lead to the novel insight that a non-recourse mortgage with no initial down payment resembles the case of corporate undercapitalization. Utilizing legal analysis and remedies applied in the case of corporate undercapitalization lends insight into creating mortgage arrangements that properly balance the competing interests of the various players in the home ownership credit market...|$|R

40|$|Domestic {{subsidies}} for cotton and other commodities {{have been a}} major topic of interest, especially during the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization trade negotiations. Many developing countries have insisted that domestic subsidies in countries like the United States represent significant trade barriers because they lower world price below their cost of production. India, Brazil, and other developing countries intimate that unless these domestic subsidies are lowered, they are unwilling to provide any more market access concessions in trade negotiations. However, these countries utilize domestic subsidy programs as well (see Hudson et al., 2009 for a complete description of foreign subsidies). India, for example, uses a minimum support price (MSP) program, which is similar to the U. S. Commodity Credit Corporation <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loan</b> program. The Government of India (GOI) annually sets the MSP for each growth region, which represents the price at which the government will purchase seed cotton from farmers.

By looking at contemporaneous extended Loan-to-Value (ELTV) and extended Debt-to-Income (EDTI) ratios under the recourse loan system, we examine whether housing equity constraints and negative income shocks deter owner-to-owner residential mobility and whether government policy aimed at addressing equity constraints under the recourse loan system {{has an impact on}} residential moves. The specific policy we examine is the implementation of the income tax deduction system that permits the carrying over of capital losses for owner-occupied households. These tax policies were devised to cope with the severe equity constraints that followed the bursting of Japan's asset Bubble in the early 1990 s. Simulation analysis of relaxing tax deduction conditions shows that changing the required years the household must live in the residence to qualify for the tax break before selling from 5 years to 1 year greatly enhances the mobility for both positive and negative equity households. Finally, simulation analysis of switching from the present recourse loan system to the <b>non-recourse</b> <b>loan</b> system shows an increase in the owners' mobility to another owner-occupied housing, especially for positive equity households...|$|E
