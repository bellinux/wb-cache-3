5|$|Russula emetica {{is one of}} over 100 red-capped Russula species known worldwide. The related {{beechwood}} sickener (R.nobilis) {{is found}} under beech in Europe. Many, such as the bloody brittlegill (R.sanguinaria), are inedible; this species can be distinguished from R.emetica by the reddish flush in its stem. R.aurea, however, is edible. It has a yellow stem, gills and flesh under its red cap. The edible R.rugulosa—common in mixed woods in the eastern and northern United States—has a wrinkled and pimpled cap cuticle, cream spores, and mild taste. Another inedible species, R.fragilis, has notched gills, and its stem stains blue with <b>naphthol.</b> The uncommon European subspecies R.emetica longipes is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills. The paler European mushroom R.betularum, found in coniferous forests and moorland, is sometimes considered a subspecies of R.emetica. R.nana is restricted in distribution to arctic and subarctic highland meadows where dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) or alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) are abundant.|$|E

Beginning in 1999, studies made by Greenpeace and others from soil, groundwater, well water and vegetables from the residential areas around UCIL and from the UCIL factory area show contamination with a range of toxic heavy metals and chemical compounds. Substances found, according to the reports, are <b>naphthol,</b> naphthalene, Sevin, tarry residues, alpha <b>naphthol,</b> mercury, organochlorines, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, hexachlorethane, hexachlorobutadiene, pesticide HCH (BHC), volatile organic compounds and halo-organics.
