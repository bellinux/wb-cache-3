40|$|SummaryEosinophilic <b>nasosinusal</b> <b>polyposis</b> is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} infection with elevated infiltration of eosinophils, which presents {{high rate of}} recurrence after surgical treatment. The continuous inflammatory process {{that leads to the}} formation of polyps requires constant clinical treatment. Contributing to the maintenance of eosinophilia are cytokines IL 5 (interleukin- 5) and GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophages colony-stimulating factor), which show up in elevated concentrations. These oligoproteins diminish the rate of apoptosis and prolong the survival of eosinophils. AimBy diminishing these cytokines, the action of Mitomycin C (MMC), an antineoplasic drug which inhibits the synthesis of DNA, was studied. In a recent study the power of this drug to cause apoptosis in eosinophils, in vitro, of nasal polyps was verified. MethodologyA biopsy of the nasal polyps was undertaken in 15 patients carriers of eosinophilic <b>nasosinusal</b> <b>polyposis</b> 24 hours after applying 0. 5 mg/ml of MMC during five minutes. RT-PCR (reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction) for IL 5 and GM-CSF was the method used to obtain the results.

40|$|A polipose nasossinusal eosinofílica (PNS) é manifestação de uma doença inflamatória crônica na mucosa do nariz e nos seios paranasais caracterizada por infiltração de granulócitos eosinófilos. O fator responsável pela eosinofilia e manutenção dessas células com a perpetuação do processo inflamatório e formação polipóide é objeto constante de estudos. As citocinas como IL 5 (interleucina 5) e GM-CSF (fator estimulador de colônia granulócito macrófago) aumentam a sobrevida dos eosinófilos e prolongam a sua presença no tecido polipóide, diminuindo o índice de apoptose eosinofílica. OBJETIVO: Avaliar o efeito da mitomicina C - MMC - por meio de aplicação tópica em pacientes portadores de PNS eosinofílica quanto à presença de IL 5 e GM-CSF. CASUÍSTICA E MÉTODOS: Quinze pacientes portadores de PNS eosinofílica foram submetidos à aplicação tópica de MMC na concentração de 0, 5 mg/ml, 1 ml, durante cinco minutos, na cavidade nasal direita, e submetidos à biópsia para RT-PCR 24 hs após. O grupo-controle foi a cavidade nasal esquerda. O perfil de citocinas foi analisado para IL 5 e GM-CSF. RESULTADOS: A comparação dos resultados de GM-CSF pré e pós-uso de MMC quando usamos o teste t pareado apresenta p= 0, 041.

40|$|Maxipolyposis, i. e. severe, diffuse <b>nasosinusal</b> <b>polyposis,</b> is {{generally}} treated with an onerous surgery. Therefore, recurrence, roughly rangling from 15 % to 25 %, {{are quite a}} disagreable outcome {{which is to be}} minimized. To this purpose, it may be useful to differentiate the residual from the recurrent polyposis, as is usually done in cases of cholesteatoma. Residual polyposis can be reduced by a thorough surgical resection. The authors detail their present technique, which joins microsurgery, used to perform ethmoidectomy, with endoscopic surgery, employed to manoeuvre within the sphenoid and maxillary sinus, as well as to drain the frontal sinus, i. e. to treat areas out of the direct view. Moreover, patients are warned of the need for close postoperative controls which should always be performed through telescopes in order to secure a sound inspection of the surgical cavities. Any slight, incipient recurrence should be immediately resected in the office by means of endoscopic technique. Recurrent polyposis must be treated with the drug therapies now in use, a waiting complete elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism. Association with systemic diseases, such as asthma, may contraindicate major surgery, as it increases the recurrence expectancy. Simple polypectomy often attains the same result in these cases, that is temporary ventilation of the nasal fossae...|$|E

At time zero, 12 and 24 hours, the surface material was taken to determination of its GM-CSF levels in 22 patients and of IL- 5 levels in 19 patients, by ELISA method. Results: Reduction in GM-CSF expression on the experimental group at time 24 h (p<= 0. 05). The treated group presented significant GM-CSF expression between zero time and 12 h time (p= 0. 013) showing the culture viability such as in the non-treated group.
