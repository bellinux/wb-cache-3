In an interview with the Actors Studio, the actor Martin Sheen recounted that he contracted polio as a child and it was only due to his doctor using Sister Kenny's method that he regained use of his legs.|$|E
25|$|The San Patricio {{men were}} deserters in action, and had traitorously joined the enemy army. There was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> this, and the {{punishment}} for desertion and treason was death. Scott's army was still facing a dangerous enemy and possible insurgency, so {{he placed the}} prisoners before courts martial to have them settle it. Eisenhower says the men were tried in two groups. The trials were conducted fairly by Brevet Colonel John Garland and by Colonel Bennet Riley. Because all the men captured were wearing Mexican uniforms, they were found guilty and sentenced to hang.|$|E

He said of his experience with Jackson, [...] "He actually does radiate an aura when he comes into the studio, there's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it.

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1958, Bánáthy {{recruited}} two patrols of boys to take part. [...] Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader. At the beginning {{there was not much}} discussion of leadership competencies. Chiorini said, [...] "White Stag was all about creating an environment in which youth led youth. At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember it was very clear in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. There was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were." [...] Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program. Some of them remained active with it into the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War almost stranded Fauré in Germany, where he had gone for his annual composing retreat. He managed to get from Germany into Switzerland, and thence to Paris. He remained in France {{for the duration of}} the war. When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with Saint-Saëns. Fauré did not recognise nationalism in music, seeing in his art [...] "a language belonging to a country so far above all others that it is dragged down when it has to express feelings or individual traits that belong to any particular nation." [...] Nonetheless, he was aware that his own music was respected rather than loved in Germany. In January 1905, visiting Frankfurt and Cologne for concerts of his music, he had written, [...] "The criticisms of my music have been that it's a bit cold and too well brought up! There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it, French and German are two different things." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{a member}} of the organization, Christman rose to the Operating Thetan level of OT VII, [...] "the near-pinnacle of enlightenment", and second-highest level within the movement. She worked for a time in one of the organization's Celebrity Centres, and became acquainted with celebrity members {{including}} John Travolta and Kelly Preston. She became an ordained minister within Scientology, and in this role trained new recruits to the organization, including Travolta. She trained Travolta on the [...] "Hubbard Qualified Scientologist", the second Scientology class after the initial communication course. Christman spent time working at Narconon International, a group affiliated with Scientology and promoted as a drug rehabilitation program using methods created by L. Ron Hubbard. She later came to realize that Narconon was a recruitment arm for Scientology, [...] "Narconon's orders come from the Church of Scientology's senior management. Their programs, policies -- it's all church policy. There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> this to anyone involved. ... At Narconon (they're) handling drugs in society. But in truth, it's to 'safe point the environment' [...] a goodwill gesture so they can recruit people." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{these was}} Bette Davis, {{one of the}} studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: [...] "No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. [...] The power. The glory. And he was in {{business}} to make money." [...] Davis revealed that, {{after the birth of}} her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. [...] "We became father and child, <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] she said. [...] "He told me I didn't have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him." [...] Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Gold and Silver {{continued}} the enormous success of its predecessors, beginning {{the formation of}} Pokémon into a multi-billion dollar franchise. As of April 2000 roughly 6.5 million copies of the games had been sold in Japan. Silver {{proved to be the}} slightly more popular version, edging out Gold by approximately 100,000 copies. By the first week of their release in the U.S.A. the games had eclipsed Pokémon Yellow's previous record sales of a little over 600,000 copies; selling a combined total of 1.4 million copies to become the fastest selling games ever. The commercial success was expected, as Peter Main, the executive {{vice president of sales and}} marketing, stated [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it; kids love to play Pokemon. So far in 2000 the best-selling game in America for any home console is Pokemon Stadium for [...] Nintendo 64, and the best-selling game for any handheld video game system is Pokemon [...] Yellow for Game Boy Color, but Pokemon [...] Gold and Silver will eclipse even those impressive sales totals. We project sales of 10 million units total of these two games in less than six months time". By 2010, the recorded sales of Gold and Silver were at 23 million units sold.|$|E

500|$|Ponsford {{travelled}} to England for {{a second}} time, with the 1930 Australian team. In a wet summer, Australia won the series two Tests to one, recovering The Ashes. For {{the second time in}} as many trips to England, Ponsford fell ill—gastritis caused him to miss the third Test at Headingley Stadium. Despite this setback, Ponsford scored 330runs in the Tests at an average of 55.00. Wisden wrote, [...] "Ponsford had a much better season—especially in the Test matches—than four years previously.... In helping his captain to wear down England's bowling he accomplished great work and, even if he was seldom really attractive to watch, there could be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> his skill and how difficult he was to get out." [...] The outstanding performer of the tour was the young Don Bradman, who scored 974runs in the Test matches—this remains a world record for the most runs scored in a Test series. Ponsford played a part in Bradman's success; Wisden stated that [...] "it is only fair to say that {{on more than one occasion}} [...] task was rendered the easier by the skilful manner in which Woodfull and Ponsford, by batting of different description, had taken the sting out of the England bowling." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Nel {{places the}} book's title {{character}} {{in the tradition of}} con artists in American art, including the title characters from Meredith Willson's The Music Man and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in The Saturday Evening Post on July 6, 1957. Michael K. Frith, who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that [...] "The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it. This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him." [...] Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it [...] "fun that is funny", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to. In an article titled [...] "Was the Cat in the Hat Black?", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including minstrel shows, Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, {{and the use of the}} term [...] "cat" [...] to refer to jazz musicians. According to Nel, [...] "Even as [...] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject." ...|$|E
500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E
