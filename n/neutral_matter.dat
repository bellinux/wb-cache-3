50|$|After {{his return}} to Germany, Rothfels was a pioneer of {{contemporary}} history, {{the study of the}} “epoch of those who lived at the time” to use Rothfels’s words. In Rothfels’s view, contemporary history was the study of the recent past, where despite or rather because the lack of documentation caused by studying events so close to the past and the challenge of writing about events that one experienced oneself, required special patience, skill and ability of the part of the historian. In particular, Rothfels called for historians working in the field of contemporary history to approach matters in an objective and <b>neutral</b> <b>matter</b> while keeping in mind the moral questions. In practice, contemporary history came to refer history from 1914 on.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{universe}} {{consisted of a}} hot, dense plasma of electrons and baryons (protons and neutrons). Photons (light particles) traveling in this universe were essentially trapped, unable to travel for any considerable distance before interacting with the plasma via Thomson scattering. [...] As the universe expanded, the plasma cooled to below 3000 K—a low enough energy such that the electrons and protons in the plasma could combine to form neutral hydrogen atoms. This recombination happened {{when the universe was}} around 379,000 years old, or at a redshift of z = 1089. [...] Photons interact to a much lesser degree with <b>neutral</b> <b>matter,</b> and therefore at recombination the universe became transparent to photons, allowing them to decouple from the matter and free-stream through the universe. Technically speaking, the mean free path of the photons became on the order {{of the size of the}} universe. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is light that was emitted after recombination that is only now reaching our telescopes. Therefore, when we look at Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, we are looking back in time to see an image of the universe when it was only 379,000 years old.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: According to the {{viewpoints}} of “one divides into two”, “one divides into three” (e. g. Neutrosophy) and “one divides into many”, {{at present}} there exist six kinds of {{matter in the}} universe altogether (one divides into six). If there exists the ordinary matter (called matter for short), there must exist its opposite. However there may exist more than one kind of its opposite, today the known opposites of matter may be the antimatter and dark matter; Other three kinds of matter are the neutral ones: the first <b>neutral</b> <b>matter</b> between matter and antimatter (Prof. Smarandache named it unmatter), the second <b>neutral</b> <b>matter</b> between matter and dark matter, and the third <b>neutral</b> <b>matter</b> between antimatter and dark matter. Similarly, if there exists the original “law of universal gravitation” (positive law of universal gravitation), there must exist its opposites (negative laws of universal gravitation), and the neutral ones (neutral laws of universal gravitation). According to this analysis, {{it is impossible to}} find the unified and ultimate gravitational theory. Key words: One divides into two; one divides into three; one divides into many; Neutrosophy; six kinds of matter; positive (original) law of universal gravitation; negative law of universal gravitation; neutral law of universal gravitation...|$|E

40|$|We derive the {{equation}} of state (EOS) for electrically charge <b>neutral</b> dense <b>matter</b> using Quantum Hadrodynamics (QHD) model. This is carried out in a nonperturbative manner including quantum corrections for baryons through a realignment of vacuum with baryon-antibaryon condensates. This yields the results of relativistic Hartree approximation of summing over baryonic tadpole diagrams. The quantum corrections from the scalar meson is also {{taken into account in}} a similar way. This leads to a softening of {{the equation}} of state for the hyperonic matter. The formalism also allows us to do a self consistent calculation of the in-medium sigma meson mass.

40|$|Whether or not deconfined quark phase {{exists in}} neutron star cores and {{represents}} the ground state of <b>neutral</b> <b>matter</b> at moderate densities are open questions. We use two realistic effective quark models, the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio {{model and the}} modified quark-meson coupling model, to describe the neutron star matter. After constructing possible hybrid equations of state (EOSes) with unpaired or color superconducting quark phase, we systematically discuss the observational constraints of neutron stars on the EOSes. It is found that the neutron star with pure quark matter core is unstable and the hadronic phase with hyperons is denied, while hybrid EOSes with two-flavor color superconducting phase or unpaired quark matter phase are both allowed by the tight and most reliable constraints from two stars Ter 5 I and EXO 0748 - 676. And the hybrid EOS with unpaired quark matter phase is allowed even compared with the tightest constraint from the most massive pulsar star PSR J 0751 + 1807. Therefore, we conclude that the ground state of <b>neutral</b> <b>matter</b> at moderate densities is in deconfined quark phase likely. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
