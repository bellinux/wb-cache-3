A few {{commentators}} picked the Bulldogs as a possible [...] "sleeper team" [...] to make the Final Four.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club Rangers for £1.2 million. Rangers had just won their third {{successive}} Scottish Premier Division title. Under newly appointed manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league. McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille. Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: [...] "It was an incredible season. We won the domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten {{and we did not}} lose a single game in Europe. And, though we said we would do it again <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> <b>we</b> all knew it was unrepeatable." [...] In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United, surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points {{on the final day of}} the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hearts as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 September, German High Command {{considered}} how {{to destroy}} Leningrad. Occupying {{the city was}} ruled out [...] "because it would make us responsible for food supply".

[...] "Early <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>we</b> enter the city (if the Finns do it first we do not object), lead those still alive into inner Russia or into captivity, wipe Leningrad {{from the face of}} the earth through demolitions, and hand the area north of the Neva to the Finns."
