40|$|Taking {{its lead}} from the debates on the {{relationship}} between the global and the local in~? process of globalisation, this project attempts to examine how the two entities are deconstructed as non-contradictory and reconstructed as part of a continuum in Joyce's Ulysses. Rather than directly approaching the two concepts in terms oftheir roles in economy, politics and culture, the thesis focuses on Joyce's de-/ re- construction ofthem from different angles in his writing. His collapsing of the two entities will be investigated from three perspectives: the narrative voices in 'Cyclops' and 'Ithaca,' the economy of advertising, and the role ofthe Catholic Church and Catholicism in Joyce's Dublin. The Introduction briefly revieyvs debates on globalisation and explains how they initiate possibilities ofreading Joyce in terms of the global and the local. Chapter Two deals with Joyce's questioning of the validity of an absolute local voice in 'Cyclops' and of an absolute global voice in 'Ithaca,' and suggests that he sees them in a complementary and continuous relation instead. The third chapter looks at the practice of the two voices in the economy of advertising, and explicates how the local voice ofIrish consumers and the global voice ofthe capitalist economy are involved in a process of <b>negotiation.</b> <b>Chapter</b> Four investigates the both global and local entity, the Catholic Church in Ireland, and suggests that for Irish nationalists and Joyce the Church gives a political counterweight to the British Empire, and Catholicism provides Joyce with an intellectual counterweight to his English writing ofIreland. The Postscript's self-reflection about this project enables a concluding retrospection ofthe previous chapters. It studies how the local voice ofTaiwanese readers converges on and diverges from the global voice ofthe Joyce industry. Moreover, the translation and reading ofJoyce in Taiwan evince something that could possibly be called the universal that Joyce's writing aims at.

40|$|Romania’s {{negotiations}} {{to become a}} European Union member were officially inaugurated on February 15, 2000. Agriculture is the largest <b>negotiation</b> <b>chapter.</b> The enlargement had and will certainly have positive effects upon the Romanian agriculture: stimulation of trade exchanges {{as a consequence of}} the dropping up of the customs duties, the increase of the agricultural products and,consequently, of the farmers’ income, the access to a much bigger market, of 450 million inhabitants. In order for the Romanian agricultural and food sector to become a competitive one, priority measures and steps are necessary both in the vegetal sector and in the animal-breeding and meat and diary products processing sectors. Once the enlargement achieved, Romanian agriculture is taking the advantage of different types of assistance within the framework of the CommonAgricultural Policy, but in order to absorb these funds it is important to know the governing principles. The basic principle of the community policy is to stimulate the farmers to adjust to the market signals, to produce what it is required to be produced on the market. Thus, the farmer will be determined to adjust the target with every quantity required, depending upon cost and qualitycompetitiveness. This concept is called “decoupling”, meaning the decoupling of the production subsidies and their connection to the surface. Romania’s tradition in animal-breeding for milk production may be an advantage for the implementation of chances to become an active participant to the intra-community trade. But tradition is not enough for Romania to be able to take advantage of the export opportunities. For this, we will have to improve the raw material milk quality and also of the products resulting from the processing, in order to allow the adjustment to the EU standards. Achieving the quality and cleaning parameters shall be performed by steps, until the end of the year 2009, mainly by adjusting the race structure and the coordination of this sector to the milk production farms and theRevista de Administraţie Publică şi Politici Sociale stimulation of the processing animals per exploitation. Every month, the farmers’meetings are to be held in order to follow the adjustment of the production and processing units to EU standards. Currently, since the enlargement date, producers must follow the community criteria concerning the milk share per each exploitation, milk ton and per year. It is extremely important to know that the subsidy is only allowed if quantity levels are followed, the individual share being set up depending on the country and the number of the producers...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} ‘Lawful Limits. Border Management and the Formation of the Habsburg-Dutch Boundary, ca. 1590 - 1665 ’ {{examines the}} creation of the territorial separation between the early modern Netherlands. Focussing on the Eighty Years War and the first {{years after the end of}} this conflict, the research examines the manifold actors who contributed to the emergence of the Habsburg Dutch-Border. Numerous people and institutions, including Kings, Councils, Estates, towns, Merchants, officers, soldiers and farmers were indeed involved in this process. By developing different strategies of border management they helped shape the eventual structures that became part of the new border, more particularly through repeating moments of interactive deliberation. Effectively, and in contrast to older historiography which focussed on the importance of war and geographic conditions for boundary formation, this research reveals that the construction of the Habsburg-Dutch border first and foremost related to human actions, reactions and counteractions. Following an introductory chapter on the role of territoriality in the geopolitics of the Eighty Years War, the first part of the dissertation discusses the Habsburg-Dutch frontier and investigates the strategies by which governments, the military and the local populations interacted in times of violent conflict. Key to this was an expanding and increasingly structured dialogue, kick-starting a self-reinforcing process that allowed for the physical and legal ‘materialization’ of the border. Chapter two delves into the connections between the military and the legal transformation of the borderlands, focussing on the development of numerous fortifications and the ‘juridical’ alternative of collecting/paying contributions. Chapter three discusses the regulation of movement in the frontier area, revealing more about the types of interactions that happened at the frontier and how these contributed to the process of border formation. Chapter four then looks at the functionality of sauvegardes and neutralities, assessing the specific interests with which people engaged each other in the borderlands of the Eighty Years War. Importantly, the periods before and after the Twelve Years Truce are discussed jointly, as similar evolutions can be observed during both periods. After analysing the combative phases of the Eighty Years War, part two focusses on the transition from war to peace through <b>negotiation.</b> <b>Chapter</b> five discusses how the border appeared during moments of failed pacification, including the 1598 Act of Cession and the 1632 Estates-General held in Brussels. Returning to some of the themes of chapter one, the question is asked if territory remained on the margins of the negotiations or if it impeded the reaching of peace. Next, chapter six brings the arrangements of successful moments of peace-making to the fore. It does so by studying which of the war-time strategies of border management were included in the Treaty of Antwerp (1609) and the Peace of Munster (1648), stressing that diplomats needed to take account of the new border framework when pacifying the Low Countries. Paying attention to these two Treaties is important because they set the playing field for numerous post-war discussions about the border. Instead of dealing with 1609 and 1648 as clear endpoints, these dates are treated here as starting points for a third round of border management interactions. Because the two Treaties still needed to be implemented, the developments that occurred during the actual Twelve Years Truce and after the Peace of Munster mattered greatly for the eventual structure of the border. Many (legal) disputes regarding the border emerged between 1609 - 1621 and 1648 - 1665. In order to demonstrate how earlier strategies of border management influenced the post-war handling of the border, the broader themes of part one are roughly repeated. Chapter seven reveals the different strategies by which the two treaties were practically implemented, stressing that peacetime border management involved both diplomacy and legal debate. Chapter eight subsequently discusses how these two options were deployed in service of the geostrategic interests of the Habsburg Monarchy and the Estates-General, i. e. how the limieten were actually delimitated during numerous ‘public’ conflicts. Finally, chapter nine studies the interaction between local actors and government officials in ‘private’ issues, stressing how the new border structures impacted on the life of the people living in (and beyond) the borderlands. nrpages: 268 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|About the book: Over {{the past}} thirty years nongovernmental {{organizations}} (NGOs) have played an increasingly influential role in international negotiations, particularly on environmental issues. NGO diplomacy has become, {{in the words of one}} organizer, "an international experiment in democratizing intergovernmental decision making. " But there has been little attempt to determine the conditions under which NGOs make a difference in either the process or the outcome of international negotiations. This book presents an analytic framework for the systematic and comparative study of NGO diplomacy in international environmental <b>negotiations.</b> <b>Chapters</b> by experts on international environmental policy apply this framework to assess the effect of NGO diplomacy on specific negotiations on environmental and sustainability issues. The proposed analytical framework offers researchers the tools with which to assess whether and how NGO diplomats affect negotiation processes, outcomes, or both, and through comparative analysis the book identifies factors that explain variation in NGO influence, including coordination of strategy, degree of access, institutional overlap, and alliances with key states. The empirical chapters use the framework to evaluate the degree of NGO influence on such negotiations as the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol negotiations on global climate change, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. ...|$|R

The significance of this study lies in its emphasis upon relations between South Korea and the United States during the 1953 - 1960 period {{from the perspective of the}} patron-client state relationship. This study analyses the issues and historical events in order to trace the development of each nation's strategy, leverages, and tactics towards the other. Each chapter is related to the U. S. security commitment policy to South Korea, and South Korea's response in the frame work of the big power and small state relationship. The Introduction explains the purpose and importance of the research and the analytical framework. Chapter 1 analyses U. S. -South Korean diplomatic seesawing and Korean President Rhee's bargaining position during the Korean armistice <b>negotiations.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 2 traces the post-armistice period and the Korean Political Conference at Geneva during 1953 - 1954. As the Korean Armistice Agreement was a temporary measure to secure a complete cessation of hostilities, the Geneva Conference of 1954, intended to establish a political settlement, was a significant issue in the post-armistice period. Chapter 3 analyses U. S. security and military policy following the Korean War. The question of the proposed reduction of ROK forces and the redeployment of U. S. forces in Korea in connection with the 'New Look' policy were troublesome issues between Seoul and Washington, over which the two governments exerted their bargaining power. Chapter 4 deals with Rhee's conflicts with the U. S. concerning the normalisation of South Korea-Japan relations, U. S. economic policy towards Korea and its negative effects on Rhee's Government, and Rhee's undemocratic rule and dispute with the U. S. concerning Korean political affairs. Chapter 5, the conclusion of this study, summarises the research findings. As power and administration in South Korea were highly centralised under Rhee, it is important to ask to what extent did he, as the leader of the weaker state, manage and manipulate a bargaining position in Korea's relations with the United States...|$|R

Polish policy positions revolved mainly around the issue of creating more level playing field between the MS and this was realized to a very limited extent. In general the above analysis confirm that in the EU, the interests of one MS can be satisfied to very small extent and the final shape of the policy is dependent on the inter-institutional-, not intergovernmental negotiations. On the other hand, due to current role of the EP, representatives of the MS interests have another platform, next to the Council...|$|R
