500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Bosman ruling in 1995 had negative consequences for Ajax in the 1996–97 season. The club lost several players, and reinvested poorly according to Winner. Injuries also affected their challenge for honours; many players were exhausted {{as a result of}} UEFA Euro 1996 and the short summer break that came with it. Chairman Michael van Praag was determined to keep the club's players and revealed Overmars had signed a four-year contract in 1996. He added, [...] "We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> them to break their contracts so they are not leaving." [...] On the pitch, Overmars made his return from injury against AZ on 28 August 1996. He had his least productive season for Ajax, scoring two goals. The club finished the season in fourth position.|$|E
500|$|As the 1937 season began, Feller {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} the April 19, 1937 issue of Time magazine. In his first appearance of the season on April 24, Feller suffered an injury to his elbow while throwing a curveball. He spent April and May healing the arm, and in May graduated from high school; the ceremony aired nationally on NBC Radio. In mid-May, the Indians considered ending Feller's season early. [...] "We're not taking any chances on that arm and we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> him to pitch again until the last trace of soreness has disappeared", said Slapnicka. On May 18 Feller appeared in his first game since April 24 but did not record an out. He did not pitch again until June 22, when he recorded two innings, then returned to normal pitching duties on July 4.|$|E
500|$|The album cover, {{designed}} by Spinetta, shows a distressed {{man with his}} hair covered by a scarf and a tear running down his cheek; a toy arrow is stuck on his head, and {{he is wearing a}} pink shirt with the name of the band. Spinetta used tempera and pencils on mat paper. RCA considered the artwork incomprehensible and noncommercial, and shelved its first version. Spinetta said, [...] "We were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the record to be released without it. I had the picture in my head very clearly, and I went home and did it again. We did not want to leave things in the hands of mediocre company dudes that make album covers like [...]" [...] Emilio García said in 2008 that the label thought most record buyers were women, and artwork should depict men as handsomely as possible: [...] "They could not believe it, because the cover of an LP (at the time) featured artists' faces or holding electric guitars; we came out with a cover like that, which I still consider absolutely great." ...|$|E

2500|$|At a statehouse {{press conference}} on June 22, 2015, Governor Nikki Haley, flanked by elected {{officials}} of both parties, including U.S. Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, and former Republican Governor Mark Sanford, called for the flag to be removed by the state legislature, saying that while the flag was [...] "an integral part of our past, it does not represent the future" [...] of South Carolina. [...] "We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> this symbol to divide us any longer," [...] she said. The legislature, scheduled to meet the following day for a budget session, must vote by a two-thirds majority to extend debate to the flag issue, and by two-thirds to remove the flag from statehouse grounds, although the legality of that provision has been questioned by some lawmakers. Haley said she would call for a special session if the legislature did not act.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} presented considerable {{evidence in}} an attempt to bind the Earps and Holliday over for trial. On {{the second day of the}} hearings, William Allen testified for the prosecution that [...] "the firing commenced by the Earp party. I think it was Doc Holliday who fired first." [...] Johnny Behan testified that he tried to prevent the confrontation. I [...] "told them...I was down there for the purpose of disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. They wouldn't heed me, paid no attention. And I said, 'Gentleman, I am Sheriff of this County, and I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> any trouble if I can help it.' They brushed past me." [...] He said Cowboys had put up their hands or thrown open their coats to show they weren't armed, and that Doc Holliday had fired first. He testified that the first five shots had come from the Earps. He clearly blamed the Earps and Doc Holliday for instigating the shootout.|$|E

50|$|New York City Construction Coordinator Robert Moses, however, {{sought to}} force O'Malley into using {{a site in}} Flushing Meadows, Queens - the {{eventual}} location of Shea Stadium, {{the home of the}} future New York Mets. Moses' vision involved a city-built, city-owned park, which was greatly at odds with O'Malley's real-estate savvy. When O'Malley realized that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> buy a suitable parcel of land in Brooklyn, he began thinking of team relocation.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2009, UANI {{worked closely}} with Representatives Ron Klein (D) and John Mica (R) of Florida to {{introduce}} into the United States House of Representatives The Accountability for Business Choices in Iran Act (ABC Iran Act) which would preclude companies that conduct business in Iran from receiving U.S. government contracts. The legislation was created to prevent Iranian business partners like Nokia and Siemens from receiving large government contracts as well as foreign banks like Credit Suisse from receiving federal bailout money. Representative Klein stated, [...] "We need to send a strong message to corporations that we’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> them <b>to</b> economically enable the Iranian government {{to continue to do}} what they have been doing." ...|$|R
2500|$|He is {{critical}} of homosexuality and issued several bans on the Moscow Pride parade, organised by Nikolai Alekseev. Yuri Luzhkov has consistently opposed pride parades in the capital {{for a variety of}} reasons. In 2007, he attracted international attention when he said of the 2006 parade: [...] "Last year, Moscow came under unprecedented pressure to sanction the gay parade, which cannot be called anything other than satanic. [...] We did not let the parade take place then, and we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> it in the future." [...] He blamed groups which he accused of receiving grants from the West for spreading what he called [...] "this kind of enlightenment" [...] in Russia. [...] "We think that destructive sects and propaganda of same-sex love are inadmissible," [...] he said of attempts to promote LGBT rights in Russia. Gay activists accuse him of homophobia and sent their appeals to the European Court of Human Rights, complaining the breach of Freedom of Assembly, which is granted in the European Convention on Human Rights. On 25 January 2010, he said: [...] "It is high time {{to crack down on the}} parade with all the power and justice of the law, instead of talking about human rights. (...) We need a social whip or something like that." ...|$|E

Since she knows {{the secret of the}} transformations, all of her guesses turn out to be right. The enraged Nome King refuses to honor his promise to let the Oz people and the Ev royal family go; he commands his army to recapture all of them by force. The Scarecrow throws two of Billina's eggs, which he had luckily kept, into the Nome King's face. [...] While the King is blinded by egg in his eyes, Dorothy takes his magic belt and uses its power to rout his army.|$|R
50|$|The {{organization}} entered their thirteenth year {{of existence}} and fourth {{year as a}} member of the IFL in 2012. Despite constant changes within the league of expansion and contraction, the Beef were a constant and competitive member. 2012 saw the addition of new general manager Josh Roehr from the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League (UFL) and the hiring of Bruce Cowdrey as head coach. Neither lasted a full season. As the rest of the 2012 season unfolded, the ownership of the team was then taken over by the IFL due to the owner not paying the fees associated with being a member. The head coach was let go, the general manager left for new employment, and several other changes were made to cut costs. Despite this, Andy Yost and James Kerwin took over as co-head coaches and the Beef qualified for the playoffs with some key wins, but the league determined they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> participate in the playoffs. This resulted in the ending of a 12-year playoff appearance streak.|$|R

5000|$|The {{impending}} {{crime of}} Bywaters {{is seen in}} the morbid and almost demented possessiveness of his last letters to Edith. This was at odds with Edith's last letter to him in which she complained that she was obliged to continue living with her husband as his [...] "dutiful wife" [...] if only in appearance, because she lacked the funds to do otherwise. Bywaters was further apprised that, as Percy was now always suspicious, Bywaters was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> dominate Edith's life to quite the same extent as before. Combined with Edith's earlier ambiguous remark to [...] "be jealous of husband so much that you will do something desperate", it seems that matters reached a juncture, albeit in a dangerously unstable mind, long since blinded to the norms of morality by his hatred of Percy. Despite the culpability of Bywaters, whose only claim to leniency was that he had been led astray by Edith, which was an unlikely proposition due to his reported lack of innocence, the press of the day [...] "hardened in favour of condemnation of the woman and forgiveness of the youth because he was a weak and often unwilling slave of her stronger will." ...|$|R
5000|$|Myrick had stores at the Yellow Medicine and Redwood Agencies. When a {{group of}} Dakota Indians {{appeared}} at the Yellow Medicine Agency and started to take the food in the warehouse that was promised through annuity payments on August 4, 1862, Indian Agent Thomas Galbraith issued some of the food but told the Dakota the rest {{would have to wait}} until the money owed to them arrived. Payments to the Dakota Indians had not been made, partly because of delays caused by the American Civil War and possibly because Mary Todd Lincoln had over spent decorating and cleaning the Executive mansion. She spent the entire four year budget allocated by Congress in a matter of months and she tried to cover it up; when Lincoln found out he was livid and immediately dispatched Congress to quietly approve two appropriations to pay her bills, and the money had to come from somewhere. After the decision to wait to issue more of the annuity food was made by Galbraith, he turned to the store owners and workers and asked them what they were intending to do. Myrick had been informed that the [...] "traders paper" [...] that <b>allowed</b> the traders <b>to</b> be paid right from the annuity allotments for what they were owed on credit was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>allowed</b> this time, so he responded that they would give no more credit at the stores and [...] "So far as I am concerned, if they are hungry let them eat grass or their own dung." [...] He made this retort while involved in a confrontation between Dakota tribesmen, the United States government, and other traders. His comment is considered an inciting factor in the Dakota War of 1862 that began shortly thereafter.|$|R

5000|$|The {{existing}} INA troops’ unhappiness {{was further}} {{compounded by the}} news that the 3rd Division of the INA was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> go to Burma to fight for India’s independence. Instead, they were tasked to protect the Japanese bases in Singapore and Malaya. In particular the Japanese forces wanted to use the 3rd division to quell the uprising from the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), formed in 1944 and was made up of local Chinese and members of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Many INA soldiers chose to defect from the INA as they did not wish to fight the locals for the Japanese forces who had broken their promises of aiding them to fight for the freedom of India from the British. Some of those who defected, quickly aligned themselves and forged alliances with MPAJA, as they now felt that there was “no hope of liberating India, the alternative of liberating Malaya begun to seem far more attractive”.Simultaneously, there was a more rapid dissolution of the INA occurring in Burma. By the middle of June 1945, when Subash Chandra Bose returned to Singapore, he focused on revitalizing the disintegrating INA movement. He engaged in various propaganda measures, most notably, he called {{for the construction of a}} memorial in remembrance of the Indian soldiers who died for the INA’s cause. However, despite his best efforts, it would appear that there was very little left of the INA to salvage. By that time, many of the INA soldiers were deeply influenced by communist ideologies and were contributing aid and rations to the guerilla forces. This decline in morale and the rise of dissatisfaction amongst the INA soldiers reached its peak in early August, when a riot erupted in one of the INA training camps. This was later believed to have been because the senior “Indian army officers that camp had rebelled in the hopes that they would be better placed when the British forces arrived”.|$|R
