5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a <b>new</b> <b>market,</b> and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the extract of the thesis „New Marketing as an Opportunity of Increasing Marketing Influence on Enterprise Competitiveness“ which was {{successfully}} defended in June 2007. <b>New</b> <b>marketing</b> trends are {{the future of}} marketing theory and business practice. Literature research follows <b>new</b> <b>marketing</b> trends from theoretical point of view. With respect to their number and a wide spectrum mainly of English literature, these trends could be grouped into four categories most frequented in literature. These trends are: - Electronic marketing - Value marketing - Relationship marketing and - Direct <b>marketing.</b> <b>New</b> <b>marketing</b> trends reflect the current tendencies in marketing. However, the firms should use them to increase their competitiveness. It‘s very {{important to realize that}} <b>new</b> <b>marketing</b> trends can‘t totally substitute traditional marketing forms. The firms have to adapt their marketing strategy to these trends. They are forced to realize one of these two marketing strategies: conservative (traditional) marketing - the main goal of this strategy is to persuade customers that the consumer value is still sufficiently high - or innovative marketing whose aim is to increase consumers‘ value. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} describe and appraise the current state of <b>marketing</b> and the <b>new</b> <b>marketing</b> (<b>new</b> <b>marketing</b> trends) influence on the competitive strength of companies and to prove the <b>new</b> <b>marketing</b> trends‘ intensifying impact in company managements based on theoreti- cal and field research.

5|$|Following World War II and the Paris Peace Treaties, Rijeka {{became a}} part of Croatia and Yugoslavia. This {{provided}} the Port of Rijeka with a <b>new</b> <b>market</b> and sparked further development. A bulk cargo terminal was completed in 1967, followed by warehouses in Škrljevo in 1978. In 1979, a container terminal in Sušak, a phosphate terminal in Rijeka and a timber terminal in Bršica were added. Joining them were a livestock terminal in Bršica and a general cargo terminal with a roll-on/roll-off ramp in the Bakar area in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The greatest volume of cargo was recorded in 1980, when 20.2million tonnes, including 13.1million tonnes of liquid cargo, were transported. The port suffered another period of stagnation in the 1990s due to the Croatian War of Independence, when a portion of the port's shipping switched to Trieste and Koper. Since 1996, the volume of operations of the Port of Rijeka has again been gradually growing.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War, {{sales of}} peat began to decline, as working horses were {{replaced}} by motor lorries and tractors. The British Moss Litter Company bought up two other companies who were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935. Most peat was sold as bales, with 'fine' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and 'litter' being used for animal bedding, while 'tailings' were used for floor covering at show-jumping events and for bulking up feed for cows. Around one-fifth was not baled, and was used for various purposes, including the production of firelighters, for health cures at Harrogate baths, and the purifying of gas by gas companies, for which it was mixed with iron ore at Creyke's Siding. By the late 1940s, it was finding a <b>new</b> <b>market</b> as litter for battery hen houses, and by then around 90 per cent was baled.|$|E

Following Iwata's death in July2015, analysts questioned whether Nintendo would continue the quality of life initiative. Despite a planned United States release in March2016, some suggested the product had been temporarily shelved, while others believed the product had been indefinitely postponed like the Vitality Sensor before it. The device was formally discontinued by February2016; however, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue.|$|E

5|$|Rightwise's <b>new</b> <b>market</b> cross only {{survived in}} its {{original}} form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 {{of the participants in}} Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5.00am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for an hour in the hope that they would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.|$|E
5|$|Tactical design {{management}} addresses the organisation of design resources and design processes.

It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes the use of a central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and finding <b>new</b> <b>market</b> opportunities. Outcomes of tactical design management are related {{to the creation of a}} structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this function: tactical design manager, design director, design & innovation manager, brand design manager, new product development (NPD) manager, visual identity manager, and others.|$|E

The local lords took responsibility for building the burh wall, which unusually for the period was not built on royal lands.
