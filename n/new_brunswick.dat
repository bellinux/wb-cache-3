5|$|<b>New</b> <b>Brunswick</b> Theological Seminary, {{which has}} its main campus in <b>New</b> <b>Brunswick,</b> New Jersey, was founded in 1784 and is the oldest {{independent}} Protestant seminary extant in the United States. It {{is one of two}} operated by the Reformed Church in America (RCA), a mainline Reformed Protestant denomination in Canada and the United States that follows the theological tradition and Christian practice of John Calvin. First established in New York City under the leadership of the Rev. John Henry Livingston, who instructed aspiring ministers in his home, the seminary established its presence in <b>New</b> <b>Brunswick</b> in 1810. Although a separate institution, the seminary's early development in <b>New</b> <b>Brunswick</b> was closely connected with that of Rutgers University (formerly Queen's College and Rutgers College) before establishing its own campus in the city in 1856. Since 1986, the seminary has offered classes at a satellite campus on the grounds of St. John's University in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York.|$|E

By the 1930s, US 1 was rerouted to follow Route 26 between Trenton and <b>New</b> <b>Brunswick,</b> with US 206 being designated along Route 27 in Trenton.|$|E

Outside of the bridge, there was significant controversy over the abandoned Delaware and Raritan Canal heading through <b>New</b> <b>Brunswick.</b> The new freeway was to supplant the former canal and its thirteenth lock in <b>New</b> <b>Brunswick,</b> abandoned in 1932. The environmentalists and the historic preservationists opposed the freeway extension because of the fears of losing the canal, while companies like Johnson & Johnson supported the new highway for redeveloping <b>New</b> <b>Brunswick.</b>|$|E
