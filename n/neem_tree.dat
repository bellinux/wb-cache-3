5|$|Siddiqui was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to bring the anthelmintic, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral constituents of the <b>Neem</b> <b>tree</b> {{to the attention of}} natural products chemists. In 1942, he extracted three bitter compounds from neem oil, which he named as nimbin, nimbinin, and nimbidin respectively. The process involved extracting the water-insoluble components with ether, petrol ether, ethyl acetate and dilute alcohol. The provisional naming was nimbin (sulphur-free crystalline product with melting point at 205°C, empirical composition C7H10O2), nimbinin (with similar principle, melting at 192°C), and nimbidin (cream-coloured containing amorphous sulphur, melting at 90–100°C). Siddiqui identified nimbidin as the main active antibacterial ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil. These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem. They also serve as natural insecticides.|$|E
5|$|For {{four to five}} years, Baba {{lived under}} a <b>neem</b> <b>tree</b> and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. His manner {{was said to be}} {{withdrawn}} and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of meditation. He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms, and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash ('Udi') to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayan and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and Qur'an for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God's name (dhikr, and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of parables, symbols and allegories.|$|E

25|$|In Central India, in Nagpur, Maharashtra State snakes {{have special}} identity. The {{name of the}} city is derived from the word Naga which means snake as the place was infested with snakes. Nagpur was the {{homeland}} of 'Naga' people who embraced Buddhism, supported it with great efforts in its early period, and propagated it throughout India. Nagoba Temple in Mahal is where worship is offered on Naga Panchami day; the temple was found under the <b>neem</b> <b>tree</b> known as “Nagoba ka vota", under a platform. Another important event held on this occasion is an arduous trekking pilgrimage known as Nagdwar Yatra to Pachmarhi. On this occasion food prepared as offering to the snake god is cooked in a kadai.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the <b>neem</b> <b>tree</b> can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E

40|$|Subsistence {{farmers in}} the Sahel could protect their crops against {{grasshoppers}} by making sprays from locally-grown <b>neem</b> <b>trees.</b> Sprays made from ground neem seeds are effective in {{reducing the amount of}} damage done to cereal crops by grasshoppers. Indian scientists showed, as far back as 1962, that sprays made from neem were effective against locusts. But those sprays are made with techniques that are not available to villagers in the Sahel. So trials have recently been carried out in Niger to see if the same sort of protection could be achieved by simply grinding up neem seeds and spraying them on to crops. Field trials were carried out at the Sahelian Centre of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). Seeds collected from locally-grown <b>neem</b> <b>trees</b> were pulverised and shell added to water. Results showed that spray made in this way was not only as effective as the more refined neem sprays but also as effective as the commonly used chemical spray. The trial also showed that even five days after the crops were first sprayed there was still some protection.
