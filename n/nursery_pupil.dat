Makino(1982) cleared, marital relation is important for child-care anxiety by statistical research. So, this paper focus marital relation and clear the real mother by open-ended question. Then I made an investigation on child-care into 1666 mothers. (They are <b>nursery</b> <b>pupil</b> 2 ̆ 7 s mothers and mothers who participated in the child care circles.) I classify four types under marital relation. I: The degree of communication is high and the degree of fathers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of mothers 2 ̆ 7 child-care is high. II: The degree of communication is high and the degree of fathers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of mothers 2 ̆ 7 child-care is low. III: The degree of communication is low and the degree of fathers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of mothers 2 ̆ 7 child-care is high. IV: The degree of communication is low and the degree of fathers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of mothers 2 ̆ 7 child-care is low. I analyzed the relationship between these four types and open-ended question by mothers. The various following points became clear as a result of the analysis. When mothers have fathers 2 ̆ 7 cooperation, they take child-care in a positive light. When mothers don 2 ̆ 7 t have fathers 2 ̆ 7 cooperation, they take child-care in a negative light. But only fathers 2 ̆ 7 cooperation is not enough for mother 2 ̆ 7 child-care. Social support is necessary for mother 2 ̆ 7 s child-care, too...|$|E

Four thousand two hundred and thirty six (65. 8 %) were infected. Three species of protozoa and 8 species of helminths were recorded as follows: Entamoeba histolytica (6 %), Entomoeba coli (4. 8 %), Giardia lamblia (5. 2 %), Schistosoma mansoni (2. 4 %), Fasciola gigantica (2. 3 %), Taenia sp.

Prevalence of infection increased with increase in age to a maximum value of 8. 15 % among the 6 - 9 years age group (junior primary pupils) and thereafter decreased with increase in age, to the least value of 28. 6 % among the 17 - 20 years old (senior secondary).

40|$|Czesław Miłosz {{was born}} in the {{vicinity}} of Kėdainiai, a multi-cultural region {{at the start of the}} 20 th century, which was populated by Lithuanians, Jews, Poles and Russians along with the faithful of a number of different religions. Kėdainiai, nonetheless, had been renowned as the primary centre of Protestantism in Lithuania since the 16 th century. The aim of this article is to depict the changes in the nation and religion, taking place in Kėdainiai and its vicinity during the latter half of the 20 th and beginning of the 21 st century. This paper is based on contemporary theories of collective identity. In the social sciences, a transition from an orientation towards individual identity to collective identity has been observed. Ethnic and national identity has been key to such studies, evolving to investigations about behavioural changes in different ethnic groups. Conditional to such changes are cultural changes currently occurring in contemporary society. Ethnic identity results from individual choice, not only from the heritage of traditions, which can be viewed in a positive manner. Lithuanian identity itself may be undergoing changes, seemingly due to decreasing pride and practicality in national identity. Considerable changes in the national makeup of Kėdainiai took place during the Soviet occupation. The population of Russians increased by 55 percent and Lithuanians by 20 percent. Meanwhile, the number of Poles decreased by 71 percent and Jews by 44 percent. The explanation for this lies in the national policies enacted during that period. The 2001 census was the first taken since the 1990 declaration of Lithuania’s independence. It showed a decrease in the population of Kėdainiai from 69, 461 to 65, 727 residents. This relates to the demographic processes in Lithuania, the aging of the society and emigration. Meanwhile, the Russian-speaking population, Russians, Byelorussians and other nationalities had decreased by more than 50 percent. The number of Polish residents has been constantly falling, and Jews have nearly disappeared; only 4 people declared this nationality. Only the architecture reflects that Kėdainiai had formerly been multi-cultural, home to ethnic groups that never entirely assimilated for generations. The statistics on educational institutions, nurseries and secondary schools, are also reviewed. In Kėdainiai, during the school year 2004 - 2005, all the <b>nurseries</b> were Lithuanian. <b>Pupils</b> studying in the Lithuanian language comprised 99. 8 percent, and only 0. 2 percent in Russian. Basic Polish language is taught at Sunday schools alone. Changes in the religious makeup of the society also relate to national changes. The 2001 census showed that Lithuanian society is rather homogenous-more than 83 percent are Lithuanians and most are Catholics. Notwithstanding that the Kėdainiai region was once the capital of Reformation in Lithuania, there are very few members of this religious confession still residing in the vicinity today. This trend is country-wide and Kėdainiai is no exception. Gradually Kėdainiai is becoming an ethnically homogenous region, with the Lithuanian culture predominating. To retain the multi-culturalism of the region, which was characteristic of Kėdainiai during the interwar period, national and religious identities must be made “attractive” to the members of the community. The opinion of the majority must be shaped to accept that investments for a multi-cultural environment are worthwhile, not for the ethnic minorities themselves but for the benefits that the majority will gain by being involved with “many cultures”. To restore the status of multi-culturalism to the region, a national programme must be developed to attract European Union funds and make use of the national heritage this vicinity offers, promoting it on the international arena...|$|R
