40|$|The {{application}} of Raman spectroscopy {{to the study}} of the copper chloride minerals <b>nantokite,</b> eriochalcite and claringbullite has enabled the vibrational modes for the CuCl, CuOH and CuOH 2 to be determined. <b>Nantokite</b> is characterised by bands at 205 and 155 cm- 1 attributed to the transverse and longitudinal optic vibrations. <b>Nantokite</b> also has an intense band at 463 cm- 1, eriochalcite at 405 and 390 cm- 1 and claringbullite at 511 cm- 1. These bands are attributed to CuO stretching modes. Water librational bands at around 672 cm- 1 for eriochalcite have been identified and hydroxyl deformation modes of claringbullite at 970, 906 and 815 cm- 1 are observed. Spectra of the three minerals are so characteristically different that the minerals are readily identified by Raman spectroscopy. The minerals are often determined in copper corrosion products by X-ray diffraction. Raman spectroscopy offers a rapid, in-situ technique for the identification of these corrosion products...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} and tested two complementary methods for making time-lapse synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) {{measurements of the}} growth of synthetic corrosion layers using a protocol for producing copper(I) chloride (<b>nantokite),</b> on copper as a test. In the first method, a copper coupon was spin-coated with saturated copper(II) chloride solution in air while the surface was characterized in real time using XRD with a fast one-dimensional (1 -D) detector. In the second, a droplet of the same reagent was suspended from an X-ray-transparent window in a hermetically sealed cell and the coupon was brought into contact with this while XRD diffractograms were acquired with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The protocol is completed by a deionized water rinse, which was also studied. The XRD shows <b>nantokite</b> precipitation in solution as well as growth on the surface, but the end products were variable proportions of <b>nantokite,</b> cuprite (Cu 2 O), and paratacamite (Cu- 2 (OH) (3) Cl). The latter two were observed forming in a reaction between the <b>nantokite</b> and the rinsing water. Comparisons between samples analyzed in the synchrotron and at lower power densities show that the effects of any radiolysis or slight heating of the sample are insignificant in this case. It would be simple to extend these methods to other corrosion or surface reaction systems...|$|E

The work reported here examines the impact of temperature, pH and time on the chloride bearing compounds <b>nantokite</b> (CuCl), clinoatacamite 1 (Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl) and atacamite (Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl), of which the latter two are also referred to as trihydroxychlorides. These compounds were individually compressed into pellets, using calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) as a binder where necessary and subjected to continuous fixed flow of sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3) 0. 01 percent (w/w) (pH  10) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) 0. 00193 percent (w/w) (pH 8) solutions in subcritical conditions. Differing sample sets were run at 130 °C, 180 °C and 230 °C for 1 and 5 hours. Eluate was sampled for chloride content at selected values of time. X-Ray diffraction and micro-Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate compound transformations that occurred during treatments. <b>Nantokite</b> and atacamite released significant amounts of chloride in all treatment environments. Varying degrees of transformation occurred for both compounds depending on parameters. <b>Nantokite</b> transformed to cuprite (Cu 2 O) and copper trihydroxychloride (Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl) while atacamite transformed to tenorite (CuO). Significant amounts of chloride detected in the eluate from clinoatacamite treatments could be assigned to residual sodium chloride (NaCl) from its synthesis as no compositional changes were detected, suggesting differing behavior from its polymorph atacamite. Hydrolysis of <b>nantokite</b> in high relative humidity produces atacamite and clinoatacamite, which physically disrupts patinas and alters the object aesthetics.

In particular, we employed 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide as the electrolyte for the galvanostatic cathodic treatment of a late bronze-age artifact that had been exposed to marine environment during its history, dating back to ca. 1100 B.

40|$|A {{partially}} corroded {{fragment of}} the neck guard of a Roman cavalry helmet excavated in the former military camp of Gerulata, {{a part of the}} Limes Romanus on the River Danube, was analysed by laboratory X-ray, synchrotron and neutron powder diffraction. The approximate phase composition determined by the neutron diffraction of the bulk, 82 % (wt) of the copper alloy phase, 12 % (wt) of cuprite and 6 % of <b>nantokite</b> indicate a significant degree of corrosion of the artefact. Elemental EDX analysis of cleaned surface showed that the chemical composition of the original alloy is 78 to 82 % (wt) of Cu and 21. 4 to 16. 5 % of Zn with minute amounts of Sn, Si and S. High contents of Cu and Zn with the negligible amount of Sn showed that the body of the helmet was made of brass and not of bronze as expected before. The amount of zinc in the copper alloy calculated from the refined lattice parameter agrees fairly well with the value determined by EDX. The most abundant phase in the synchrotron powder diffraction pattern of the corrosion products scrapped from the artefact is cuprite, but presence of atacamite, malachite, brochantite, <b>nantokite,</b> mixed Cu-Zn hydroxyl carbonates and probably also of simonkolleite (Zn 5 (OH) 8 Cl 2 ·H 2 O) have been detected. In contrast, the X-ray pattern taken directly {{from the surface of the}} artefact is dominated by atacamite with some traces of malachite and quartz. Because the penetration depth of laboratory X-rays is in order of tens of microns, the phase analysis based only on a diffraction pattern taken from a surface can lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the phase composition of the patina...|$|E

This includes a new spectroelectrochemical approach which allows 2 -D pseudorandom X-ray reflection diffraction patterns to be obtained without interrupting the reaction in solution. Experiments were carried out on synthetically produced chloride layers on copper (<b>nantokite</b> and atacamite).

The grid has bars 35 μm wide and holes 90 μm square. Cleaning these is impractical so they were used directly from the packaging. They were immersed for 1 h in a saturated aqueous solution of copper II chloride (Aldrich, > 99 %) and then rinsed very briefly with deionized water to remove residual CuCl 2. (This must be done rapidly or much of the CuCl patina will hydrolyse to Cu 2 O [28]). Cuprite was produced on ∅ 12.5 mm[*]×[*] 2 mm thick coupons of 99.9 % pure copper (Goodfellow, UK). The copper surface was cleaned as described elsewhere [28] and heated to a dull red in a reducing Bunsen flame.

40|$|The Focus of {{this study}} {{consists}} of examining how simultaneous SR-XRD and electrochemical measurements can provide information {{on the effectiveness of}} stabilization and storage treatments of copper artefacts in aqueous solution. The electrochemical cell used here was designed for in situ, time resolved SR-XRD studies of corrosion and inhibition Studies on cultural heritage materials. Key objectives of the new cell were to monitor corrosion layers on alloys with realistic metallographic structures and to obtain co-incident, time resolved, electrochemical data such as reduction measurements, oxidation measurements and corrosion potential (E-corr) measurements. Here we present some early results from the cell. Firstly, a correlated SR-XRD and corrosion potential (E-corr) study of the reduction of <b>nantokite</b> during storage in sodium sesquicarbonate, which shows that the surface chemistry continues to change after E-corr has stabilized.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction of}} an electrochemical cell of the Bragg type suitable for in situ synchrotron X-ray measurements on rough, heterogeneous metals such as cultural heritage alloys and simulants with corroding or passivated surfaces. The cell features a working electrode, which may be moved under remote control from a position close to an X-ray window to full immersion in the electrolyte. A pocket of electrolyte in contact with the bulk can be maintained on the working electrode surface at all times. Its thickness (typically 100 - 200 mu m) can be controlled by adjusting the working electrode position and, independently, altering the conformation of the X-ray window with hydrostatic pressure. Alternatively, the electrode may be lowered into the bulk of the electrolyte.

30|$|Imaging can be {{performed}} by scanning the sample under an x-ray microprobe. We show elsewhere that the power density needed for image acquisition on a reasonable time-scale is high enough to damage a patina and modify its chemistry. Although the damaged region may be invisible to the human eye, the data are characteristic of the damage and not the native chemistry of the surface. A macrobeam power density can be 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that for a microbeam and no surface modification was observed on test samples. Features of the instrument are demonstrated using copper test surfaces with a spatially varying patination to establish the ground work for the imaging of copper, cuprite, <b>nantokite</b> and atacamite/paratacamite and a first application from a bronze chain mail link. In parallel we have developed a suite of imaging software which can process XEOM image stacks to produce reduced data sets characteristic of {{various aspects of the}} surface chemical map. These include edge-shift (oxidation state) images and edge height (high contrast) images and spectra from user defined regions of interest.|$|E
30|$|Malachite (CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) is {{more stable}} than azurite (2 CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) and {{verdigris}} (xCu(CH 3 COO 2)·yCu(OH) 2 ·zH 2 O), therefore showing less or slower reactivity towards many factors [119, 123]. It {{is known to be}} permanent in all binding media, lightfast and alkali proof. Its deeper colour is obtained by coarse grinding, and as a consequence of having relatively low refractive index, it shows better performances in tempera than in oil [50, 126]. Due to its chemical composition, malachite is subject to interactions with acids, bases, humidity, temperature and circulating ions. In presence of humidity, malachite stains can be observed, which are actually caused by proteinaceous binders degradation [64]. Moreover, ions such as Cl− present in the mortar, sand or in the bricks, can react with the basic carbonate to form copper hydroxychlorides ((Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3) atacamite, clinoatacamite, paratacamite botallackite) [119, 121, 123, 126 – 128] and the copper chloride <b>nantokite</b> [103]. Sulphate ions are also likely to be present in wall paintings, especially from the degradation of calcite to gypsum, from gypsum preparation layers [53], or from SO 2 /SO 3 pollution.|$|E
40|$|Much {{information}} {{is available on the}} atmospheric corrosion of copper and patina formation mechanisms in the short, mid and even long term. However, studies of the structure and morphology of patina layers are less abundant and mostly deal with patinas formed in the atmosphere over a small number of years. The present study concentrates on the structure and morphology of corrosion product films formed on copper after long-term atmospheric exposure (13 - 16 years) in five Spanish atmospheres of different types: rural, urban, industrial and marine (mild and severe). Characterisation has been performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Long-term copper corrosion is higher in industrial and marine atmospheres and lower in rural and urban atmospheres. In all cases a decrease in the corrosion rate with exposure time is observed. The formation of antlerite [Cu 3 SO 4 (OH) 4] is seen in more acidic conditions and in specimen areas subject to a high time of wetness.

The object was then treated successfully with a novel electrochemical approach specifically designed to allow penetration of the electric field into deep, screened pits. In order to further develop and optimize this promising approach by fine-tuning the capabilities of electrochemical control, more insight is required on the specific morphochemistry of the corrosion product scenario. To this end, here we report a space-dependent compositional and chemical-state analysis, performed with synchrotron-based scanning photoelectron microspectroscopy. The investigated object consists of a segregated cast bronze. The prevailing corrosion form is preferential attack of Sn-rich phases, accompanied by a synergistic type of Sn and Cu attack triggered by the peculiar type of decuprification taking place in a bronze disease framework and characterized by the formation of Sn(OH) Cl as a result of local HCl generation in the Cu corrosion process...|$|E
30|$|As we show {{elsewhere}} [8, 10], {{the x-ray}} power density {{used in a}} microprobe for XAS and ODXAS imaging alters copper and bronze corrosion products on a timescale from milliseconds to tens of seconds {{through a variety of}} processes. Such images are therefore unlikely to be representative of the original surface. For example [10], we have shown that using a microprobe with a power density of 60  W mm- 2, a thin <b>nantokite</b> coating (observed in the ODXAS channel, but too thin to be seen in conventional XAS) is progressively hydrolysed to paratacamite in the beam over a period of seconds to minutes. In contrast, in a macroprobe of 20  μW mm− 2 (typical of a bending magnet) the ODXAS observed from the thin patina and a bulk reference of CuCl are stable over time and identical [8]. Effects analogous to the bleaching seen in conventional fluorescence microscopy [23] are also seen in our microprobe data [10]. Since optical components and pixelated light detectors are widely available and relatively inexpensive, imaging using XEOL provides an attractive alternative for collecting XAS images using a macroprobe. We therefore developed a broadband microscopy system (XEOM 1) [16] which will transfer XEOL from an area of 4  mm 2 to a broadband CCD detector. XEOM 1 allows the sample to be in air, in a controlled atmosphere, or even immersed in an electrochemical cell.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of a modular system for the nondestructive chemical imaging of metal and other surfaces is described using heritage metals as an example. The custom-built X-ray-excited optical luminescence (XEOL) microscope, XEOM 1, images the chemical state and short-range atomic order of the top 200 nm of both amorphous and crystalline surfaces. A broad X-ray beam is used to illuminate large areas (up to 4 mm 2) of the sample, and the resulting XEOL emission is collected simultaneously for each pixel by a charge-coupled device sensor to form an image. The input X-ray energy is incremented across a range typical for the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and an image collected for each increment. The use of large-footprint beams combined with parallel detection allows the power density to be kept low and facilitates complete nondestructive XANES mapping on a reasonable time scale. In this study the microscope was evaluated by imaging copper surfaces with well-defined patterns of different corrosion products (cuprite Cu 2 O and <b>nantokite</b> CuCl). The images obtained show chemical contrast, and filtering the XEOL light allowed different corrosion products to be imaged separately. Absorption spectra extracted from software-selected regions of interest exhibit characteristic XANES fingerprints for the compounds present. Moreover, when the X-ray absorption edge positions were extracted from each spectrum, an oxidation state map of the sample could be compiled. The results show that this method allows one to obtain nondestructive and noninvasive information at the micrometer scale while using full-field imaging. ...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{reports the}} results of the SEM–energy {{dispersive}} spectrometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS and optical microscopy (OM) investigations performed to identify the corrosion products nature, i. e. the patina, grown on bronze common use artefacts found during excavations carried out at Tharros (on the west coast of Sardinia, Italy). The micro-chemical investigations of the patina revealed the structure and the chemical composition of the stratified corrosion layers, where tin depletion phenomenon has been observed within some cases of a surface enrichment of lead combined with elements coming from the soil such as Cl and P and mixed with other burial elements such as Ca, Si, Fe, Si and Al. The presence of soil elements was also confirmed by XPS investigations that evidence from the lineshape analysis and Binding Energy (BE) values of Cu 2 p, Sn 3 d and Pb 4 f photoemission signals that these elements are mainly present in their maximum oxidation states on the surface. The surface information is confirmed by OM and XRD results that evidence also the presence of copper rihydroxychlorides. In the inner layers, OM, SEM–energy dispersive spectrometry and XRD results disclose the presence of Cu (I) compounds such as cuprite (Cu 2 O) and <b>nantokite</b> (CuCl), the latter being the specie that induces the cyclic and self-sustaining degradation process commonly defined ‘bronze disease’.

40|$|Archaeological copper-based {{artefacts}} {{recovered from}} wet and salty environments {{should not be}} exposed directly to the atmosphere as the metal usually corrodes at an accelerated rate in the oxygen-rich air. These objects are commonly stabilised in sodium sesquicarbonate solutions. However, modification of the natural patina and development of active corrosion can occur during these processes, which implies the need for monitoring the stabilization processes. In a {{first part of the}} study, we focussed on examining how corrosion potential measurements can contribute in providing information on these side effects. The electrochemical behaviour of artificial copper and copper alloys (covered or not with corrosion layers) immersed in sodium sesquicarbonate solutions was reported. In addition SR-XRD measurements were performed before and after the treatment to reveal the reactions that take place. A second part involved observing some key reactions in a novel electrochemical cell designed for in-situ, time resolved SR-XRD studies of metal corrosion. By taking simultaneous SR-XRD and electrochemical data on copper electrodes in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution, we observed the replacement of <b>nantokite</b> with cuprite in real time. To investigate the presence of amorphous intermediates in the reaction, the application of the in situ cell was extended to simultaneous XAS experiments. A rising intensity of the XAS signal was observed as a function of time. This behaviour may be caused by the electrolyte solution and/or the window material as both give a clearly visible copper edge. In a last part of the study a variation of the immersion treatment was investigated, involving the application of a low potential to the artefact to drive the chloride extraction process. A complimentary set of electrochemical, microscopy and synchrotron X-ray techniques has been used {{to examine the effects of}} this stabilization method on corroded copper artefacts, where chlorides form a substantial part of the corrosion.

40|$|Twenty {{five years}} ago, {{close to the}} {{northern}} Peruvian town of Lambayeque (Huaca Rajada) beneath two large and eroded pyramids, built of adobe mud bricks, Professor Alva discovered the world-famous unlooted pre-Columbian burial chambers of the Royal Tombs of Sipan. The tombs contained {{a large amount of}} objects of exceptional artistic and historical value including the greatest intact number of gold and silver artefacts in the Americas to be {{considered one of the most}} important archaeological discoveries of the last century. Some copper based objects coated with thin layers of gold have been studied by means of the combined use of analytical techniques such as optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray micro-analysis (SEM-EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to identify the chemical composition and the manufacturing processes of the gold layer as well as the corrosion products formed during the long-term burial. The micro-chemical and structural results give useful information about the manufacturing techniques used by the Moche metalsmiths to modify the surface chemical composition of the coated artefacts likely based on the depletion gilding process carried out by oxidising the surface copper containing the noble metal and etching away the copper oxides. Furthermore, the results reveal that the main degradation agent is the ubiquitous chlorine and that copper has been almost completely transformed during the burial into mineral species giving rise to the formation of stratified structures constituted by different mineral phases such as cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) and copper carbonates [azurite (Cu- 3 (CO 3) (2) (OH) (2) and malachite (CuCO 3 Cu(OH) (2)) ] as well as dangerous chlorine-based compounds such as <b>nantokite</b> (CuCl) and atacamite (Cu- 2 (OH) (3) Cl) polymorphs. These information evidence the strict interaction of the alloying elements with the soil components as well as the occurrence of the copper cyclic corrosion as post-burial degradation phenomenon. The present study confirms that the combined use of micro-chemical and micro-structural investigation techniques such as SEM-EDS, XPS, XRD, and OM can be successfully used to investigate the technological manufacturing processes of the ancient coated artefacts and to achieve information about degradation agents and mechanisms useful to define tailored conservation strategies possibly including new, more reliable, and safer materials...|$|E
30|$|Azurite (2 CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) was {{the most}} {{diffused}} blue pigment during Middle Ages, and before [1, 20]. It appears to be stable to light and atmosphere, and shows good performances both in oil and tempera mediums [111, 112], although its poor hiding power in oil is reported in literature [113]. Degradation of azurite in frescoes seems related to pH and grain size [91, 114]. Azurite degrades to green compounds: malachite (CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) and paratacamite/atacamite (Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3) are some examples [28, 64, 111, 112, 115 – 118]. Humidity and chloride ions from various sources cause the formation of black copper oxides (CuO) and green chlorides (<b>nantokite</b> CuCl, paratacamite/atacamite or botallackite Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3 [103, 116, 118 – 121]). Azurite degrades to black tenorite CuO when exposed to heat in presence of alkali [20, 68, 91, 103, 113, 114, 121 – 123], while cold alkaline conditions might not affect it [111], or cause conversion to malachite [119], or the formation of tenorite via formation of copper hydroxide Cu(OH) 2 [35, 64, 114]. On the other hand, it is decomposed by acids, such as oxalic acid to form oxalates (CuC 2 O 4 ·nH 2 O, mooloite) [32, 55, 116]. It {{has been reported that}} the combination of oxalic acid and chlorides in wall paintings results in Cu-hydroxychlorides Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3 and Ca-oxalates [59]; and that no Cu-oxalates were observed in azurite paint layers [58]. On the other hand, oxalates attributable to the biodegradation of an organic binder were found in both a gypsum preparation (weddellite/whewellite) and in the overlying azurite-containing paint layer [116]. Cu-carboxylates are rarely formed, as leadwhite, often mixed with azurite, is more reactive; moreover, as azurite is preferred in a tempera medium, carboxylic acids are less present [56]. In proteinaceous binder, other interactions are reported [51]. Verdigris xCu(CH 3 COO 2)·yCu(OH) 2 ·zH 2 O might be formed when high relative humidity interacts with an azurite containing paint layer, degrading the oil binder [64]. Also, the yellowing of the binder/varnish can alter the blue shade to a green one in oil paintings [111]. Small particles are reported to have less colouring power and to be more sensitive to chemical interaction [35], and to dissolve in organic binding media [111]. In egg tempera, azurite is not affected by light, while thermal ageing, high relative humidity, and pollutants affect the paint film (oxidative processes) [112]. Also, the copper interacts with the proteinaceous moieties to form metalloproteins [112]. Azurite turns bluish-black when exposed to H 2 S vapours [124], especially in frescoes [111], as covellite CuS is formed. The effect of laser irradiation on azurite is the formation of black CuO, which depends on the particle size and therefore on the temperature increase [112, 114, 125]. Selective biological activity is observed towards lead pigments [124].|$|E
40|$|Corrosion is a {{major source}} of {{degradation}} in heritage metal objects, and any remedial measures are subject to a strong (Western) ethic that favors conservation as opposed to restoration. 0 Accordingly, major scientific challenges exist for developing appropriate treatment methods to stabilize and protect artifacts after they are recovered from an archaeological site, both before and during their display or storage in a museum. Because inappropriate treatments can cause irreversible damage to irreplaceable objects, it is crucial that the chemical processes involved are fully understood and characterized before any preservation work is undertaken. In this regard, large infrastructural facilities such as synchrotrons, neutron sources, and partide accelerators provide a wealth of analytical possibilities, unavailable in smaller scale laboratories. In general, the intensity of the radiation available allows measurements on a short time scale or with high spatial resolution (or both), so heterogeneous changes induced by a chemical process can be recorded while they occur. The penetrative nature of the radiation (e. g., X-rays, protons, or neutrons) also allows a sample to be studied in air. If necessary, complete artifacts (such as paintings or statuettes) can be examined. In situ analysis in a controlled environment, such as a liquid or corrosive atmosphere, also becomes an exciting possibility. Finally, there are many complementary techniques (local atomic structure or crystal structure determination, macroscopic 3 -D imaging (tomographies), imaging chemical analysis, and so on) so the many distinct details of a problem can be thoroughly explored. In this Account, we discuss the application of this general philosophy to studies of corrosion and its prevention in cultural heritage metals, focusing on our recent work on copper alloys. More specifically, we use synchrotron-based techniques to evaluate the use of corrosion potential measurements as a possible monitoring method for copper-based objects recovered from marine environments. The extraction of chlorides from such artifacts is a process that must take place before the artifacts are put on display or stored, because air exposure of untreated metal will result in severe damage or loss in as little as a few weeks. Chloride is removed by soaking the artifact for up to two years in tap water or dilute sodium sesquicarbonate, with regular solution changes. Our research supports the effectiveness of this treatment for thin <b>nantokite</b> (copper(I) chloride) layers, but it raises questions for copper hydroxychlorides (atacamite and paratacamite), especially when these minerals are trapped in fissures. Electrochemical parameters such as the corrosion potential are shown to be insensitive to the physical presence of large hydroxychloride coverages if they overlie a cuprite (Cu 20) layer. X-ray absorption spectroscopy proves to be a good monitor for the chloride in solution over the working electrode, whereas X-ray diffraction offers the potential for real-time measurement of the surface chloride composition. In principle, the two techniques together offer the possibility of monitoring Norma...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of sodium}} {{chloride}} (NaCl) particles and ammonium sulfate ((NH 4) 2 SO 4) particles {{on the initial}} atmospheric corrosion of copper and zinc was investigated under in situ and ex situ conditions using microgravimetry, FTIR spectroscopy, ion chromatography, scanning electron microscopy with x-ray microanalysis and the scanning Kelvin probe. For the first time, in situ infrared spectra were collected on a micron level during particle induced atmospheric corrosion using a recently developed experimental set-up for in situ FTIR microspectroscopy. Lateral distribution of corrosion and reaction products on copper and zinc surfaces was determined and could be connected with the mechanisms of the initial particle induced corrosion. The recently discovered secondary spreading effect from NaCl electrolyte droplets on metal surfaces was studied under in situ conditions {{and the effect of}} CO 2 on the spreading process was elaborated. The ambient level of CO 2 (350 ppm, 1 ppm = 10 - 6 volume parts) results in a relatively low secondary spreading effect, whereas the lower level of CO 2 (< 5 ppm) causes a much faster secondary spreading effect over a large area. At low CO 2 concentration alkaline conditions will prevail in the cathodic area, leading to large changes in the surface tension at the oxide/electrolyte interface in the peripherical parts of the droplet. This induces a surface tension driven convective flow of electrolyte from the NaCl droplet. The continuous growth of the secondary spreading area at low CO 2 concentration is possible due to the galvanic coupling with the droplet leading to transport of sodium ions to this region and maintenance of the alkaline conditions. At 350 ppm CO 2, carbonate formation in the secondary spreading area results in lowering of the pH, increasing the surface tension of the oxide/electrolyte interface and inhibiting the secondary spreading. CO 2 strongly affects the NaCl-induced atmospheric corrosion rate of copper. The overall influence of CO 2 and NaCl depends on at least three identified mechanisms. At low NaCl particle density, CO 2 affects the secondary spreading effect from the electrolyte droplet. This leads to a larger effective cathodic area at low CO 2 concentration and a higher corrosion rate. The more alkaline surface electrolyte present at low CO 2 concentration also affects the formation of corrosion products and the amount of soluble copper chloride. Whereas the presence of larger amounts of soluble chloride tends to increase the corrosion rate, the formation of CuO results in a more protective surface film which decreases the corrosion rate. This effect was observed at higher NaCl particle densities, where the secondary spreading areas overlapped with adjacent NaCl particle clusters. The formation of CuO leads to lower corrosion rates compared to ambient CO 2 concentration in which this phase was not formed. For zinc, the formation of a more protective corrosion product layer was not observed and the corrosion rate is generally higher for low than for ambient CO 2 concentration. The presence of NaCl particles on the metal surfaces strongly affects the SO 2 interaction with the metal surfaces. The oxidation of S(IV) turned out to be fast at the area of the NaCl-containing electrolyte droplet, both for copper and zinc. On copper surfaces, both sulphate (SO 4 2 -) and dithionate (S 2 O 6 2 -) ions formed which is consistent with a copper catalysed reaction route for sulfite oxidation including the formation of a Cu(II) –sulfito complex as an important step. For zinc, a surface mediated sulfite oxidation process leads to rapid formation of sulphate in the electrolyte droplet area. The presence of SO 2 strongly inhibits the secondary spreading due to the decrease in pH induced by absorption of SO 2 in the cathodic areas. The presence of gaseous oxidants, such as NO 2 and O 3, has previously been considered as an important prerequisite for the oxidation of sulfite on copper. The results obtained here suggest that the formation of local electrochemical cells induced by deposited NaCl particles could be another important route for S(IV) - oxidation to sulfate formation. On copper, SO 2 was also found to promote the formation of less soluble copper chlorides, such as paratacamite (Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl) and <b>nantokite</b> (CuCl). The electrolyte droplet was dried after 24 hours of exposure due to the formation of less soluble paratacamite (Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl) and <b>nantokite</b> (CuCl) and led to a decrease in the corrosion rate. Thus, SO 2 alone promotes the corrosion rate of copper, whereas in the presence of NaCl particles the corrosion rate of copper may slow down due to the formation of insoluble copper chloride compounds. The lateral distribution of corrosion products after exposure of NaCl contaminated copper and zinc surfaces to humid air with gaseous pollutants {{is a result of the}} formation of local electrochemical cells at the particles and concomitant differences in chemical composition and pH. For (NH 4) 2 SO 4 deposited copper and zinc surfaces the corrosion effects increase with the amount of pre-deposited particles and with the exposure time. On copper, the size of the particles affects the corrosion rate, smaller particles resulting in a higher corrosion rate than larger particles at equal amount of deposition. The formation of Cu 2 O was the dominant corrosion product after exposure longer than 10 days. (NH 4) 2 SO 4 particles result in enhanced Cu 2 O formation on copper due to a reaction sequence involving catalysis by NH 3. The corrosion of copper by (NH 4) 2 SO 4 particles was much larger than that induced by NaCl particles. However, for zinc, the (NH 4) 2 SO 4 particles lead to smaller corrosion effects than those of NaCl particles. For both particles, significant corrosion attack was observed at relative humidity (RH) lower than the deliquescence point of the salts. QC 2010100...|$|E
