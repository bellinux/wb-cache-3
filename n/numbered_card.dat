Edith {{and her mother}} had been invited to this performance, and front seats had been {{reserved}} for them, for each guest had received a <b>numbered</b> <b>card.</b> But Mrs. Starr had a headache, and could not go out that afternoon, and for a time her daughter had thought that she, too, must give up the pleasure Loring had promised her, and stay with her mother. But when the elder lady dropped into a quiet sleep, Edith thought that, late as it was, she would go by herself, and see what she could of the performance.|$|E

Look at him now there," [...] she added the next moment, [...] "and judge." [...] We had resumed our walk and turned the corner of the house, a movement that brought us into view of a couple just round the angle of the terrace, a couple who, like ourselves, must have paused in a sociable stroll. The lady, with her back to us, leaned a little on the balustrade and looked at the gardens; the gentleman close to her, with the same support, offered us the face of Guy Brissenden, as recognisable at a distance as the <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> of a [...] "turn"--the black figure upon white--at a music-hall. On seeing us he said a word to his companion, who quickly jerked round. Then his wife exclaimed to me--only with more sharpness--as she had exclaimed at Mme. de Dreuil: [...] "By all that's lovely--May Server!" [...] I took it, on the spot, for a kind of [...] "Eureka!" [...] but without catching my friend's idea. I was only aware at first that this idea left me as unconvinced as when the other possibilities had passed before us. Wasn't it simply the result of this lady's being the only one we had happened not to eliminate? She had not even occurred to us. She was pretty enough perhaps for any magic, but she hadn't the other signs. I didn't believe, somehow--certainly not on such short notice--either in her happiness or in her flatness. There was a vague suggestion, of a sort, in our having found her there with Brissenden: {{there would have been a}} pertinence, to our curiosity, or at least to mine, in this juxtaposition of the two persons who paid, as I had amused myself with calling it, so heroically; yet I had only to have it marked for me (to see them, that is, side by side,) in order to feel how little--at any rate superficially--the graceful, natural, charming woman ranged herself with the superannuated youth.|$|E
50|$|When playing, it {{is useful}} to have two play piles: one for <b>Number</b> <b>cards,</b> and the other for Direction cards. Play travels around in a circle {{depending}} on the direction indicated on the last played Direction card. The Direction cards also indicate which <b>Number</b> <b>cards</b> can be played. An Up Direction <b>card</b> indicates <b>Number</b> <b>cards</b> with a value higher than the last played <b>Number</b> <b>card,</b> while Down indicates lower valued <b>Number</b> <b>cards.</b> The Pivot Direction card can be played to change the direction of play. A player may play any one of these cards on their turn. If they cannot play a card, that player must draw one card from the draw pile.|$|R
50|$|The spin cards have white {{patches on}} the <b>number.</b> Spin <b>cards</b> are only from <b>number</b> <b>cards</b> 1 to 5.|$|R
50|$|For example, if the {{direction}} is Up {{and the last}} played <b>Number</b> <b>card</b> was 42, valid plays are any <b>Number</b> <b>card</b> higher than 42, a Down card, or a Pivot card (which {{would have the same}} effect as a Down card).|$|R
50|$|Up {{to eight}} players may take part. Each player picks a card from the deck, and the player drawing the highest-numbered card is the dealer. This person then deals four cards to each player, and places the {{remainder}} of the cards face down {{in the center of the}} table to form the draw pile. The player to the dealer's left starts the hand by playing a <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> face up in the center of the table and announces the number. He must then immediately draw a new card from the draw pile. The next player then plays a <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> on top of the first player's card and announces the total of these numbers added together. Play continues clockwise around the table in this manner, with players continuously adding to the total until someone causes it to reach or exceed 99. That player loses the hand.|$|E

In the Detour, teams chose between [...] (Melkh HaShetyheym - King of Rugs) and [...] (Melkh HaSerenedot - King of Serenades). In King of Rugs, teams had to travel to Plaza de España where one team member had to ride on the other's shoulders and clean a rug by beating it. In King of Serenades, teams must join a group of troubadours and sing a serenade (in Hebrew) for a local female. They must hand over a violet to the local every time the word [...] "violet" [...] is sung.|$|E
5000|$|KFRR {{signed on}} the air in 1992 under the call letters of KFCL, as Fresno's first {{commercial}} classical music station. Two years later, the format was changed to adult contemporary with a change of call letters to KFRR K104-In-A-Row (where the station plays four songs in a row without commercial interruptions). The station had a huge amount of PR with giving away plastic [...] "credit card style" [...] cards which were branded with a unique number. The station would call out for a <b>numbered</b> <b>card,</b> and if that listener called in within 10 minutes, they'd receive a cash prize. If nobody called in, the cash prize amount would increase until someone won it. The called it the [...] "Cash Call Jackpot". The jackpot always started at $104.01 when it was reset. The station's main competitor at this time was Cross Town KTHT (Mix 102.7).|$|E

5000|$|This {{game was}} first {{introduced}} on 4 April 2007 and had two parts to it. The first part is where a viewer calls up and correctly answers a dingbat, a graphic on the screen which features a picture of two different objects (for example, a car {{and a set of}} keys). The viewer had to say the correct answer (car keys) to receive $50. Then the viewer got to pick from a wall of 15 gold cards pinned to it numbered from 1 to 15. Some had no prizes behind them, others had Savvytel starter kits (mobile phone credit) or minor cash prizes but only one has the [...] "Gold Mine" [...] which jackpots after each unsuccessful caller until someone picked the <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> with the [...] "Gold Mine" [...] on it. After that, a tower game was played {{for the remainder of the}} episode.|$|E
50|$|The {{combat system}} is {{substantially}} different {{when compared to}} that of the original Baten Kaitos. Instead of each character having their own deck of Magnus cards, all characters use cards from a single deck and play from a single hand. Since most armor, weapons, and special attacks are specific to a given character, there are frequently times when {{one or two of the}} characters have only a very limited number of options. Because of this streamlining, the game focuses primarily on increasingly <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> combos, instead of some of the more elaborate combinations that were possible in Baten Kaitos. Nonetheless, it is possible for one to maintain separate decks (such as a fire-based deck, a heal-heavy deck, etc.) and to then switch to the appropriate deck as needed between fights. Combat is more speed driven, and the player does not need to use a turn to 'reshuffle' their deck, as cards are automatically recycled as they're disposed.|$|E
50|$|A {{system of}} red and white flags on poles was used to signal to engine drivers where the Brandling and Stanhope & Tyne {{railways}} crossed at Brockley Whins; a white flag meant a Brandling Junction train could proceed and a red was hoisted for a Stanhope and Tyne train. Lamps with coloured light were used at night. Discs were connected to the points {{at the ends of}} the Newcastle and North Shields Railway line to show drivers their position. Originally paper tickets were written out by the clerk in a time consuming process, so some railways, such as the Brandling Junction Railway, closed the station doors five minutes before trains were due to depart. With such as system it was difficult to keep accurate records, and Thomas Edmondson, a Newcastle and Carlisle Railway station master printed <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> tickets, which were dated by a press first used in 1837. The GNER issued such tickets from 1841. The electric telegraph was installed in 1846-47 on the York & Newcastle and Newcastle & Berwick railways.|$|E

5000|$|He or {{she plays}} five rounds which involve {{identifying}} a [...] "Who", [...] "What" [...] or [...] "Where" [...] subject {{based on a}} series of clues. The player is given the subject's category and one free clue. An additional 9 clues are hidden on the board; clues are revealed in a predetermined order, and get progressively easier. The bank for each round is divided into nine increasing values, hidden behind the numbers 1 through 9. To purchase a clue, the player chooses a <b>numbered</b> <b>card.</b> The amount is revealed and subtracted from the bank, then the clue is revealed. A player can guess the subject at any time, but they only get one guess. A correct guess adds the remaining money in the bank to the contestant's total winnings; if the guess is incorrect, no money is banked for that round. In the first four rounds, the incorrect guess will force the contestant to replay the round for the same maximum amount as the previous round that they got the incorrect answer on (this reduces the top prize); likewise, an incorrect guess on round 5 will result in the total winnings for the beneficiary being cut in half.|$|E
5000|$|All of the 1986 {{sets were}} used again in 1987, {{with a few}} differences. The {{standard}} set put a checklist card at #27, so the Rated Rookie cards now occupied 28 through 47. Roberto Clemente debuted as the jigsaw puzzle pieces inserted into wax packs, and the 1987 factory sets contained a complete puzzle set. Perez-Steele Galleries started using repeats of the Diamond King (1-26) sections, to avoid depleting their limited pool of available players. There was no change to the [...] "All-Stars" [...] set. 1987 marked the last year Donruss issued cards {{on the bottom of}} the regular set and [...] "All-Stars" [...] boxes, and the last year Donruss released a [...] "Highlights" [...] set. [...] "Pop-Ups" [...] increased from an 18-card to 20-card set. [...] "Rookies" [...] replaced last year's 15-piece jigsaw puzzle with Roberto Clemente. [...] "Super Diamond Kings" [...] decreased from a 29-card set to a 28-card set, excluding card 27 this time. Again, the other two cards featured a no numbered checklist card and a no <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> depicting the complete Roberto Clemente jigsaw puzzle. This year's [...] "Leaf" [...] set featured artwork by Dick Perez on card numbers 65 and 173, Floyd Youmans and Mark Eichhorn, respectively. Again, those cards were not in the U.S. set. 1987 was the last year Donruss released enlarged versions of the [...] "All-Stars" [...] and [...] "Pop-Ups" [...] sets.|$|E
5000|$|Donruss' 1986 {{baseball}} card sets didn't deviate {{much from}} 1985. The standard 660-card set featured Hank Aaron puzzle pieces inserted into wax packs. Again, Donruss issued {{cards on the}} bottom of wax boxes. The 60-card [...] "Action All-Stars" [...] changed slightly. The set was now called [...] "All-Stars" [...] and featured players that were involved in the 1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Cards were very similar to the standard set, and backs of the cards displayed each players All-Star game statistics. Similar to the 1985 and 1986 wax boxes, the All-Star Boxes featured four standard-size cards, styled the same as the standard set, {{on the bottom of}} the box. The 56-card [...] "Highlights" [...] set were given a glossy-coating on the front side of the card. Again, the [...] "Super Diamond Kings" [...] set was available by mail-order and is an enlarged versions of the regular set. This year's set featured an extra card, however. Card 27 is Pete Rose [...] "King of Kings". The other two cards featured a no numbered checklist card and a no <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> depicting the complete Hank Aaron jigsaw puzzle. The 264-card [...] "Leaf" [...] set had the same differences as the previous year's set. However, this year card numbers 214 and 254 feature Dick Perez artwork of Jeff Reardon and Jesse Barfield, respectively, and are not found in the standard set.|$|E
5000|$|A payment <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> primary {{account number}} (PAN), {{or simply a}} <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> is the <b>card</b> {{identifier}} found on payment cards, such as credit cards and debit cards, as well as stored-value cards, gift cards and other similar cards.

The <b>card</b> <b>number</b> prefix identifies the issuer of the card, and the digits that follow identify a unique account which is associated by the issuing organization with one of its customers and then to the customer's designated bank accounts. In the case of stored-value type cards, the association with a particular customer is only made if the prepaid card is reloadable. <b>Card</b> <b>numbers</b> are allocated in accordance with ISO/IEC 7812.

5000|$|Once {{allies have}} committed, the {{attacker}} and defender both select encounter cards from {{their hands to}} place face-down, then reveal them. If both cards are Attack cards, the total of the attack value and number of allied ships are added for both sides, and the side with the larger value wins with the defending player winning in case of ties. If the attacking side wins, the defender's colony is lost and all ships and allies' ships are sent to the warp, while the attacker and their allies gain colonies on that planet. If the defending side wins, the attacker and allies' ships are sent to the warp, and defending allies gain a bonus of either a ship from the warp or a new card from the deck for each ship risked. If one side plays a Negotiate card against a <b>numbered</b> <b>card,</b> they immediately lose, but they, though not their allies, get [...] "compensation" [...] from the victor such as by drawing cards from the victor's hand. If both players use Negotiate cards, they have one minute to make a deal, such as exchanging colonies or cards from their hands, while all allies are sent back to their owners' colonies (allies get nothing in this situation). If a deal can't be made, both players lose ships as a penalty. Play then proceeds to the next player.|$|E
5000|$|Continuing {{this method}} of lyrical composition, Mosdell started the solo project, Squawk: The Song of the Violinnet, though {{following}} the financial decline of the Smokey Studios in Ginza, none of the recorded songs was ever distributed. However the effort did result in Mosdell's collaboration with the American artists Jore Park and Wylci Fables, who produced enormous [...] "birdhead boys" [...] depicting the characters. Using a painting technique similar to batik but on waxed Japanese washi paper, vast stained-glass-like art pieces were created—a method {{that would be used}} in Mosdell's next project.In 1988 Mosdell collaborated with the poet Shuntarō Tanikawa on a deck of 77 cards in the omikuji fortune-telling tradition of Shinto shrines. The Oracles of Distraction, are similar in style to Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies; however, rather than being instructional they are intended to distract the reader with juxtaposed images and sound. Mosdell wrote a [...] "distractive" [...] poem for each [...] "oracle" [...] in English, while Tanikawa wrote the reverse side in Japanese. Jore Park and Wylci Fables created accompanying 77 washi-painted panels. Musician Yu Imai then worked alongside other studio performers with Mosdell to create 77 audio sketches using Mosdell's VISIC compositional method. The efforts were combined into a CD box set of text, audio and visual imagery intended to be used in conjunction. Users were instructed to randomly select a <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> to read and view, and to simultaneously play the CD track of the same number.|$|E
40|$|Consider the {{following}} method of card shu#ing. Start with {{a deck of}} N cards numbered 1 through N. Fix a parameter p between 0 and 1. In this model a "shu#e" consists of uniformly selecting a pair of adjacent cards and then flipping a coin that is heads with probability p. If the coin comes up heads then we arrange the two cards so that the lower <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> comes before the higher <b>numbered</b> <b>card.</b> If the coin comes up tails then we arrange the cards with the higher <b>numbered</b> <b>card</b> first. In this paper we prove that for all 1 / 2, the mixing time of this card shu#ing is O(N), as conjectured by Diaconis and Ram [7].
