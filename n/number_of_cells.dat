5|$|The {{behavior}} of certain other systems, such as one-dimensional cyclic cellular automata, {{can also be}} {{described in terms of}} ballistic annihilation. There is a technical restriction on the particle positions for the ballistic annihilation view of Rule 184 that does not arise in these other systems, stemming from the alternating pattern of the background: in the particle system corresponding to a Rule 184 state, if two consecutive particles are both of the same type they must be an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> apart, while if they are of opposite types they must be an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> apart. However this parity restriction does not {{play a role in the}} statistical {{behavior of}} this system.|$|E

40|$|Questions: What is the macroevolutionary {{relationship}} between body size, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types and metabolism? Furthermore, {{why does the}} {{relationship between}} body size and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types hold between major metazoan clades but not within closely related taxa? Mathematical methods: Expand the allometric relationship between size and metabolism to include (1) the energetic costs of supporting an increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types and (2) the phylogenetic constraints governing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types. Key assumptions: An increase in organismal size selects for additional cell types. This is due to biophysical constraints and transport demands. The increase in cell types allows the organism to perform new functions. The extra cell types also require more intercellular networks. Therefore, {{the amount of energy}} required per unit of body mass should increase with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types. Phylogeny may also constrain the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types within taxa. This constraint will limit the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types to be approximately constant within a bauplan (a unique organismal form comprised of an anatomical and physiological design). Predictions: Organismal size should be positively correlated to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types across metazoan taxa. However, this relationship will not hold within clades due to energetic and phylogenetic constraints. The energetic constraint leads to a positive correlation between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types and metabolic intensity (the mass-specific rate of energy processing standardized to a given body size) across metazoan bauplans. Available data support these predictions. Metabolic intensity is positively related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types in metazoan clades...|$|R

40|$|This work {{is one of}} {{the studies}} made by the authors on wood {{properties}} of forest fertilized Sugi(Cryptomeria japonica D. Don). In this paper the widths of growth ring of fertilized trees and of non-fertilized ones are compared and examined under microscopic observation. These test trees are produced in the experimental forest of Kyoto University, Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture(fertilized trees 3, non-fertilized trees 3, total number 6) and Okutsu-cho, Tomada, Okayama Prefecture(fertilized trees 2, non-fertilized trees 2, total number 4). The following items are observed and measured about the disk at breast height: a) Average width of annual ring b) Average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> consisting <b>of</b> an annual ring c) Width of late wood and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> d) Width <b>of</b> early wood and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> e) Width and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> false ring, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell.</b> The results may be summerized as follows: 1) In diameter at breast height, height and volume, the differences between two populations characterized by fertilization and non-fertilization are quite significant at the 1 % level. (as shown table 1). 2) In the width of growth ring and average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell,</b> the differences between two populations are significant at the 1 % level. 3) In the width of late wood and cell number, the differences are significant at the 5 % level except some portion, but are not significant at the 1 % level. The difference in the ratio of late wood between two populations is not quite significant at the 5 % level, so it seems reasonable to assume that the difference in the ratio of late wood between fertilized trees and non-fertilized ones is negligible. 4) In the width of early wood and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell,</b> the significant difference between two populations is recognized at the 5 % level, but the difference in the size <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> is not significant. And this indicates that the difference in the width of growth ring between fertilized trees and non-fertilized ones depends upon the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell,</b> but is not concerned with the size <b>of</b> <b>cell.</b> 5) The false rings are found more in fertilized trees, and the difference between two populations is significant at the 1 % level. 6) The significant difference is not recognized in the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> in an annual ring to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> in a late wood and false rings between two populations...|$|R
5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> relatively constant in adults. There {{are two different}} ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells.

40|$|Abstract This paper evaluates cell-loss {{ratio in}} an output buffer of an ATM node {{based on the}} {{observed}} relative frequency <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> arrivals during a fixed interval. The central issue of this evaluation {{problem is that the}} unique evaluation result of cell-loss ratio cannot be derived because the relative frequency <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> arrivals does not completely describe the traffic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> streams. Thus! this paper focuses on the derivation of the worst-case performance, that is, the cell-loss-ratio upper bound. Two cell-loss-ratio upper bounds are derived- one for when the cell streams are stationary, and one for when cell streams are stationary and ergodic. Numerical results show that cell streams with the same relative frequency <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> arrivals can have quite different cell-loss ratios, and that the derived formula gives the actual upper bounds. 1...|$|R
