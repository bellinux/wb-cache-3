5|$|A folk {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja on the <b>night</b> of Diwali, the festival of lights. On one Kali puja <b>night,</b> he {{performed}} the puja and sang throughout the <b>night.</b> In the morning, Ramprasad carried the jar of Divine Mother's sanctified water on {{his head to the}} Ganges. He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in the Ganges after the <b>night</b> of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E

The parents anticipate <b>night,</b> using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as <b>night</b> approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the <b>night,</b> the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E

5|$|From late June the 315thBombardment Wing {{conducted}} {{a series of}} <b>night</b> precision bombing attacks against the Japanese oil industry, independently of the precision day and <b>night</b> incendiary raids.
