After a short time he received there already thanks to his Kenntnisreichheit a leading function in the metal metallurgical engineering. However, after only one year he changed on recommendation of his supervisor {{at that time to}} the BASF where he took up his activity as an assistant from Carl Bosch. Besides, he took part in the attempts with which nitrogen about Metallnitride as well as Metallcyanide should be fixed. In 1909 Mittasch began production on the base from Eisenoxid in whose result approx. 20,000 attempts were carried out for the optimisation with the systematic search for a catalyst to the ammonia. The found catalyst (iron (II/III) oxide Fe3O4, K2O, CaO, Al2O3 and SiO2) allowed the large-scale technical ammoniated synthesis and is nearly unchanged till this day in use. By his great success Mittasch became 1918 research leaders of the then new-founded ammoniated laboratory of the BASF. Not only this start of the efficient catalyst to ammoniated production decreases to Mittasch but also the catalytic ammoniated oxidation to the <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production,</b> the high-pressure methanol synthesis (together with Matthias Pier in 1923) with mixing oxide catalysts (Zn(II) oxide and Chromium(III) oxide), as well as the Hochdruckcarbonylprozesse to the production of the purest metals such as nickel. The results of his works are held on in 85 patents which he announced mostly with his employees. For his knowledge and his engagement received numerous honours for his works, including the honorary doctorate of the universities TH Munich and LwH Berlin, as well as the appointment the professor by the government of Baden-Wurttemberg.

40|$|The {{nucleation}} of NAD and NAT from HNO 3 /H 2 O and HNO 3 /H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O solution droplets is investigated both theoretically and experimentally {{with respect}} to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). Our analysis shows that homogeneous NAD and NAT nucleation from liquid aerosols is insufficient to explain the number densities of large <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> containing particles recently observed in the Arctic stratosphere. This conclusion is based on new droplet freezing experiments employing optical microscopy combined with Raman spectroscopy. The homogeneous nucleation rate coefficients of NAD and NAT in liquid aerosols under polar stratospheric conditions derived from the experiments are - 5 cm - 3 s - 1 and - 2 cm - 3 s - 1, respectively. These nucleation rate coefficients are smaller by orders of magnitude than the value of ~ 10 3 cm - 3 s - 1 used in a recent denitrification modelling study that is based on a linear extrapolation of laboratory nucleation data to stratospheric conditions (Tabazadeh et al., Science, 291, 2591 [...] 2594, 2001). We show that this linear extrapolation is in disagreement with thermodynamics and with experimental data and, therefore, must not be used in microphysical models of PSCs. Our analysis of the experimental data yields maximum hourly <b>production</b> rates of <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> hydrate particles per cm 3 of air of about 3 x 10 - 10 cm - 3 (air) h - 1 under polar stratospheric conditions.

In addition, the <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> hydrate <b>production</b> rate inferred from our data is much smaller than that required to reproduce the observed denitrification in the modelling study mentioned above.

The higher the pressure of gaseous ammonia oxidation, the greater the loss of platinum group metals {{from the surface of the}} applied selective heterogeneous catalysts. Total losses for one batch over the whole period of using selective heterogeneous catalysts may account in the range from 20 to 40 % of the total installed quantity of precious metals. An important part of the platinum removed from the platinum-rhodium alloy wires can be recovered at the outlet of the reactor by means of palladium catchment gauzes. However, this catchment process, which is based on the great ability of palladium to alloy with platinum, is not 100 % effective and a fraction of the platinum and practically all of the rhodium lost by the catalyst wires, evades the catchment package and is then deposited in other parts of the plant, especially heat exchangers. From the above mentioned operating equipment, the retained mass of precious metals can be recovered by the technical procedure of non-destructive and destructive chemical solid-liquid extraction. Shown is the technical procedure of destructive chemical recovery of preheater and boiler for preheating and production of steam by applying sulfuric acid (w = 20 %) and subsequent procedure of raffination of derived sludge, to the final recovery of precious metals.

In the simulations, the column abundance of <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> is only depleted if temperatures low enough for <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> particles to exist extend to the altitude above which the column is measured. Such low temperatures are infrequent in the Arctic lower stratosphere, which may be the main reason that the Arctic stratospheric column shows little loss of <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> during winter, while the colder Antarctic stratospheric column shows a substantial loss of <b>nitric</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we present {{simulations}} {{of the effect}} of <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HNO 3) on cloud processing of aerosol particles. Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) production and incloud coagulation are both affected by condensed <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> as <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> increases the number of cloud droplets, which will lead to smaller mean size and higher total surface area of droplets. As a result of increased cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the incloud coagulation rate is enhanced by a factor of 1 ? 1. 3, so that the number of interstitial particles reduces faster. In addition, sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>production</b> occurs in smaller particles and so the cloud processed aerosol size distribution is dependent on the HNO 3 concentration. This affects both radiative properties of aerosol particles and the formation of cloud droplets during a sequence of cloud formation-evaporation events. It is shown that although the condensation of HNO 3 increases the number of cloud droplets during the single updraft, it is possible that presence of HNO 3 can actually decrease the cloud droplet number concentration after several cloud cycles when also H 2 SO 4 production is taken into account...|$|R
