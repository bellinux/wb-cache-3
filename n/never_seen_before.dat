5|$|In another study, synesthetes were {{prompted}} to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time {{too short to}} account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain, pointing again towards ideasthesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{disintegration}} of Chad caused {{the collapse of}} France's position in the country. Libya moved to fill the power vacuum and became involved in Chad's civil war. Libya's adventure ended in disaster in 1987; the French-supported president, Hissène Habré, evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.|$|E

His many activities brought him into the highest social and professional circles. Like other turn of the century hunters such as Teddy Roosevelt, he was an active campaigner for animal welfare and succeeded in seeing legal measures introduced for their protection.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol Empire's rise gave Western Christians the {{opportunity}} to visit lands that they had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> and they set out in large numbers along the Empire's secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the Crusader states' salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, was {{one reason for the}} numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include Franciscan explorers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in 1245 and William of Rubruck in 1253.|$|E
5|$|When Beria told Stalin {{about the}} Manhattan Project and its {{importance}} Stalin handpicked Molotov {{to be the}} man in charge of the Soviet atomic bomb project. However, under Molotov's leadership the bomb, and the project itself, developed very slowly and Molotov was replaced by Beria in 1944 on the advice of Igor Kurchatov. When Harry S. Truman, the American president, told Stalin that the Americans had created a bomb <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> Stalin relayed the conversation to Molotov and told him to speed up development. On Stalin's orders the Soviet government substantially increased investment in the project.|$|E

5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{is placed}} under guard in quarters. McGivers {{is sent to}} brief him on current events. Taking {{advantage}} of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her he means to rule mankind again and needs her help to take over Enterprise. Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to Botany Bay, where he revives {{the rest of his}} people. They return to Enterprise and assume control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression tank, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his cohorts. Khan escapes the gas and heads to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy Enterprise, but Kirk confronts him and a brawl ensues. Though outmatched by Khan's superior strength, Kirk pulls an odd rod-like tool (<b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> or since, in this episode or the entire series) from a wall and uses it as a club to knock the superman unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the museum}} was afflicted with {{structural}} and logistical problems from its inception, it nonetheless managed to organise five outstanding exhibitions on Chinese history in six years. The first of these exhibitions, which featured royal objects from the Qing Dynasty, put on display many precious artefacts <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> outside China. By 1995, the museum's problems {{got the better of}} it and on 30 April that year, it closed its doors.|$|E
25|$|While the United States {{with its}} soil {{untouched}} by the war was enjoying prosperity and living standards of a sort <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> in history, life in postwar Britain was comparatively grim. Living standards and life expectancy were low, there was little for working-class people to buy, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis continued to claim many lives. Automobile and home ownership were limited to the upper class of society. Birthrates were low compared to the contemporary baby boom in the US.|$|E

25|$|The {{few years}} {{preceding}} {{and following the}} new millennium seemed to be least successful for comics, many magazines folded during these years leaving several fans without comics. This and some other factors caused fans, artists, publishers, merchants to connect on the Internet and set up new foundations for a wholly revised comics scene. The period lasting since 2004–2005 is {{commonly referred to as}} the New Wave of Hungarian comics, since comics scene participants show a degree of activity <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

They travelled farther to photograph the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai, the tombs and temples of Petra, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the ruins at Baalbek, and finally the buildings of the Acropolis in Athens.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} deindustrialization {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s saw income {{inequality}} increase dramatically to levels <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> But at the same time, most orthodox economists, and most policy makers, pointed {{to the fact that}} consumers could buy so many goods, even with the inflation of the 1970s, as evidence that the general shift away from manufacturing and into services was creating widespread prosperity. In 1968, the U.S. Gini coefficient was 0.386. In 2005, the American Gini coefficient had reached 0.469.|$|E

25|$|The {{expense of}} {{procuring}} licenses {{for the original}} music in the series delayed any release of a DVD set for years. When it finally was released, much of the music was replaced by generic substitutes. Some scenes were shortened or cut entirely, and voiceovers were used to avoid using unlicensed musical content. However, some scenes that were originally edited out for television (and therefore <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before)</b> were added back into the episodes to give viewers the back story which further explained a later scene.|$|E

It would take another 200 years, until the Ming dynasty, to claim back all the territories that the Song dynasty lost.|$|E
