40|$|This project {{explore the}} notion of cosmopolitanism in a {{conceptual}} historic scope with Immanuel Kant’s 1784 essay Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Aim and Ulrich Beck’s 2004 publication Cosmopolitan Vision as its focal points. It seeks to do so with a theoretical and methodological basis in Hans-Georg Gadamer’s theory of hermeneutics as introduced in Warheit und Methode (1960) and Reinhart Koselleck’s theory of conceptual history and thesis of modernity as introduced in Begriffsgeschichte und Sozialgeschichte (1972) and ‘Erfahrungsraum' und 'Erwartungshorizont' - zwei historische Kategorien (1976). The first chapters expound the conceptual history of the cosmopolitan notion in three periods: In Hellenic Greece, when it was conceived, during the Age of Enlightenment when it was reintroduced by Kant and finally around the new millennium when it was reintroduced once again by ‘new cosmopolitans’ such as Ulrich Beck. With basis in Koselleck and his theory of conceptual history these chapters seek to elaborate how the usage of cosmopolitanism and cognate notions such as the universal and the particular mirror the historical contexts of the different periods in a reciprocal relation. The analyses of the main texts; Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Aim and Cosmopolitan Vision, serves as the pivotal point of the project. Both analyses begin with a close, expounding reading of their theories of cosmopolitanism {{in order to better}} understand their different ways of utilizing the notions of cosmopolitanism, universalism and particularism. Firstly, the discussion seeks to compare the usage of {{the notion of}} cosmopolitanism and cognate notions by the two authors. Then it proceeds to discuss how the authors are generally criticized and how they contradict themselves with primary regard to the notion of universalism. Finally, it seeks to discuss the main problematic of cosmopolitanism; the universal against the particular, and the question if it is possible to be cosmopolitical without being universalistic. The project concludes that the main difference between Beck’s and Kant’s way of using the cosmopolitic <b>notion</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the concept of universalism. It concludes that Beck seeks to dissociate his usage of universalism by adopting a relativistic attitude due to elements in the historical context of his writing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The indifferentiability {{framework}} of Maurer, Renner, and Holenstein (MRH) has gained immense popularity {{in recent years}} and {{has proved to be a}} powerful way to argue security of cryptosystems that enjoy proofs in the random oracle model. Recently, however, Ristenpart, Shacham, and Shrimpton (RSS) showed that the composition theorem of MRH has a more limited scope than originally thought, and that extending its scope required the introduction of resetindifferentiability, a notion which no practical domain extenders satisfy with respect to random oracles. In light of the results of RSS, we set out to rigorously tackle the specifics of indifferentiability and reset-indifferentiability by viewing the notions as special cases of a more general definition. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we provide the necessary formalism to refine the notion of indifferentiability regarding composition. By formalizing the definition of stage minimal games we expose new <b>notions</b> <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> between regular indifferentiability (MRH) and reset-indifferentiability (RSS). Secondly, we answer the open problem of RSS by showing that it is impossible to build any domain extender which is reset-indifferentiable from a random oracle. This result formally confirms the intuition that reset-indifferentiability is too strong of a notion to be satisfied by any hash function. As a consequence we look at the weaker notion of single-reset-indifferentiability, yet there as well we demonstrate that there are no “meaningful ” domain extenders which satisfy this notion. Not all is lost though, as we also view indifferentiability in a more general setting and point out the possibility for different variants of indifferentiability...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic {{study of the}} Uruguayan {{programme}} CEIBAL, which aims to promote social inclusion by providing children and teachers with laptop computers. The novelty of the study {{lies in the fact}} that it illustrates empirically the complicated work of conceiving, implementing and sustaining policy in practice, both at the macro level and through local instantiations. This was achieved in three inter-related ways. First, by looking at how the national project of development was conceptualised around themes of techno-modernity and consolidated the promise of inclusiveness through claims on the universality of ‘technical needs’. Technology provided the conceptual space in which to resolve a presumed dichotomy between themes of equality, education and paternalistic state and those of economic development, modernisation and innovation. Second, it was analysed by exploring the way in which heterogeneous assemblages of people, values, laptops, and interests, were mobilized to stabilize the programme’s material and conceptual order across a wide range of sites and actors. This was based on the recognition of a ‘natural affinity’ between CEIBAL and Uruguay, which concealed differences, provided coherence and built a strong sense of ‘national consensus’. And finally, as a result of the other two, it was analysed by examining the relationship between ‘the technical’ and ‘the social’ as inscriptions and ‘fudged’ values objectified in the device faced users and their expectations. This implied looking at how CEIBAL officials attempted to make the laptop embody a political and moral project of inclusion, and its infinite promises, so that it could perform them. People in the three localities studied in this thesis (Montevideo, Paysandú and Queguayar) created very tangible strategies for dealing with notions of ‘social inclusion’, expressed different understandings of how technologies created possibilities for them and enacted these beliefs through a wide range of practices. This included the creation of new metaphors of ‘social inclusion’ through the notion of ‘connectivity,’ reconfiguring both social values and definitions of what constitute ‘connections’ as a result: the laptop’s ability to connect children with each ‘wired up the social fabric. ’ These negotiations over the possibility of making connections are explored through a new concept that I refer to as ‘geographies of possibilities,’ which describes topographies of power that influence people’s ability to make technology perform. The key to this <b>notion</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the recognition of several forms of agency that are enacted in strategies to navigate through different geographies: people are not mere recipients of policy but active constituents of its various forms and instantiations in practice. ...|$|E

6000|$|Condillac, {{as we have}} said, had {{published}} his first work, the Essay on the Origin of Human Knowledge, three years before (1746). This was a simple and undeveloped rendering {{of the doctrine of}} Locke, that the ultimate source of our <b>notions</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> impressions made upon the senses, shaped and combined by reflection. It was not until 1754 that Condillac published his more celebrated treatise on the Sensations, in which he advanced a stride beyond Locke, and instead of tracing our notions to the double source of sensation and reflection, maintained that reflection itself is nothing but sensation [...] "differently transformed." [...] In the first book, again, he had disputed Berkeley's theory of vision: in the second, he gave a reasoned adhesion to it. Now Diderot and Condillac had first been brought together by Rousseau, when all three were needy wanderers about the streets of Paris. They used to dine together once a week at a tavern, and it was Diderot who persuaded a bookseller to give Condillac a hundred crowns for his first manuscript. [...] "The Paris booksellers," [...] says Rousseau, [...] "are very arrogant and harsh to beginners; and metaphysics, then extremely little in fashion, did not offer a very particularly attractive subject."[65] The constant intercourse between Diderot and Condillac in the interval between the two works of the great apostle of Sensationalism, may well account for the remarkable development in doctrine. This {{is one of the many}} examples of the share of Diderot's energetic and stimulating intelligence, in directing and nourishing the movement of the time, its errors and precipitancies included. On the other hand, the share of Condillac in providing a text for Diderot's first considerable performance, is equally evident.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{autoimmune}} {{diseases are}} chronic conditions that progress {{over the course}} of years, and are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that precede the overt disease by months or years. As examples, the presence of two islet cell antibodies (ICA) are associated with a 50 % risk of developing diabetes mellitus in 5 years, anticyclic citrullinated (anti-CCP) antibodies are found in the sera of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients a median of 4. 5 years before the overt disease, and in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), patients accrue antibodies throughout a foreseen course during the 3 – 4 years prior to the clinical symptoms. This ability to predict autoimmune diseases, or rather their clinical manifestations, leads to the prospect of screening healthy individuals for autoantibodies. The importance of such a <b>notion</b> <b>lies</b> not only <b>in</b> the ability to prevent life-threatening manifestations, such as Addisonian’s crisis and thyroid storm, but also in the ability to treat and even prevent overt autoimmune diseases. Among such documented treatment modalities are administration of aspirin in antiphospholipid syndrome, ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), vitamin D in SLE and autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), and more. Although additional studies are still needed to fully assess these notions, as well as the appropriate screening strategies to apply them, one cannot ignore the prospect of predicting and preventing autoimmunity...|$|R

Formalist philosophers argue that music has no semantic content; what do music teachers say?

40|$|Abstract Background The recent {{increase}} in childhood asthma {{has been a}} puzzling one. Recent views focus {{on the role of}} infection in the education of the immune system of young children. However, this so called hygiene hypothesis fails to answer some important questions about the current trends in asthma or to account for environmental influences that bear little relation to infection. Discussion The multi-factorial nature of asthma, reflecting the different ways we tend to interact with our environment, mandates that we look at the asthma epidemic from a broader perspective. Seemingly modern affluent lifestyles are placing us increasingly in static, artificial, microenvironments very different from the conditions prevailed for most part of our evolution and shaped our organisms. Changes that occurred {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century in industrialized nations with the spread of central heating/conditioning, building insulation, hygiene, TV/PC/games, manufactured food, indoor entertainment, cars, medical care, and sedentary lifestyles all seem to be depriving our children from the essential inputs needed to develop normal airway function (resistance). Asthma according to this view is a manifestation of our respiratory maladaptation to modern lifestyles, or in other words to our increasingly artificial habitats. The basis of the artificial habitat <b>notion</b> may <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> reduced exposure of innate immunity to a variety of environmental stimuli, infectious and non-infectious, leading to reduced formulation of regulatory cells/cytokines as well as inscribed regulatory pathways. This could contribute to a faulty checking mechanism of non-functional Th 2 (and likely Th 1) responses, resulting in asthma and other immuno-dysregulation disorders. Summary In this piece I discuss the artificial habitat concept, its correspondence with epidemiological data of asthma and allergy, and provide possible immunological underpinning for it from an evolutionary perspective of health and disease. </p...|$|R

And still, I hope, not as in a place of thought! not the frightful <b>notion</b> of <b>lying</b> awake <b>in</b> his grave!

40|$|Kovesi {{maintains}} (1) {{that the}} key to understanding a term is to be found not in empirical similarities among observable things and events but in the human needs and interests incorporated in what he calls the formal elements of our notions, (2) that these formal elements also provide, where appropriate, standards for evaluation, (3) that this is true of moral and non-moral notions alike, the differences between moral and other notions, between moral and other judgements and between practical and theoretical reasoning being differences in ingredients or subject matter rather than in logic, and (4) that the distinction between description and evaluation has, traditionally, been incorrectly drawn. In this essay I examine these theses and the arguments used to support them, and conclude that, if extended more widely than Kovesi envisages and interpreted with care, they are inherently plausible and are more attractive than some obvious rivals. The first chapter is devoted mainly to elucidating the technical terms 'form' and 'matter', comparing them with the more familiar 'necessary' and 'contingent', with Aristotle's 'form' and 'matter' and with Plato's 'form'. Chapter two concentrates on Kovesi's theses (1) and (2), with particular emphasis on the requirement that language be public and on the notion of following a rule, finding that (1) applies not only to terms but also to a variety of speech acts. In chapters three and four I examine thesis (3), finding it adequately supported, but disagreeing with two consequences Kovesi draws from his view of moral notions. I also consider whether he is committed to the view that we create the world through the notions we form, arguing that despite appearances he is not committed to such a view, and that the question whether we do so create the world lacks sense. Chapter five is concerned primarily with theses (4) and (2), with particular attention to the question whether we must all have the same notions in order to understand each other, and to just how the differences in ingredients or subject matter mentioned in (3) are to be specified. I conclude that a public language is possible without our all having, in the appropriate sense, exactly the same notions, and suggest that the difference between moral and other <b>notions</b> <b>lies</b> not <b>in</b> some single moral point of view but in what is regarded as central to the notion of a perso...|$|R
