The CH radar operator directed them until the observer visually spotted a Do 17.

Above the belt the [...] battery was protected by 4.5-inch armor, but the bow and stern were left unprotected. Although not initially part of the design, transverse bulkheads were added during construction to protect {{the ends of the}} battery. They consisted of [...] of wrought iron backed by [...] of white oak. The deck was three inches of yellow pine beneath [...] of wrought iron. Mirroring French practice, the armor plates were secured to the ship's hull and deck by countersunk screws. The armor plates were cut with a groove on each side and an iron bar was inserted between each plate to better distribute the shock of impact. The side armor was backed by [...] of wood. A conning tower with three-inch sides was also added during construction. It was placed behind the funnel and the mainmast, and had <b>no</b> <b>visibility</b> directly forward. It was small and could only fit three people.|$|E
500|$|Earlier, in mid-1948, Saville asked Colonel Bruce K. Holloway to {{evaluate}} existing fighter aircraft defense capabilities. Holloway teamed with Major General William E. Kepner, {{commander of the}} Air Proving Ground at Eglin Air Force Base, to measure interceptor performance under realistic conditions. Tests showed that the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star and the North American F-82 Twin Mustang, then in service, were completely inadequate to stop high-altitude bomber attacks at night or in bad weather. Fairchild learned of this failure and formed a team {{to evaluate}} two prototype interceptors, the Northrop XP-89 Scorpion and the Curtiss-Wright XP-87 Blackhawk, in October 1948. As {{a member of the}} team, Holloway was disappointed with the performance of the prototypes, and he recommended that both aircraft be refused for air defense. Fairchild canceled the Curtiss machine but the Northrop, the [...] "best of a poor lot", was pushed into immediate service. Holloway and Saville agreed that America needed a fighter that could take off under [...] "zero-zero" [...] conditions of <b>no</b> <b>visibility,</b> and they felt that such a design should be in production by 1954, when the Soviets were expected to have fleets of bombers. Until then, an interim solution was sought. In a May 1949 meeting of the USAF Senior Officers Board, Saville recommended that the North American F-86 Sabre be procured in quantity, as it was in his opinion the best available American all-weather fighter for air defense. The government quickly ordered 124 F-86Ds, as a start.|$|E

2500|$|Sky high {{salaries}} {{also changed}} {{many of the}} strategies of the game. Players rarely were [...] "sent" [...] down to the minors if they failed to perform. Who could justify paying a slumping player millions to sit in Toledo where the major league fans couldn't pay their way? Other players in the Triple-A level of the minor leagues, who used to rise on merit, became trapped under these overpaid [...] "stars." [...] Also, {{in order to make}} the media happy, trades, rather than call-ups, became the order of the day.

The {{superimposition}} {{of the human body}} on its limbs I call weight on lightness: the superimposition of the branches on a tree trunk I call lightness on weight: in both cases the support is fully adequate to the work, the form of support being regulated by the differences of requirement. Nothing in architecture is half so painful as the apparent want of sufficient support when the weight above is visibly passive: for all buildings are not passive; some seem to rise by their own strength, or float by their own buoyancy; a dome requires <b>no</b> <b>visibility</b> of support, one fancies it supported by the air. But passive architecture without help for its passiveness is unendurable. In a lately built house, No. 86, in Oxford Street, three huge stone pillars in the second story are carried apparently by the edges of three sheets of plate glass in the first. I hardly know anything to match the painfulness of this and some other of our shop structures, in which the iron-work is concealed; nor, even when it is apparent, can the eye ever feel satisfied of their security, when built, as at present, with fifty or sixty feet of wall above a rod of iron not the width of this page.|$|E
