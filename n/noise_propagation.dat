40|$|We {{present a}} noise-driven {{effective}} capacitance method for estimating the combined <b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> and crosstalk <b>noise.</b> Gate <b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> rules are efficiently calculated inside the Ceff procedure {{to determine a}} linear Thevenin model of the victim driver. A voltage-dependent current source model [2, 6] of the driver, along with a load capaci-tor is analyzed to generate the gate output waveform, from which noise rules are directly extracted. This method re-moves potential errors introduced in traditional look-up ta-ble or fitted-equation based noise rules. The linear driver Thevenin model can then be employed to analyze the prop-agation noise, while the same Thevenin resistance {{can be used to}} analyze the crosstalk noise. The combined coupling and <b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> can then be estimated using super-position. In this work, we extend the popular timing-driven effective capacitance method into the noise domain.

40|$|Abstract—Molecular {{communication}} (MC) {{between a}} transmit-ter and a receiver {{placed in the}} chambers attached to a microflu-idic channel is investigated. A linear end-to-end channel model is developed capturing {{the effects of the}} diffusion and the junction transition at the chambers, as well as the microfluidic channel shapes and the fluid flow. The spectral density of the <b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> is studied, and the flat frequency bands are identified for the chambers and the microfluidic channel. This suggests that in cer-tain microfluidic design choices, the spectral density of noise may end up naturally being flat. Motivated by this result, the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) model is developed based on the chamber, the microfluidic channel, and the fluid flow parameters for the end-to-end <b>propagation</b> <b>noise.</b> Furthermore, the molecular memory is modeled due to inter-diffusion among transmitted molecular signals. The effect of the molecular memory on the end-to-end <b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> is also analyzed. To substantiate our analytical results, the ranges of physical parameters that yield a linear end-to-end MC channel are investigated.

40|$|Single-cell studies often show {{significant}} {{phenotypic variability}} {{due to the}} stochastic nature of intra-cellular biochemical reactions. When the numbers of molecules, e. g., transcription factors and regulatory enzymes, are in low abundance, fluctuations in biochemical activities become significant and such "noise" can propagate through regulatory cascades in terms of biochemical reaction networks. Here we develop an intuitive, yet fully quantitative method for analyzing how noise affects cellular phenotypes based on identifying a system's nonlinearities and <b>noise</b> <b>propagations.</b> We observe that such noise can simultaneously enhance sensitivities in one behavioral region while reducing sensitivities in another. Employing this novel phenomenon we designed three biochemical signal processing modules: (a) A gene regulatory network {{that acts as a}} concentration detector with both enhanced amplitude and sensitivity. (b) A non-cooperative positive feedback system, with a graded dose-response in the deterministic case, that serves as a bistable switch due to noise-induced bimodality.

50|$|He {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for an ability {{to get to the}} heart of the issue and to draw in knowledge from other areas. A good example of this came during his work on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In trying to quantify the shapes of fibre tracts seen in DTI, he found measures that focussed on shape, not brain size. Furthermore, these measures were inspired from such varied fields as torsion and polymer structure analysis and even the orbits of asteroids. In 2002, the choice of which diffusion gradient directions to acquire in diffusion tensor imaging was the subject of debate in the literature, with various empirical approaches having been proposed. At its core, this was a problem that combined the geometry related to the equal distribution of points on a hemisphere (the diffusion directions) and the diffusion-attenuated signal in MRI. Batchelor showed why direction schemes based on icosahedral shapes are optimal, and provided proof that the <b>noise</b> <b>propagation</b> in these icosahedral direction schemes was closely related to the best that could ever be done by acquiring an infinite number of directions.|$|E
40|$|Series MAPK enzymatic cascades, ubiquitously {{found in}} {{signaling}} networks, act as signal amplifiers {{and play a}} key role in processing information during signal transduction in cells. In activated cascades, cell-to-cell variability or noise is bound to occur and thereby strongly affects the cellular response. Commonly used linearization method (LM) applied to Langevin type stochastic model of the MAPK cascade fails to accurately predict intrinsic <b>noise</b> <b>propagation</b> in the cascade. We prove this by using extensive stochastic simulations for various ranges of biochemical parameters. This failure is due to the fact that the LM ignores the nonlinear effects on the noise. However, LM provides a good estimate of the extrinsic <b>noise</b> <b>propagation.</b> We show that the correct estimate of intrinsic <b>noise</b> <b>propagation</b> in signaling networks that contain at least one enzymatic step can be obtained only through stochastic simulations. <b>Noise</b> <b>propagation</b> in the cascade depends on the underlying biochemical parameters which are often unavailable. Based on a combination of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and stochastic simulations, we developed a systematic methodology to characterize <b>noise</b> <b>propagation</b> in the cascade.

40|$|The space-dependent neutron noise, {{induced by}} {{propagating}} perturbations (<b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> for short) is investigated in a one-dimensional homogeneous model of various reactor systems. By using two-group theory, the noise {{in both the}} fast and the thermal group is calculated. The purpose is to investigate the dependence of {{the properties of the}} space-dependent fast and thermal <b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> on the static neutron spectrum {{as well as on the}} presence of the fluctuations of several cross sections. The motivation for this study arose in connection with recent work on neutron noise in molten salt reactors (MSR) with propagating fuel of various compositions. Some new features of the induced noise were observed, but it was not clear whether these were due to the propagating perturbation alone, or to the propagation of the fuel and hence that of the delayed neutron precursors. The present study serves to clarify the significance of the spectral properties of the different cores through calculating the <b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> in four different reactor systems, as well as considering the influence of the perturbation of the various cross sections. By comparing the results with those obtained in MSR, the effect of the moving fuel on the <b>propagation</b> <b>noise</b> is clarified. It is shown that in fast systems the noise in the fast group is much larger than in the thermal group and hence can gain diagnostic importance. It is also shown that the coexistence of several cross section fluctuations leads to qualitatively and quantitatively new characteristics of the noise, hence it is important to model the effect of e. g. temperature fluctuations of the coolant in a proper way.

In this paper, we introduce DNF-AF selection two-way relaying scheme {{which aims to}} avoid error propagation and mitigate <b>noise</b> <b>propagation.</b> If the relay successfully decodes the exclusive or (XOR) of the messages sent by the two transceivers, it applies denoise-and-forward (DNF). Otherwise, amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy will be utilized. In this way, decoding error propagation is avoided at the relay. Meanwhile, since the relay attempts to decode the XOR of the two messages instead of explicitly decoding the two messages, the larger usable range of XOR network coding can be obtained.

Simulations of <b>noise</b> <b>propagations</b> {{have been performed}} using energybased CRR (combined ray-tracing and radiosity) and wave-based PSTD (pseudospectral time-domain) methods. The noise abetment schemes included the placement of vegetation on building facades and on low-profile barriers. Generally good agreement between the simulation methods has been achieved for the cases with vegetation on the facades, although for the cases with barriers the effect of diffraction at low frequencies shows the limitation of the CRR method. Considering a relatively high broadband absorption of 0. 33 for facades as the reference cases, when vegetation is applied on all facades, a SPL decrease of up to 0. 7 dB and of up to 1 dB can be achieved {{in the street and}} square, respectively. The insertion of a low-profile barrier in the street and the square can result in a decrease in SPL of up to 3 dB and up to 4. 5 dB, respectively.
