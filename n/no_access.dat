5|$|NY132 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with the concurrency of US202 and NY35 {{in front of}} Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park {{in the town of}} Yorktown. NY132 proceeds north along Old Yorktown Road, crossing through a residential section of Yorktown. After passing a junction with Meadowcrest Drive, the route takes a turn to the northwest then returns to its northerly progression near Strang Boulevard. Remaining a two-lane residential street through Yorktown, NY132 passes Lakeland Copper Beech Middle School and turns northwest once again towards more homes and into a partial diamond interchange with the Taconic State Parkway. At this interchange, there is <b>no</b> <b>access</b> from NY132 to the northbound Taconic, and <b>no</b> <b>access</b> from the southbound Taconic to NY132.|$|E

5|$|Northbound, two lanes {{from the}} DVP {{are joined by}} a third from the {{eastbound}} collectors of Highway401. These narrow to two lanes before merging with a single lane from westbound Highway401 immediately south of Sheppard Avenue.

5|$|The plan allows low to {{moderate}} income households where the members have <b>no</b> <b>access</b> to employer provided healthcare {{to apply for}} coverage. The fee for coverage is calculated using a formula that results in a charge between 2%–5% of a person's income. A $1,100 annual deductible is standard on all policies and allows applicants {{to qualify for a}} health savings account. The plan pays a maximum of $300,000 in annual benefits.|$|E
5|$|At its {{southern}} end {{near the mouth}} of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is <b>no</b> <b>access</b> either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.|$|E
5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese have <b>no</b> <b>access</b> to grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E

5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted {{during the course of}} the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had <b>no</b> <b>access</b> to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there {{does not seem to have}} been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with <b>no</b> <b>access</b> to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|NY268 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY97 in eastern Hancock. The route heads northeast, paralleling the Quickway (NY17) {{and following the}} east branch of the Delaware River's northern bank through the town of Hancock toward the hamlet of Cadosia. South of the hamlet, NY268 connects to NY17 at exit87A; however, there is <b>no</b> <b>access</b> between NY268 and westbound NY17. Just past the exit, NY268 leaves the pre-Quickway routing of NY17 and follows Cadosia Creek north through a large valley into Cadosia.|$|E

5|$|NY454 {{continues}} as a four-lane arterial {{through a large}} commercial district, intersecting with CR93 (Lakeland Avenue). There, the highway passes Long Island MacArthur Airport and bends to the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles. The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial {{for the last two}} miles (3.2km) of NY454. About three miles (4.8km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY454 connects to the Sunrise Highway (NY27) at exit51, a partial interchange in Holbrook. Here, the NY454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY27. There is <b>no</b> <b>access</b> to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY454 itself; instead, the connection is made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.|$|E
5|$|North of {{the first}} exit with St. Paul Street, Ridge Road resurfaces as East Ridge Road, which {{parallels}} the expressway to the north. NY104 continues through Rochester and Irondequoit, connecting to North Clinton Avenue, Seneca Avenue, Hudson Avenue, Carter Street, Portland Avenue, North Goodman Street and Culver Road by way of interchanges. Between the Goodman Street and Culver Road exits, NY104 passes the former Medley Centre. East of Culver, NY104 encounters NY590 and connects to NY590 southbound by way of an interchange. East Ridge Road runs {{through the middle of}} this interchange, although there are no connections between Ridge and NY104. There is also <b>no</b> <b>access</b> from NY104 eastbound to NY590 northbound; eastbound traffic must take Culver Road in order to go north toward Sea Breeze. Just east of the NY590 interchange, NY104 becomes the Irondequoit–Wayne County Expressway and crosses the Irondequoit Bay by way of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge. An access road between NY104 just west of the bridge and NY590 at Titus Avenue was once planned. Although entrance and exit ramps were built for the connection along NY104, the rest of the link was never built, leaving <b>no</b> <b>access</b> from NY104 westbound to NY590 northbound and from NY590 southbound to NY104 eastbound.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{degree of}} {{authority}} any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, {{as he had}} <b>no</b> <b>access</b> to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains. Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in the same manner. Because of his ignorance of nautical matters, Bonnet was in an even weaker position than other pirate captains, as is demonstrated by the utter domination Blackbeard exercised over him during their collaboration. During Bonnet's early career, his crew {{seems to have been}} less than loyal to him and to have greatly preferred the more charismatic and experienced Blackbeard.|$|E
5|$|The film's visual style {{includes}} abrupt cuts, rapid camera movement, extensive superimposition, dim lighting, {{and shapes}} and forms in twisted and disoriented angles. Filmed {{with a budget}} of only $97 ($ in today's dollars), it includes a combination of close-ups of live actors and long shots of miniature sets, which were made from such items as cardboard, paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, and toy trains. With <b>no</b> <b>access</b> to Hollywood studios or equipment, most of the filming {{took place in the}} filmmakers' residences, with walls painted black for use as a background.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have <b>no</b> <b>access</b> pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
