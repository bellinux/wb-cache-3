25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. <b>No,</b> <b>sir,</b> not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E
