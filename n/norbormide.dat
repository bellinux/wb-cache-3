5000|$|<b>Norbormide</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{with the following}} systematic name: 5-(α-hydroxy-α-2-pyridylbenzyl)-7-(α-2-pyridylbenzylidene)-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide. The structure consists of a norbornene ring, that is merged with an imide ring opposite to the double bond. One of the carbon atoms of this double bond is connected to another carbon atom, that is bound to a hydroxyl, a pyridyl and a phenyl group. The bridging carbon of the norbornene ring is double bonded to a carbon atom to which a pyridyl and a phenyl group are attached. There are eight possible stereoisomers of <b>norbormide.</b> On the exocyclic double bond there is cis/trans-isomerism. The imide ring can have an endo or an exo orientation and for the hydroxyl group erythro and threo isomers are possible. The vasoconstrictor properties of <b>norbormide</b> {{turn out to be}} very dependent on stereochemistry. Only the endo isomers are toxic in rats and the threo isomers are ten times as potent as the erythro isomers. The cis-endo-threo isomer {{has been found to be}} the isomer with the most potent vasoconstrictor properties. In this structure there is a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the adjacent pyridine ring. Studies reveal that <b>norbormide</b> toxicity is sensitive to structural changes, in almost all cases the toxicity decreases due to structural changes. Only substitution of the NH proton of the imide with certain groups could give toxic activity comparable to <b>norbormide</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have been}} done in which was searched for {{derivative}} compounds of <b>norbormide</b> that are more toxic. Addition or substitution of miscellaneous groups never turned out to give considerably more toxic compounds.

Recent studies have been looking for prodrugs of <b>norbormide</b> that release the toxicant slowly and thereby delay the toxic effects. Prodrugs have been found that appear to have these properties.

50|$|<b>Norbormide</b> has {{a strong}} effect on the {{mitochondria}} in the cell. Therefore, <b>norbormide</b> transfer through the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the inner mitochondrial space. At this location or at the matrix it induce the permeability transition pore (PTP). This PTP is an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) channel, whose opening leads to an increasing permeability for ions with an exclusion size of about 1500 Da. The transport of norborimide comes from a translocation protein (TSPO) also known as peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. The TSPO is selective for the <b>norbormide</b> transport in rats. In figure 6.1 shows the crucial alignment of rat, mouse and guinea pig LPSO. There are a few differences in amino acids, but the position of 113 is very similar in between the species and other species like dogs, humans and chickens. Where the rat have at position 113 a methionine (M) others species have a leucine amino acid. This results probably for the different amount of transport between rat and other species.|$|E

40|$|Cardiac {{effects of}} <b>norbormide</b> and {{verapamil}} were compared in single ventricular myocytes, right atria, and Langendorff perfused hearts isolated from guinea-pigs. In ventricular myocytes, <b>norbormide</b> 50 [*]μM inhibited the peak calcium current (ICa) by 49. 6 ± 3. 9 % without altering {{the shape of}} the current-voltage relationship; verapamil 1 [*]μM inhibited ICa by 83. 2 ± 3. 3 %. Neither <b>norbormide</b> nor verapamil affected ICa at the first beat after a 3 [*]min quiescence period; during repeated depolarizations, both drugs cumulatively blocked ICa (use-dependence), with time constants of 23. 0 ± 7. 0 [*]s for <b>norbormide</b> and 91. 3 ± 8. 4 [*]s for verapamil. In constant-flow perfused hearts electrically driven at 2. 5 [*]Hz or 3. 3 [*]Hz, both <b>norbormide</b> and verapamil concentration-dependently decreased ventricular contractility (dP/dtmax), atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction velocity and coronary pressure. Intraventricular conduction velocity was slightly decreased by <b>norbormide</b> but not by verapamil. At an equivalent change in AV conduction, <b>norbormide</b> depressed heart contractility less than verapamil. The effects of <b>norbormide</b> on AV conduction, intraventricular conduction, and contractility were frequency-dependent. Furthermore, the curves correlating the mechanical and electrical effects of <b>norbormide</b> at the two frequencies used were apparently coincident, while those of verapamil were clearly separated. In spontaneously beating right atria, <b>norbormide</b> and verapamil decreased the frequency of sinus node (SA) in a concentration-dependent way. At an equivalent effect on the AV conduction, <b>norbormide</b> exerted a greater effect on sinus frequency than verapamil. These results indicate that in guinea-pig heart <b>norbormide</b> has the pharmacological profile of a Ca-antagonist with strong electrophysiological properties. In comparison with verapamil, <b>norbormide</b> is more selective on SA and AV node tissues and exerts a weaker negative inotropic effect on ventricles. In principle, this pattern of effects may be an advantage in treating supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with heart failure. The effect of <b>norbormide</b> on intraventricular conduction may represent an additional antiarrhythmic mechanism...|$|E

To characterise <b>norbormide</b> actions within the rat vascular tree we have investigated {{its effects on}} the contractile function of rings from several arteries and veins. A maximal <b>norbormide</b> concentration (50 muM) failed to contract thoracic aorta and carotid artery, whereas in pulmonary artery, abdominal aorta, iliac, caudal, and femoral arteries it induced a contractile effect that was respectively 4. 8 +/- 0. 6, 18. 4 +/- 1. 5, 39 +/- 5, 144 +/- 7, and 260 +/- 22 % of that induced by 90 MM KCl. In pulmonary, carotid, and iliac arteries, and in thoracic and abdominal aorta, 50 muM <b>norbormide</b> inhibited KCl-induced responses. <b>Norbormide</b> (50 muM) contracted all veins investigated. The effect, expressed as % of KCl-induced contraction, was 121 +/- 25, 154 +/- 14. 5, 154 +/- 18. 2, 203 +/- 19, and 267 +/- 33 for pulmonary vein, thoracic and abdominal vena cava, iliac and jugular veins, respectively. In jugular vein, as previously shown in rat caudal artery, <b>norbormide</b> contraction was abolished in Ca 2 +-free medium, was unaffected by the Ca 2 + channel blocker nifedipine, and was relaxed by SK&F 96365, a blocker of store-operated Ca 2 + channels. In conclusion: i) rat veins represent the main target for contractile <b>norbormide</b> action; ii) in both artery and veins <b>norbormide</b> contractions are generally inversely related, to the calibre of the vessel; iii) norbormide-induced contraction is mediated by the same mechanism/s in arteries and veins; iiii) in norbormide-contracted arteries the drug activates both contractile and relaxing mechanisms.

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>norbormide,</b> a selective vasoconstrictor agent of the rat peripheral vessels, on the whole-cell voltage-dependent L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa(L)) of freshly isolated smooth muscle cells from the rat caudal artery, using either the conventional or the amphotericin B-perforated whole-cell patch-clamp method. <b>Norbormide</b> decreased L-type Ca 2 + current in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner, without modifying the threshold and the maximum of the current-voltage relationship. Norbormide-induced ICa(L) inhibition was reversible upon wash-out. <b>Norbormide</b> both shifted the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation curve to more negative potentials by about 16 mV, without affecting the activation curve, and decreased the slope of inactivation. <b>Norbormide,</b> however, did not modify both the activation and the inactivation kinetics of the ICa(L). <b>Norbormide</b> decreased ICa(L) progressively during repetitive step depolarizations, with inhibition depending on the stimulation frequency (use-dependent block) as well as on the holding potential. Addition of 50 μM <b>norbormide</b> caused the contraction of all freshly isolated cells and also of those impaled with the perforated method, but not of those impaled with the conventional method (i. e. dialysed). In conclusion, these results prove <b>norbormide</b> to be a vascular L-type Ca 2 + channel inhibitor, which preferentially acts on the inactivated and/or open state of the channel.

To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in NRB rat-selective activity, we investigated the subcellular distribution of NRB-AF 12, a nitrobenzodiazole (NBD) -derivative of NRB, in living NRB-sensitive and NRB-insensitive cells. In both cell types, NRB-AF 12 localised to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endosomes; however, in NRB-sensitive cells, the fluorescence also extended to the plasma membrane.

Cells exposed for 24 h to NRB-AF 12 did not show apparent signs of toxicity, even at concentrations of the dye (10 µM) much higher than those required for fluorescence labelling (500 ηM).

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the mechanism of rat-selective induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) by <b>norbormide</b> (NRB). We show that the inducing effect of NRB on the PT (i) is inhibited by the selective ligands of the 18 kDa outer membrane (OMM) translocator protein (TSPO, formerly peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) protoporphyrin IX, N,N-dihexyl- 2 -(4 -fluorophenyl) indole- 3 -acetamide and 7 -chloro- 5 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 1, 3 -dihydro- 1 -methyl- 2 H- 1, 4 -benzodiazepin- 2 -one; and (ii) is lost in digitonin mitoplasts, which lack an intact OMM. In mitoplasts the PT can still be induced by the NRB cationic derivative OL 14, which contrary to NRB is also effective in intact mitochondria from mouse and guinea pig. We conclude that selective NRB transport into rat mitochondria occurs via TSPO in the OMM, which allows its translocation to PT-regulating sites in the inner membrane. Thus, species-specificity of NRB toward the rat PT depends on subtle differences {{in the structure of}} TSPO or of TSPO-associated proteins affecting its substrate specificity...|$|E

Until this happy announcement is made, a review of the pharmacology of the older compounds is in order to enable us to understand the limitations on their effectiveness and hazard. The tremendous chemical variety of the compounds precludes any obvious systematic grouping of the compounds for discussion so that I have arbitrarily divided them into Inorganic, Organic, and Fumigants.

However, as an acute vasoactive, NRB has a rapid onset of action which makes it relatively unpalatable to rats, often leading to sublethal uptake and accompanying bait shyness. A series of NRB-derived pro-toxicants (3 a – i, 4 a – i, and 5 a – i) were prepared in an effort to ‘mask’ this acute response and improve both palatability and efficacy. Their synthesis, in vitro biological evaluation (vasocontractile response in rat vasculature, stability in selected rat media) and palatability/efficacy in Sprague–Dawley, wild Norway, and wild ship rats is described. Most notably, pro-toxicant 3 d was revealed to be free of all pre-cleavage vasoconstrictory activity in rat caudal artery and was subsequently demonstrated to release NRB in the presence of rat blood, liver, and pancreatic enzymes. Moreover, it consistently displayed a high level of acceptance by rats in a two-choice bait-palatability and efficacy trial, with accompanying high mortality.

40|$|<b>Norbormide</b> (NRB) is a {{selective}} vasoconstrictor {{agent of the}} rat small vessels. The mechanisms underlying the selective vasoconstrictor effect of NRB are unknown. To investigate whether phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway {{plays a role in}} NRB-induced vasoconstriction, we performed experiments in NRB-contracted tissues, namely, rat caudal arteries (RCA) and smooth muscle cells derived from rat mesenteric arteries (MVSMCs). An NRB-insensitive vessel, namely rat aorta (RA), served as a control tissue. In RCA and RA we measured either isometric tension or formation of inositol phosphates (IPs), the latter taken as an index of PLC activation. In MVSMCs, we measured intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]cyt). In the presence of external Ca 2 +, NRB (2 - 50 microM) stimulated IPs formation in RCA but not in RA, and increased [Ca 2 +]cyt in MVSMCs. In the absence of external Ca 2 +, NRB (50 microM) increased IPs formation in RCA but was unable to increase [Ca 2 +]cyt in MVSMCs. In RCA, in the presence of external Ca 2 +, NRB-induced contraction was inhibited by calphostin C (0. 2 - 1 microM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), and by SK&F 96365 (30 microM), an inhibitor of the store-operated calcium channels, but was poorly affected by verapamil, an L-type calcium channel blocker. However, verapamil was much more effective when external Ca 2 + was substituted by Sr 2 +. These results suggest that NRB elicits its tissue and species-selective vasoconstrictor effect by stimulating PLC-PKC pathway and increasing Ca 2 + influx through both verapamil-sensitive and -insensitive calcium channels. Ca 2 + release from sarcoplasmic reticulum seems not involved in NRB vasoconstriction...|$|E
