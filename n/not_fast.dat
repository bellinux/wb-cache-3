His fastball travelled in the low nineties, and while his curveball was <b>not</b> <b>fast,</b> it had late breaking action and {{got a lot of}} swing-throughs. Affeldt induced groundballs at a high rate with his sinking fastball and could also get the strikeout when the situation called for it.|$|E

But Paul and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos, which can run at up to 56km or 35 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|L'Hermite's {{three other}} ships all survived the {{hurricane}} relatively intact {{and were able}} to continue their journey to Europe unimpeded, the British squadrons in the area also dispersed by the summer storms. In late September the squadron broke up, Régulus sailing for Brest and arriving on 5 October, the only French ship of the line to enter or leave the port all year. Président was less successful: at 03:30 on 27 September, while sailing in the Bay of Biscay at , Captain Labrosse sighted six ships of the line. This overwhelming force was a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis, which had been sent to the Bay of Biscay to await the return of Willaumez from the Caribbean. Immediately giving chase, Louis found that his ships of the line were <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> enough to catch the French frigate, which began to outdistance {{the main body of the}} squadron. However one of the small 18-gun sloops attached to the squadron, HMS Despatch under Captain Edward Hawkins was able to keep pace with the frigate, coming within firing range at 18:45.|$|E

The country's {{participation}} at London marked its ninth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its début at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The delegation included two track and field athletes; Mike Tebulo and Ambwene Simukonda, and one swimmer; Joyce Tafatatha. Tebulo and Simukonda qualified through wildcard places for their respective events. Tebulo {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening and closing ceremonies. Tebulo finished 44th in the men's marathon, while Simukonda did not advance beyond {{the first round of the}} women's 400 metres.

Evans was unable to {{maintain}} the pace that he had set in the heats, clocking a time 0.10s slower. In the 200m, Evans came second in his heat but was <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> {{enough to make the}} final, swimming 1.47s slower than the slowest qualifier to finish 17th. The final event for Evans was the 4×100m medley relay. Evans was joined by Kerry, while Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell swum the butterfly and freestyle respectively. The Americans were overwhelming favourites, boasting the gold medallists in three of the respective individual events. The hosts easily won the gold by almost four seconds; Evans and the Australians were third, relegated from the silver medal by just 0.02s by the Canadian team, having been in the bronze medal position at every change. Evans recorded the second-fastest breaststroke split, slower than Lundquist, but quicker than the rest, including Davis.|$|E
5|$|Nhu {{then decided}} that his men {{would go to}} Lâm Thao to {{reinforce}} their colleagues. On the way, they stopped at {{the nearby town of}} Kinh Khe, where the instructor, Nguyen Quang Kinh, and one of his two wives were slain by VNQDĐ members in an apparent revenge killing. Kinh had previously been affiliated with the VNQDĐ, whose members took him away. His wife had tried to follow him, so the VNQDĐ captured her as well. French intelligence reports speculated that Kinh had been killed because he would not join his former colleagues. Nhu then led his men through Lâm Thao. The plan was that they would help to consolidate the other unit's control on the town until the afternoon. They were hopeful that the attack in Yên Bái would have been successfully completed by then, and that the mutineers and people of Yên Bái would come to Lâm Thao and stage their forces before attacking the barracks at Phu Tho. However, they were <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> enough.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, the Mordechai (Pesachim 107) quotes {{the ruling}} of his {{father-in-law}} Rabbeinu Yechiel that firstborns need <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> {{at all on}} the day before Passover; firstborns need only limit their diet to snacks. (The Bigdei Yesha commentary suggests the rationale behind this ruling was to avoid holding a fast during the month of Nisan, which is generally prohibited.) The Mishnah Berurah states that it is appropriate for a weak individual to follow this ruling.|$|E

We regularize the stochastic differential equations by associating with them approximating ordinary differential equations obtained by discretization of the increments of the Wiener process on small intervals. By showing that the flows associated with the regularized equations converge uniformly to {{the solution of the}} stochastic differential equation, we at the same time establish the existence of a global flow for the stochastic equation under local Lipschitz conditions...|$|R

However, the fluxional process is <b>not</b> <b>fast</b> enough to produce averaging in the IR spectrum. Thus, three absorptions are seen for each isomer. The νCO bands for bridging CO ligands are around 1780cm−1 whereas νCO bands for terminal CO ligands are about 1980cm−1.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{discussion}} among the poskim (halakhic authorities) regarding whether a firstborn born through caesarean section {{is required to}} observe this fast, given {{that he is not}} obligated in the Redemption of the Firstborn. The Chok Ya'akov (470:2) suggests that such a firstborn may be required to fast, while the Kaf HaChayyim (470:3) rules that he need <b>not</b> <b>fast.</b> To circumvent this question, as well as dispute regarding a firstborn non-Jew who converts to Judaism, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (cited in HaSeder Ha'aruch, Vol. 3, p.44) suggests that such firstborns participate in a seudat mitzvah (see here and here below).|$|E

This appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large current account deficits. However, no shortage of foreign currency ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and memories of the debt crisis of the 1980s faded.|$|E

25|$|Many authorities, {{including}} the Rema, note the custom {{that the father}} of a firstborn should fast on his child's behalf until the child reaches halakhic adulthood.

The Mateh Moshe and Maharil dispute this and rule in such a scenario that the mother need <b>not</b> <b>fast.</b> The Magen Avraham rules that it is appropriate to follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, but he adds that a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain that custom and fast in subsequent years.|$|E
