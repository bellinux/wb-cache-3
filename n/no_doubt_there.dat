These weapons had been selected before they set off. The knife was far too big to be hidden from the others. There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> was a hunting party looking for a victim." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Court {{have been described as}} slow and tentative. <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> were many reasons for this, including the unfamiliarity of lawyers and litigants with the new Court, the speedy recall [...] to England of successive Lord Deputies, the wish of many [...] English-born judges to return home as quickly as possible, and the disruption caused by the Desmond Rebellions in the early 1580s.|$|E
2500|$|Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it {{was clear}} FIFA needed to change, saying [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> needs to be reform of FIFA. This is {{something}} that we're hearing worldwide", with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of [...] "scamming" [...] the country out of the A$46 million (US$35 million) it spent on the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that [...] "until the investigation into FIFA has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers' money on any future World Cup bids." ...|$|E

I never want {{to call into question}} the behaviour of our soldiers and our army, who I believe to be the finest in the world. And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>there</b> is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Howard's last election, he was {{defeated}} in the Seat of Bennelong by Labor candidate Maxine McKew, who had hosted Lateline during the Howard era. Peter Mares reported for Radio National that [...] "some wags described it as an 'internal promotion', while others said she'd simply moved from the 'media wing' to the 'political wing' of the ALP". Mares consulted ABC journalist turned NSW Liberal MLA Pru Goward who said: [...] " [...] I have <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> was left-wing bias, I certainly thought it when I was there", while McKew {{said there was no}} left wing bias, though [...] "what I detected years ago in the ABC, much more of a collectivist philosophy".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{international}} {{criticism has}} {{centered around the}} government of Karzai in early 2009 for failing to secure the country from Taliban attacks, systemic governmental corruption, and widespread claims of electoral fraud in the 2009 Afghan presidential election. Karzai staunchly defended the election balloting, stating that some statements criticizing the balloting and vote count were [...] "totally fabricated." [...] He told the media that, [...] "There were instances of fraud, <b>no</b> <b>doubt...</b> <b>There</b> were irregularities... But the election {{as a whole was}} good and free and democratic." [...] He further went on to say that, [...] "Afghanistan has its separate problems and we have to handle them as Afghanistan finds it feasible... This country was completely destroyed... Today, we are talking about fighting corruption in Afghanistan, improved legal standards... You see the glass half empty or half full. I see it as half full. Others see it as half empty." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Bears {{could not}} score until the fourth quarter, and head coach Dick Jauron offered no excuses. During a postgame interview, he said, [...] "That {{certainly}} wasn't pretty in any area. It's frustrating, <b>no</b> <b>doubt.</b> <b>There's</b> nobody who's happy right now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she said. [...] "We mustn't {{have any}} unpleasantness, and Mr. Hill's first night back amongst us, too. <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>there's</b> some little mistake.

2500|$|On 13 August 2011, Cahill {{scored on}} {{the opening day of}} the 2011–12 Premier League season against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in a 4–0 victory from 25yards out in the 45th minute. In December 2011, before the January {{transfer}} window, Bolton manager Owen Coyle admitted that Cahill may be sold as his contract will expire {{at the end of the}} 2011–12 season. Coyle said, [...] "If he [...] does move, there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> will be top clubs clamouring for Gary." [...] This led much speculation that Cahill could move to higher-placed clubs like Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United or Tottenham Hotspur, all of which showed interest. On 23 December, Coyle confirmed that they had started negotiations with Chelsea about a possible transfer, and a week later a transfer fee was agreed. Despite being on the brink of joining Chelsea, Cahill continued to play for Bolton, scoring the crucial goal in the 1–2 away win against Everton at Goodison Park on 4 January 2012. Two days after that, Coyle said that Cahill was not going to play in their FA Cup clash against Macclesfield Town, as it would leave him cup-tied for Chelsea.|$|E
2500|$|The Irmenach church might {{originally}} {{have been}} Saint Peter’s Church, {{even though the}} old local lore held that it was consecrated to Saint “Irmel” (Irmina) or that {{at the very least}} there was an altar consecrated to Irmina. Whatever the truth is, it seems that there were pilgrimages to the Irmenach church. Of the older church buildings, the lowest part of the tower may be all that is left; this may date from about 1200, whereas the tower and the nave were built later. Preserved to this day, however, are the old bells (...) from 1423, 1514 (poured by Hans von Breisig) and 1555 (poured by Johann von Trier). In 1871 and 1872, a new nave was built in Irmenach, as the one that had stood until then had become too small for the community. This was not accomplished before an acrimonious dispute between the two centres, for the Beuren dwellers were of the opinion that any new church building should happen in their village. When the old church was torn down, the paintings, of which there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>there</b> were many, were all lost; such artworks can still be found at Lötzbeuren and Raversbeuren. The historical Stumm organ from 1776, though, was preserved.|$|E
