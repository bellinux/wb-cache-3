25|$|On 1 May 1983, an Israeli Air Force F-15D {{collided}} mid-air with an A-4 Skyhawk {{during a}} training flight, causing the F-15's right wing {{to shear off}} almost completely.

25|$|In 1955, Stroukoff, under {{contract}} from the USAF, produced a single YC-123E, designed {{to be able to}} take off from any surface, and also equipped with BLC. The new aircraft also featured Stroukoff's Pantobase system, combining a ski system with a sealed fuselage and wing mounted floats, while retaining its <b>normal</b> <b>landing</b> gear. The skis worked both on snow and water, and the system effectively allowed the aircraft to land on water, land, snow or ice.|$|E

The pre-production vehicles quickly developed, without the central steering and complex body panels. The design team felt the centre steering was somewhat awkward to use and impractical in certain circumstances. The concept stayed in initial development drawings of the 'Land Rover' program in October 1947.

2500|$|The {{construction}} of the shuttles began in 1980, and by 1984 the first full-scale Buran was rolled out. The first suborbital test flight of a scale-model (BOR-5) took place as early as July 1983. As the project progressed, five additional scale-model flights were performed. [...] A test vehicle was constructed with four jet engines mounted at the rear; this vehicle is usually referred to as OK-GLI, or as the [...] "Buran aerodynamic analogue". The jets were used to take off from a <b>normal</b> <b>landing</b> strip, and once it reached a designated point, the engines were cut and OK-GLI glided back to land.

Twenty-four test flights of OK-GLI were performed after which the shuttle was [...] "worn out".

40|$|Abstract Background Many visitors, {{including}} military troops, {{who enter}} highland regions from low altitude areas may suffer from acute mountain sickness (AMS), which negatively impacts workable man-hours and increases healthcare costs. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the population level risk factors and build a multivariate model, which might be applicable to reduce the effects of AMS on Chinese young men traveling to this region. Methods Chinese highland military medical records were used to obtain data of young men (n = 3727) who entered the Tibet plateau between the years of 2006 - 2009. The relationship between AMS and travel profile, demographic characteristics, and health behaviors were evaluated by logistic regression. Univariate logistic models estimated the crude odds ratio. The variables that showed significance in the univariate model were included in a multivariate model to derive adjusted odds ratios and build the final model. Data corresponding to odd and even years (2 subsets) were analyzed separately and used in a simple cross-validation. Results Univariate analysis indicated that travel profile, prophylactic use, ethnicity, and province of birth were all associated with AMS in both subsets. In multivariate analysis, young men who traveled from lower altitude (600 - 800 m vs. 1300 - 1500 m, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1. 32 - 1. 44) to higher altitudes (4100 - 4300 m vs. 2900 - 3100 m, AOR = 3. 94 - 4. 12; 3600 - 3700 m vs. 2900 - 3100 m, AOR = 2. 71 - 2. 74) by air or rapid land transport for emergency mission deployment (emergency <b>land</b> deployment vs. <b>normal</b> <b>land</b> deployment, AOR = 2. 08 - 2. 11; normal air deployment vs. <b>normal</b> <b>land</b> deployment, AOR = 2. 00 - 2. 20; emergency air deployment vs. <b>normal</b> <b>land</b> deployment, AOR = 2. 40 - 3. 34) during the cold season (cold vs. warm, AOR = 1. 25 - 1. 28) are at great risk for developing AMS. Non-Tibetan male soldiers (Tibetan vs. Han, AOR = 0. 03 - 0. 08), born and raised in lower provinces (eastern vs. northwestern, AOR = 1. 32 - 1. 39), and deployed without prophylaxis (prophylactic drug vs. none, AOR = 0. 75 - 0. 76), also represented a population at significantly increased risk for AMS. The predicted model was built; the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0. 703. Conclusion Before a group of young men first enter a high altitude area, it is important that a health service plan should be made referring to the group's travel profile and with respect to young men's ethnicity and province of birth. Low-cost Chinese traditional prophylactic drugs might have some effect on decreasing the risk of AMS, although this needs further verification. </p...|$|R
