5000|$|Smith {{was born}} in Savannah, Georgia. Known by his middle name (and his nickname, [...] "Smitty"), Smith covered US presidents from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Richard Nixon and {{originated}} the practice of closing presidential <b>news</b> <b>conferences</b> <b>with</b> [...] "Thank You, Mr. President," [...] which was {{the title of his}} 1946 book, written during his coverage of the Harry Truman administration.

25|$|On September 2, 2014, Marshall and Finance Minister Charlene Johnson held a <b>news</b> <b>conference</b> <b>with</b> {{multiple}} {{union leaders}} {{to announce that}} they had negotiated a deal to reform pension plans {{for the majority of}} public sector employees. The government had spoken of the need to reform pension plans for years. As of March 31, 2014, the pension liabilities and other post-retirement benefits made up 74 percent of Newfoundland and Labrador's $9.8 billion net debt. Reforms to the plan included increased contributions by employers and government beginning January 1, 2015, over five years the retirement age will increase to 58 and employees will need to 10 years of service to qualify for a pension rather than five years. The unions and government will jointly manage the fund with {{the creation of a new}} corporation and it is expected the plans will be fully funded within 30 years.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 11, {{the crew}} of Space Shuttle Endeavour {{conducted}} a late inspection of the orbiter's Thermal Protection System. On most previous flights, this inspection was performed after the shuttle undocked from the ISS. However, {{in this case it}} was done early, because the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was to be left on board the ISS after Endeavours departure. The joint Expedition 28/STS-134 crew held a <b>news</b> <b>conference</b> <b>with</b> reporters on the ground at NASA centers around the country and ISS partner agencies. Commander Mark Kelly also spoke to reporters from four Tucson, Arizona television stations. Later in the crew day, the joint crew held an EVA procedure review for the fourth and final spacewalk of STS-134. Astronauts Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff spent the night in the Quest Airlock with the air pressure reduced to 10.2 Psi, so as to avoid decompression sickness during their spacewalk. The crew and flight controllers on the ground opted not to use the In-suit Light Exercise (ISLE) protocol that was tested during EVA 3 earlier in the mission, opting instead to go with the standard campout protocol, since it was discovered that ISLE used more carbon-dioxide scrubbing capability. They wanted to save this capability, since a CO2 sensor in Chamitoff's suit had failed during EVA 1, cutting that spacewalk short.|$|E
500|$|On April 19, 2012, {{shortly before}} the 2012 Serbian {{parliamentary}} election, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani traveled to Belgrade to attend a <b>news</b> <b>conference</b> <b>with</b> Belgrade mayor candidate Aleksandar Vučić. The US Embassy to Serbia gave a statement {{that it did not}} support any specific candidate in the upcoming election. Belgrade mayor Dragan Đilas slammed the conference which Giuliani attended, telling press that [...] "Giuliani should not speak about Belgrade's future as a man who supported the bombing of Serbia." [...] After the 2012 presidential elections in Serbia, a large number of local news outlets and even some intellectuals interpreted Philip T. Reeker's visit to Belgrade in July 2012 as an attempt to create a parliamentary coalition between the Demokratska Stranka and the Serbian Progressive Party as opposed to the Progressive-SPS bloc which had been composed by the election results. The election ultimately gave SNS along with its partners a victory, while Demokratska Stranka was removed into the opposition. The newly elected government ultimately continued largely the same Euro-Atlantic integration programs pursued by the Tadić administration. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, only 20% of Serbs approved of U.S. leadership, with 57% disapproving and 22% uncertain, the fifth-lowest rating for any surveyed European country that year.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his last}} trip to Afghanistan U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel {{announced}} on 6 December 2014 {{the end of}} the U.S original plan to withdraw its troops form Afghanistan. Under a plan announced in May 2014 the number of American troops was supposed to fall to 9,800 by 1 January 2015. Instead the U.S. will keep up to 10,800 troops for {{the first few months of}} 2015 and then restart the drawdown, which is scheduled to reach 5,500 troops by the end of 2015. Besides partaking in NATO's Resolute Support Mission consisting of 12,500 soldiers some U.S. troops will take part in a separate counterterrorism mission focused on al-Qaeda. By the time U.S. President Obama leaves office in 2017 only a small force attached to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul is to remain in Afghanistan. The reason for the United States to keep additional forces in the country temporarily was that planned troop commitments by US allies for the Nato train-and-assist mission starting in January 2015 have been slow to materialize. President Barack Obama [...] "has provided US military commanders the flexibility to manage any temporary force shortfall that we might experience for a few months as we allow for coalition troops to arrive in theater," [...] Hagel said in a <b>news</b> <b>conference</b> <b>with</b> President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul. [...] "But the president’s authorization will not change our troops’ missions, or the long-term timeline for our drawdown," [...] he added.|$|E
