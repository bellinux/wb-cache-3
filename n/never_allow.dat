5|$|An {{agreement}} {{called the}} Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between the French and the Kanaks, {{which had the}} majority support of 80% of the French people. According to the Matignon Accord (or Matignon Agreement) a referendum on independence was proposed to be held by 1998. However, two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement, Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist. The Kanak independence activists were unhappy with the situation as they felt that France would <b>never</b> <b>allow</b> them independence.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} heavily debated topics of the period was that of faith versus reason. Avicenna and Averroes both leaned more {{on the side of}} reason. Augustine stated that he would <b>never</b> <b>allow</b> his {{philosophical}} investigations to go beyond the authority of God. Anselm attempted to defend against what he saw as partly an assault on faith, with an approach allowing for both faith and reason. The Augustinian solution to the faith/reason problem is to (1) believe, and then (2) seek to understand.|$|E

Saying that while Lysias is present, he would <b>never</b> <b>allow</b> himself {{to be used as a}} training partner for Phaedrus to practice his own speech-making on, he asks Phaedrus to expose what he is holding under his cloak.

25|$|The {{royal family}} could {{not return to}} Greece {{immediately}} {{after the war ended}} due to a civil war between the Communists and the Conservatives. Prince Peter was aware that King George, if allowed to return, would <b>never</b> <b>allow</b> him to move to Greece along with his wife. Therefore, he, while still in Egypt, started searching for a country where the two could settle. On 1 September 1946, a referendum confirmed George II's position. The King, however, died unexpectedly on 1 April the next year and the Prince was demobilised. Peter hoped that Paul, George II's successor, would recognise his marriage to Ovtchinnikova. King Paul agreed but only if Prince Peter officially recognised that the marriage deprived him of his dynastic rights, something the Prince had always refused to do. Peter turned down the offer and Paul prohibited him from returning to Greece.|$|E

25|$|Later in the epic, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh {{the story}} of the Great Flood, which was sent by the god Enlil to annihilate all life on earth because the humans, who were vastly overpopulated, made too much noise and {{prevented}} him from sleeping. Utnapishtim tells how, when the flood came, Ishtar wept and mourned over the destruction of humanity, alongside the Anunnaki. Later, after the flood subsides, Utnapishtim makes an offering to the gods. Ishtar appears to Utnapishtim wearing a lapis lazuli necklace with beads shaped like flies and tells him that Enlil never discussed the flood with any of the other gods. She swears him that she will <b>never</b> <b>allow</b> Enlil to cause another flood and declares her lapis lazuli necklace a sign of her oath. Ishtar invites all the gods except for Enlil to gather around the offering and enjoy.|$|E
25|$|With Admiral Hugo von Pohl {{becoming}} mortally-ill and Admiral Reinhard Scheer taking {{command of}} the German High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916, the Germans began {{to take a more}} offensive strategy in the North Sea. Hitherto the German fleet had spared the army the burden of coast defence and encouraged the neutrality of the Netherlands and Scandinavia. The British blockade of Germany was causing hunger and the Germans lacked the staying power of the British and Scheer desired to find some means to counter British sea power. The High Seas Fleet could only prevail against the Grand Fleet in exceptional circumstances, which Jellicoe would <b>never</b> <b>allow</b> but Scheer thought that he could make the British war-weary and German raids in the North Sea became more frequent. On 9 February, the Admiralty warned the Grand Fleet that the Germans were stirring and the fleet was ordered south, the cruisers of Harwich Force being ordered to sail for Texel. A few hours later the alert was cancelled but next day, it was discovered that a force of light cruisers and destroyers had sailed westwards from the Jade river.|$|E
25|$|After {{defeating}} Louis, Schmeling {{expected a}} title shot against James J. Braddock, who had unexpectedly defeated Max Baer for the heavyweight title the previous June. Madison Square Garden (MSG) had {{a contract with}} Braddock for the title defense and also sought a Braddock-Schmeling title bout. But Jacobs and Braddock's manager Joe Gould had been planning a Braddock-Louis matchup for months. Schmeling's victory gave Gould tremendous leverage, however; {{if he were to}} offer Schmeling the title chance instead of Louis, there was a very real possibility that Nazi authorities would <b>never</b> <b>allow</b> Louis a shot at the title. Gould's demands were therefore onerous: Jacobs would have to pay 10% of all future boxing promotion profits (including any future profits from Louis's future bouts) for ten years. Braddock and Gould would eventually receive more than $150,000 from this arrangement. Well before the actual fight, Jacobs and Gould publicly announced that their fighters would fight for the heavyweight title on June 22, 1937. Figuring that the New York State Athletic Commission would not sanction the fight in deference to MSG and Schmeling, Jacobs scheduled the fight for Chicago.|$|E
