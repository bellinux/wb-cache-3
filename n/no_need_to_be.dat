This includes sidecar rigs where the car is rigidly mounted on the bike. The three wheeled BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster uses two front wheels which do not lean, and so it steers like a car.|$|E
25|$|Though, again a tough semi-final awaited against {{defending}} {{world champions}} Spain. The victory value was huge: the dreamed Olympic final, guaranteed silver {{and a chance}} at gold, while also providing {{the opportunity to take}} back on the 66–91 shellacking during preparations. Both teams played at their best, with Spain compensating the absence of José Calderón to lead by the first quarter, only for Lithuania to dominate for the following two and having a minimal 74–73 advantage by the fourth. Then rising performances by Rudy Fernandez and Pau Gasol (9 and 7 points respectively) during the concluding quarter along with the Lithuanians' exhaustion and lack of big men input lead the Spanish to barely edge and win the semifinal 91–86. Head coach Ramūnas Butautas said that the team played well and there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disappointed.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match was}} a Texas Tornado match between Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) and The Varsity Club (Mike Rotunda and Kevin Sullivan). In this match, all the {{competitors}} were legal {{and there was}} <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tagged in. Sullivan and Rick started against each other while Rotunda and Scott battled each other. Rotunda dominated Scott and threw {{him out of the}} ring, which allowed Rotunda and Sullivan to double-team Rick. Scott entered the ring and Rick delivered a Belly To Back Suplex to Sullivan. Sullivan tossed Rick on the floor outside the ring. The match continued as Sullivan and Rotunda dominated the match. Rick tried to deliver a Lariat, which he called Steinerline, to Sullivan but Sullivan tossed him out of the ring. Scott was double teamed by Varsity Club. Rotunda came off the ropes to attack Scott but he pulled the rope down causing Rotunda to fall to the floor. In the ring, Sullivan tried to deliver a Shoulderbreaker to Rick but Scott delivered a Diving Crossbody on Sullivan. Both Steiner Brothers fell on Sullivan and pinned him to win the match.|$|E

5000|$|During its stay in {{the second}} division, the club {{experiences}} again the reorganisation of sports politics in the Peoples Republic of Bulgaria {{that took place in}} 1957. According to the changes, clubs <b>no</b> longer <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affiliated <b>to</b> enterprises and instead the emphasis turned back to the territorial principle. Thus, sport clubs <b>no</b> longer <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "DSO" [...] (abbreviation meaning [...] "voluntary sports organisation") inside the principal. Rather, as a club with many supporters in its area, DSO Lokomotiv assimilated the clubs Torpedo Plovdiv (with which it still shared a stadium) and Septemvri (Plovdiv). As the club <b>no</b> longer <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "DSO" [...] it changed its name to [...] "Lokomotiv" [...] Plovdiv.|$|R

500|$|For a long time, it was {{difficult}} to discover many details of Sorabji's life, as he was extraordinarily private. He almost always refused requests for interviews or information, often with sharp messages and warnings not to approach him again. This has led to numerous misunderstandings, such as that he lived in a castle, because he lived in the Dorset village of Corfe Castle. Since he had independent financial means, he felt <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tactful in his dealings with the public, critics and musicians interested in performing his works. [...] "The Eye", Sorabji's home in Corfe Castle, had a sign at the gate stating: [...] "Visitors Unwelcome".|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} {{discusses}} racial classification and {{the root of}} White fear of African Americans, particularly racist concerns by some Whites over the effect of miscegenation. In the song, Chuck D argues {{that they should not}} worry as the original man was black and [...] "white comes from black / <b>No</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confused". The song features a vocal sample of comedian and activist Dick Gregory: [...] "Black man, black woman, black baby / white man, black woman, black baby?". [...] "Pollywanacraka" [...] also concerns interracial relations, including Blacks who leave their communities to marry wealthy Whites, and societal views of the matter: [...] "This system had no wisdom / The devil split us in pairs / and taught us white is good, black is bad / and black and white is still too bad". [...] "Meet the G That Killed Me" [...] features homophobic etiology and condemns homosexuality: [...] "Man to man / I don't know if they can / From what I know / The parts don't fit". Written by hypeman Flavor Flav and Bomb Squad-producers Keith Shocklee and Eric [...] "Vietnam" [...] Sadler, [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] features Flav as the main vocalist and criticizes the inadequacy of 9-1-1, the emergency telephone number used in the United States, and the lack of police response to emergency calls in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the feud between Mercedes and Mitzeee, All About Soap {{columnist}} Laura Morgan {{commented that}} it was shocking that she felt sorry for Mercedes. She explained that even though Mercedes was [...] "a nasty cow" [...] because of the feud she was a [...] "woman teetering {{on the verge of}} a massive meltdown". Upon Mercedes telling Riley she has <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> angry with Silas not sitting trial Morgan said she could tell Mercedes had been [...] "knocked her for six", adding that Mercedes could not [...] "hide anything from us". The journalist added that [...] "Mercedes did what Mercedes does best and decided a randy hook-up [...] was just what she needed to get her mind off Silas. After slapping on the war paint and selecting her sluttiest outfit, minxy Merc headed to a grotty hotel". She went on to explain that [...] "Mercedes knows she’s sinking. She pretty much admitted it when the doc asked her if she hated him and she replied, “I guess I hate myself a little more...” So why doesn’t she get some help before she totally and utterly loses the plot? [...] we’re missing our tart-with-a-heart Mercedes. We want to see her flirting her way around the village again, but without her finger firmly on the self-destruct button..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Africanis Society of Southern Africa aims to {{conserve}} the Africanis as a landrace rather than develop it as a breed. While the Africanis is {{recognized by the}} Kennel Union of South Africa (KUSA) as an emerging breed, researchers on the ground, such as anthropologist Sian Hall, hold that the various different types of indigenous African dogs have already developed, over thousands of years, as types suited to their specific conditions by Africa's own indigenous peoples. They therefore have <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Eurocentrically regarded as an [...] "emerging breed" [...] by European canine institutions. Hall holds that the dogs have already developed as distinct types among the various African groups and that each deserves to be regarded and recognised as such. It follows that one breed descriptions cannot be allocated to the {{many different types of}} indigenous dogs on the African continent.|$|E
