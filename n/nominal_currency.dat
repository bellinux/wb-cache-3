With its acceptance, Sec.11 of the Coinage Act of 1792 established: [...] "That the proportional value of gold to silver in all coins which shall by law be current as money within the United States, shall be as fifteen to one, according to quantity in weight, of pure gold or pure silver;" [...] the proportion had slipped by 1834 to sixteen to one.

50|$|When a daily indexed unit of {{account or}} Daily Consumer Price Index (Daily CPI) or monetized daily indexed {{unit of account}} is used in {{contracts}} or in the Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power accounting model, deferred payments and constant real value non-monetary items are indexed to the general price level {{in terms of a}} Daily Index such that changes in the inflation rate - in the case of monetary items - and the stable measuring unit assumption - in the case of constant real value non-monetary items - have no effect on the real value of these items. Non-indexed units, such as contracts written in <b>nominal</b> <b>currency</b> units and nominal monetary items, incur inflation or deflation risk in the case of monetary items. During all periods of inflation (low, high or hyperinflation), the debtor pays less in real terms than what both the debtor and creditor agreed at the original time of the contract/sale.

Contracts and constant real value non-monetary items accounted in daily indexed units of account, Daily CPI or monetized daily indexed units of account incur no inflation or deflation risk, as the real value of payments and outstanding capital amounts remain constant over time while the nominal values are inflation- or deflation-indexed daily.|$|E

40|$|Nominal {{exchange}} rate changes {{can lead to}} 'expenditure switching' when they change relative international prices. A traditional argument for flexible nominal {{exchange rate}}s posits that when prices are sticky in producers' <b>currencies,</b> <b>nominal</b> exchange rate movements can change relative prices between home and foreign goods. But if prices are fixed ex ante in consumers' <b>currencies,</b> <b>nominal</b> exchange rate flexibility cannot achieve any relative price adjustment. In that case nominal exchange rate fluctuations have the undesirable feature that they lead to deviations from the law of one price.

Here, additional support for this conclusion is provided. We then review some new approaches in the theoretical literature that imply an important expenditure-switching role even when consumer prices are sticky in consumers' currencies. Further empirical research is needed to resolve the quantitative importance of the expenditure-switching role for nominal exchange rates. ...|$|R

Several important conclusions are obtained. First, there is a monotonically increasing relationship between domestic nominal interest rates and the portfolio share of domestic currency denominated assets. This relationship is steep at low levels of government debt, and almost flat at high levels of government debt. Second, optimal foreign currency borrowing is small and negative. Third, a fiscal theory of exchange rate determination is compatible with general equilibrium in a two-country world. This theory is identical in spirit, but not in detail, to the conventional fiscal theory of the price level.

40|$|Following the {{successful}} {{introduction of the}} euro in Western Europe, several regional economic blocs in Africa are planning to launch a common currency as an intermediary step towards the emergence of a single currency for the entire continent. The purpose of this dissertation is to tackle several economic issues related to monetary integration and empirically apply it to the context of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). In the first essay, we estimate trade potentials for southern African countries using the gravity model approach. More specifically, we use the level of infra-regional trade as predicted by the gravity model and compared it with the observed trade in order to assess the trade potentials in the region, as well as the South Africa's trade potentials with its SADC partners. Our results demonstrate that the observed trade flows among SADC countries are largely greater than the ones predicted by the empirical model. We also found that other SADC member countries over-trade with respect to South Africa. However, there are still some unexploited trade potentials for several pairs of SADC countries. The second essay deals with the issue of the choice for the optimal <b>nominal</b> <b>currency</b> anchor to which the national currencies of the region have to be pegged to. Using a panel of 63 countries, we obtained OCA indices à la Bayoumi and Eichengreen for SADC countries vis-à-vis five potential nominal anchor currencies, and we find that the optimal <b>nominal</b> <b>currency</b> anchor for these countries is the US dollar. We also find several pairs of SADC countries which are suitable for a common currency {{on the basis of the}} estimated OCA indices. In the last essay, we empirically assess the expandability of the CMA within the SADC by investigating the convergence of monetary policies of each SADC member to that of South Africa, a proxy for CMA. Empirical tests show evidence of long-run relationship between South Africa and two countries, namely Botswana and Mauritius suggesting that these countries may able to follow the leadership of the South African Reserve Bank. Following the results of the Granger-causality test, the leadership hypothesis in the strict sense is rejected for the case of Mauritius and Botswana. However, the only other country which shows evidence of following the South Africa's leadership in terms of Granger-causality is Malawi. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT...|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} Polish export is very low. The returns on this account per one {{inhabitant}} are about 820 USD, {{whereas in the}} European Union countries they are seven times larger. The decisive influence upon such a serious underdevelopment of the Polish export was exerted by the policy leading to an increase of {{the real value of}} the zloty relative to foreign currencies, supported by the keeping of a very high level of real interest rates. This is clearly confirmed by the presented in the article analysis of the mutual co-dependence of the dynamics of export and the <b>nominal</b> <b>currency</b> rates of exchange in the years 1993 - 2001. A particularly negative influence on the magnitude of export was exerted by the exceptionally high appreciation of the zloty in the years 2000 Ś 2001, which occurred after the full liquidation of the currency rate of exchange. The creation of conditions for the activation of export requires therefore the restoration of a defined band of permissible fluctuations of the rate of exchange, after the transgression of which there would follow the intervention of the National Bank of Poland in order to bring back the value of the zloty to the internal band. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{builds a}} DSGE {{model for a}} small open economy (SOE) in which the central bank {{systematically}} intervenes both the domestic currency bond and the FX markets using two policy rules: a Taylor-type rule and a second rule in which the operational target is the rate of <b>nominal</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation.

The model is calibrated and implemented in Dynare for 1) simple policy rules, 2) optimal simple policy rules, and 3) optimal policy under commitment. Numerical losses are obtained for ad-hoc loss functions for different sets of central bank preferences (styles). The results show that the losses are systematically lower when both policy rules are used simultaneously, and much lower for the usual preferences (in which only inflation and/or output stabilization matter). It is shown that this result is basically due to the central bank's enhanced ability, when it uses the two policy rules, to influence capital flows through the effects of its actions on the endogenous risk premium in the (risk-adjusted) interest parity equation...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} large {{currency}} devaluations on output, {{as measured by}} the real gross domestic product, continues to be an elusive question in the empirical macroeconomic literature. This paper aims at re-examining and providing new empirical evidence on this relationship, by using a sample covering 109 emerging market and developing economies for the period 1960 - 2006. In contrast with the existing empirical literature, we examine not just the impact of large <b>nominal</b> <b>currency</b> devaluations on output growth, as has been customary in the literature, but also provide estimates of how devaluationary episodes affect output trend. By doing so, we find that the devaluation-output relationship is not robust across regions and time, and that the persistence of devaluations matters. In particular, one-time devaluations induce output trend gains at ten year horizons, while successive devaluationary episodes have no impact whatsoever. A policy implication is that poorly executed devaluations induce no long-run output gains. Finally, the role of the external sector in explaining the heterogeneity of the results is examined. We find that real imports rather than exports do most of the adjustment, thus suggesting a strong expenditure-switching effect and, possibly, the emergence of export financing constraints at the time of devaluations. This last aspect highlights the need to avoid a credit crunch at the time of large currency devaluations as it might wipe out all the beneficial gains that devaluations may have on exports and, ultimately, on output...|$|E
