5|$|The {{notion of}} {{temporal}} finitism {{was inspired by}} the doctrine of creation shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the early Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel).|$|E
5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that {{evolution}} supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. He goes on to suggest that evolution gives more support to the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that evolution has led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 18th century, two laws about {{chemical}} reactions emerged without referring to the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> atomic theory. The first was the law of conservation of mass, formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products). The second was the law of definite proportions. First proven by the French chemist Joseph Louis Proust in 1799, this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, then the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1939, Britain {{declared}} war when its ultimatum for Germany {{to withdraw from}} Poland expired. Because the Statute of Westminster {{had not yet been}} ratified by the Australian parliament, any declaration of war by the UK applied to Australia by default. In some other Commonwealth Dominions, such as South Africa and Canada, there were intense parliamentary debates before the declaration of war was accepted. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies asked the British government to notify Germany that Australia was an associate of the United Kingdom. Menzies' support for the war was based on the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> imperial defence system, upon which he believed Australia relied and which would be destroyed if the UK was defeated. This position was generally accepted by the Australian public, although there was little enthusiasm for war.|$|E
5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{among both}} ancient authors and modern scholars about the ethnic {{identity of the}} ancient Macedonians.

Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected hegemon PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.|$|E

5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by locale theory, {{we propose}} “pointfree convex geometry”. We {{introduce}} the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> convexity algebra as a pointfree convexity space. There are two <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point for convexity algebra: {{one is a}} chain-prime meet-complete filter {{and the other is}} a maximal meet-complete filter. In this paper we show the following: (1) the former <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point induces a dual equivalence between the category of “spatial” convexity algebras and the category of “sober” convexity spaces as well as a dual adjunction between the category of convexity algebras and the category of convexity spaces; (2) the latter <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> point induces <b>a</b> dual equivalence between the category of “m-spatial” convexity algebras and the category of “m-sober” convexity spaces. We finally argue that the former <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point is more useful than the latter one from a category theoretic point of view and that the former <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point actually represents a polytope (or generic point) and the latter <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point properly represents a point.
