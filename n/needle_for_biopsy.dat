MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2000 and March 2012, 202 thyroid nodules in 191 patients were diagnosed as medullary thyroid cancer by using sonography-guided fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or surgery. One hundred eighty-three thyroid nodules in 172 patients were included {{on the basis of}} the final diagnosis.

RESULTS: Fine-needle aspiration showed 43. 8 % sensitivity and 85. 1 % positive predictive value for the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer; 25. 7 % (44 / 171) of patients had a delayed diagnosis, while 18. 7 % (32 / 171) underwent an operation for accurate diagnosis, and 20. 5 % (35 / 171) underwent an operation with an incorrect diagnosis.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} retrospectively the clinical procedural performance of CT-guided <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> <b>for</b> retroperitoneal lesions. Materials and Methods: CT-guided needle biopsy was performed in 74 consecutive patients (M:F = 44 : 30; mean age, 59. 7 years) with retroperitoneal lesions between April 1998 and June 2009. The target lesion ranged from 1. 5 to 12. 5 cm in size. The biopsy access path ranged from 3. 5 to 11. 5 cm in depth. A biopsy specimen was obtained using an 18 -gauge core needle under a CT or CT-fluoroscopy guidance and with the patient under local anesthesia. The histopathological diagnoses from the biopsies were obtained. The diagnostic confirmation of the subtype of lymphoma was evaluated. Results: Satisfactory biopsy samples were obtained in 73 (99 %) of 74 patients and a pathological diagnosis was made in 70 (95 %) of 74 patients. Sixty three lesions were malignant (45 lymphomas, nine primary tumors, nine lymph node metastases) and seven were benign. The subtype of lymphoma was specified in 43 (96 %) of 45 patients who were diagnosed with lymphoma. Analysis of the value of CT-guided biopsy in this series indicated 63 true positives, zero false positive, six true negatives and five false negatives. This test had a sensitivity of 93 %, a specificity of 100 % and an accuracy of 93 %.

Aim of the study: This study aimed to compare the diagnostic validity of ANPB under ultrasound guidance (US-ANPB) with that of medical thoracoscopy in patients with pleural effusion. Methods: 30 patients with recurrent exudative pleural effusion of undetermined etiology that have undergone cytologic analysis and could not be diagnosed were included in the study and divided into 2 groups, Group I who underwent medical thoracoscopy for diagnosis (n =  15) and Group II who underwent ultrasound-guided Abrams <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> <b>for</b> diagnosis (n =  15).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The optimal method <b>for</b> liver <b>biopsy</b> in {{patients}} with simultaneous bone marrow and liver impairment {{has not yet been}} established. New approaches (e. g. imaging-guided methods) for this procedure are needed. In spite of coagulopathy, immunosuppression, anemia or ascites, we histologically characterized liver damage in a series of bone marrow transplanted patients using color-Doppler ultrasonography, which permits very keen visualization (and assessment) of hepatic parenchyma and vessels, and a fine <b>needle</b> <b>for</b> percutaneous <b>biopsy.</b> DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed percutaneous liver biopsy using a Menghini-type automatic very fine cutting needle (1. 2 mm, 18 G) under color ultrasound guidance in 16 bone marrow transplanted adult patients consecutively seen in our units from 1998 to 2001. The patients had clinically defined diffuse serious liver damage; liver biopsy was performed between 3 and 10 months after allogeneic (n= 11) or autologous (n= 5) transplantation. RESULTS: Fifteen patients tolerated the procedure well and had no discomfort, while one patient developed intrahepatic hemorrhage. All liver <b>biopsies</b> were suitable <b>for</b> histologic examination and informative, revealing the specific etiology of liver damage: graft-versus-host disease in six patients, drug toxicity in five, hepatitis C virus acute reactivation in two, and in one each vanishing bile duct syndrome, nodular regenerative hyperplasia and hemochromatosis. Biopsy detected potentially injurious concomitant factors, e. g., occult intrahepatic hepatitis B virus infection and reactivation. Histology radically changed the presumptive clinical diagnosis in 10 of the 16 patients and led to successful treatment changes in six. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous biopsy with a small cutting needle under color ultrasound guidance carries a low risk of complications and provides reliable information regarding liver histology in critically ill patients, in the early stage after bone marrow transplantation. We suggest including this imaging-guided mini-invasive procedure to the standard work-up of post-transplant liver damage...|$|R

30|$|Given the {{perceived}} potential for tumor seeding along the <b>needle</b> tract even <b>for</b> SFTs [10, 11], percutaneous biopsy of a potentially malignant lesion is controversial. According to Berger-Richardson’s [12] report that examined seeding after percutaneous <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> <b>for</b> sarcoma, {{in the setting}} of a retroperitoneal sarcoma, a review of pooled data from four large tertiary care referral centers demonstrated a 0.37 % risk of needle tract seeding.

They also concluded that although en bloc excision of the needle tract with the primary tumor is often performed, this practice is not associated with improved oncologic outcomes. Buchs et al.

Certain cases of aggressive angiomyxoma can be treated initially with goserelin acetate (GnRH agonist, Zoladex), some GIST with imatinib, and some desmoids fibromatosis with tamoxifen and sulindac; a reduction {{in the size of the}} lesion or a reduction of the local invasion has been observed.|$|R
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} a {{multifocal}} disease and lesions are not distributed uniformly within the gland.

Recently a statistical cancer atlas of the prostate was constructed providing voxelwise probabilities of cancers in the prostate. Additionally an optimized set of biopsy sites were computed with 94 − 96 % cancer detection accuracy using only 6 - 7 needles. Here we discuss the warping of this atlas to prostate segmented side-fire ultrasound images of the patient. A shape model was used to speed up registration. The model was trained from 38 surfaces of the prostate gland segmented by experts from real patient TRUS images. This training yielded as few as 15 - 20 degrees of freedom that were optimized to warp the atlas surface to the patient’s ultrasound image followed by elastic interpolation of the 3 -D atlas. As a result the atlas is completely mapped to the patient’s prostate anatomy along with optimal predetermined <b>needle</b> locations <b>for</b> <b>biopsy.</b> These do not preclude the use of additional biopsies if desired. A color overlay of the atlas is also displayed on the ultrasound image showing high cancer zones within the prostate.

One feasible approach is to perform OCT within small gauge needles to optically image tissue microstructure.

We have developed and demonstrate an integrated core-needle biopsy system that utilizes catheter-based 3 -D OCT for real-time image-guidance for target tissue localization, imaging of tissue immediately prior to physical biopsy, and subsequent OCT imaging of the <b>biopsied</b> specimen <b>for</b> immediate assessment at the point-of-care. OCT images of biopsied ex vivo tumor specimens acquired during core-needle placement are correlated with corresponding histology, and computational visualization of arbitrary planes within the 3 -D OCT volumes enables feedback on specimen tissue type and biopsy quality. These results demonstrate the potential for using real-time 3 -D OCT <b>for</b> <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> guidance by imaging within the needle and tissue during biopsy procedures...|$|R
