The population of the study was defined as all advisers of <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> in the 241 Indiana public senior high schools during the 1978 - 1979 academic year. The review of related literature and research revealed empirical data regarding the types of organizational structures, activities, and adviser compensation plans were either incomplete or outdated. Most of the literature was found to be subjective. The survey instrument was a 94 item questionnaire developed after reviewing related literature and consulting with a committee of experts. Two hundred-one <b>student</b> <b>council</b> advisers returned completed questionnaires. The following findings were based on analysis of data obtained from 201 questionnaires: 1. Fifty-five percent of the respondents had more than 12 years of teaching experience. 2. Forty-eight percent of the respondents had fewer than 4 years of teaching experience in the senior high schools in which the respondents were employed prior to appointment as <b>student</b> <b>council</b> advisers. 3. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents were considered members of teaching staffs. 4. Student members of 94 percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> were elected by popular vote of the students. 5. Seventy-nine percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> met during the regular school day. 6. Seventy-four percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> met at least once every two weeks. 7. Forty-four percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> were involved in the development of codes of dress and student conduct. 8. Forty-two percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> were involved in the formulation of school policy. 9. Twenty-one percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> were involved in in curriculum development and evaluation. 10. Advisers of 61 percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> reported receiving compensation for serving as <b>student</b> <b>council</b> advisers. 11. Advisers of 32 percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> reported receiving between $ 101 and $ 300 for serving as <b>student</b> <b>council</b> advisers. Advisers of 15 percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> reported receiving $ 100 or less for serving as <b>student</b> <b>council</b> advisers. 12. Advisers of 72 percent of the <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> reported devoting an average of less than 4 hours per week beyond normal school hours to <b>student</b> <b>council</b> responsibilities. The following conclusions, based upon the review of related literature and research and upon data from the study, were developed: 1. The organizational structures of a majority of <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> conformed to criteria established by experts for effective <b>student</b> <b>councils</b> regarding <b>student</b> representation, membership selection, frequency and time of council meetings, and the existence of written documents detailing responsibilities, authority, purposes, and aims of <b>student</b> <b>councils.</b> 2. <b>Student</b> <b>council</b> members were more likely involved in student social activities and student awareness activities than curriculum development or formulation of school policy. 3. <b>Student</b> <b>council</b> members in senior high schools with student populations greater than 2, 000 were more likely to be involved in the formulation of school policy and codes of dress and student conduct than were <b>student</b> <b>council</b> members in senior high schools with student populations of 2, 000 or less. 4. While a majority of <b>student</b> <b>council</b> advisers have 12 or more years of teaching experience, the assignment to serve as <b>student</b> <b>council</b> adviser has been given to teachers with few years of teaching experience in the senior high schools in which the advisers have been employed. 5.
