5|$|<b>Niobium</b> {{and some}} <b>niobium</b> alloys are physiologically inert and hypoallergenic. For this reason, <b>niobium</b> {{is used in}} {{prosthetics}} and implant devices, such as pacemakers. <b>Niobium</b> treated with sodium hydroxide forms a porous layer that aids osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that <b>niobium</b> was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading {{producer}} of <b>niobium</b> and ferroniobium, an alloy of <b>niobium</b> and iron which has a <b>niobium</b> content of 60-70%. <b>Niobium</b> is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of <b>niobium</b> enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium</b> has {{no known}} {{biological}} role. While <b>niobium</b> dust is an eye and skin irritant {{and a potential}} fire hazard, elemental <b>niobium</b> {{on a larger scale}} is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium</b> is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms <b>niobium</b> carbide and <b>niobium</b> nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the <b>niobium</b> content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Other binary {{compounds}} of <b>niobium</b> include <b>niobium</b> nitride (NbN), {{which becomes}} a superconductor at low temperatures {{and is used}} in detectors for infrared light. The main <b>niobium</b> carbide is NbC, an extremely hard, refractory, ceramic material, commercially used in cutting tool bits.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} oxidizers like sodium nitrate {{are added to}} enhance the reaction. The result is {{aluminium}} oxide and ferroniobium, an alloy of iron and <b>niobium</b> used in the steel production. Ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% <b>niobium.</b> Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce <b>niobium.</b> Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of <b>niobium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although <b>niobium</b> {{exhibits}} all of {{the formal}} oxidation states from +5 to −1, the most common compounds have <b>niobium</b> in the +5 state. Characteristically, compounds in oxidation states less than 5+ display Nb–Nb bonding.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{is used in}} alloys with iron, titanium, <b>niobium,</b> tantalum, {{and other}} metals. An alloy used for liquid rocket {{thruster}} nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which consists of 89% <b>niobium,</b> 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium</b> {{becomes a}} {{superconductor}} at cryogenic temperatures. At atmospheric pressure, {{it has the}} highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors at 9.2K.Sn Coated Multicell Accelerating Cavity|first = M.|last = Peiniger|author2=Piel, H. |journal = Nuclear Science|date= 1985|volume= 32|issue = 5|doi = 10.1109/TNS.1985.4334443|pages = 3610–3612|bibcode = 1985ITNS...32.3610P }} <b>Niobium</b> has the greatest magnetic penetration depth of any element. In addition, {{it is one of}} the three elemental Type II superconductors, along with vanadium and technetium. The superconductive properties are strongly dependent on the purity of the <b>niobium</b> metal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium</b> is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below <b>niobium</b> in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make <b>niobium</b> attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|One example {{superalloy}} is Inconel 718, {{consisting of}} roughly 50% nickel, 18.6% chromium, 18.5% iron, 5% <b>niobium,</b> 3.1% molybdenum, 0.9% titanium, and 0.4% aluminium. These superalloys are used, for example, in advanced air frame {{systems for the}} Gemini program. Another <b>niobium</b> alloy {{was used for the}} nozzle of the Apollo Service Module. Because <b>niobium</b> is oxidized at temperatures above 400°C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.|$|E
5|$|Out of 44,500 tonnes of <b>niobium</b> mined in 2006, an {{estimated}} 90% {{was used in}} high-grade structural steel. The second largest application is superalloys. <b>Niobium</b> alloy superconductors and electronic components account for a very small share of the world production.|$|E
5|$|Quantities of <b>niobium</b> {{are used}} in nickel-, cobalt-, and iron-based {{superalloys}} in proportions as great as 6.5% for such applications as jet engine components, gas turbines, rocket subassemblies, turbo charger systems, heat resisting, and combustion equipment. <b>Niobium</b> precipitates a hardening γ-phase within the grain structure of the superalloy.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between columbium (<b>niobium)</b> and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: <b>niobium</b> (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and <b>niobium.</b> The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to <b>niobium</b> or mixtures of <b>niobium</b> and tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Completely {{analogous}} reactions {{occur for}} the <b>niobium</b> component, but the hexafluoride is typically predominant under {{the conditions of}} the extraction.|$|E
5|$|In many ways, <b>Niobium</b> {{is similar}} to {{tantalum}} and zirconium. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures; with fluorine at room temperature; with chlorine and hydrogen at 200°C; and with nitrogen at 400°C, with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200°C. It resists corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids, including aqua regia, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids. <b>Niobium</b> is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium</b> is an {{important}} component of high-performance heterogeneous catalysts for the production of acrylic acid by selective oxidation of propane.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium</b> is used {{in various}} superconducting materials. These superconducting alloys, also {{containing}} titanium and tin, are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners. Other applications of <b>niobium</b> include welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics, and jewelry. In the last two applications, the low toxicity and iridescence produced by anodization are highly desired properties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium,</b> {{formerly}} columbium, is {{a chemical}} element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, {{often found in}} the minerals pyrochlore (the main commercial source for <b>niobium)</b> and columbite. Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.|$|E
5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, {{but some are}} toxic and should be treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and <b>niobium</b> chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of <b>niobium</b> pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum, always {{together}} with the chemically similar <b>niobium,</b> occurs in the minerals tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite).|$|E
5|$|The English chemist Charles Hatchett {{reported}} a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named <b>niobium.</b> In 1864 and 1865, {{a series of}} scientific findings clarified that <b>niobium</b> and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. <b>Niobium</b> was officially adopted as {{the name of the}} element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The arc-tube seals of high {{pressure}} sodium vapor lamps are made from <b>niobium,</b> sometimes alloyed with 1% of zirconium; <b>niobium</b> has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion, matching the sintered alumina arc tube ceramic, a translucent material which resists chemical attack or reduction by the hot liquid sodium and sodium vapour contained inside the operating lamp.|$|E
5|$|These same <b>niobium</b> alloys {{are often}} used in {{pipeline}} construction.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of <b>niobium</b> and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less stable than those of <b>niobium</b> and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Like titanium, tantalum, and aluminium, <b>niobium</b> can be {{heated and}} {{anodized}} ("reactive metal anodization") {{to produce a}} wide array of iridescent colours for jewelry, where its hypoallergenic property is highly desirable.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion battery {{efficiencies}} – Yet-Ming Chiang and {{his group}} at MIT showed a substantial improvement {{in the performance of}} lithium batteries by boosting the material's conductivity by doping it with aluminium, <b>niobium</b> and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements <b>niobium</b> and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and <b>niobium.</b> Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled <b>niobium</b> more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria {{also has}} {{a wide array of}} underexploited mineral {{resources}} which include natural gas, coal, bauxite, tantalite, gold, tin, iron ore, limestone, <b>niobium,</b> lead and zinc. Despite huge deposits of these natural resources, the mining industry in Nigeria is still in its infancy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium</b> {{is used as}} a {{precious}} metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver <b>niobium</b> euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin anodized oxide layer. In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian €25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin, and the 2006 Austrian €25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Niobium</b> {{is used in}} {{arc welding}} rods for some {{stabilized}} grades of stainless steel and in anodes for cathodic protection systems on some water tanks, which are then usually plated with platinum.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{belongs to}} group 9 of the {{periodic}} table, but {{the configuration of}} electrons in the outermost shells is atypical for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements, <b>niobium</b> (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46).|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than <b>niobium</b> it is called tantalite and when there is more <b>niobium</b> than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E
5|$|The nozzle of the Merlin Vacuum {{series of}} engines {{developed}} by SpaceX {{for the upper}} stage of its Falcon 9 rocket is made from a <b>niobium</b> alloy.|$|E
5|$|The {{third largest}} {{producer}} of <b>niobium</b> is the carbonatite-hosted Niobec mine, in Saint-Honoré, near Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada, owned by Magris Resources. It produces between 7% and 10% of the world's supply.|$|E
5|$|For decades, the {{commercial}} technology for separating tantalum from <b>niobium</b> involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, {{a process that}} was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.|$|E
