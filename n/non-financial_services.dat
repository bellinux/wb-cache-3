25|$|One of {{the issues}} arising from {{unsolicited}} phone marketing is the dealing in individuals' personal information, ie. financial institutions selling personal information, balances and transaction information to third parties. However financial services companies, those that offer both banking, insurance, and investment products, say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was caused by smaller financial institutions who simply focused on one type of product or business. The {{reason for this is}} that combining all those products with one company creates a Walmart-style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they have never sold information to <b>non-financial</b> <b>services</b> companies. Some critics of financial institutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.|$|E

The study sample includes <b>non-financial</b> <b>service</b> and industrial companies for the years 1990 - 2006. The banking, insurance, and finance sectors were excluded from the study since they apply certain disclosure requirements. To achieve the objectives of the study, Altman and Kida models were applied on the sample companies in both service and industrial sectors. After the exclusion of companies from the financial sectors 16 companies were eligible for the analyses that have been bankrupt during the period mentioned and compared with 16 successful companies every year of the five years preceding the` incident liquidation. The results of the two models were then compared to recognize which one is most favorable to give an early warning about the possibility of bankruptcy for each of those years. Of the two models Altman's model has an advantage in company bankruptcy prediction, with a 93. 8 % average predictive ability of the five years prior to the liquidation incident, while the average for Kida's model is 69 %. The outcome of the analyses shows that Jordanian listed companies may not be using such models in their financial and credit analyses. Consequently, it is best that they should at least apply one of these models with high credibility for predicting corporate bankruptcy...|$|R

The strategy defines commissioning as âthe process of deciding {{how to use the}} total resources available for children and families in order to improve outcomes in the most efficient, equitable, proportionate and sustainable wayâ (Gillen et al., 2013 : 1). Based on the approach outlined in the strategy, Tusla undertook to develop a three-year commissioning plan (2015 â 18). Among the functions set out for Tusla in legislation, the Act also creates a new framework for accountability for the use of resources; for financial arrangements between the agency and other organisations, including not-for-profit providers; and for <b>non-financial</b> <b>service</b> provision arrangements with other statutory bodies. This drive for an effective resource-allocation orientation takes place {{in the context of a}} national policy orientation towards greater management of constrained resources. In the area of children and family services, the Department of Children and Youth Affairsâ Statement of Strategy 2011 â 2014, acknowledging severe resource constraints, specifies the need for research evidence on effectiveness to inform the review, redesign or curtailment of such programmes and services (DCYA, 2012). The first overarching national policy framework for children and young people in Ireland, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, stipulates that Tusla must introduce the commissioning of services âby moving away from a grants system to outcome-based contracts, and offer support to build capacity within the children and youth sector to respond to the new approachâ (DCYA, 2014 : 69).

The main question is what economic activities make Oregon, and regions within Oregon grow? To find out where Oregon's economic strength and weaknesses lie, first we have to understand the income and employment contributions of different industries in Oregon. Second, decisions for improving Oregon's economic growth may be guided by investment in the production of goods for which Oregon is competitive relative to other goods in domestic and international regions. Third, we can investigate and hypothesize about reasons for strengths and weaknesses of Oregon's industries relative to other industries locally, nationally, and internationally. To provide a guideline for Oregon economic development, this study first classifies Oregon's economic activities into eight major economic sectors: agriculture, lumber and wood, high-tech, other manufacturing, <b>non-financial</b> private <b>services,</b> financial services, other private services, and government services.

In concordance with survey findings, an aggregate model of investment indicates that even during the recent double recession the most important driver of capital accumulation was demand conditions. The user cost of capital had a substantial negative impact in the acute phases of the sovereign debt crisis, but since 2013 its contribution has been positive, thanks to the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy. The constraints on capital accumulation imposed by tight credit supply conditions were particularly severe in 2009 and 2012. Finally, uncertainty provided a sizeable drag on investment growth not only during the global financial crisis but also in the last two years. The significance of these determinants of investment is confirmed also by a disaggregated model for the thirteen manufacturing branches. non-construction investment, uncertainty, credit constraint...|$|R
