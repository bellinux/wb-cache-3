40|$|Phosphorus {{deficiency}} affects around 80 % of {{the acid}} soils of western Kenya, but fertilizer use is limited {{due to high}} prices. This paper explores the potential of local phosphate rocks (PR) as a remedy within the context on an integrated soil fertility management approach. A promising phosphate rock is Minjingu PR (MPR, Tanzania), a sedimentary/biogenic deposit which contains about 13 % total P and 3 % <b>neutral</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> (NAC) soluble P. On-farm trials in P-deficient soils in western Kenya demonstrate MPR to {{be as effective as}} triple superphosphate (TSP, 20 % P) at equal P rates. The benefits are most pronounced with the integration of agroforestry technologies that improve soil fertility. Besides Minjingu PR, Busumbu PR from Uganda (BPR) is potentially another source of P. It is typical of the abundant but unreactive igneous PRs in eastern, central and southern Africa. Agronomic performance of BPR is poorer, though its lower cost and location near to P-deficient areas in western Kenya make it attractive in some situations. The policy implications of these findings are discussed further in the paper...|$|E

40|$|Samples {{from the}} {{weathering}} mantle containing crandallite of three Brazilian phosphate deposits, Tapira, Catalo, and Juqui, were characterized, calcined, and agronomically evaluated. The calcination process increased total phosphorus (P) and <b>neutral</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> soluble (NAC) P contents of all samples. The NAC solubility of original Tapira, Catalo, and Juqui was about 5 % of total P, whereas for calcined samples it was 54, 16, and 53 %, respectively.

The {{results showed that}} the calcined P samples increased dry-matter yield and P uptake with increasing rates of P applied for both crops. Tapira and Juqui were more effective for flooded than for upland rice.

40|$|Optimization {{in the use}} of {{phosphate}} rocks {{is important}} and the residues of fertilizer production in the form of crandallite may be suitable for agronomic use after calcination. With the objective of evaluating the effect of thermal treatment of the aluminous phosphates of the crandallite group as related to solubility, crystalline structure and morphology, samples from the mine residues of three Brazilian phosphate deposits (Tapira-MG, Catalão-GO, and Juquiá-SP) were collected, air-dried, and screened to 100 mesh. Sub samples were thermally treated at 300, 500, 700, and 900 °C for 2 hours. Treated and untreated materials were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and for the total and soluble P contents. The treatment of samples: (i) raised P solubility in <b>neutral</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> solution, (ii) caused the disorganization of the crystalline structure of crandallite at 500 °C and above, and (iii) altered their morphology (cracking and rounding). The increase in P solubility of samples after calcination indicates that the agronomic utilization of these marginal P sources may be of interest since plant growth may be favored due to higher P availability. New studies to evaluate these materials in order to determine their agronomic effectiveness must be carried out to establish adequate conditions that favor their use by plants...|$|E

However, {{there are no}} methods to efficiently and satisfactorily analyze the plant-availability of P in sewage sludge-based P fertilizers except by undertaking time-consuming and complex pot or field experiments. We employed the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique to quantify the plant P availability of various types of P fertilizers with a novel focus on sewage sludge-based P fertilizers. Mixtures of fertilizer and soil were incubated for 3 weeks at 60 % water holding capacity. DGT devices were deployed {{at the beginning of}} the incubation and again after 1, 2, and 3 weeks. Two weeks of incubation were sufficient for the formation of plant-available P in the fertilizer/soil mixtures. In a pot experiment, the DGT technique predicted maize (Zea mays L.) biomass yield and P uptake significantly more accurately than standard chemical extraction tests for P fertilizers (e. g. water, citric acid, and <b>neutral</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate).</b> Therefore, the DGT technique can be recommended as a reliable and robust method to screen the performance of different types of sewage sludge-based P fertilizers for maize cultivation minimizing the need for time-consuming and costly pot or field experiments...|$|E

In {{this study to}} compare the effectiveness of direct application of PRs, two samples of a sedimentary unbeneficiated PR from Lar mine of Yasooj and two samples of concentrated PR of Asfordi igneous PR of Yazd in Iran along with one sample PR of Gafsa (Tunisia) were analyzed for the main nutrients and minerals with XRF and XRD. Calcite and quartz were the main ingredients of Yasooj PR which cause problems for direct application.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{phosphate}} rock acidulation, several impure P compounds may be formed along with the desirable Ca and NH 4 phosphates. Such compounds normally reduce the content of water-soluble P and thus the agronomic effectiveness of commercial fertilizers. In order to study this problem, a greenhouse experiment consisting of three consecutive corn crops was conducted in samples of a Red-Yellow Latosol (Typical Hapludox) in a completely randomized design (6 x 2 x 2), with four replicates. Six commercial fertilizers were added to 2 kg of soil {{at a rate of}} 70 mg kg- 1 P, based on the content of soluble P in <b>neutral</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> plus water (NAC + H 2 O) of the fertilizers. Fertilizer application occurred either in the original form or leached to remove the water-soluble fraction, either by mixing the fertilizer with the whole soil in the pots or with only 1 % of its volume. The corn plants were harvested 40 days after emergence to determine the shoot dry matter and accumulated P. For the first crop and localized application, the elimination of water-soluble P from the original fertilizers resulted in less bioavailable P for the plants. For the second and third crops, the effects of P source, leaching and application methods were not as evident as for the first, suggesting that the tested P sources may have similar efficiencies when considering successive cropping.

The rate of Zn applied to the soil was 5 mg kg- 1, using the sources zinc sulfate, commercial granular zinc, ash and galvanic sludge, ash and two brass slags. Most Zn was extracted from the sources by DTPA, 10 % HCl, NAC, 1 % acetic acid, and 10 % sulfuric acid. Recovery by the extractors 2 % CA, EDTA, water, and hot water was low. The agronomic efficiency index was found to be high when using galvanic sludge (238 %) and commercial granular zinc (142 %) and lower with brass slag I and II (67 and 27 %, respectively). The sources galvanizing ash and brass ash showed solubility lower than 60 % in 2 % CA, despite agronomic efficiency indices of 78 and 125 %, respectively. The low agronomic efficiency index of industrial by-products such as brass slag I and galvanizing ash can be compensated by higher doses, provided there is no restriction, as well as for all other sources, in terms of contaminant levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury as required by law (Normative Instruction No 27 / 2006).

After calcination at 500 degrees C for 4 h, the solubility of Juquia PR and Sapucaia PR in <b>neutral</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> (NAC) significantly increased from almost nil to a maximum of 39. 3 and 114 g P kg(- 1), respectively. X-ray diffraction showed that crystalline crandallite mineral was transformed to an amophorus form after calcination. The solubility behavior of the two calcined PR sources followed the same trend as Gafsa PR, that is, P release decreased with increasing equilibrium pH in the 0. 01 M KCl solution (PH 3. 0 - 8. 0). At PH 3, the solubility followed: Gafsa PR > calcined Sapucaia PR > calcined Juquia PR. No P release was detected from any of the PR sources at pH >= 5. 0 in the solution, indicating the Ca-P characteristic of the Ca-Fe-Al-P mineral controlled P dissolution of the calcined PR. Without calcination, both Juquia PR and Sapucaia PR were totally ineffective for upland rice grown on a Hiwassee clay loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Kanhapludult) with pH 5. 4 whereas a significant P response was observed with the calcined PR samples. For flooded rice grown on Hiwassee soil, the calcined Juquia PR and Sapucaia PR were 66 and 72 %, respectively, as effective as TSP in increasing rice grain yield whereas Gafsa PR was ineffective. For upland rice grown on the unlimed soil, Gafsa PR was as effective as TSP in increasing rice grain yield whereas calcined Juquia PR and Sapucaia PR were 89 and 83 % of TSP. The effectiveness of Gafsa PR was reduced to 0 % after the soil was limed to pH 7. 0 whereas the two calcined PR sources were reduced to 49 % of TSP.

The unit cell a dimensions and the empirical formulae of the rocks were calculated from x-ray diffraction data and statistical models of francolites; the results agreed closely with those published. The concentrations of nontrace metals (Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Sr), and of many trace metals (Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, and Zn) varied considerably in the PR samples. Laboratory studies on the release of P with 19 low-molecular-weight organic acids containing mono-, di-, and tri-carboxylic groups and three mineral acids (HCl, HNO[subscript] 3, and H[subscript] 2 SO[subscript] 4) showed that {{the effectiveness of the}} organic acids to release P is determined by the chemical structure, type and position of the functional group of the ligand, and by the relative stability of the metallo-organic complexes formed. The monocarboxylic acids were less effective than the dicarboxylic, which, in turn, were less effective than the tricarboxylic acid group, with the exception of oxalic acid which was equally effective as sulfuric acid. Analysis of the rocks before and after free carbonate removal showed that more P was released from the low reactive PRs than from the high reactives. Removal of free carbonate from the rocks significantly altered the relationship between P and Ca and Mg released. Laboratory studies on the release of P from PRs added to three Iowa surface soils (Gosport, Clinton, and Grundy soils) with or without organic acids and incubated at 25 °C for 15, 30, and 45 days showed that the percentage of plant-available P (P[subscript] i test) released from the rocks varied considerably and was related to the reactivity of the rocks. Incubation time of 30 days corresponded in many cases to the maximum percentage of P released. A greenhouse study with corn (Zea mays L.) grown for 60 days on three soils treated with six PRs (Kodjari, North Carolina, Gafsa, Tilemsi Valley, Central Florida, or Hahotoe) mixed with or without organic acid (oxalic or citric) showed that application of organic acids to soils did not significantly increase the uptake of native P by plants. Corn response (dry matter and P yields) to addition of oxalic or citric acid varied with P rates and PR sources, suggesting that organic acids have potential as amendments for increasing plant-available P in PRs added to soils...|$|E
40|$|Ten P {{fertilizers}} {{were collected}} (commercial fertilizers) or synthesized (experimental sources) {{in order to}} obtain single superphosphates varying in water and citrate solubility. A standard source of P was also produced by crystallization of the water-soluble fraction of a triple superphosphate. Eleven P sources were band applied to a medium textured Xanthic Hapludox, in Bahia, Brazil (low content of resin-extractable P) at a rate of 80 kg ha- 1 of NAC + H 2 O (<b>neutral</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> plus water) soluble P 2 O 5, with soybean as the crop which was grown to maturity. A check plot (control) was included in the study. Three of the P sources [single superphosphate produced from Araxa phosphate rock (PR), low-grade single superphosphate produced from Lagamar PR and the standard source of P] were also applied at rates to provide 40 and 120 kg ha- 1 of NAC + H 2 O soluble P 2 O 5. Yield of soybean was evaluated by analysis of variance with mean comparison performed utilizing LSD lines, considering the P sources applied at a rate of 80 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5 + control. Regression procedures were used to study the relation between yield of soybean and rates of P 2 O 5. The fertilizers tested performed equally well as a source of P for soybean. The level of water-soluble P did not influence fertilizer performance. Dez fontes de P foram coletadas em unidades revendedoras de fertilizantes comerciais ou produzidas em laboratório de tal forma a obter superfosfatos simples com variabilidade em água e citrato neutro de amônio + água (CNA + H 2 O). Utilizou-se como fonte padrão de fósforo a fração solubilizada, filtrada e cristalizada de um superfosfato triplo. As onze fontes de P foram aplicadas nas linhas de semeadura de soja de um Xanthic Hapludox textura média, localizado no Município de Barreiras, Bahia (baixo teor de fósforo resina) na dose de 80 kg ha- 1 de P 2 O 5 solúvel em CNA + H 2 O. Três das fontes (superfosfatos simples produzido a partir da rocha fosfática de Araxá e Lagamar e a fonte padrão) foram aplicadas também em doses de 40 e 120 kg ha- 1 e uma parcela testemunha, sem P, adicionada ao experimento. A produtividade da soja foi avaliada por meio de análise de variância e comparação de médias, considerando-se as fontes de P aplicadas na dose de 80 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5 + parcela testemunha. Regressões foram utilizadas para estudar a relação entre a produtividade de soja e as doses de P 2 O 5. Os fertilizantes tiveram igual comportamento como fonte de P às plantas de soja. O teor de P 2 O 5 solúvel em água não influenciou o comportamento dos fertilizantes...|$|E
30|$|Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable {{resource}} [1], and currently {{the majority of}} P added as fertiliser in agriculture {{is in the form}} of inorganic fertilisers. From a sustainability point of view, it is sensible to make better use of P resources that are discarded as waste from urban areas; hence, there is a need to improve the recycling of P from agricultural and urban wastes [2]. Recycled fertiliser products are by no means homogenous and the availability of P for plant uptake from recycled fertiliser products may vary considerably, depending on the feedstock of the fertiliser and the subsequent type of processing [3]. Sewage sludge as a fertiliser may contain a range of different P forms depending on the specific process used to recover P from the sewage water, but a precipitation reaction using Al, Fe, Mg or Ca to precipitate P is often employed [3]. Sewage sludge may contain different types of organic contaminants [4]. Although it is still used as a fertiliser in many countries across Europe [5], the use of sewage sludge has declined in a number of European countries, while sewage sludge application on agricultural land was banned in Switzerland in 2008 [6]. A common practice that eliminates the organic contaminants in sludge is to incinerate the sewage sludge, thus producing sewage sludge ash. However, the availability of P in sewage sludge ash is quite low, but is also observed to be variable depending on the type of treatment in the sewage treatment plant [7]. Techniques such as acid leaching and thermal treatment have been investigated for their potential to recover P from sewage sludge ash while separating it from the detrimental heavy metals with varying success [5, 7], but there is also a possibility of combining the upgrading of sewage sludge ash with the recycling of metallurgical slags. Slags from the metallurgical industry had been recycled as fertiliser in Germany in the form of Thomas phosphate for more than 100  years, but this is no longer produced [8]. BOF (basic oxygen furnace) or LD (Linz–Donawitz) slag from steel production may be used as a liming agent in agriculture [8]. It is also possible, however, to use sewage sludge ash as a means to enrich the hot liquid BOF slag with P, resulting in a fertiliser with a markedly higher P availability compared to the feedstock sewage sludge ash, due to a conversion of Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 (whitlockite) of low <b>neutral</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> (nac) solubility into Ca-silico-phosphates with a higher nac solubility [9]. P contained in animal manures can be used more sustainably if it is up-concentrated, and thereby more easily transported from areas with a P surplus to areas where soils have a P deficit [3]. The majority of P (60 – 90  %) found in pig manure is inorganic [10] and only very little {{is in the form of}} phytate [11, 12]. Biomass ash (e.g. wood and straw ash) from bioenergy-plants could also potentially serve as a P fertiliser [13].|$|E

The effects of bath composition and PC plating factors on compositions of Au-Sn deposits, intermetallic phase formation, and plating rates have been investigated. The transition current density for plating the two different gold-tin intermetallics, Au 5 Sn and AuSn, was shifted to lower current densities at lower <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> dosage. In addition, deposits plated from solutions with lower <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> concentrations were denser.
