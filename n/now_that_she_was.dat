25|$|So strong was her {{box office}} appeal by <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{one of four}} finalists {{for the role of}} Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939). The film's producer, David O. Selznick, had briefly romanced Arthur in the late 1920s when they both were with Paramount Pictures. Arthur re-united with {{director}} Frank Capra and Stewart for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), with Arthur cast once again as a working woman, this time one who teaches the naive Mr. Smith the ways of Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|Codreanu {{clashed with}} Cuza over the League's structure: he demanded that it develop a {{paramilitary}} and revolutionary character, while Cuza was {{hostile to the}} idea. In November, while in Văcărești prison in Bucharest, Codreanu had planned {{for the creation of}} a youth organization within the League, which he aimed to call The Legion of the Archangel Michael. This was said to be in honor of an Orthodox icon that adorned the walls of the prison church, or, more specifically, linked to Codreanu's reported claim of having been visited by the Archangel himself. A more personal problem also divided Codreanu and Cuza, namely that Cuza's son had an affair with Codreanu's sister that left her pregnant. The couple had broken up with the younger Cuza refused his girlfriend's demand that he marry her <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> bearing his child. Though the scandal was hushed up, the fact that his sister was having an illegitimate child was deeply humiliating for Codreanu as he liked to present his family as model members of the Orthodox church and he sought unsuccessfully to have Cuza pressure his son to marry his sister.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Charlotte's flight and return was soon {{the talk of}} the town; Henry Brougham, a former MP and future Whig Lord Chancellor, {{reported}} [...] "All are against the Prince", and the Opposition press made much of the tale of the runaway Princess. [...] Despite an emotional reconciliation with his daughter, the Prince Regent soon had her conveyed to Cranbourne Lodge, where her attendants were under orders never to let her out of their sight. [...] She was able to smuggle a note out to her favourite uncle, Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex. [...] The Duke responded by questioning the Tory Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, in the House of Lords. He asked whether Charlotte was free to come and go, whether she was allowed to go to the seaside as doctors had recommended for her in the past, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> eighteen, whether the government planned to give her a separate establishment. [...] Liverpool evaded the questions, and the Duke was summoned to Carlton House and castigated by the Prince Regent, who never spoke with his brother again.|$|E

2500|$|... "A Short Trip Home", Saturday Evening Post, January 17, 1927. [...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E
60|$|She kept {{regarding}} him steadily {{with very}} blue eyes, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> relieved of driving.|$|E
60|$|And thus {{early in}} the evening Caroline {{contrived}} to be alone; and then {{for the first time she}} attempted to realize all that had come upon her. Hitherto she had had to support herself--herself and her goddess-ship,--first before George Bertram, and then with lighter effort before her aunt. But <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> alone, she could descend to humanity. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> alone she had so to descend.|$|E

6000|$|... "Going to lose her?" [...] exclaimed Tarzan. [...] "Why, {{what do you}} mean? Oh, yes, I understand. You mean <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{married and}} living in England, you will seldom if ever see her." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{starts with}} she calls [...] "set fair," [...] and feeling <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{something}} like a Providence, composes herself for a doze. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> startled out of her sleep by {{the return of the}} Wandering Spirit.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes--it was beautiful. Well," [...] Kate, {{to defer}} to him still, further remarked, [...] "it's not news to us <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> stupendous. Anything's possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let us {{hear all}} about it, Bob," [...] her husband said. [...] "I could see Carrie was on thorns, lest {{you were going}} off again. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> satisfied, <b>she</b> may <b>be</b> able to listen to you, comfortably." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a fraud; no more divine {{than you}} or I. More I {{am willing to}} concede--that the First Born are no holier than the Holy Therns, nor the Holy Therns more holy than the red men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{at least}} I {{will do as}} much," [...] Andrew answered. [...] "I am her oldest friend, and I have claims upon her which you never could have. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in this terrible trouble my place is by her side. I----" ...|$|R

60|$|Moving slowly forward--stopping--moving onward again--hesitating again--the {{woman at}} last approached. There was light enough left {{to reveal her}} face, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> near. It was the face of Sydney Westerfield.|$|E
60|$|Manston {{was very}} {{friendly}} that evening. It was evident to her, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> behind the scenes, {{that he was}} making desperate efforts to disguise the real state of his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, Razafil--not lost!" [...] said Ravonino, in a {{quiet but}} firm tone, for he saw the gleam {{increasing}} in the poor father's eyes. [...] "Did you not say just <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> singing with joy unspeakable the praises of His name?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I do not {{see that}} I should be betraying any {{confidence}} now," [...] he said. [...] "The promise I gave was only binding for a short time, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> to be seen openly with the Duchess de Montegarde, I suppose the embargo is removed.

6000|$|... "I'd {{like some}} breakfast, Hank," [...] remarked the girl, feeling more cheerful <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> on dry land; [...] "but we can't eat the flowers, {{although}} they do smell mighty good." ...|$|E
60|$|To her amazement {{he stepped}} aside--a most unaccountable action for him. More unaccountable still, {{she did not}} move, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> free, but stood poised for flight, held by she knew not what.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he answered, {{becoming}} angry <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> safe indoors, and not alarmed. 'And a nice game I've {{found you}} out in to-night. You are in man's clothes, and I am ashamed of you!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What does {{it matter}} about her <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> harmless?" [...] Poomba said scornfully.

2500|$|Ullman {{commented that}} the United States is [...] "now able to laugh at itself more," [...] {{embracing}} more satiric humour rather than deeming it [...] "unpatriotic."

60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{faced by}} the direct question, Jessy hesitated. As a rule, she was subtle, but she could be ruthlessly frank, and she was possessed by a passionate hatred of the girl beside her.|$|E
60|$|She darted swiftly past him, {{seizing the}} door and drawing it closed after her. A lantern hung on the central post and flung its rays upon his face. Her own, mercifully, was in the shadow, and burning now with a shame that was insupportable. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> there, beside him, her {{strength}} failed her, and her courage--courage {{that she had been}} storing for this dread undertaking throughout the whole of that dreadful day. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> there, she would have given her life {{to have been able to}} retrace her steps, to lose herself in the wild, dark places of the mountain.|$|E
60|$|Over {{the cool}} dining-room, with its faint scent of pinks, of melon, and of ham, came silence. Suddenly Cecilia glided from the room. Her light {{footsteps}} were heard hurrying, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not visible, up to Thyme.|$|E
6000|$|... (Struggling {{to control}} himself <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> no longer looking at him.) No; I {{ask you to}} dash it from yourself. I am not too strong. You must help me. You must call your child to your aid in helping me. I could go mad for you now-- ...|$|R
50|$|Recently, Kendra has {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had enhanced healing, strength,vision and limited hover abilities when not wearing Nth metal. <b>She</b> speculates <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> {{due to her}} prolonged exposure to the substance.
