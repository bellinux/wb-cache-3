5|$|On August 10, 2005, ABC aired {{a two-hour}} special, Peter Jennings: Reporter, with archival clips of his reports and {{interviews}} with colleagues and friends. The special drew more than nine million viewers, and was the most watched television program of the <b>night.</b> <b>For</b> the week of his death, World News Tonight placed {{number one in the}} ratings race {{for the first time since}} June 2004.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} <b>night,</b> <b>for</b> over three hours {{about a hundred}} people held a {{demonstration}} at Sheridan Square in Manhattan, to protest the verdict. About 20 officers observed the protest, which began at 8 pm, but no arrests were made. A candlelight vigil was planned for two days later, sponsored by the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights and the National Gay Task Force.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with his}} {{colleague}} Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations {{three times a}} <b>night</b> <b>for</b> a continuum of five years. The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved {{into a state of}} considerable error. Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements. Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a <b>night</b> <b>for</b> what should have been five successive years. The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate. They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs. When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors. Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions. Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{directed}} two further {{films for}} South Pacific, Anggrek Bulan and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949). Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with Sedap Malam (Sweetness of the <b>Night),</b> <b>for</b> Djamaluddin Malik's company Persari. Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s. SPFC made another six films before shutting {{down at the}} end of the Indonesian National Revolution in 1949. A 35mm copy of Djaoeh Dimata is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at <b>night.</b> <b>For</b> nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E

She eventually consents, and finally finds {{in the film}} an insightful view into historical Human-Vulcan relations. Meanwhile, Mayweather makes his intended modifications without permission, resulting in a confrontation when Paul finds out. The ship comes under further attack from an alien vessel, and Paul offers up the cargo as planned. The aliens refuse and demand the vessel as well. Left without any other option, Paul tells Mayweather to re-initiate the modifications, and to detach the command module from the cargo section. They soon disable the alien ship. The brothers reconcile, and Mayweather leaves, promising to visit again soon.|$|E
5|$|Debs {{attended}} public school, {{dropping out}} of high school at age 14. He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day. He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work, Debs was pressed into service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a dollar a <b>night</b> <b>for</b> the next three and half years.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at <b>night</b> <b>for</b> fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E

Of that, $14.8million is granted from the National Park Service, and $13.5million from various sources including CERP, donations, and other grants. The entry fee for vehicles in 2006 ranged from $10 to $200 for bus tours. Of the nearly one million visitors to Everglades National Park in 2006, more than 38,000 were overnight campers, paying $16 a night or $10 a <b>night</b> <b>for</b> backcountry permits. Visitors spent $2.6 million within the park and $48million in local economies. More than 900jobs were sustained or created within or by the park, and the park added value of $35million to local economies.|$|E
5|$|Like other rails, the Crex {{species have}} {{a wide range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call consisting of a series of grating notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at <b>night</b> <b>for</b> the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3am.|$|E

5|$|Other {{offering}} rituals {{took place}} at noon and at sunset, though the sanctuary was not reopened. Some ceremonies other than offerings also took place daily, including rituals specific to a particular god. In {{the cult of the}} sun god Ra, for instance, hymns were sung day and <b>night</b> <b>for</b> every hour of the god's journey across the sky. Many of the ceremonies acted out in ritual the battle against of the forces of chaos. They might, for instance, involve the destruction of models of inimical gods like Apep or Set, acts that were believed to have a real effect through the principle of heka.|$|E
5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at <b>night</b> <b>for</b> their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E
5|$|The miniseries {{was highly}} {{successful}} for CBS, as 19.4 million viewers {{tuned in to}} {{the first part of}} the film and made it the channel's best-rated Sunday night movie in over two years.

5|$|When Lowe {{arrived at}} Singapore Changi Airport {{on the morning}} of 8 March, he was accosted by Martin (under the assumed name of Simon Davis), who struck up a {{conversation}} with him and suggested that they share a room, to which Lowe agreed. They managed to book Room 1511 in the River View Hotel off Havelock Road. The next morning, Martin asked a hotel receptionist to delete Lowe's name from the room registration system, saying that he had kicked Lowe out the previous <b>night</b> <b>for</b> being a homosexual. Martin checked out on 11 March and flew to Bangkok the same day.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that <b>night,</b> <b>for</b> the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E
