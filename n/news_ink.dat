40|$|A {{major problem}} in the {{printing}} of newsprint by flexography with water-based inks is the filling-in of halftones. Drying of the ink and rewettability, {{the ability of the}} fresh ink to wet the dried ink, appear to be primary in the understanding of the filling-in problems. Quantification and qualification of critical factors are essential in resolving this problem. In this study black water based flexographic <b>news</b> <b>inks</b> from different manufacturers were compared in terms of their drying and rewettability characteristics. The change in weight with time and contact angle measurements are the response parameters considered. Proper care has been exercised to maintain constancy of parameters while conducting the experiments. Four samples of black ink were analyzed in this study. The critical balance-weight differential-gravimetric method was adopted to determine the drying rates and the sessile drop method was used for finding the contact angle. This study has yielded information which will enable {{a better understanding of the}} drying properties of the inks. More important, the contact angle will serve as the determinant of the fresh ink 2 ̆ 7 s ability to wet the dry ink...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{both from}} audiences and critics. Film critics often noted the technical {{quality of the}} film even as an amateur, low-budget film. Critic Robert Abele (Los Angeles Times) said [...] "there's a rapacious DIY showmanship at work here reminiscent of the calling-card chutzpah Robert Rodriguez and Peter Jackson showed in scrappier, pre-blockbuster days." [...] Luke Y. Thompson of LA Weekly ranked the film positively and remarked, “Ink has all the ambition of a Terry Gilliam or Jean-Pierre Jeunet epic, but since none of the studios bit, the writer-director decided to make it himself with next-to-no money, a bold gambit a viewer can respect even while wishing the final project were remotely as grandiose as the auteur’s aspirations.” [...] Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post also offered the film a positive review. The film currently holds a critical score of 100% on the movie review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on six reviews, with an average rating of 7.6 out of 10. The film achieved a sort of cult status with audiences. Due to good word of mouth among audiences, the film was frequently viewed many times upon its release. According to TorrentFreak, a file sharing <b>news</b> site, <b>Ink</b> was downloaded via BitTorrent 400,000 times in a single week, which exposed the film to a large audience and led to higher DVD and Blu-ray sales in return.|$|R
40|$|A {{brief history}} of solventless ink systems {{introduces}} this review. factors {{that have led to}} the current usage of ultraviolet curing systems in web and sheetfed offset printing are presented. A survey of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these ink systems is made with relation to this segment of the printing industry. economics as motives for using solventless inks me discussed. Finally, the estimated $ 4, 000, 000 The roles of energy, pollution regulations, and market for 1975 is broken donz by end-use applications. No one can argue that the concept of a solventless ink system is not timely; and it is certainly not new. In fact, it has its roots in the traditional mechanisms associated with the method by which a printed ink film is imnobil ized. These methods are: 1) Oxidation (chemical), 2) Penetration, 3) Solvent evaporation, and 4) Moisture setting (precipitation). There is no doubt then that a <b>news</b> <b>ink</b> is a solventless system since, it is a dispersion in essentially nonvolatile 1 iquid carriers that set by absorption into the pulpy news stocks, which function like a blotter. In the same sense, many traditional sheetfed inks are also solventless systems, being dispersions in nonvolatile oleoresinous vehicles. These cure in time by oxidation. Today most people feel that solventless inks were developed to rep conventional heat-drying offset inks. High-speed,web offset has been 0 the largest growing segments of the converting industry since the 196 At about this same time, concerns for the environment with regard to pollution were growing with equal vigor.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{thought that the}} water pick-up rate and {{capacity}} of an ink may have a profound affect on the press performance of an ink. As the water content of ink changes so do the Theological characteristics of the ink and this effects ink performance attributes such as ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. An emulsification curve can {{shed some light on}} how ink might perform on a press but this alone is not enough. The objective of this thesis research was to study the interaction of fountain solution and ink as used in the printing of newspapers, in terms of ink water pick-up rates and capacity. Further, this is a study of the effect of the fountain solution and ink interaction on ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. In this study, three different black news inks and three different fountain solutions have been used to make a total of nine different ink and fountain solution combinations. One set was a specific black <b>news</b> <b>ink</b> and fountain solution combination, Flint Low Rub Black and Anchor Neutral Fountain Solution, used in the printing of USA Today at Boston Offset in Norwood, MA. The paper, a 30 # newsprint, was the only newsprint used throughout the testing. Water pick up rates have been determined and emulsification curves have been developed {{with the use of a}} Duke Tester for all nine ink and fountain solution combinations. The effect of these water pick-up rates on the rheological characteristics has been studied with the use of a Brookfield Rotational Viscometer. With the use of a motorized Little Joe printability tester, ink was laid down on the newsprint at a constant volume and any changes in ink strength were measured with a densitometer. Rub resistance was examined with a Rub Tester and a densitometer. The experimental data from this study show a direct correlation between the water pick-up capacity of an ink and the affect this has on the ink rheology and ink performance. The tests and data revealed that each ink had a tendency to pick-up more of the alkaline fountain solution than the neutral solution. The least was picked up with the acid fountain solution. The more fountain solution the inks picked up, the greater the changes in viscosity, strength, dryback and rub-off. With the low-rub premium and the dense black, the viscosity rose higher as the ink picked-up more fountain solution. The soy low-rub ink reacted differently. The soy ink had an initial drop in viscosity then, as the ink began to pick up more fountain solution, the viscosity seemed to stabilize. The more fountain solution the ink picked-up the weaker the strength became. At the same time, the more fountain solution that was picked-up, the less density was lost due to dryback and rub-off...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{newspapers}} have been compelled {{to introduce a}} lot more process color to their pages. This coincides {{with the introduction of}} USA Today, but also with the fact that all forms of media, including television and magazines, have become significantly more colorful. There is considerable market pressure on newspapers to be colorful, as well. Continued audience interest and advertising dollars are at stake. This is not a trivial issue. At the same time, newspapers are being admonished to make sure that, if they do introduce color to their pages, then it should be of high quality. Low quality color is worse than no color at all. During most of this period, traditional, high end scanners comprised the only reasonable option available to address the task of generating color separation films. In recent years, with the improvement of microcomputer based technology, desktop scanning systems have become an option. The quality of the output of these systems has been suspect, however. On the other hand, it is generally acknowledged that these systems are improving. Of all the forms of lithographic printing, newspaper printing (coldset offset lithography on newsprint) is least {{able to take advantage of}} all the data that the upstream processes, particularly the color separation process, can provide. It represents the lowest level of reproduction fidelity. It has a shorter density range, requires a lower screening frequency, and is restricted to a more limited color gamut, for example, than the other forms of lithographic printing. This is due primarily to the substrate, newsprint, but also in part to <b>news</b> <b>inks.</b> Is it possible that today 2 ̆ 7 s desktop scanners now provide output whose quality level is sufficient for this printing process? Would readers show no preference for reproductions made from separations generated by these systems over those made from separations generated by high end scanning systems? That is the fundamental question addressed in this thesis. A common set of transparencies were separated through a high end system and a desktop system. Care was taken to prevent either system from being disadvantaged through parameter settings. The separations from both systems were stripped into a common test form, and printed on an offset newspaper press. Judges evaluated the pairs of images in a paired comparison test, indicating a preference for the high end generated image or the desktop generated image. The results indicate that readers do indeed continue to show a clear preference for images generated on a high end scanner. The reader is requested to take note of two caveats. First, this test represents a comparison of two scanning systems, not two families of scanners. The author found the two best scanners from each family that were available to him at the time of the test. The reader applies the findings of this test to the families of scanners that these two scanners represent at his or her own peril. Second, the reader is admonished to recognize that these are times of rapidly changing technology. The results of an experiment such as this could change as the technology advances...|$|R
40|$|The Secret Flower Language, Women and Expression In {{the romantic}} {{minds of the}} Victorian’s with their {{interest}} in medieval chivalry and sentimental symbolism, an obligation to social etiquette caused extreme censorship of what was considered appropriate conversation. This combination created a society that utilized and applied symbolic meanings of objects to express what otherwise could not be spoken. The Victorians followed upon the interest in botany and the natural world developed by the educated and leisure classes of England in the mid- 18 th century. They continued this interest, which developed into a fascination with the study of horticulture, botany and gardening. The increased importation of exotic plants and flowers along with {{a renewed interest in}} 16 th century herbals created an overall appreciation for flowers in society, which additionally became a common subject in Victorian artwork. Beginning in the 18 th century, rumors spread across Europe of a secret flower language being practiced in Turkey. This is largely a result of the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who, while writing home to England from the Turkish Embassy, discussed “a mysterious language of love and gallantry”. In a letter to a friend, she described the use of objects to communicate, calling it a “Turkish love letter”. She wrote of this language: “There is no colour, no flower, no weed, no fruit, herb, pebble, or feather that has not a verse belonging to it: and you may quarrel, reproach, or send letters of passion, friendship, or civility, or even of <b>news,</b> without ever <b>inking</b> your fingers”. Over the course of the century, the rumors became interest, and then practice. Until, by the early 19 th century, the development of a formalized Language of Flowers had occurred. This took the form of a dictionary of symbolic meanings assigned to individual flowers, which thus became generally known to society as a method of silent communication...|$|R
