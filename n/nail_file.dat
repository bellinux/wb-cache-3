Newsman Jack Cafferty noted that airport security personnel demonstrated poor judgment in not recognizing the Medal of Honor and in demanding to confiscate and destroy the medal and related memorabilia.

25|$|Kim meets Silas {{once again}} in the {{hospital}} while it is temporarily shut down. Silas and Lindsey put their plan into action and break into the Roscoe home but Mercedes is not there. Angered by this failure, Silas disowns Lindsey and tells her he will go after Mercedes alone. However, Lindsey's waters break and she goes into labour. Alarmed, Silas bundles her into the Roscoe garage, steals Joe's phone and abandons her. Later that day, Mercedes answers the door to find Silas. Meanwhile, Lindsey has managed to summon Kim for help and gives birth to a baby girl at the hospital with the reluctant help of Tegan and Celine McQueen (Sarah George). When Joe and Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) arrive at the hospital to find Lindsey with the baby, they try to call the police, but Lindsey warns them not to as Mercedes is in danger. Silas plays a game of chess with Mercedes, while blaming her for Riley's death. Mercedes angrily demands where Silas was when Riley died and throws him into a rage when she reminds him of his part in Heidi's death. He tells her that she is to be his final victim and he will not be cheated this time as he was with Lynsey and Texas. Silas allows Mercedes to take JJ to bed, but she secretly hides a <b>nail</b> <b>file</b> in her pocket. When Silas guides her downstairs, Mercedes attempts to stab him with the <b>nail</b> <b>file,</b> but Silas easily deflects it. Lindsey then gives the order for Silas to kill Mercedes, but Mercedes criticises him for taking orders from a woman, especially one who cheated on Joe with Freddie. When Silas criticises Mercedes' stillborn son, Gabriel, Mercedes asks him to kill her so she can be with him. Silas is touched by this and noting that Mercedes has made significant effort to mend her ways over the years, he decides to spare her life. When Lindsey shows up at the Roscoe home, having managed to escape from the hospital with her baby, Silas feigns concern and asks to hold her baby. Silas then gives Mercedes the baby and asks her to ensure that the child grows up as pure and innocent as she is now. Silas then turns on Lindsey for cheating on the Roscoe brothers. Joe, Kim and Freddie arrive to find Lindsey's corpse on the couch. Silas is last seen looking on as a hysterical Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is led out of The Loft by Tegan and Celine. He then leaves the village, smirking.|$|E
50|$|Glass <b>nail</b> <b>files</b> {{are more}} {{recently}} available. Since glass <b>nail</b> <b>files</b> have a smoother and more even surface {{they do not}} splinter the nail like emery boards or metal <b>nail</b> <b>files.</b> This makes them a preferred instrument by manicurists, although they are sometimes difficult to find in stores. Glass <b>nail</b> <b>files</b> come in very different qualities, some of them solid glass, others merely glass covered with an abrasive surface.|$|R
50|$|Types {{and sizes}} {{of a glass}} nail file: Glass <b>nail</b> <b>files</b> of the big sizes are used, as a rule, for a pedicure. There are also {{produced}} the special glass <b>nail</b> <b>files</b> for daily use, for example, by masters in beauty salons.Such <b>nail</b> <b>files</b> have only one working side, {{so as not to}} injure the manicure masters' fingers skin.|$|R
50|$|Emery {{boards are}} {{generally}} less abrasive than the metal <b>nail</b> <b>files,</b> and hence, emery boards may {{take longer to}} <b>file</b> down <b>nails</b> than metal <b>nail</b> <b>files.</b> However, <b>nail</b> <b>files</b> {{may play a role}} in disease transmission if they are used on more than one person without adequate sterilization. Emery boards are usually less expensive than metal <b>nail</b> <b>files,</b> therefore emery boards can be economically disposed of after use on a single person.The nail can be smoothed and shaped accurately by taking light, even strokes in one direction across the top of the nail. Twenty to thirty easy strokes can typically shorten excessively long fingernails, while five to ten strokes are sufficient for shaping the nails.|$|R
500|$|In July 1969, Martello {{attended}} an open {{meeting of the}} Mattachine Society's New York branch. He was appalled at the Society's negative reaction to the Stonewall riots, and castigated those gay {{people in the audience}} who accepted the categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness, accusing them of being self-loathing. He proceeded to publish his thoughts in an essay in which he stated that [...] "homosexuality is not a problem in itself. The problem is society's attitude towards it." [...] Those gay rights activists who rejected the Mattachine Society's approach and who favored a confrontational stance against the police and authorities founded the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), with Martello elected the group's first moderator. Martello supported the GLF's stance that condemned [...] "this rotten, dirty, vile, fucked-up capitalist conspiracy" [...] that dominated American society, and he volunteered by producing articles both for the group's newsletter Come Out! and for the wider press. He was involved in the GLF's campaign against The Village Voices decision to ban the word [...] "gay" [...] from advertisements; the magazine preferred the term [...] "homophile", which had also been used by the Mattachine Society. Wanting to break from previous gay liberation organizations, the GLF embraced the term [...] "gay", with Martello dismissing [...] "homophile" [...] as sounding like a <b>nail</b> <b>file</b> for homosexuals.|$|E
