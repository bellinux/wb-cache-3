Paulet effected repairs to both ships and gave temporary command of Gloire to Lieutenant John Talbot, who was subsequently promoted.

Australia batted in both innings with only nine men {{because of injuries}} sustained by Bradman and Jack Fingleton during Hutton's 13-hour marathon effort. They collapsed to the heaviest defeat in Test history, by an innings and 579 runs. It was Australia's last Test before World War II and they had <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> a Test since then.|$|E

5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, <b>not</b> <b>lost,</b> as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|By 1908, Piemonte {{had been}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet, which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats. In August that year, Piemonte participated in the annual summer maneuvers of the Italian fleet. She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, {{and the fact that}} the relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies was <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> on analysts in Vienna. The Maneuvers concluded with a fleet review on 18 October. Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.|$|E
5|$|During the 1998 season, Burns {{recorded}} similar batting averages to {{the previous}} season, but was rarely used as a bowler. Wisden noted that he played some good first-class innings, but needed to be more consistent; an improvement he made in 1999. That following year, Burns achieved a batting average in excess of thirty for the first time, and scored the maiden century of his first-class career. Facing Leicestershire, who had <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> in the County Championship for 21 months, Burns scored 109, and shared a 244-run partnership with Peter Bowler to help Somerset to victory by 9 wickets. His second century that season came in a defeat to Worcestershire; chasing 316 runs {{to win in the}} fourth innings, Somerset were reduced to 56 for three. Burns played an attacking innings, hitting 105 runs from 103 deliveries to give his side a chance of victory, but Worcestershire eventually won by 26 runs.|$|E
