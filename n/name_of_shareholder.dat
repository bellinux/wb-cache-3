40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} {{empirical}} qualitative research with Finance Directors and Investor Relations managers {{to examine the}} disciplinary consequences of their meetings with institutional investors. These private meetings have increased both in frequency and importance in the last decade, but, when compared to public disclosure, they are relatively under researched. Existing studies have focussed on {{the role that the}} meetings play either in the market for information, or as a mechanism for corporate governance. By contrast, in this paper we draw upon Foucault s analysis of power/knowledge to explore how the meetings shape executive subjectivity. The meetings take place {{in the context of a}} proliferation of techniques through which corporate performance is disclosed, modelled, compared and ranked. Such visibility makes possible processes of executive subjection which the paper traces firstly in the anticipatory self-discipline of executive s extensive rehearsals for the meetings, and secondly in the rituals of face-to-face scrutiny of the meetings themselves where the body of the executive is understood to represent the company. The paper then explores the ways in which subjection to investors enables executives to speak on behalf of the investor within the business and effect its restructuring in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> value. We suggest that these neglected disciplinary effects of company/fund manager meetings have been all too potent in recent years...|$|E
40|$|In {{the debate}} on {{globalisation}} of the financial markets {{and its effect on}} corporate governance it is often claimed that the pressure for higher rates of return exerted by institutional investors in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> value, has led to a fundamental change of company policy among listed companies. Due to short-term profit orientation and increased dividend pay-outs to investors, the critiques argue, long-term development of the innovation potential of these companies will suffer, and this ultimately will have negative consequences on employment and growth. Since in the 1990 s almost all major German companies listed on the stock exchange have declared their commitment to the principles of shareholder value. Hitherto there is little empirical evidence of the consequences of such an orientation on company-internal structures and processes. The present case study on the Volkswagen AG helps to close this gap. Central questions in this study are the following: To what extent have the distinct characteristics of Volkswagen’s corporate governance systems changes in response to shareholder value demands? What {{is the role of the}} stock market for the company? Have the incentive systems and the systems of target setting and controlling changed to better correspond with shareholder expectations, and what are the effects on investment/disinvestments decisions and thus on the long-term innovation potential of the firm? And finally, what are the effects on the economic and the financial performance of the company? Zusammenfassun...|$|E

50|$|The law {{regulates the}} {{disclosure}} of ownership information for media organisations regularly registered as companies is the Company Register Act adopted in 2006 and in force since January 2008. As not all media are registered companies, {{as a matter of}} fact this law does not cover all media outlets operating in Bulgaria. For the media companies covered by the scope of this law, information have to be made to the Company Register, which is a public register. Information to be disclosed under this law includes: <b>names</b> <b>of</b> directors, <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> (comprising beneficial shareholders through brokerage), members of management and supervisory boards, size of shareholdings, management details, the outcome of the company decision-making process, financial reports, constitutive acts, etc. Information on those with indirect control is also made public. This information is recorded electronically and available to the public online via the company register website maintained by the Registry Agency.

5000|$|Over {{the past}} decade, in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> maximizing <b>shareholder</b> value, this financialized behavior, {{manifested}} by enormous stock buybacks and outsized executive pay, has become endemic to the U.S. economy. In an article, “Innovative Business Models and Varieties of Capitalism: Financialization of the U.S. Corporation,” that compares the United States and Japan, Lazonick {{shows how the}} persistence in the 1990s and 2000s of the Japanese institutions of stable shareholding, permanent employment, and main-bank lending, even in diminished form, imparted employment stability and income equity to the Japanese economy. [...] Although, in the United States, the New Economy business model has enabled rapid product development based on the technologies of the Internet revolution, Lazonick argues that financialization of the New Economy business model has undermined the innovative capability of U.S. industrial enterprises while contributing to employment instability and income inequity in the U.S. economy.|$|R

Despite its relative recency (in the Czech law effective since 2005), the institute of squeeze- out has become notorious for lack of legislative quality, vast exploitation possibilities at the hands <b>of</b> the majority <b>shareholder</b> and for low respect paid to interests <b>of</b> small <b>shareholders.</b> Probably nobody would doubt an economical impact of the squeeze-out itself, but the Czech version evokes them. These doubts might be particularly seen in difficulties dealing with judicial review {{of the amount of}} compensation paid for the squeezed shares and subjectivity of the experts' estimation of shares value. In my thesis, I have focused primarily on the disputable aspects of the squeeze-out, tried to perform a critical view and introduce solutions (in terms of de lege ferenda) for {{some of the problems that}} might be found in the context of this institute, particularly the topic <b>of</b> the Main <b>shareholder,</b> Monetary compensation and chosen decision of the Czech High Court.

5000|$|Bearer shares - Are a legal {{instrument}} denoting company ownership, {{and are usually}} {{in the form of}} share warrants. A share warrant is a document which states that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares stated in it. If authorised by its articles, a company may convert any fully paid shares to [...] "share warrants". These warrants are easily transferable without any need for a transfer document; that is, they can simply be passed from hand to hand. When share warrants are issued, the company must strike out the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shareholder</b> from its register of members and state the date of issue of the warrant and the number of shares to which it relates. Subject to the articles, a share warrant can be surrendered for cancellation. If so, the holder is entitled to be re-entered into the register of members. Vouchers are usually issued with the share warrants in order that any dividends may be claimed. (Bearer shares have been abolished in the UK by the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act 2015. Existing Bearer shares must be converted to registered shares by February 2016 or the company will be obliged to apply to the Court to cancel them.) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the rules}} regarding the internet-based exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights for public corporations incorporated in Canada, France, Germany, the U. S. (DelGCL & RMBCA), the UK and Switzerland. The traditional doctrine associates information, communication and voting with shareholder meetings. In addition, shareholder meetings regularly prompt reviews of management's activities exercised on behalf <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> by accountants or the judiciary. The analysis {{reveals that the}} current regimes <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> meetings merely provide for voting and information {{in the context of}} a digital environment, while communication and review is usually not replicated. The lack of all functions <b>of</b> traditional <b>shareholder</b> meetings is one reason of why exclusively virtual shareholder meetings have not gained widely spread acceptance across jurisdictions. Another reason is that a well-fitting design for the web-based exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights does not yet exist. Thus, the paper develops an advisable design <b>of</b> Virtual <b>Shareholder</b> Meetings that replicates all for functions <b>of</b> traditional <b>shareholder</b> meetings, while it is likely to reduce shareholder apathy at the same time. It argues that enabling more frequent opportunities for voting is the logical consequence of the developments of continuous disclosure requirements and continuous buy/hold/sell-decisions by market participants. Therefore, the virtual exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights should be achieved through (1) liberalizing currently existing legislative and practical barriers, and in particular, time and place restrictions on shareholder meetings; (2) re-integrating analyst and institutional investor meetings in the process <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> meetings, and (3) substituting for the traditional face-to-face accountability <b>of</b> managers to <b>shareholders</b> through specific electronic means. The latter involves, specifically, the use of RSS-Feed and XBRL-technologies for gathering and evaluating information, the use of the company's website as the central communication platform for management to shareholders and shareholders to shareholders, and the election <b>of</b> an independent <b>shareholder</b> rights manager (firm) by the shareholder body with procedural, technical, and organizational authority for organizing the exercise <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights. Ideally, the blueprint presented herein achieves the harmonization of voting behavior and market reactions, thereby furthering market efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Democracy and {{participation}} <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> or {{the demand for}} their active participation in the meetings of the Assemblyhas increasingly gained in importance in modern conditions. This is because, negative trends of passivation, the limitations of democratic potential <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> and shareholders' rights abuse by the management body, especially in the work control and compensation policy <b>of</b> <b>shareholders,</b> have been observed in {{a detailed analysis of}} the application and results <b>of</b> the <b>Shareholder</b> Rights Directive. The passivity <b>of</b> <b>shareholders,</b> as one <b>of</b> the most striking features of their position in the joint stock company today, is the biggest problem and threat to democratic processes within the company. If we bear in mind that the most common definition <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> democracy is 'ability <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> to influence the management of the company', we can notice a clear picture of the seriousness and importance of the lack <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> participation. This is the reason why the author of this paper gradually examines the causes and consequences of the passivity <b>of</b> <b>shareholders,</b> the proposed changes in this context in the Law of the European Union and the practical implications of such solutions in practice. In addition, the author examines contemporary forms and conditions for shareholder democracy and the legal framework in the European Union and the Republic of Serbia. In this way, we analyze the situation in this area and point out shortcomings of certain solutions, as well as the implications they cause in practice. The main thesis from which starts the scientific work and which will be gradually proven through theoretical and practical analysis is that the wider social processes directly reflect {{on the state of the}} joint-stock companies, or the state of corporate governance. This means that the negative trends of modern democracy (in the constitutional sense) are almost mirrored in economic capital (EC) and our attempt in this paper is to prove that, through the analysis of existing solutions.
