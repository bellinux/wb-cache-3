This store was reputedly relocated from Burketown, being the former store of Robert Towns. Within two months of opening this store, Burns had received £2,000 worth of orders for goods to transport to graziers in the district.

Moreover, chemical processes and fermentation were discussed as different foods and drinks were analysed. Some food were token to laboratories so that biomole cules qualitative analysis were carried on. Domestic use reagents as pharmaceutical iodine solutions, commercial NaOH and vegetable pigments were used. The substances identified were reductant glycid, starch, fatty acid, triacylglycerol and protein. Reactions allowed to identify fungi and vegetable tissues. Moreover, invertase and alfa-amilase activities were determined. After discussions in class, students could improve biochemical knowledge as well as distinguish between milk or lactic drink, animal fat or vegetable hydrogenated fat, honey or glucose.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{identify}} pivotal moments in students’ knowledge building progress for an online asynchronous corpus generated by a class of master’s level students {{in the context of}} a totally online course. The main motivation for this study is to develop a methodology that can be effectively automated to aid teachers and/or researchers to quickly gain a good overview of students’ progress in understanding at an overall class level from a very large, semantically rich, and complex discourse corpus. The methodology incorporates the use of participation and discourse marker indicators to provide an overview of the nature and depth of students’ engagement in relation to key concepts targeted for student learning, and to support the heuristic selection of a small sample of <b>notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> by the teacher and/or researcher for further in-depth qualitative analysis. This methodology has the potential of being developed into a teacher’s pedagogical aid to more effectively facilitate students’ collaborative inquiry and knowledge building. As a researcher’s productivity tool in understanding students’ developmental trajectory in learning through discourse, it offers a distinct possibility for developing and validating knowledge building theory on the basis of empirical discourse analysis of large sets of corpus...|$|E
40|$|Background: Existing risk {{adjustment}} {{models for}} {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) outcomes rely on manual abstraction of patient-level predictors from medical charts. Developing an automated method for abstracting these data from free text might reduce cost and data collection times. Objective To develop a support vector machine (SVM) classifier capable of identifying a range of procedures and diagnoses in ICU clinical <b>notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in risk adjustment. Materials and methods: We selected notes from 2001 - 2008 for 4191 neonatal ICU (NICU) and 2198 adult ICU patients from the MIMIC-II database from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Using these notes, we developed an implementation of the SVM classifier to identify procedures (mechanical ventilation and phototherapy in NICU notes) and diagnoses (jaundice in NICU and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in adult ICU). On the jaundice classification task, we also compared classifier performance using n-gram features to unigrams with application of a negation algorithm (NegEx). Results: Our classifier accurately identified mechanical ventilation (accuracy= 0. 982, F 1 = 0. 954) and phototherapy use (accuracy= 0. 940, F 1 = 0. 912), as well as jaundice (accuracy= 0. 898, F 1 = 0. 884) and ICH diagnoses (accuracy= 0. 938, F 1 = 0. 943). Including bigram features improved performance on the jaundice (accuracy= 0. 898 vs 0. 865) and ICH (0. 938 vs 0. 927) tasks, and outperformed NegEx-derived unigram features (accuracy= 0. 898 vs 0. 863) on the jaundice task. Discussion: Overall, a classifier using n-gram support vectors displayed excellent performance characteristics. The classifier generalizes to diverse patient populations, diagnoses, and procedures. Conclusions: SVM-based classifiers can accurately identify procedure status and diagnoses among ICU patients, and including n-gram features improves performance, compared to existing methods...|$|E
40|$|As a new medium, {{video games}} can be {{analyzed}} under some of the similar rubrics of other media. However, because of the fundamental differences between video games and older media, including the requirement of skilled user action, alterations to this categorization prove necessary. The study of games has been approached from many aspects, including the study of narrative in games {{and the study of}} game play. Both of these aspects complement each other and additional studies, such as studies of video game audiences, further complement game studies as an emerging field. Because video games require skilled user interaction, studying games requires game play. Game play in turn necessitates that players and students studying video games use additional resources to play particular games, and especially to complete particular games or to explore the games as texts to even a reasonable degree needed for study. Essentially, because games are interactive or mutable texts- in the sense that game play is open and a stable text is not available {{in the manner in which}} it would be for most films or novels- game play and additional resources are necessary for players and scholars. The additional resources offer a sense of how a particular game functions for various players and for repeated game play through its many permutations. This is particularly important for game studies because, while games often include stories, games are first predicated on game play. Because the emphasis is first on game play, the gaming walkthroughs and other resources offer a sense of the manner in which the games are played, and a sense of how the games operate for different players. For the many games with narratives, walkthroughs also offer plot points and information on the narrative progression. Additional resources for play can often be found on the official websites of games and in official game walkthroughs, like those published by Bradygames and Prima. However, many older and even many current games do not have enough information available through official sites or through official walkthroughs. For these games, fan sites provide needed academic resources in much the same way that databases do for scholarly studies of films and literature and in the same way that CliffsNotes - printed books and now an online site with <b>notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in studying particular literary texts - do for students studying literature and that the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) does for students studying film. As Donna E. Alvermann and Margaret C. Hagood argue, students can often benefit from producing fan works and connecting to fan cultures (2001 : 436 - 446). While scholarly databases, CliffsNotes, and IMDB all differ from each other in important ways and cannot replace the engagement with particular texts, just as fan sites cannot replace actual game play, each of these does often serve as a necessary complement for scholarly studies and for pedagogical purposes...|$|E
