Let S = <b>NA</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> semidirect {{extension}} of a Heisenberg type nilpotent group N by the one-parameter group of dilations, {{equipped with the}} Riemannian structure, which generalizes this of the symmetric space. Let {Pa(y) }a> 0 be a Poisson kernel on N {{with respect to the}} Laplace-Beltrami operator. Then every bounded harmonic function F on 5 is a Poisson integral F(yb) = f * Pb(y) of a function / € L° ° (N). Moreover the harmonic measures Ha defined by Pf, = Pa * ßa, b> a, are radial and have smooth densities. This seems to be of interest also {{in the case of a}} symmetric space of rank 1. Introduction. We continue to investigate the harmonic functions on the Riemannian spaces S, studied in [2, 3], with respect to the Laplace-Beltrami operator A. S is a semidirect product of a type H nilpotent group N and the one-parameter group of dilations A, equipped with the Riemannian structure modeled on one of the symmetric spaces of rank 1. S includes those spaces as well as many mor...|$|E
