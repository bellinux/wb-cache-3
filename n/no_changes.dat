2500|$|For {{an ideal}} gas, [...] {{does not change}} during a Joule–Thomson expansion. As a result, there is <b>no</b> <b>change</b> in {{internal}} energy; since there is also <b>no</b> <b>change</b> in thermal potential energy, there can be <b>no</b> <b>change</b> in thermal kinetic energy and, therefore, <b>no</b> <b>change</b> in temperature.

5|$|Although {{students}} protested Bonfire's {{environmental impact}} since 1970, <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> {{were made for}} decades. In 1990, student Scott Hantman asked the Bonfire leadership to help him address the problem. The group solicited volunteers, and {{in the spring of}} 1991, they planted 400trees. The tradition, Aggie Replant, has been repeated annually. The Replant organization became independent of Bonfire in 1994 when it gained its own Student Government Committee.|$|E

5|$|Jeethu had {{initially}} approached Mammootty {{to play the}} lead, but {{he was unable to}} commit and asked Jeethu to proceed with the film with another actor. According to the director, Mammootty was instrumental in casting actress Meena for the film. The director, in an interview with The New Indian Express, stated that he wrote the screenplay with Mohanlal in mind and that the character was tailor-made for Mohanlal. He later added that <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> were made in the script when Mohanlal agreed.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2014, Fox {{appealed the}} R-rating, which Motion Picture Association of America gave the film for sexual references. The studio wanted a PG-13 rating.

The Other Woman was released on April 25 in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The first {{change to}} the highway's {{alignment}} occurred on November 1, 1966, when SH-51 was straightened between Stillwater and Yale; SH-108 was realigned to continue to concur with SH-51. Around the same time, the remainder of SH-108 was paved. The final change to SH-108 was made on June 4, 1974, when a straightening of SH-33 resulted in a slight extension of SH-108 to continue to meet the new highway. <b>No</b> <b>changes</b> have been made since.|$|E

5|$|The {{road that}} {{currently}} carries the SR-202 designation has existed since 1937, when it connected US-40 and US-50 along the Garfield Cut-Off Road. The Utah State Legislature designated the road SR-202 in 1969, thus taking responsibility {{of maintaining the}} road from the county. <b>No</b> <b>changes</b> or alterations have been made to SR-202, except for the legal definition of the road, which has changed twice since it was formed.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{call for}} {{automated}} transponders after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> were made, as aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies. In the wake of Flight 370, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs. Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting {{on the need to}} cut power to equipment {{in the event of a}} fire. Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof circuit breakers were being considered.|$|E

Arsenal made <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> {{to the first}} team which played in the FA Cup Final the previous season, whereas for Liverpool new signing Avi Cohen started on the bench. In the match Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the 38th minute when Terry McDermott scored past goalkeeper Pat Jennings. They extended their lead through Kenny Dalglish in the 63rd minute before McDermott added his second two minutes later. Alan Sunderland scored a consolation for Arsenal late on.|$|E
5|$|Townships and chapelries {{which were}} {{separately}} rated for poor law purposes were formed into civil parishes in 1866. The borough of Leeds contained eleven parishes {{and part of}} two others, and <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> were made to their boundaries until 1894. The Local Government Act 1894 provided that no parish could lie {{in more than one}} local government area, with parishes being divided or amalgamated as required.|$|E
5|$|All {{the regular}} first-choice players signed on {{again for the}} new campaign, apart from goalkeeper George Hollis. Of the less regular team members, Bernard Pumfrey left for Midland League club Gainsborough Trinity, William Reynolds and Gilbert Smith were {{released}} to join Birmingham & District League club Berwick Rangers, and Chris Charsley retired from League football to concentrate on his police career. Small Heath signed the former Sunderland full back Jack Oliver, whom they had failed to recruit earlier in the season, and forward Charlie Letherbarrow from Walsall, but those were the only major signings. The squad was boosted by players from local football, who included Alec Leake, Bill Lewis and a young Billy Pratt. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy. There were <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> to the team's kit of light blue shirts with navy collar trim, cuffs and pocket, white knickerbockers and navy socks.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. <b>No</b> <b>changes</b> in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all drivers {{at the front of the}} grid got away without {{incident}} and with <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> in position. On the outside of turn three, Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position. Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa, who both started from the rear end of the grid, made up places early in the race, running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9, when Vettel came into the pit lane for his first stop. The pit stop did not go well, as his car was stationary for about six seconds. Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two. Meanwhile, at the front, Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second-placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake.|$|E
5|$|Content {{with their}} convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made <b>no</b> <b>changes</b> to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young {{due to a}} {{combination}} of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall {{played a key role in}} a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat.|$|E
