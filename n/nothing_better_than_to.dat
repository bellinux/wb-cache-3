25|$|Hutton {{discouraged}} fraternisation {{with the}} West Indies players and this went decidedly against Trueman's grain, {{given that he}} was a gregarious character who liked <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> fraternise. Trueman had made friends with Frank Worrell and other West Indian players when he met them in English league cricket and objected strongly to Hutton's policy, claiming that he was not alone in this and especially as Hutton gave no reason for it. Trueman suspected the MCC hierarchy of instructing Hutton to make the demand. For his own part, he would not allow anyone to dictate to him with whom he should be friends.|$|E

In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He heard me very patiently; but when I had finished, shook his head, and told me, in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E

Upon hearing [...] "I Was Here", Beyoncé got chills, and {{immediately}} made up her mind, [...] "Oh my god, I have to have this song." [...] September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyoncé thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyoncé to record the song. Warren {{was present at the}} recording sessions, which took place two days following her conversation with Beyoncé and Jay-Z on the phone. She said, [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> hear the song that you came up with [...] It's like your heart found another heart", before adding: ...|$|E
500|$|Originally modeled in Max Payne {{after the}} game's writer Sam Lake, Max's {{appearance}} was remodeled after professional actor Timothy Gibbs for Max Payne 2; James McCaffrey returned {{as the voice}} of Max. The game's plot was written by Lake, who decided to write it as a film noir love story, as he felt that it suited Max's persona the best. Lake hoped that the story would break new ground, noting, [...] "At least it's a step into the right direction. I'd like <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> see new and unexpected subject matters to find their way to games and stories told in games." [...] Lake remarked that basic, archetypal film noir elements found in many classics of the genre [...] "can go a long way" [...] when telling a story, and gave examples that included a hostile, crime-ridden city; a story that takes place late at night with heavy rain; and a cynical, hard-boiled detective down on his luck. Lake considered writing a sequel to Max Payne an [...] "art of [...] own". Since the setting and characters were already established, Lake decided that the primary goal of the sequel was [...] "to keep what's good and fix what was not so good", and to take the story in surprising directions. The screenplay for the sequel ended up being three times longer than the one for Max Payne. Lake predicted that the more complex story would add to the game's replay value.|$|E

2500|$|Summers then {{concluded}} {{his discussion}} of the three hypotheses by saying: [...] So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> be proved wrong, because I would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and working very hard to address them. Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.|$|E
2500|$|The Court's {{majority}} ruling, {{authored by}} Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, {{held that the}} United States Constitution [...] "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body." [...] The Court held that the law school's interest in obtaining a [...] "critical mass" [...] of minority students was indeed a [...] "tailored use". O'Connor noted that sometime in the future, perhaps twenty-five years hence, racial affirmative action {{would no longer be}} necessary in order to promote diversity. It implied that affirmative action should not be allowed permanent status and that eventually a [...] "colorblind" [...] policy should be implemented. The opinion read, [...] "race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time." [...] "The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today." [...] The phrase [...] "25 years from now" [...] was echoed by Justice Thomas in his dissent. Justice Thomas, writing that the system was [...] "illegal now", concurred with the majority only on the point that he agreed the system would still be illegal 25 years hence.|$|E
