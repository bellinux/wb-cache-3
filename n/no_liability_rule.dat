This paper analyzes how the frequency of altruistic behavior changes depending on whether consumers (i. e., the electorate) or producers (i. e., politicians) bear the responsibility.

It finds that under the <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> <b>rule,</b> if politicians are altruist, the frequency of altruistic behavior is less than under the strict liability rule.

40|$|While {{focus of}} the {{mainstream}} analysis of liability rules has been on negligence based liability, some recent works have recommended sharing of liability between the parties involved in an accident. In this paper, we study the implications of various approaches to liability assignment for the existence and efficiency of equilibria under liability rules. Contrary to what is suggested in the literature, we show that the sharing of liability when parties are either both negligent or both non-negligent does not threaten the existence of equilibria. Moreover, it does not dilute the incentive for the parties to take the due care. Also, we extend the analysis {{to search for the}} second-best liability rules; since in view of Shavell (1987) <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> <b>rule</b> can achieve the first best outcome. We show that each of the standard liability rules fails to be efficient even from from a second best perspective. We show that second best efficiency requires loss sharing between non-negligent parties. As implications of our main results, we reexamine some of the existing claims regarding the existence and efficiency of equilibria under liability rules. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{structure}} of liability rules from the efficiency perspective when there are multiple victims. It is shown that, when there is one injurer and multiple victims, there is <b>no</b> <b>liability</b> <b>rule</b> with the property of invariably yielding efficient outcomes. The {{fact that there is}} no rule which is efficient for all applications of course does not in any way preclude the possibility of a rule being efficient with respect to some subclass of applications which may be of interest. We consider in this paper the important subclass of applications (′) which are such that the expected loss of a victim depends only on the care level taken by that victim and the care level taken by the injurer. It is shown that a sufficient condition for a one-injurer multiple-victim liability rule to be efficient with respect to the above subclass of applications  ′ is that its structure be such that: (i) whenever the injurer is negligent and a particular victim is non-negligent, the entire loss incurred by that victim must be borne by the injurer; and (ii) whenever a particular victim is negligent and the injurer is non-negligent, the entire loss incurred by that victim must be borne by the victim himself. In fact, for an important subclass of one-injurer multiple-victim liability rules, characterized by the condition that the proportions in which the loss incurred by a particular victim is to be borne by the injurer and that victim must depend only on the non-negligence proportions of the injurer and that victim, the above condition is both necessary and sufficient for efficiency with respect to the restricted subclass of applications  ′.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{efficient}} bargaining {{is impossible for}} a wide class of economic settings and property rights. These settings are characterized by (i) the existence of “adverse efficient opt-out types”, whose participation {{does not change the}} efficient allocation and who, when they opt out, are the worst type other agents can face, and (ii) non-existence of the “marginal core”, and its multivaluedness with a positive probability. We also examine the optimal allocation of property rights within a given class that satisfies (i), such as simple property rights, <b>liability</b> <b>rules,</b> and dual-chooser rules. We characterize property rights that minimize the expected subsidy required to implement efficiency. With two agents, simple property rights that are optimal in this way maximize the expected surplus at the status quo allocation, but this no longer holds with more agents. We also study “second-best” budget-balanced bargaining under a <b>liability</b> <b>rule.</b> The optimal “second-best” <b>liability</b> <b>rule</b> may differ from, but is often close to, the expectation of the victim’s harm, which would be optimal if there were <b>no</b> bargaining.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to show that the {{conflict}} between the considerations involving economic efficiency and those of distributive justice, in the context of assigning liability, is not as sharp as is generally believed to be the case. The condition of negligence liability which characterizes efficiency in the context of <b>liability</b> <b>rules</b> has an all-or-none character. Negligence liability requires that if one party is negligent and the other is not then the liability for the entire accident loss must fall on the negligent party. Thus within the framework of standard <b>liability</b> <b>rules</b> efficiency requirements preclude any non-efficiency considerations in cases where one party is negligent and the other is not. In this paper it is shown that a part of accident loss plays no part in providing appropriate incentives to the parties for taking due care and can therefore be apportioned on non-efficiency considerations. For a systematic analysis of efficiency requirements, a notion more general than that of a <b>liability</b> <b>rule,</b> namely, that of a decomposed <b>liability</b> <b>rule</b> is introduced. A complete characterization of efficient decomposed <b>liability</b> <b>rules</b> is provided in the paper.

The efficiency analysis incorporating the causation requirement of law of Torts, whenever undertaken, is largely restricted only to the rule of negligence.

First, they argue that the prospect of multiple takings (by others or even the original entitlement holder taking back the entitlement) makes it impossible to implement <b>liability</b> <b>rules</b> with regard to tangible entitlements. Second, they argue that <b>liability</b> <b>rules</b> cannot harness private information when the disputants’ valuations are correlated and that valuations of tangibles tend to be more correlated than valuations of intangibles.

The necessary and sufficient conditions for an incremental <b>liability</b> <b>rule</b> to be efficient, derived in the paper, can be stated as follows: Let the party which is the residual liability holder when both parties are non-negligent be designated as r and the other party as nr.
