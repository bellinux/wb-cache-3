40|$|The {{dynamics}} of cell genesis in the olfactory epithelium {{of the adult}} mouse were investigated using 3 H-thymicline autoradiography. Mice were injected once with 3 H-thymidine, and their olfactory epithelia were examined 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 d later. The number of silver grains over each nucleus was counted, and the relative distance from the basement membrane was measured for each labeled nucleus. At 7 and 14 d, {{the average number of}} labeled cells in each section was about 20 per mm. By 30 d, and for the following 60 d, the average number of labeled cells was only about 6 per mm.

40|$|The {{natural product}} {{flavonoid}} quercetin {{has been shown}} to sensitise cells to the cytotoxic potential of cisplatin. Both cisplatin and quercetin are genotoxicants. As quercetin is currently in clinical trial as a cytotoxicant-sensitising agent, we wanted to elucidate whether it affects the genotoxicity associated with cisplatin. The genotoxic potential of both agents alone and in combination was studied in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 and by assessment of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, effects of quercetin on levels of cisplatin-DNA adducts were studied in hepatocytes by ELISA. Cisplatin was mutagenic in all 3 bacterial strains and quercetin in strain TA 98. The number of revertant Salmonella colonies observed with the combination did not differ significantly from that caused by the drugs on their own. In the UDS assay, cisplatin was genotoxic but quercetin was not. In combination, quercetin decreased the <b>nuclear</b> <b>grain</b> count caused by cisplatin, but quercetin did not alter the level of cisplatin-DNA adduct formation in hepatocytes. Our results suggest that the mutagenic potential of the combination cisplatin-quercetin, as judged by the bacterial short-term test, does not exceed that associated with the individual components. However, in hepatocytes, quercetin appears to inhibit repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage. Therefore, in patients who are to be treated with a combination of cisplatin and quercetin, the risk of genotoxicity in normal tissues will have to be taken into consideration. 9302...|$|E
40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed The involvement of cytochrome P 450 in the cytotoxicity and DNA damage-repair induced by A'-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA), JV-nitroso-n-butyI-/j-propylamine (NBPA) and N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA) was investigated in cultured hepatocytes isolated from untreated, phenobarbital (PB) and pyridine (PYR) -pretreated rats. Pretreatment of rats with PB caused a 10 -fold increase in the sensitivity of hepatocytes to the cytotoxic actions of NDPA, NBPA and NDBA as measured by trypan blue exclusion, whereas PYR pretreatment increased the sensitivity of hepatocytes to NDPA and NBPA, but not to NDBA. This elevated sensitivity correlated well with increased 7 -pentoxyresorufin depentylase activity catalyzed by P 450 2 B 1 in cultures from PB-pretreated rats and enhanced p-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity of P 450 2 E 1 in cultures of hepatocytes from PYR-pretreated rats. Unscheduled DNA synthesis showed that DNA damage-repair was significantly increased in freshly isolated hepatocytes from PB- and PYR-pretreated rats. With increasing time in culture, however, there was a marked reduction in the DNA damage repair response, concomitant with {{a decrease in the}} cytotoxicity of NDPA, NBPA and NDBA in primary cultures of hepatocytes. Coincident with this, a rapid loss in the specific activities of P 450 2 B 1 and 2 E 1 was detected during the first 48 h in all primary cultures. Although N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), used as a positive control, produced high <b>nuclear</b> <b>grain</b> counts in cultures from PYRpretreated rats, the toxic effect of NDMA in rat hepatocytes was much weaker than that observed with NDPA, NBPA and NDBA.

40|$|An autoradiographic {{study was}} made ofde novo RNA {{synthesis}} and nuclear area in endometrial stroma and myometrium in ovariectomized C 57 B 1 / 6 J mice. A comparison of uterine tissue from young adult (4 to 7 month old) mice {{was made with}} tissue from animals {{at the age of}} decreased fertility (15 months of age). In mice receiving exogenous estradiol- 17 / 3 there was an age related decrease in <b>nuclear</b> <b>grain</b> counts 60 min after injection of 3 H-uridine which was more pronounced in endometrial stroma than in myometria when mice were compared with oil injected controls of the same age. The mean nuclear area of both cell types was greater in estrogenized mice than in control mice. The decrease in endometrial stromal response to exogenous estrogen is consistent with, and may contribute to, decreasing fertility with advancing maternal age. R EPRODUCTIVE decline with advancingmaternal age is manifested by a decrease in the frequency and size of litters in poly-tocous species.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to use in-situ nick {{translation}} (ISNT) to investigate the relative number of unrepaired nuclear (n) DNA nicks in different cell types in the brain of the 9 -month-old mouse after a 2 -month exposure to a 50 Hz magnetic field with 0 mT (control), 0. 1 mT or 1 mT. 5 minutes after the end of the magnetic field exposure, the mice were injected with 555 kBq ³H-thymidine (TdR) per gram of body mass, in order to carry out additional UDS tests on these animals. Two hours after ³H- TdR injection the animals were sacrificed, their organs removed and preserved with a fixative for several weeks. Paramedian sagittal paraffin sections were prepared with a thickness of 3 µm. To investigate the cell type-specific content of unrepaired nDNA nicks (i. e. DNA single strand breaks), the sections were subjected to an ISNT with DNA polymerase I and ³H-thymidine triphosphate; finally autoradiograms were prepared. Under the microscope, at a 1250 x primary magnification, 100 successive cells per cell type were analyzed according to their <b>nuclear</b> <b>grain</b> numbers and a computer-assisted measurement of the corresponding nuclear profile area was performed. By correcting for background labelling and normalization to nuclear DNA content, a direct comparison between the new results and those of the literature was possible. It should bementioned that the grain numbers connted were analyzed using cumulative frequency distributions to identify possible artifacts. After calculating the mean of the remaining data, the animal cohorts were compared using univariance analysis and post-hoc t-tests with consideration of a Bonferroni correction. All results with of p < 0. 05 were considered as statistically significant. Finally, linear regression analyses were used with p< 0. 05 to compare the results with corresponding values of the literature. With respect to the content of unrepaired DNA nicks, this study yielded in the univariance analysis a statistically significant correlation to the magnetic field dose only for hippocampus granule cells. However, this results could not be confirmed with post-hoc t-test. On the other hand, however, the results of the UDS tests conducted in parallel (Füller, 2009) showed that, if magnetic field-induced DNA damage had in fact occurred, this damage was repaired no more than 24 hours after switching off the magnetic field. In the case of cell types from the caudate nucleus (neurons, glial cells and endothelial cells), as well as the plexus epithelial cells in the lateral ventricle and (separately from it) in the IV ventricle, no clear significant result could be obtained. For the measured values of the nuclear profile areas which, according to the literature, are positively correlated with cell metabolism in the case of a globose nucleus, statistically reliable correlations were only detected for the neurons of the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus granule cells. The nuclear profile areas were significantly reduced here in comparison to the animals not exposed to a magnetic field, both for an exposure to 0. 1 mT and also to 1 mT. It is worthy to note that only the findings for the caudate nucleus were confirmed in the UDS test conducted in parallel (Braun, 2009) ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study autoradiographically after {{injection}} of ³H-thymidine (TdR) the influence of an 8 -week magnetic field (MF) exposure of 50 Hz with 0. 1 mT or 1 mT flux density on cell proliferation in the spleen germinal center and nuclear (n) DNA-repair capacity in the mantle zone of follicular spleen cells of adult mice. Altogether 72 male mice were exposed to a 50 Hz magnetic field with flux densities of 0 mT (control), 0. 1 mT or 1 mT {{for a period of}} eight weeks. In addition, three completely untreated animals were used for determination of autoradiographic background labeling. The mice were injected with ³H-TdR 5 minutes (sub-group A), 24 hours (sub-group B) or seven days (sub-group C) after the end of MF exposure. All mice were sacrificed 115 min after ³H-TdR injection with an intracardial perfusion fixation. 3 µm thick paraffin sections were deparaffinized, Feulgen stained, and autoradiographs were prepared using Ilford K 2 -emulsion and the dipping method. The exposition time was 251 days. In order to study cell proliferation in the spleen germinal center, the total number of follicles per section as well as the number of follicles containing so-called clusters, i. e. accumulations of S phase cells, and the number of S-phase cells per 10 follicles were determined. The (relative) extend of nDNA damage of spleen mantle zone cells was calculated by measuring <b>nuclear</b> silver <b>grain</b> numbers. Using cumulative frequency distributions of the silver grains, artifacts (arisen during the production of the autoradiographs) could be recognized; these autoradiographs were excluded from further calculations.

However, essentially all commercial sorghum hybrids contain A 1 cytoplasm, which raises the concern about increased disease risk {{as a result of}} cytoplasmic genetic uniformity. To determine the influence of cytoplasmic background on the expression of susceptibility to panicle diseases, F 1 hybrids with four nuclear genotypes in each of two cytoplasms (A 1 and A 2) were planted in three environmentally diverse geographic locations in Nebraska. Fusarium head blight ranged in incidence from 13 to 100 % across locations. Grain mold, caused primarily by species of Alternaria, Fusarium, and Cladosporium, ranged in incidence from 5 to 100 % across locations. There was a significant effect of nuclear genotype on the incidence and severity of both head blight and grain mold across the three locations. Cytoplasm had no effect on head blight incidence or severity, or on grain mold severity. Cytoplasm had a significant effect on grain mold incidence, with A 1 exhibiting slightly lower incidence than A 2 (64 versus 70 %). Although the cytoplasm effect for grain mold incidence was statistically significant, most of the variation in grain mold incidence was attributable to nuclear genotype. The slight increase in grain mold incidence attributable to A 2 cytoplasm should be overcome easily by selection of <b>nuclear</b> genotypes with <b>grain</b> mold resistance.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the effects of a {{continuous}} exposure of 9 months old mice to a 50 Hz magnetic field (MF) with flux densities of 1 mT, 0, 1 mT, or 0 mT (controls) on specific brain cells (epithelial cells of the choroids plexus of the II. and IV. Ventricle, granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cortical endothelial cells. This was carried out by analysing autoradiographs after injection of ³H-thymidine (TdR) concerning nuclear (n) unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA synthesis in order to obtain information on MF induced nDNA damage and its repair as well as the cell metabolism. 80 male mice (NMRI strain) were randomly divided into four groups, In group I and II, the MF exposure was 1 mT (I) or 0. 1 mT (II). Group III was the control group, i. e. sham-exposed with 0 mT. After the end of the MF-exposure or sham-exposure, the mice were injected with ³H-TdR, either after 5 minutes (Group A), or 24 hours (Group B) or 7 days (Group C). After paraffin embedding 3 µm thick paramedian, sagittal sections were cut, and subsequently autoradiographs prepared (exposure time: 250 d at 4 °C). 100 consecutive cells per cell type and animal were analysed concerning <b>nuclear</b> and cytoplasmic <b>grain</b> numbers as well as the corresponding profile areas. For background correction cells of six mice without MF-exposure and without ³H-TdR injection were examined additionally. The statistical analyses included univariance analyses and subsequent post-hoc t-tests with so-called Bonferroni-corrections. Furthermore, the new data and those of a preceding pilot study (Schmitz et al., 2004) were combined in order to carry out regression analyses. Regarding the effects of the different MF doses on UDS, only the epithelial cells of the choroids plexus (of both ventricles) showed significant results. Surprisingly, UDS was significantly (p< 0. 05) smaller after exposure to 1 mT than 0 mT. This was probably caused by effects unrelated to the MF-exposure. In contrast, the results of linear and quadratic regression analyses led suppose that only MF-exposure with more than 1 mT leads to DNA damage in the epithelial cells of the choroids plexus. However, no harmful effects of MF-exposure could be detected on the hippocampal granule cells. The cytoplasmic labelling of the epithelial cells of the choroids plexus also showed a significant decline between 0 mT and 1 mT MF-exposure. Since the data obtained showed a good correlation with the quadratic regression model, it can be assumed that – as in the case of UDS – MF-exposure with a dose higher than 1 mT leads to an increased cellular metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{incorporation}} of exotic germplasm from Avena sterilis L. into cultivated oats (A. sativa L.) has {{become a part of}} several oat improvement programs. To date, this research has involved only nuclear genes; yet, variation among cytoplasms in Avena may provide much opportunity for improving oats as an agricultural crop. The objectives of this study were (a) to determine if cytoplasmic effects occurred in reciprocal interspecific matings, (b) to assess whether backcrossing to the cultivated parent influenced cytoplasm effects, and (c) to determine if there were specific nuclear x cytoplasmic interactions;Sixty populations of 20 oat lines each, representing the BC(, 0), BC(, 1), and BC(, 2) of the matings among five A. sterilis accessions and two A. sativa cultivars with reciprocals, were evaluated in a field-grown experiment for grain yield, straw yield, harvest index, heading date, plant height, unit straw weight, and vegetative growth rate. The data from this experiment were analyzed {{in such a way that}} the effects of nuclear genes, of cytoplasms, and of nuclear genes x cytoplasms could be assessed;A. sterilis <b>nuclear</b> effects on <b>grain</b> yield, straw yield, and plant height were large, even in the BC(, 2), indicating much genetic variability was present in A. sterilis for these traits. The importance of the A. sativa parents to differences among matings increased with backcrossing to the A. sativa parent for all traits except plant height and grain yield. With random backcrossing, specific nicking ability of A. sterilis and A. sativa was lost, with the result that parental performance per se was a good indicator of the performance of a mating;Generally, the values for straw yield, plant height, unit straw weight, and vegetative growth rate were increased by A. sterilis cytoplasm, but these advantages decreased with backcrossing and were lost by BC(, 2). Probably, this relationship with level of backcrossing resulted because interactions between A. sterilis cytoplasms and A. sterilis nuclear genes were responsible for the improved performance. Harvest index showed an advantage for A. sterilis cytoplasm in the BC(, 1) and BC(, 2). Grain yield and heading date were significantly increased by A. sterilis cytoplasm and these effects were not diminished by backcrossing. The effect of A. sterilis cytoplasm on heading date showed no mating interactions of importance, an indication of a direct cytoplasmic effect. The grain yield increase due to A. sterilis cytoplasm was most likely due to specific favorable interactions with A. sativa nuclear genomes;These results suggest that plant breeders might improve crop performance by making use of diverse cytoplasms. An additional benefit would be the added cytoplasmic diversity which could be a stabilizing influence on production...|$|R
40|$|Carbon based {{materials}} (CBMs) {{are used}} in fusion devices as plasma facing materials for decades. They have been selected due to the inherent advantages of carbon for fusion applications. The main ones are its low atomic number {{and the fact that}} it does not melt but sublimate (above 3000 °C) under the planned working conditions. In addition, graphitic materials retain their mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and their thermal shock resistance is one of the highest, making them suitable for thermal management purpose during long or extremely short heat pulses. <b>Nuclear</b> grade fine <b>grain</b> graphite was the prime form of CBM which was set as a standard but when it comes to large fusion devices created nowadays, thermo-mechanical constraints created during transient heat loads (few GW. m- 2 can be deposited in few ms) are so high that carbon/carbon composites (so-called Carbon Fiber Composites (CFCs)) have to be utilized. CFCs can achieve superior thermal conductivity as well as mechanical properties than fine grain graphite. However, all the thermo-mechanical properties of CFCs are highly dependent on the loading direction as a consequence of the graphite structure. In this work, the background on the anisotropy of the graphitic structures but also on the production of fine grain graphite and CFCs is highlighted, showing the major principles which are relevant for the further understanding of the study. Nine advanced CBMs were then compared in terms of microstructure and thermo-mechanical properties. Among them, two fine grain graphites were considered as useful reference materials to allow comparing advantages reached by the developed CFCs. The presented microstructural investigation methods permitted to make statements which can be applied for CFCs presenting similarities in terms of fiber architecture. Determination of the volumetric percentage of the major sub-units of CFCs, i. e. laminates, felt layers or needled fiber groups, lead to a better understanding on how anisotropy can be tailored and on the strategies which were applied for the production of the investigated materials. Textures of fibers and microstructures of matrices were also described. Thermo-physical properties such as thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of some CFCs were studied for different materials’ orientations. For the first time, some off-axis results of thermal conductivity and thermal expansion for fusion related CFCs are displayed. Room temperature bending and tensile loading of CFCs were performed and they allowed relating the microstructural findings to the anisotropic mechanical response. Fiber architecture of CFCs and interfacial shear strength between the fiber and the matrix appeared to be the main parameters which dictate the fracture mechanisms. In addition, the analysis of five batches of one CFC permitted to understand the difficulty of reproducing such advanced material. The differences in terms of needling process were related to the variations of the tensile properties in the various fibrous directions. Finally, fusion-relevant transient heat loads were simulated on the investigated CBMs within various high heat flux facilities, i. e. electron beam, ion beam and plasma gun. Erosion scenarios at different scales were compiled in relation to the CBM properties but also the type of the transient event. The locally preferential erosion and ejection of material from the surface of the CBM are comprehensively described as well as their implications. This ejection of hot particles from the CBM surface (so-called Brittle Destruction (BD) mechanism) was defined, explained and analyzed. An experimental thermal shock resistance criterion based on thermal-shock induced weight loss is presented. After analyzing the anisotropic response of CFCs to transient heat loads in their three orthotropic fiber directions, attempts to reduce BD were done by loading them under off-axis orientations. It partly succeeded and led to the observation of unexpected erosion patterns for penetrating species such as the used 120 keV electrons. The effect of neutron irradiation on CBMs under thermal shock load is presented and a significant defect recovery in the near surface was observed...|$|R
