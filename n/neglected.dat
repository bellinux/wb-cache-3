40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{learn more}} about the {{behavioural}} and anatomical features of ipsilesional <b>neglect.</b>  METHODS—Thirty consecutive patients with spatial <b>neglect</b> were tested on cancellation and line bisection tasks. To learn if patients with ipsilesional <b>neglect</b> demonstrate the sensory-attentional or motor-intentional type of <b>neglect,</b> a video apparatus was used that dissociates these determinants.  RESULTS—Five patients showed evidence of ipsilesional <b>neglect.</b> This phenomenon was seen only on the line bisection task. All patients with ipsilesional <b>neglect</b> had lesions involving frontal-subcortical regions. Although ipsilesional <b>neglect</b> evolved from early in three of five cases, the other patients displayed ipsilesional <b>neglect</b> without initial contralateral <b>neglect,</b> suggesting that ipsilesional <b>neglect</b> cannot be fully attributed to a compensatory strategy. The results of the tests that used the video apparatus indicate that right sided frontal or subcortical injury may induce contralateral attentional or intentional "approach" behaviours.  CONCLUSIONS—Ipsilesional <b>neglect</b> is most often associated with frontal-subcortical lesions, cannot be entirely attributed to a compensatory strategy, and may be induced by an attentional bias, an intentional bias, or both. ...|$|R

40|$|Background Patient <b>neglect</b> is {{an issue}} of {{increasing}} public concern in Europe and North America, yet remains poorly understood. This is the first systematic review on the nature, frequency and causes of patient <b>neglect</b> as distinct from patient safety topics such as medical error. Method The Pubmed, Science Direct, and Medline databases were searched in order to identify research studies investigating patient <b>neglect.</b> Ten articles and four government reports met the inclusion criteria of reporting primary data on the occurrence or causes of patient <b>neglect.</b> Qualitative and quantitative data extraction investigated (1) the definition of patient <b>neglect,</b> (2) the forms of behaviour associated with <b>neglect,</b> (3) the reported frequency of <b>neglect,</b> and (4) the causes of <b>neglect.</b> Results Patient <b>neglect</b> is found to have two aspects. First, procedure <b>neglect,</b> which refers to failures of healthcare staff to achieve objective standards of care. Second, caring <b>neglect,</b> which refers to behaviours that lead patients and observers to believe that staff have uncaring attitudes. The perceived frequency of neglectful behaviour varies by observer. Patients and their family members are more likely to report <b>neglect</b> than healthcare staff, and nurses are more likely to report on the neglectful behaviours of other nurses than on their own behaviour. The causes of patient <b>neglect</b> frequently relate to organisational factors (e. g. high workloads that constrain the behaviours of healthcare staff, burnout), and the relationship between carers and patients. Conclusion A social psychology-based conceptual model is developed to explain the occurrence and nature of patient <b>neglect.</b> This model will facilitate investigations of i) differences between patients and healthcare staff in how they perceive <b>neglect,</b> ii) the association with patient <b>neglect</b> and health outcomes, iii) the relative importance of system and organisational factors in causing <b>neglect,</b> and iv) the design of interventions and health policy to reduce patient <b>neglect...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Contralateral <b>neglect</b> is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} sequela of right hemisphere strokes. <b>Neglect</b> involves attentional and cognitive deficits, including distortions of contralateral spatial and personal awareness. There are no established successful therapies for <b>neglect,</b> and treatment is often complicated by anosognosia. The disturbances associated with <b>neglect</b> are debilitating to patients and their families, and presence of <b>neglect</b> is a strong predictor of poor prognosis for recovery. Objective: The present report reviews findings from 20 years of research using a rat model of <b>neglect.</b> In the rat, 2 cortical areas that are linked by corticocortical connections {{have been identified as}} having a major role in <b>neglect,</b> and these correspond to frontal and parietal fields in primates. These 2 cortical areas also have convergent projections to the dorsocentral striatum, which has been implicated as a crucial subcortical component of the cortical-striatal-thalamic circuitry involved in directed attention and <b>neglect.</b> We discuss the role of the dorsocentral striatum in <b>neglect</b> and recovery and present evidence that induced axonal sprouting may promote functional recovery following cortical lesions that produce <b>neglect.</b> Conclusions: The rodent model of <b>neglect</b> captures some of the essential behavioral and anatomic features of <b>neglect</b> in humans. This model has helped reveal the pathophysiology of <b>neglect,</b> has suggested a crucial role of the striatum in recovery from <b>neglect,</b> and is being used to investigate potential therapeutic approaches.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 This study {{examined}} the association between poverty and child <b>neglect.</b> The existence of a general association has been established for some time. However, there is much debate, and little detailed research, on the specific processes that create this association. This study focused on the form of <b>neglect</b> that involves the most health risk for children—physical <b>neglect.</b> It was hypothesized that poverty should {{increase the likelihood of}} a specific type of physical <b>neglect,</b> <b>neglect</b> of safety and basic needs, occurring more than other types. Using official child protective services data from a national data set three types of physical <b>neglect</b> were examined: abandonment, lack of safety or basic needs, and inadequate supervision. Hypothesis 1 was that poverty increases the odds of safety/basic needs <b>neglect</b> more than it influences the odds of either abandonment <b>neglect</b> or inadequate supervision <b>neglect,</b> controlling for prior <b>neglect.</b> Hypothesis 2 focused on a test of whether the link between poverty and physical <b>neglect</b> is not direct, but is instead mediated by caregiver stress. Three waves of longitudinal data were used for this test to establish causal time order between poverty and stress, and between stress and physical <b>neglect.</b> This study analyzed data from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and <b>Neglect</b> (LONGSCAN), Assessments 0 - 3 from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and <b>Neglect</b> at Cornell University. The data was analyzed using multinominal logistic regression for both models. The results did not confirm Hypothesis 1, though the analysis was limited somewhat due to low frequencies of some physical <b>neglect</b> types in certain age groups. Hypothesis 2 was confirmed showing that the effect of poverty on physical <b>neglect</b> was completely mediated by caregiver stress for the abandonment and safety/basic needs types of physical <b>neglect.</b> Implications of the results for research on the effects of poverty on child <b>neglect,</b> and for preventing child <b>neglect</b> are discussed...|$|R

We set out to address whether <b>neglect</b> presentation could be modified from egocentric to allocentric through manipulating the task demands whilst keeping the physical stimulus constant by measuring the eye movement behaviour of a single group of <b>neglect</b> patients engaged in two different tasks (copying and tracing). Eye movements and behavioural data demonstrated that patients exhibited symptoms consistent with egocentric <b>neglect</b> in one task (tracing), and allocentric <b>neglect</b> in another task (copying), suggesting that task requirements may influence the nature of the <b>neglect</b> symptoms produced by the same individual.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{posterior}} {{cortical atrophy}} (PCA), {{there is a}} progressive impairment of high-level visual functions and parietal damage, which might predict the occurrence of visual <b>neglect.</b> However, <b>neglect</b> may pass undetected if not assessed with specific tests, and might therefore be underestimated in PCA. In this prospective study, we aimed at establishing the side, the frequency and the severity of visual <b>neglect,</b> visual extinction, and primary visual field defects in an unselected sample of PCA patients. Methods Twenty-four right-handed PCA patients underwent a standardized battery of <b>neglect</b> tests. Visual fields were examined clinically by the confrontation method. Results Sixteen of the 24 patients (66 %) had signs of visual <b>neglect</b> {{on at least one}} test, and fourteen (58 %) also had visual extinction or hemianopia. Five patients (21 %) had neither <b>neglect</b> nor visual field defects. As expected, left-sided <b>neglect</b> was more severe than right-sided <b>neglect.</b> However, right-sided <b>neglect</b> resulted more frequently in this population (29 %) than in previous studies on focal brain lesions. Conclusion When assessed with specific visuospatial tests, visual <b>neglect</b> is frequent in patients with PCA. Diagnosis of <b>neglect</b> is important because of its negative impact on daily activities. Clinicians should consider the routine use of <b>neglect</b> tests to screen patients with high-level visual deficits. The relatively high frequency of right-sided <b>neglect</b> in neurodegenerative patients supports the hypothesis that bilateral brain damage is necessary for right-sided <b>neglect</b> signs to occur, perhaps because of the presence in the right hemisphere of crucial structures whose damage contributes to <b>neglect.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|A lateral {{deviation}} of the walking trajectory is often observed in stroke patients with unilateral spatial <b>neglect.</b> However, existing research {{appears to be}} contradictory regarding the direction of this deviation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to gain more insight into the walking trajectory of <b>neglect</b> patients. Twelve right hemisphere stroke patients (six <b>neglect,</b> six no <b>neglect),</b> eight left hemisphere stroke patients (none <b>neglect)</b> and 10 healthy control subjects were instructed to walk towards a target while a two-dimensional ultrasonic positioning system recorded their walking trajectory. Patients' recovery of walking ability was assessed and they were tested for the presence of <b>neglect.</b> <b>Neglect</b> patients showed a larger {{lateral deviation}} in their walking trajectory compared to stroke patients without <b>neglect</b> or controls. <b>Neglect</b> patients with good walking ability showed a deviation to the contralesional side. <b>Neglect</b> patients with limited walking ability showed a deviation to the ipsilesional side. Within the <b>neglect</b> group we found no relation between the severity of <b>neglect</b> and lateral deviation. Differences in walking ability may account for the contradictory results between studies regarding the lateral deviation in <b>neglect</b> patients' walking trajectory. We suggest that when a <b>neglect</b> patient's walking ability is limited, walking towards a target becomes a dual task: heading control and walking. A limited walking ability will cause a higher task priority of walking compared to heading control. This shift in task priority may be causing the change in walking trajectory deviation.

40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of <b>neglect</b> in the child welfare system, understanding of the etiology of <b>neglect</b> remains limited in scope. Limitations are driven by the frequent reliance on child protective services (CPS) data which consists of identified cases and consequently, the most serious of all cases, or through a few population based studies that operationalize <b>neglect</b> as a homogenous phenomenon rather than as distinct subtypes. Furthermore, most studies of <b>neglect</b> focus on maternal deficiencies while paternal factors are largely ignored. This study is meant to address these considerations by utilizing the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a broad population based sample of US citizens, to explore the associations between mental health disorders and <b>neglect</b> subtypes. The aims were to investigate distinctions between maternal and paternal psychopathology and subtypes of <b>neglect</b> compared {{to other forms of}} maltreatment, key differences across lifetime DSM-IV disorders between <b>neglect</b> subtypes and other forms of maltreatment, and how the presence of maternal and paternal psychopathology and maltreatment subtype increase the likelihood of lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses. Out of all <b>neglect</b> subtypes, supervisory <b>neglect</b> was the most prevalent form of <b>neglect</b> and also had the strongest association to most lifetime DSM-IV disorders. Paternal emotional <b>neglect</b> was associated with lifetime mood and behavior disorders as well as phobias compared to those without this experience. Conversely, maternal emotional <b>neglect</b> did not have a significant relationship to any disorder. Similarly, lack of care (LOC) <b>neglect</b> did not increase the risk of any lifetime disorder and even reduced the likelihood of substance disorders compared to those without LOC history. Findings between paternal psychopathology and <b>neglect</b> subtypes indicate that assessments of <b>neglect</b> should expand to include paternal functioning and availability. Supervisory <b>neglect,</b> LOC <b>neglect,</b> and exposure to family violence all demonstrated a greater relationship with paternal substance disorders and/or antisocial behaviors than maternal depression and anxiety.
