5|$|The {{pharyngeal}} jaws of teleosts, {{a second}} set of jaws contained within the throat, are composed of five branchial arches, loops of bone which support the gills. The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials, ceratobranchials, epibranchials and pharyngobranchials. The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate. The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and sometimes additionally, some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial. The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second, third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper. In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the <b>neurocranium,</b> pectoral girdle, and hyoid bar. Their function is limited to merely transporting food, and they rely mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity. In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the <b>neurocranium.</b> They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the <b>neurocranium</b> (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E
25|$|It is {{inferred}} {{that the}} gills of Bothriolepis {{are of the}} primitive type, though their structure is still not well understood. Laterally, they are enclosed by an opercular fold and {{are found in the}} space beneath the lateral part of the head shield, extending medially underneath the <b>neurocranium.</b> Compared to the gills of normally-shaped fish, the gill region of Bothriolepis is considered to be placed more dorsally, is anteriorly more crowded and, in general, is relatively short and broad.|$|E
500|$|Like {{all three}} species of Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris {{exhibited}} derived traits {{not seen in}} the two other less specialized genera of sloth lemur. [...] These traits included deflated auditory bullae and paired protrusions of bone around the nasal opening consisting of part of the premaxilla and the nasal bones. [...] Its skull was wider than that of Megaladapis, but shorter, measuring [...] [...] Its face was shorter than that of Palaeopropithecus, with its eyes directed further forward. [...] The <b>neurocranium</b> (braincase) was small and elevated relative to the face, unlike Palaeopropithecus. Postorbital constriction (narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets) is pronounced. [...] The skull also bore a low, broad sagittal crest (a ridge of bone {{on the top of}} the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and robust but smaller nuchal crests (ridges of bone on the back of the skull to which neck muscles attach). [...] Unlike Palaeopropithecus the rims of the orbits (eye sockets) were not as thick. [...] The area of the orbit was , comparable to that of gorillas. [...] Based on the ratio of its orbit area to the size of its optic canal, Archaeoindris had low retinal summation, meaning its eyes were less sensitive to light (like living diurnal lemurs). [...] Yet the ratio was not as low as in comparably sized apes, suggesting Archaeoindris had low visual acuity and lacked trichromatic color vision.|$|E
2500|$|The {{skull of}} the snake {{consists}} of a solid and complete <b>neurocranium,</b> to which {{many of the other}} bones are only loosely attached, particularly the highly mobile jaw bones, which facilitate manipulation and ingestion of large prey items. The left and right sides of the lower jaw are joined only by a flexible ligament at the anterior tips, allowing them to separate widely, while the posterior end of the lower jaw bones articulate with a quadrate bone, allowing further mobility. The bones of the mandible and quadrate bones can also pick up ground borne vibrations. [...] Because the sides of the jaw can move independently of one another, snakes resting their jaws on a surface have sensitive stereo hearing which can detect the position of prey. The jaw-quadrate-stapes pathway is capable of detecting vibrations on the angstrom scale, despite the absence of an outer ear and the ossicle mechanism of impedance matching used in other vertebrates to receive vibrations from the air.|$|E
50|$|The skull {{consists}} of two parts, of different embryological origin—the <b>neurocranium</b> and the facial skeleton (also called the viscerocranium). The <b>neurocranium</b> (or braincase) forms the protective cranial cavity that surrounds and houses the brain and brainstem. The upper areas of the cranial bones form the calvaria (skullcap). The <b>neurocranium</b> includes the mandible.|$|E
50|$|The <b>neurocranium</b> {{is formed}} by the endocranium, the lower {{portions}} of the cranial vault, and the skull roof. These are not fused in fishes, and a proper <b>neurocranium</b> is only found in land vertebrates.|$|E

50|$|Evolutionarily, {{the human}} <b>neurocranium</b> has {{expanded}} from comprising the back {{part of the}} mammalian skull to being also the upper part: during the evolutionary expansion of the brain, the <b>neurocranium</b> has overgrown the splanchnocranium. The upper-frontmost part of the cranium also houses the evolutionarily newest {{part of the human}} brain, the frontal lobes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the very}} first years of life the sutures serve as the most {{important}} centers of growth in the skull. The growth of the brain and the patency of the sutures depend on each other. Brain growth pushes {{the two sides of the}} patent sutures away from each other, thereby enabling growth of the <b>neurocranium.</b> This means that the <b>neurocranium</b> can only grow if the sutures remain open.The <b>neurocranium</b> will not grow when the forces induced by brain growth are not there.This will occur for example when the intracranial pressure drops; the sutures do not experience stretching anymore causing them to fuse.|$|E

5000|$|The human skull is anatomically {{divided into}} two parts: the <b>neurocranium,</b> formed by eight cranial bones that houses and protect the brain—and the facial {{skeleton}} (viscerocranium) composed of fourteen bones, not including the three ossicles of the inner ear. [...] The term skull fracture typically means fractures to the <b>neurocranium,</b> while fractures of the facial portion of the skull are facial fractures, or if the jaw is fractured, a mandibular fracture.|$|E

50|$|The mesenchyme {{above the}} {{meninges}} undergoes intramembranous ossification forming the <b>neurocranium.</b> The <b>neurocranium</b> consists of several bones, which are united {{and at the}} same time separated by fibrous sutures. This allows movement of the separate bones in relation to one another; the infant skull is still malleable. The fibrous sutures specifically allow the deformation of the skull during birth and absorb mechanical forces during childhood They also allow the necessary expansion during brain growth.|$|E
50|$|In mammals, the <b>neurocranium,</b> {{also known}} as the braincase, brainpan, or brain-pan is the upper and back part of the skull.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} bones—the occipital, parietal, frontal, in the <b>neurocranium,</b> and the nasal, lacrimal, and vomer, in the facial {{skeleton}} are flat bones.|$|E
50|$|The chondrocranium (or {{cartilaginous}} <b>neurocranium)</b> is {{the primitive}} cartilaginous skeletal {{structure of the}} fetal skull that grows to envelop the rapidly growing embryonic brain.|$|E

50|$|The sphenoid articulates {{with the}} frontal, parietal, ethmoid, temporal, zygomatic, palatine, vomer, and {{occipital}} bones {{and helps to}} connect the <b>neurocranium</b> to the facial skeleton.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the human}} skull, the <b>neurocranium</b> {{includes}} the calvaria or skullcap. The {{lower part of}} the skull is the facial skeleton, also known as the splanchnocranium.|$|E
50|$|The viscerocranium {{is derived}} from the neural crest cells (also {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} <b>neurocranium,</b> teeth and adrenal medulla) or from the sclerotome, which derives from the somite block of the mesoderm. As with the <b>neurocranium,</b> in Chondricthyes and other cartilaginous vertebrates, they are not replaced via endochondral ossification. In tetrapods, such as amphibians and reptiles, the columella connecting to the tympanum {{is derived from}} the splanchnocranium. In mammals, the splanchnocranium derives the bones of the middle ear, the malleus, the incus and stapes.|$|E

5000|$|The skull can {{be divided}} into two parts: the <b>neurocranium,</b> which forms a {{protective}} case around the brain, and the facial skeleton, which forms the skeleton of the face.|$|E
50|$|Weindenreich (1941) and Biegert (1957, 1963) {{argued that}} the supraorbital region can best be {{understood}} as a product of the orientation of its two components, the face and the <b>neurocranium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Below the <b>neurocranium</b> is {{a complex}} of {{openings}} (foramina) and bones, including the foramen magnum which houses the neural spine. The auditory bullae, located in the same region, aid in hearing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>neurocranium</b> {{arises from}} {{paraxial}} mesoderm. There is also some contribution of ectomesenchyme. In Chondrichthyes and other cartilaginous vertebrates {{this portion of}} the cranium does not ossify; it is not replaced via endochondral ossification.|$|E

50|$|The human skull is {{generally}} considered to consist of twenty-two bones—eight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones. In the <b>neurocranium</b> these are the occipital bone, two temporal bones, two parietal bones, the sphenoid, ethmoid and frontal bones.|$|E
