5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a <b>necessary</b> <b>condition</b> for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E

Our approach simplifies the conventional derivation of the <b>necessary</b> <b>conditions</b> by using a transversality condition to ensure feasibility of modifications to the optimal path.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Necessary</b> <b>conditions</b> for an {{abstract}} optimization problem are derived under weak assump-tions. The {{presence of a}} generalized critical direction in these conditions {{is the basis for}} deriving <b>necessary</b> <b>conditions</b> of arbitrary order for various concrete problems. Two applications are considered in detail. The first concerns first- and second-order <b>necessary</b> <b>conditions</b> for a constrained optimization problem in an infinite-dimensional vector space where the cost, equality and inequality functions possess differentials of a finite-dimensional one-sided character. The second application concerns first-, second- and third-order <b>necessary</b> <b>conditions</b> for a constrained optimization problem in a Banach space with Fr 6 chet differentiability hypotheses.

5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a <b>necessary</b> <b>condition</b> for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E

This paper extends the earlier <b>necessary</b> <b>conditions,</b> to allow for free end-times. A notable feature of the new free end-time <b>necessary</b> <b>conditions</b> is that they cover problems with measurably time dependent data. For such problems, standard analytical techniques for deriving free-time <b>necessary</b> <b>conditions,</b> which depend on a transformation of the time variable, no longer work.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} <b>necessary</b> <b>conditions</b> of optimality {{for optimal}} control problems, {{in which the}} pathwise constraints comprise both ‘pure’ constraints on the state variable and also ‘mixed’ constraints on control and state variables.
