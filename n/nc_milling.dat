50|$|As {{waterjet}} cutting moved into traditional manufacturing shops, controlling the cutter reliably and accurately was essential. Early {{waterjet cutting}} systems adapted traditional {{systems such as}} mechanical pantographs and CNC systems based on John Parsons’ 1952 <b>NC</b> <b>milling</b> machine and running G-code. Challenges inherent to waterjet technology revealed the inadequacies of traditional G-Code, as accuracy depends on varying {{the speed of the}} nozzle as it approaches corners and details. Creating motion control systems to incorporate those variables became a major innovation for leading waterjet manufacturers in the early 1990s, with Dr John Olsen of OMAX Corporation developing systems to precisely position the waterjet nozzle while accurately specifying the speed at every point along the path, and also utilizing common PCs as a controller. The largest waterjet manufacturer, Flow International (a spinoff of Flow Industries), recognized the benefits of that system and licensed the OMAX software, with the result {{that the vast majority of}} waterjet cutting machines worldwide are simple to use, fast, and accurate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanics}} {{behind a}} PCB milling machine are fairly straightforward {{and have their}} roots in CNC milling technology. A PCB milling system {{is similar to a}} miniature and highly accurate <b>NC</b> <b>milling</b> table. For machine control, positioning information and machine control commands are sent from the controlling software via a serial port or parallel port connection to the milling machine's on-board controller. The controller is then responsible for driving and monitoring the various positioning components which move the milling head and gantry and control the spindle speed. Spindle speeds can range from 30,000 RPM to 100,000 RPM depending on the milling system, with higher spindle speeds equating to better accuracy, in a nutshell the smaller the tool diameter the higher RPM you need. [...] Typically this drive system comprises non-monitored stepper motors for the X/Y axis, an on-off non-monitored solenoid, pneumatic piston or lead screw for the Z-axis, and a DC motor control circuit for spindle speed, none of which provide positional feedback. More advanced systems provide a monitored stepper motor Z-axis drive for greater control during milling and drilling as well as more advanced RF spindle motor control circuits that provide better control over a wider range of speeds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComposite adaptively sampled {{distance}} {{fields are}} {{a new approach to}} shape representation that is well suited for Numerically Controlled (<b>NC)</b> <b>milling</b> simulation. In <b>NC</b> <b>milling,</b> as the milling tool moves along the tool path, it carves out a swept volume and a portion of the workpiece is removed. During the milling tool motion, it is in contact with the workpiece over an instantaneous common surface which is called Cutter Workpiece Engagement (CWE) surface. In order to model the process mechanics and dynamics accurately, {{it is important to have}} a precise geometric representation of the CWE surface. One of the fundamental difficulties has been the accurate and computationally efficient determination of this surface along the tool path for five-axis milling applications. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to distance fields for swept volumes and describe a new method for determining the CWE surface for general and complex five-axis <b>NC</b> <b>milling.</b> The combination of high simulation speed, high accuracy and modest memory requirements provide significant improvements over existing approaches...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm is presented for intersecting vectors with swept solids which represent three-axis numerically controlled (<b>NC)</b> <b>milling</b> tool motions. The intersection calculation proceeds in hierarchical steps {{through a series}} of progressively more exact definitions of the shape of the tool swept volume. At each step, results of intermediate calculations are used to determine whether intersection with an exact representation of the solid is possible and, if so, where and how the swept volume model must be refined for the next step. This structure ensures that superfluous intersection calculations are minimized. This intersection technique has been successfully implemented as part of an algorithm for automatic verification of three-axis <b>NC</b> <b>milling</b> programs, and may also be useful for applications in robotics and factory automation...|$|E
