Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic.

500|$|After the {{resolution}} of the strike, Lindelof said that the effect of the strike on the fourth season would be minimal and the season's story arc would be completed as originally intended. However, the first draft of the second part of [...] "There's <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home," [...] was 85 pages long, approximately 30 pages longer than a typical one hour Lost script. Lindelof and Cuse found that they could not compress {{the second half of the}} season finale into one episode and actually wanted to expand it. Subsequently, the show runners went into [...] "advanced talks" [...] with executives at ABC and convinced them to produce one of their episodes [...] "in the bank", thereby extending [...] "There's <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home: Part 2" [...] to two hours. However, this caused a scheduling problem with Grey's Anatomy and Ugly Betty, which were both already scheduled to air their season finales on May 22, 2008. To allow Lost to have a two-hour finale, ABC moved it one week later to May 29, 2008 and aired both parts of [...] "There's <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home" [...] back-to-back. Ultimately, this left thirty-four episodes to be split over seasons five and six, which will each have seventeen episodes. Another effect of the strike was that the backstories of the so-called [...] "freighter folk", i.e. Faraday, Miles and Charlotte, had to be pushed back to season five.

[...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "the episode was dynamic and busy enough as it relied heavily on action-adventure… but the finale wasn't as mind-bending as [...] season's farewell, during which we received the show's first flash-forward." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the triple-length [...] "There's <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home", but ranked {{it in the middle of}} his list of the season's episodes from best to worst and decided that [...] "'There's <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home" [...] (both parts) played fair with the audience 100 percent, answered [...] questions … and yet … I feel ever so slightly disappointed by all of this." [...] He also found the special effects [...] "looked much shoddier than usual" [...] and praised the score. [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press thought that [...] "it might be the most rewarding, deliciously challenging episode in the history of this mystical ABC serial." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "Part 2" [...] "was perhaps the most action-packed, meaningful episode of television I've watched all year.
