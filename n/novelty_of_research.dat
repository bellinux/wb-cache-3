40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we have {{modified}} a constrained clustering algorithm {{to perform}} exploratory analysis on gene expression data using prior knowledge {{presented in the}} form of constraints. We have also studied the effectiveness of various constraints sets. To address the problem of automatically generating constraints from biological text literature, we considered two methods (cluster-based and similarity-based). We concluded that incomplete information {{in the form of}} constraints set should be generated carefully, in order to outperform the standard clustering algorithm, which works on the data source without any constraints. For sufficiently large constraints sets, the constrained clustering algorithm outperformed the MSC algorithm. The <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> presented here is the study of effectiveness of constraints sets and robustness of the constrained clustering algorithm using multiple sources of biological data, and incorporating biomedical text literature into constrained clustering algorithm in form of constraints sets.

40|$|This {{article is}} about {{ambivalent}} dynamics {{of hope and}} uncertainty within neurobiological autism research. While much literature has commented on the positive hopes and expectations that surround technoscientific projects, fewer have focused on less promissory visions – and, in particular, {{on the presence of}} uncertainty and ambiguity among working scientists. This article shows how autism neuroscientists actually talk about their research in ambivalent, entangled registers of both promising hope and deflated uncertainty. The article locates the dynamic between these in an ‘intermediate terrain’ of autism research – in which autism is both ‘present’ as an epidemiological and social force, but also ‘ambiguous’ as a (not yet) well-defined clinical and scientific object. It argues that neuroscientists work through this terrain by drawing not only on a discourse of unalloyed hope and promise, but by entangling their research within a more complex register of ‘structured ambivalence’, which includes languages of uncertainty, deflation and low expectation. As well as showing the <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> within autism’s ‘intermediate terrain’, this adds to a growing literature on the ‘sociology of low expectations’, and analyses the presence of such feelings among scientific researchers particularl...|$|E

40|$|As hydrologists {{confront the}} future of water {{resources}} on a globalized, resource-scarce and human-impacted planet, the educational preparation of future generations of water scientists becomes increasingly important. Although hydrology inherits a tradition of teacher-centered direct instruction – based on lecture, reading and assignment formats – {{a growing body of}} knowledge derived from engineering education research suggests that modifications to these methods could firstly improve the quality of instruction from a student perspective, and secondly contribute to better professional preparation of hydrologists, in terms of their abilities to transfer knowledge to new contexts, to frame and solve novel problems, and to work collaboratively in uncertain environments. Here we review the theoretical background and empirical literature relating to adopting student-centered and inductive models of teaching and learning.

Finally, the relative <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> on engineering instruction in general and hydrology in particular creates opportunities for new partnerships between education researchers and hydrologists to explore the discipline-specific needs of hydrology students and develop new approaches for instruction and professional preparation of hydrologists...|$|E
