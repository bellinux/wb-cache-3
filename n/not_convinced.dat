5|$|The {{executives}} of Columbia Records were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> that the album would sell well, because {{the project was}} {{a radical departure from}} his earlier success in the outlaw movement. The album included pop, jazz and folk music styles, in addition to country. It was recorded from December 3–12, 1977.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test, which started on 24 June at Lord's. Following his {{injury in the}} previous Test, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.|$|E

5|$|After Euro 2004, Juventus manager Marcello Lippi was {{replaced}} by Fabio Capello. Capello was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> of Del Piero's fitness levels, and frequently benched him in favour of the younger, new offensive signing Zlatan Ibrahimović. Despite his limited playing time, Del Piero still managed to score 14 goals as Juventus won their 28th league title, due to his overhead assist to teammate David Trezeguet, which proved decisive in a match against Milan at the San Siro. Del Piero also helped Juventus to reach the quarter finals of the UEFA Champions League that season, only losing out to eventual champions Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Australia's success {{came at a}} cost, with Lindwall {{injured and}} unable to bowl in the lead-up to the Second Test, missing the {{intervening}} matches against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire. The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, {{and he was still}} not fully recovered by the start of the Second Test at Lord's. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Miller also played, but still nursing his back, was unfit to bowl.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{rent the}} film Paint Your Wagon, expecting {{it to be}} a shoot-em-up Western. Homer is dismayed to find out that it is {{actually}} a musical, and expresses his distaste for such films. Marge is baffled by this, saying that he ironically loves singing. The family starts delivering their dialogue in song form, and Marge decides to prove that Homer loves to sing by showing family videos. Several clips are shown of various songs from past episodes, but Homer is <b>not</b> <b>convinced.</b> At this moment, Snake breaks into their house and holds them hostage. However once he hears them singing, Snake decides that they would not make good hostages and leaves.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{community}} of Narrowsburg, New York, several miles upstream, requested that Pennsylvania Department of Transportation replace the 102-year-old structure. It had already had its weight limits reduced. The same year, an engineering firm in Millburn, New Jersey reported replacing the bridge would cost about $6.16 million, while keeping it would cost even more and raise its life expectancy {{by no more than}} 15 years. The Upper Delaware Council said that the 8 ton (7.2 tonne) limit on the bridge was inadequate for service trucks and emergency vehicles. The Shohola Township supervisors support maintaining the existing bridge, but the Lumberland Town Board was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> that it would be sufficient.|$|E

5|$|Orr {{joined the}} Bruins for the 1966–67 season, his {{first as a}} professional. The Bruins were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. At the season's start, the Bruins offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, but Orr chose jersey number 4. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, getting one assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was a slap shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a {{standing}} ovation.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> {{when the}} class was being {{designed}} that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Vidya Balan came with Sarkar's prior work {{experience}} {{with her in}} three music videos. Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested {{for six months and}} only then they were sure of her acting abilities. Saif once said that he was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> of Vidya's abilities, since Parineeta was to be her first film. He instead hoped to work with established actresses like Aishwarya Rai or Rani Mukherjee. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of Lalita, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance. Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to portray made Vidya accept the role of Lalita.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Frederick, {{the heir to}} the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused {{constitutional}} chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, as Regent (since the heir apparent, George III, was only a child), while the public favoured the child's mother Princess Augusta. In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta was to be a regent along with a council of others, and that George would become the heir when he reached maturity. Murray made a speech supporting the government's proposal, but despite this, Parliament was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> that a council was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{family would}} have {{preferred}} him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years {{and then go on}} to Cambridge University. They were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling {{it would be wrong to}} prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
5|$|When Pearson bent {{the frame}} of his own race car early in the 1961 season, he began working as a house roofer in Spartanburg to support his family, which {{included}} two sons. Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and {{was not able to}} compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte. Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended that car builder Ray Fox hire Pearson. Pearson was unsure if he should join the team, and Fox was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> that he should trust his car to the relatively untested 26-year-old driver.|$|E

5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to renew the}} station's license in early 1971, Mid-Atlantic Network ran into trouble with the FCC due to the quantity of commercials the station was airing. The station was carrying 22 minutes of commercials an hour according to a letter from then-FCC Broadcast Bureau Chief Francis R. Welsh. Welsh said in the letter that the FCC was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> the amount of commercials served the community in a positive way. At the time, the FCC allowed no more than 18 minutes of commercials per hour. However, the station's license was ultimately renewed on May 14, 1971.|$|E
5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was <b>not</b> <b>convinced,</b> but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of his stronghold in Kediri, Trunajaya managed to escape to the {{mountains}} of eastern Java. VOC and the king's forces chased Trunajaya, who, isolated and deprived of food, surrendered to the VOC {{at the end of}} 1679. Initially, he was treated with respect as a captive of the VOC commander. However, during a ceremonial visit to the royal residence in Payak, East Java, on 2 January 1680, he was personally stabbed by Amangkurat, and the king's courtiers finished him off. The king defended this killing of a VOC prisoner by saying that Trunajaya had tried to kill him. The VOC was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> by this explanation, but it chose not to call the king into account. A romanticised account of Trunajaya's death appears in the 18th-century Central Javanese babads.|$|E
