50|$|Autogas (called GLP in Spain) was {{restricted}} {{by law to}} taxis and public transport buses for many decades. In recent years the market has been liberalised and autogas has been made available {{to all kinds of}} vehicles. The Spanish government subsidises the installations of autogas in cars and the purchase of brand-new factory-installed autogas cars. There are many factory-installed autogas brand-new cars available for purchase. While the number of autogas-powered cars is increasing every year, it is still low. The main barrier for a major expansion of the number of autogas-powered cars is that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> for autogas is also still low, but it is increasing quickly too. By the end of 2015 there were 342 stations selling autogas in Spain. Spain is currently the only country using the new EU-wide common standard connector for autogas, the Euroconnector or Euronozzle adapter.|$|E
50|$|The use of autogas (called LPG in both French and Dutch {{speaking}} Belgium) {{was once}} {{very popular in}} Belgium, thanks to the subsidies given {{by the government to}} install conversion kits. Since, 2003, when the subsidies disappeared, the number of cars running on LPG has decreased and the number of cars running on diesel has increased. This was partly due to the tax incentives to purchase diesel cars. In recent years, the use of autogas as a vehicle fuel has accounted for less than 2% of vehicle fuel use in Belgium. At the end of 2003, there was an estimate of 93,000 autogas-powered vehicles on Belgium, supported by 600 refuelling stations. In 2010 there were 33,482 cars equipped with LPG and in 2012 it went down to 22,265. Since 2012 there has been a slight {{increase in the number of}} autogas-powered vehicles of around 14%. This increase is mainly due to the phasing-out of the tax incentives to buy diesel cars. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> equipped with LPG has increased and in 2012 there were 727 stations.|$|E
40|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> for AFVs (alternative fuel vehicles) {{is limited}} {{during the early}} stges of the {{diffusion}} of AFVs. Different layouts of these initial stations will result in different degrees of driver concern regardng refueling and will therefore influence dividuals' decisions to adopt AFVs. The question becomes "what is an optimal layout for these initial stations? Should it target all drivers or just a portion of them, and if so, which portion?" Further, how does the number of initial AFV refueling stations influence the adoption of AFVs? This paper explores these questions with agent-based simulations. Using Shanghai {{as the basis of}} computational experiments, this paper first generates different optimal layouts using a genetic algorithm to minimize the total concern of different targeted drivers and then conducts agent-based simulations on the diffusion of AFVs with these layout. The main findings of this study are that (1) targeting drivers in the city center can induce the fastest diffusion of AFVs if AV technologies are mature and (2) it is possible that a larger number of initial AFV refueling stations may result in slower diffusion of AFVs because these initial stations may not have sufficient customers to survive. The simulations can provide some insights for cities that are trying to promote the diffusion of AFVs...|$|E
40|$|Within the Dutch {{transition}} policy framework, {{the transition}} to hydrogen-based transport {{is seen as a}} promising option towards a sustainable transport system. This transition requires the build-up of a hydrogen infrastructure as a certain level <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> infrastructure is necessary before (even the most innovative or environmentally friendly) consumers will substitute their conventional car for a hydrogen vehicle (Dunn 2002). This {{is often referred to as}} the chicken-and-egg problem of infrastructure development. However, the build-up of infrastructure is costly and irreversible and it is therefore important for policymakers to gain insight in the minimally required levels of initial infrastructure that will still set off the transition. In this paper we therefore present a diffusion model for the analysis of the effects of different strategies for hydrogen infrastructure development on hydrogen vehicle fleet penetration. Within the simulation model, diffusion patterns for hydrogen vehicles were created through the interactions <b>of</b> consumers, <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> and technological learning. We compare our results to the benchmark patterns derived from the hydrogen roadmap. The strategies for initial infrastructure development differ with respect to the placement (urban or nationwide) and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations.</b> Simulation results indicate that when taking social learning between consumers into account, diffusion is generally lower than in the benchmark patterns. Furthermore, simulation results indicate that a nationwide deployment strategy generally leads to faster diffusion of hydrogen vehicles than a strategy focused on urban areas. These demand side aspects of {{the transition to}} sustainable mobility are considered especially important in the Netherlands since besides the high cost associated with infrastructure investment the Netherlands do not have a domestic car industry so that policy measures will most likely focus on infrastructure and consumers. Increased insights in the relation between infrastructure development strategies and hydrogen vehicle diffusion are thus necessary to further manage the transition to sustainable mobility. transition management, sustainable mobility...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} (H 2) as transport fuel {{is often said}} to suffer from the ‘chicken and egg’ problem: vehicles that depend on H 2 cannot go on the roads {{due to the lack}} of an adequate infrastructure, and the almost non-existent fleet of H 2 vehicles on the roads makes it economically unsound to build a H 2 infrastructure. Although both hydrogen vehicles (fuel cell and internal combustion engine) and the related infrastructure have been (and are being) developed and some are commercially available, cost is seen as a major barrier. With today's technologies, H 2 only becomes competitive with petrol and diesel when produced at large quantities, suitable for supplying e. g. thousands of H 2 buses. The question is, how might this point be reached, and are there least cost infrastructural pathways to reach it. This paper tries to address the latter question, using the early development of a H 2 infrastructure for buses in London as a case study. The paper presents some of the analyses and results from a Ph. D. project (in progress) being undertaken at Imperial College London, funded by EPSRC (Grant GR/R 50790 / 01). The results presented here illustrate that cost {{of hydrogen}} production and delivery vary mainly with levels of hydrogen demand and delivery distances, as well as other logistic criteria; least cost production–delivery pathways have been identified for various hydrogen demand scenarios and <b>refuelling</b> <b>station</b> set-ups.

40|$|International audienceThe {{planning}} of a hydrogen infrastructure with production facilities, distribution chains, and <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> {{is a hard}} task. Difficulties may rise essentially {{in the choice of}} the optimal configurations. An innovative design of hydrogen network has been proposed in this paper. It consists of a network <b>of</b> green hydrogen <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> (GHRSs) and several production nodes. The proposed model has been formulated as a mathematical programming, where the main decisions are the selection of GHRSs that are powered by the production nodes based on distance and population density criteria, as well the energy and hydrogen flows exchanged among the system components from the production nodes to the demand points. The approaches and methodologies developed can be taken as a support to decision makers, stakeholders and local authorities in the implementation of new hydrogen infrastructures. Optimal configurations have been reported taking into account the presence of an additional hydrogen industrial market demand and a connection with the electrical network. The main challenge that has been treated within the paper is the technical feasibility of the hydrogen supply chain, that is mainly driven by uncertain, but clean solar and wind energy resources.

40|$|Alternative fuel {{vehicles}} (AFVs) {{face the}} lack <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> infrastructure as one obstacle to initial market diffusion. Also potential operators <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> await significant market shares before constructing a dense refuelling network. The resulting lock-in effect or chicken-egg-problem {{has been a}} field of research for many AFVs, but the co-diffusion of PEVs has rarely been analysed for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) up to now. 1 This might derive from the large availability of private charging options (simple sockets at home) or semi-public charging options (at work). The question is whether these charging options are sufficient to overcome the potential lock-in or how much additional public charging infrastructure is needed. Here, we develop an agent-based market diffusion model for PEVs and their charging infrastructure {{that is based on}} a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individual driving profiles for private and commercial car holders in Germany. Within the model, we determine the utility-maximising fuel type for each user based on cost, willingness-to-pay and the available charging infrastructure which derives from its driving behaviour and socio-demographic information. Infrastructure agents build public charging points when economically sensible. Our results show that there can be a market evolution in Germany without any public charging infrastructure facilities, since many vehicles are parked in garages or close to a house where power outlets are already available or easy to install. The second-best option for an infrastructure set-up is at work where the majority of vehicles is parked over a long time during the day, the installation is not costly and users profit more than from public facilities.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse the {{researches}} performed so far on vehicle choice according to the fuel type. There are different reasons {{to be interested in}} this theme. Among the most relevant we recall the following: a. increasing costs of conventional fuel; b. development of new fuel types; c. different fuel efficiency; d. higher productivity standards, due to crisis of car corporations; e. Italy’s car fleet has a 30 % of vehicles that are ten years or older and also by a strong preference towards buying gasoline and diesel fuelled vehicles. The paper proposes a critical analysis of vehicle choice analysis based on fuel type (e. g. gasoline/diesel, CNG and hybrid). A significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> studies are centred on the consumer. As noted by Achtnicht (2008) the choice depends on the person’s age, gender and level of schooling.

The lack of a diffused network <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations,</b> particularly with reference to the CNG (compressed natural gas), has also been highlighted by Achtnicht, Buhler e Hermeling (2009). Several electrical car market development researches, such as the Salerno’s and Zito’s ones (2004), have stressed its high purchasing price and its maintenance costs.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} the Hotelling model of exhaustible {{resource}} extraction is extended to incorporate network externalities. The impact of network externalities on competition between an exhaustible resource and a renewable resource sector is studied. The {{motivation for the}} paper is that the benefits to consumers from consumption of fossil fuels versus renewable energy sources depend on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other consumers consuming {{the same type of}} energy. For example purchase of fossil fuel driven vehicles has greater benefits if there are large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> other drivers of such vehicles resulting in a large network of infrastructure for the technology, e. g. roads, gas stations, automobile clubs. Likewise purchase of electric or solar- hydrogen vehicles would have increased benefits if there were a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other users of such vehicles with a large infrastructure network available such as plug-in points for electric vehicles <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> for hydrogen vehicles. The paper examines the transition from a fossil fuel economy to a renewable energy economy with network externalities within the framework of a differential game between the policymaker who determines the extent of extraction of fossil fuels and consumers who choose between a fossil fuel network and a renewable energy network in response to network externalities in consumption. Two cases are considered one with two immature industries both characterised by network externalities and one with a mature fossil energy sector in which network externalities are absent and an immature renewable sector that is characterised by network externalities. The key results demonstrate that network effects will have different impacts when technological choices are between two immature sectors as opposed to choices between a mature and an immature sector. In the latter case network externalities are a key barrier whereas in the former the impact depends on the remaining lifetime of the fossil energy source. The results also have implications for policy in particular it is suggested that barriers to the transition to renewable energy are a more appropriate target for policy than attempting to reduce the costs of capturing renewable energy as the latter is likely strengthen the marginal impact of network externalities on resource extraction thereby slowing the transition to renewable energy...|$|R

A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>refuelling</b> conditions and aircraft models are considered for the investigation of the wake. Moreover, an arbitrary hose fairing model is considered to study the effect of the fairing on the flow field and the refuelling hose. Different refuelling configurations are taken into account for the investigation of the hose characteristics. Various hose exit positions were studied within the near field wake to assess the impact on the hose characteristics. The probe hose engagement with the associated hose whip phenomenon is a major topic within this work. The hose whip is a highly undesired phenomenon and is amplified by a specific hose shape which is characterised through an inflection point along the hose. The present research reveals that the rear fuselage wake has a crucial impact on the hose characteristics. In particular, the rear fuselage upwash is the primary cause for formation of the undesired hose inflection point. The findings obtained from the present research are used for the suggestion of palliatives to avoid undesirable hose characteristics.

40|$|On-site {{hydrogen}} production at <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> from liquid fuels offers a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> advantages like {{high energy density}} and infrastructure already being available. Besides, it is economically advantageous in areas where hydrogen cannot be cost-effectively supplied by a central production plant. Within the 3 -year project NEMESIS 2 + (New Method for Superior Integrated Hydrogen Generation System) a small-scale hydrogen generator capable of producing 50 m 3 h- 1 from biodiesel and diesel will be developed. Apart from integrating such system into existing <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations,</b> the NEMESIS 2 + hydrogen generator is potentially applicable to the chemical industry, in particular for blanketing, hydrogenation and chemical synthesis. ...|$|R
