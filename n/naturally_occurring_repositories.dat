40|$|<b>Naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> {{regulatory}} T cells (T reg cells) are a thymus-derived {{subset of}} T cells, which are {{crucial for the}} maintenance of peripheral tolerance by controlling potentially autoreactive T cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this strictly cell contact–dependent process are still elusive. Here we show that <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> T reg cells harbor high levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This second messenger is known to be a potent inhibitor of proliferation and interleukin 2 synthesis in T cells. Upon coactivation with <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> T reg cells the cAMP content of responder T cells is also strongly increased. Furthermore, we demonstrate that <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> T reg cells and conventional T cells communicate via cell contact–dependent gap junction formation. The suppressive activity of <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> T reg cells is abolished by a cAMP antagonist as well as by a gap junction inhibitor, which blocks the cell contact–dependent transfer of cAMP to responder T cells. Accordingly, our results suggest that cAMP is crucial for <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> T reg cell–mediated suppression and traverses membranes via gap junctions. Hence, <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> T reg cells unexpectedly may control the immune regulatory network by a well-known mechanism based on the intercellular transport of cAMP via gap junctions...|$|R
50|$|There are <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> {{radioactive}} materials (NORM), for example radium, radon, uranium, and thorium, in shale deposits. Brine co-produced {{and brought to}} the surface along with {{the oil and gas}} sometimes contains <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> {{radioactive materials}}; brine from many shale gas wells, contains these radioactive materials.

5000|$|There are <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> {{radioactive}} material (e.g., radium and radon) in shale deposits.

[...] These <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> radionuclides are of more concern than some man-made radionuclides used in fracture monitoring because of their long half lives. Radium (Ra) is a product of Uranium-238 decay, and is the longest-lived isotope of radium with a half-life of 1601 years; next longest is Radium-228, a product of Thorium-232 breakdown, with a half-life of 5.75 years. Radon (Rn) is a <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> product of the decay of uranium or thorium. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of 3.8 days. Strontium is also <b>naturally</b> <b>occurring</b> and may be dislodged by the process.|$|R
