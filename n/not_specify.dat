5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season as defined by NOAA has six to fourteen named storms of which four to eight reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes. The June 1988 forecast was that eleven storms would form and that seven would reach hurricane status. The forecast did <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> how many hurricanes would reach major hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|Glamorgan {{sausages}} {{are thought}} to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat. The Welsh Gas Board promoted the sausage in a cookbook published in the 1950s, in which it did <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> the type of cheese to be used.|$|E

He did <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E

He did <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> his date of resignation at that time, however he submitted his letter of resignation in June, writing that he would leave office on October 1. In the early hours of October 2, 2011, Alison Redford was declared the new leader of the party, and Stelmach resigned as premier on October 7.|$|E

5|$|The local newspaper, the Southern Daily Echo, claims {{one of the}} Chancellors of the Exchequer {{that served}} under Charles II {{was buried in the}} catacombs, but does <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> which {{chancellor}} this was. Rear-Admiral Philip De Carteret, a renowned Royal Navy officer and explorer who participated in two circumnavigation expeditions in 1764–66 and 1766–69 was also buried in the catacombs. Another naval officer, Captain Sir Thomas Carew, was interred in the catacombs on 2 May 1840.|$|E
5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Despite the opposition, on 30 June 1852 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Act 1852 was passed, {{giving the}} Brookwood scheme Parliamentary consent to proceed. The former Woking Common at Brookwood, {{owned by the}} Earl of Onslow, {{was chosen as the}} site for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from {{exploiting}} its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> details of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E

5|$|Following {{complaints}} from local media over {{limited access to}} Goldschmidt's public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state archivist announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access as defined in a state law passed in 1973. That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives. Many records were published on the state archives' Web site in early 2005.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 1852 the {{promoters}} of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed, and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company (LNC) was formed. The former Woking Common near Brookwood, {{owned by the}} Earl of Onslow, {{was chosen as the}} site for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> detail of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E

His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia. They did not comment where the corpse was to be taken, but unconfirmed reports suggested that there were plans to cremate him and scatter his ashes at a village in the Tierra Caliente region in Michoacán.|$|E
