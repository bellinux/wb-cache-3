50|$|The JDM DC2 {{received}} significant upgrades in 1998 and {{is known}} as the '98 Spec R. Some of the main changes were a redesigned rear bumper, 16-inch wheel with 215/45R16 tires, 5-lug <b>nut</b> <b>wheel</b> hubs and bigger brakes. Gear ratios for the final drive were higher, making 1st to 3rd gears closer, while 4th and 5th were longer to maintain the '96 Spec cruising comfort. The engine power remained the same, but use of a new 4-1 long tube header brought torque lower down to 6200 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Wheels must {{be fitted}} {{with the correct}} type of lug <b>nuts</b> on <b>wheel</b> studs, or bolts. Lug <b>nuts</b> (aka <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> in British English) are usually either flat, tapered (generally at 60 degrees and {{referred}} to as conical seat), or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively.Most Mercedes have ball lug seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. Wrong lug <b>nuts</b> for the <b>wheel</b> will not properly center it and cause wobble. Some manufacturers (e.g. Toyota and Lexus) have used taper lug <b>nuts</b> for steel <b>wheels</b> and flat seated lug <b>nuts</b> for alloy <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|A lug <b>nut</b> or <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> is a fastener, {{specifically}} a nut, used {{to secure}} a wheel on a vehicle. Typically, lug nuts are found on automobiles, trucks (lorries), and other large vehicles using rubber tires.|$|R
50|$|During {{the second}} half of the 1997 model year, Ford {{introduced}} a heavier GVWR version (8800 GVW), bearing the F-250 HD name. It was distinguished by seven-lug <b>nut</b> <b>wheels.</b> The F-250 HD (heavy duty) was in the same series as the F-350 (same body style as the 1992 to 1997 model years; it was still built in South America only).|$|R

50|$|Loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{indicators}} are small pointed tags, usually made of fluorescent orange or yellow plastic, which are {{fixed to the}} lug <b>nuts</b> of the <b>wheels</b> of large vehicles. The tag rotates with the nut, and if the nut becomes loose, {{the point of the}} tag shifts noticeably out of alignment with the other tags. If too many lug nuts are loosened, the wheel can detach from the wheel stud; loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> indicators allow identification of loose nuts before this can occur.|$|R

40|$|A failed <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{belonging}} to an aircraft {{was sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> failed in progressive manner wherein a number of cracks had initiated all along the circumference of the nut at the fillet of the flange. Fractographic features indicated that the reason for the progressive failure was hydrogen embrittlement and it appears most probable that the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> would have picked up hydrogen during cadmium plating. In general, the microstructure of the nut material was found to be satisfactory and the composition was found to conform to the specification. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this repor...|$|R

50|$|Newer {{aftermarket}} rims may {{be worth}} thousands of dollars. Owners use special lug <b>nuts,</b> called <b>wheel</b> locks, to secure them, although it renders the vehicle difficult to service, and there are doubts as to how well the locks thwart determined thieves.|$|R

5000|$|Impact wrench - An {{air powered}} socket wrench that {{delivers}} high torque output by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft. Nearly every auto body or mechanic shop {{will have an}} air compressor and impact wrench to loosen and tighten lug <b>nuts</b> on <b>wheels.</b> [...] Most major tool manufacturers carry an air impact wrench, including DeWalt, Ingersoll, and Craftsman.|$|R

He has also presented a number of current affairs programmes for the station, such as Seven Days, <b>Wheel</b> <b>Nuts,</b> Sunday Live election programming and the channel's coverage of The State Opening of the Scottish Parliament. Jardine has also fronted feature programmes for STV including Drivetime, Summer Discovery, <b>Wheel</b> <b>Nuts,</b> Rich, Gifted & Scots and The Talent along with four live Hogmanay shows.|$|R
50|$|Friction torque {{can also}} be an asset in engineering. Bolts and nuts, or screws are often {{designed}} to be fastened with a given amount of torque, where the friction is adequate during use or operation for the bolt, nut or screw to remain safely fastened. This is true with such applications as lug <b>nuts</b> retaining <b>wheels</b> to vehicles, or equipment subjected to vibration with sufficiently well attached bolts, nuts or screws to prevent the vibration from shaking them loose.|$|R
5000|$|A {{peanut butter}} wrench, {{also known as}} a crank bolt spanner or a crank spanner, is a {{single-ended}} box wrench or ring spanner used in cycling to tighten older 14 mm and 15 mm crank bolts, or the <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> (track nuts) on hubs with solid axles commonly found on track bicycles, particularly the 15 mm wrench made by Campagnolo. This is the only one-piece wrench {{that can be used to}} tighten or loosen the bolt or nut which holds the crank to a square-taper bottom bracket spindle (although a thin-walled 15 mm socket and handle will also serve), whereas any wrench/spanner of the correct size will tighten or loosen <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The American {{version of}} the 997 GT3 RS has a {{standard}} rear window (not plexiglas) and the smaller 911 fuel tank to comply with rules of SCCA, Can-Am, and IMSA. For Grand-Am races, the central locking <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> is replaced with the standard five-lug pattern required under Grand-Am rules.|$|R
50|$|A center cap, or centercap is a {{decorative}} disk on an automobile wheel that covers a central {{portion of the}} wheel. Early center caps for automobiles were small and primarily served the purpose of keeping dirt away from the spindle <b>nut</b> and <b>wheel</b> bearings of vehicles. Center caps are often found on new cars to hide the lug nuts, and/or the bearing. Center caps are a type of hubcap, the other primary type being wheel covers. Some modern center caps are retained to the wheel using spring clips, while others are retained by the wheel lugs or other threaded fasteners.|$|R

50|$|For 1972, new wheels {{featuring}} smaller hubcaps with exposed <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> {{like those}} on the 2000 GTV were fitted. At the same time, the GT 1600 Junior was introduced alongside the GT 1300 Junior. The GT 1300 Junior was discontinued for the right hand drive UK market but continued to be available in other right hand drive markets.|$|R

50|$|In {{countries}} where the theft of alloy wheels is a serious problem, locking nuts (or bolts, as applicable) are available - or already fitted by the vehicle manufacturer - which require a special adaptor ("key") between the nut and the wrench to fit and remove. The key is normally unique to each set of nuts. Only one locking <b>nut</b> per <b>wheel</b> is normally used, so they are sold in sets of four. Most designs can be defeated using a hardened removal tool which uses a left-hand self-cutting thread to grip the locking nut, although more advanced designs have a spinning outer ring to frustrate such techniques.|$|R
50|$|Loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{indicators}} or Lug nut {{indicators are}} used both by auto mechanics and drivers to identify lug nuts which require tightening, {{as well as}} by accident investigators to detect faults after accidents. Although not compulsory in most jurisdictions, road safety bodies recommend their use, especially on large or heavy vehicles such as buses, coaches, large vans, and trucks.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{long after}} the {{standard}} Slash 4x4 was announced, a race-ready [...] "Platinum Edition" [...] was also announced. Much like the Revo Platinum Edition, it lacks a pre-painted body, but includes most of Traxxas' available accessories as stock equipment. New features include big-bore aluminum shocks, a center differential, aluminum hubs and axle carriers, blue anodized aluminum <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts,</b> front and rear sway bars, and racing compound tires.|$|R

Unfortunately he muffed the start and later spun out of contention when a front <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> became loose, and his teammate Jacques Villeneuve {{went on to win}} at a fraction over 124mph, from Berger's Benetton and the McLaren of Häkkinen.|$|R
