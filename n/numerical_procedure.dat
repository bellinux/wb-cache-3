40|$|Concave regularization methods provide natural {{procedures}} for sparse recovery. However, they {{are difficult to}} analyze in the high dimensional setting. Only recently a few sparse recovery results have been established for some specific local solutions obtained via specialized <b>numerical</b> <b>procedures.</b> Still, the fundamental relationship between these solutions such as whether they are identical or {{their relationship to the}} global minimizer of the underlying nonconvex formulation is unknown. The current paper fills this conceptual gap by presenting a general theoretical framework showing that under appropriate conditions, the global solution of nonconvex regularization leads to desirable recovery performance; moreover, under suitable conditions, the global solution corresponds to the unique sparse local solution, which can be obtained via different <b>numerical</b> <b>procedures.</b> Under this unified framework, we present an overview of existing results and discuss their connections. The unified view of this work leads to a more satisfactory treatment of concave high dimensional sparse estimation procedures, and serves as guideline for developing further <b>numerical</b> <b>procedures</b> for concave regularization.

50|$|A {{different}} {{field where}} accuracy {{is an issue}} is the area of numerical computing of integrals and the solution of differential equations. Examples are Simpson's rule, the Runge-Kutta method, and the Numerov algorithm for the Schrödinger equation. Using Visual Basic for Applications, any of these methods can be implemented in Excel. Numerical methods use a grid where functions are evaluated. The functions may be interpolated between grid points or extrapolated to locate adjacent grid points. These formulas involve comparisons of adjacent values. If the grid is spaced very finely, round-off error will occur, and the less the precision used, the worse the round-off error. If spaced widely, accuracy will suffer.

Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver 2's three position components. This may require a <b>numerical</b> <b>procedure.</b> An approximation of receiver 2's position is required to use such a numerical method. This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver 2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver 2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver 2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.|$|E

For example, if the position of receiver 1 is known but the position of receiver 2 unknown, {{it may be possible to}} estimate the position of receiver 2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs quite possibly will be sufficient to solve for the three components of position of receiver 2. This may require the use of a <b>numerical</b> <b>procedure</b> such as one of those found in the chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations in Numerical Recipes. To use such a numerical method, an initial approximation of the position of receiver 2 is required. This initial value could probably be provided by a position approximation based on the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Although multidimensional numerical root finding can have problems, this disadvantage may be overcome with this good initial estimate. This procedure using three time pairs and a fairly good initial value followed by iteration will result in one observed triple difference result for receiver 2 position. Greater accuracy may be obtained by processing triple difference results for additional sets of three independent time pairs. This will result in an over determined system with multiple solutions. To get estimates for an over determined system, least squares can be used. The least squares procedure determines the position of receiver 2 which best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver 2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.|$|E
