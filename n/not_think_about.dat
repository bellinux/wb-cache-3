25|$|While Charles was in Paris, Marie {{wrote to}} him passionate love letters {{and sent him}} her picture, {{as well as a}} Christmas cake {{in the spirit of the}} season. He ate a piece of it and {{suddenly}} became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie put him to bed and fed him venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening.|$|E

I'd rather <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that album because it doesn't mean much {{in terms of where}} I was at... the album didn't sell very well and I'm glad."

500|$|This was {{followed}} by victories over Belgium and Cameroon in the knock-out stages, {{to set up a}} semi-final with West Germany. England lost the match on a penalty shoot-out, after the score had been tied at 1–1 following extra time. Robson said afterwards, [...] "ot a day goes by when [...] does <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the semi-final and other choices [...] might have made." [...] Robson remains only the second coach, after Alf Ramsey, to take England to a World Cup semi-final, and the only coach to do so on foreign soil.|$|E
500|$|Once the Nannygate matter {{broke into}} the news, the {{question}} [...] "Do you have a Zoë Baird problem?" [...] became frequently asked by Americans {{of each other in}} casual conversation, with many answers being in the affirmative. [...] U.S. Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service data indicated that only one-quarter of people who employed household help paid Social Security taxes to the workers, and that even figure may have been higher than the real one due to people not responding to surveys honestly. [...] Most of those doing the hiring did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> breaking the law or getting caught.|$|E
500|$|Zoë Nightshade: Zoë is the {{daughter}} of Atlas, a banished Hesperid for helping the hero Hercules, and the first lieutenant of the Hunters of Artemis. [...] She often has trouble updating her language and uses Old English. [...] She dies after being bitten by Ladon, who protects the immortality-giving golden apple tree, and after her father Atlas, throws her against a pile of rocks. Artemis turns her spirit into a constellation soon after her death for remembrance. She and Thalia developed grudges against each other after Thalia did not want to join the hunters, but they get along when they do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E

500|$|In 1512 Erasmus {{had been}} in {{negotiation}} with Badius Ascensius of Paris to publish the Vulgate of Jerome and a new edition of Adagia. It did not happen, and Erasmus did not continue contacts with Badius. At that time Erasmus did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> a Greek New Testament. It is uncertain when Erasmus decided to prepare his edition of the Greek New Testament, but {{on a visit to}} Basel in August 1514 he contacted Johann Froben. Many scholars believe that Froben had heard about the forthcoming Spanish Polyglot Bible, and tried to overtake the project of Alcala (e.g. S. P. Tregelles). Some scholars doubt this motivation of Froben (e.g. Bruce Metzger), because {{there is no evidence to}} support it. Most likely Erasmus included the Greek text to prove [...] the superiority of his Latin version.|$|E
500|$|Shanina's {{personal}} life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, {{she wrote in}} her diary, [...] "I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [...] has been killed... He loved me, I know, and I him... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [...] friend". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she [...] "is flogging into her head that [...] loves" [...] a man named Nikolai, although he [...] "doesn't shine in upbringing and education". In the same entry she wrote that she did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> marriage because [...] "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she [...] "had it out" [...] with Nikolai and [...] "wrote him a note {{in the sense of}} 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she [...] "cannot find a solace" [...] now and is [...] "of no use to anyone".|$|E

500|$|Takumi only spent {{little time}} on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the game's story, and instead made up {{dialogue}} and developed Phoenix's personality {{as he went}} along. Takumi said that Phoenix is Shu Takumi in everything but name, with dialogue similar to what Takumi would have said in each situation in the games; he attributed this to him being a first-time writer who did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> developing characterization prior to writing the story. Takumi didn't write a backstory for Dick Gumshoe; instead, Gumshoe's character and personality just [...] "fell into place" [...] after Takumi decided that the character would end his sentences with [...] "pal". Other aspects of the character came about organically as Takumi wrote the story; for instance, at one point Edgeworth says that he will cut Gumshoe's salary, which became part of Gumshoe's backstory. Takumi {{came up with the}} partner character Maya because {{he thought it would be}} more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own. Originally, she was going to be a lawyer-in-training, preparing to take the bar exam.|$|E
500|$|The Griffins {{prepare to}} return to Quahog, where Peter faces the {{prospect}} of finding a new job. Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming {{there is no room}} for any more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on not just Nelson, but all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, Jimbo Jones, Principal Skinner, Sideshow Bob, and (for the sake of making a scatological pun) Apu. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violent tendencies and ends their friendship. Homer tries to explain his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight (à la fighting between Peter and The Giant Chicken) through Springfield. The pair gain superpowers when they hit the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, then end up in Kang and Kodos' spaceship, where they lose their powers before landing in Springfield Gorge. Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find that the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie tries to pretend he is over Bart, but goes to his room crying while writing [...] "I will <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Bart anymore" [...] several times on a chalkboard.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the basis}} of this prototype, Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of sound {{transmitting}} devices inspired by the telegraph model as did other pioneers of the telephone, such as Charles Bourseul, Philipp Reis, Innocenzo Manzetti and others. Meucci later claimed that he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph [...] "make-and-break" [...] method, but he looked for a [...] "continuous" [...] solution that did not interrupt the electric current.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} reform was {{to prop up}} the {{centrally}} planned economy—not to transition to market socialism. Speaking in late summer 1985 to the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties, Gorbachev said: [...] "Many of you see the solution to your problems in resorting to market mechanisms in place of direct planning. Some of you look at the market as a lifesaver for your economies. But, comrades, you should <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> lifesavers but about the ship, and the ship is socialism." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shore {{spent her}} last years in poverty. She {{had to sell}} her Weston {{photographs}} to survive and became increasingly depressed. Sometime in the late 1950s her neighbors had her institutionalized. Her very dear friend Jehanne Bietry Salinger said about the matter, [...] "some so-called 'do-gooders' went to her studio, found it disorganized, and had Henrietta committed to an asylum. If I had been in Carmel, I would never have permitted it, since she {{was in no way}} insane. I still can <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> this without being heartbroken."

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his beliefs in an {{interview}} in 1988, Bardeen responded: [...] "I am not a religious person, and so do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it very much". However, he has also said: [...] "I feel that science cannot provide an answer to the ultimate questions about the meaning and purpose of life." [...] Bardeen did believe in a code of moral values and behaviour. John Bardeen's children were taken to church by his wife, who taught Sunday school and was a church elder. Despite this, he and his wife {{made it clear that they}} did not have faith in an afterlife and other religious ideas.|$|E
