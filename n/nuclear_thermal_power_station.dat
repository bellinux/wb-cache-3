50|$|In L'Ankou, Ororéa invites Spirou and Fantasio to {{join her}} at a {{congress}} of magicians in Brittany. When they arrive, they meet strange L'Ankou, who objects {{to the presence of}} a <b>nuclear</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> on his land. They then save Ororéa from an aggression, but the gangsters manage to escape. At their arrival at the hotel, they find out that Itoh Kata is amongst the magicians invited. The others are telepath Al Kazar, hypnotist monk Capuccino and telekinesist Rethros Athana. Those are currently developing a magic trick based on teleportation.Fantasio is used as guinea-pig during the first representation but is abducted by the gangsters. Ankou reappears and suggests to Spirou and his friends not to try anything against the kidnappers. The latter exert blackmail on the magicians: they are to deliver a revolutionary product developed at the power station in exchange for Fantasio. Kata decides not to say anything to his friends and together, the magicians steal the product. Meanwhile, Fantasio manages to escape and warns the police with Spirou and Ororéa. The gangsters are arrested but the product stolen by the magicians threatens to explode. Fortunately, Spirou warns the magicians in time and Itoh Kata makes the product vanish. This event leads to the power station closing down. L'Ankou is thus grateful towards Spirou and his companions.|$|E

Mallipattinam is located between the Kudankulam and Kalpakkam nuclear power plants and near to Tuticorin <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plant. Water, sediments, seaweeds, crustaceans, molluscs, and fish were collected to measure the concentrations of (210) Po and (210) Pb. The concentrations of (210) Po and (210) Pb in most samples are comparable to values reported worldwide. In fish, the concentrations of (210) Po and (210) Pb are in the range 16 - 190 Bq kg(- 1) and 8 - 153 Bq kg(- 1), respectively.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} {{protective}} and safety systems of <b>nuclear</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> or chemical plants. The main {{aim of the}} study is an algorithm called Intelligent measuring channel (IMC) applied in the safety system S. O. S. for measuring signal validation. The author's part deals with a reliability evaluation of the IMC, automatic pre-setting of limit difference test parameters by means of derived theory of calculation of dynamic systems extreme differences and creation of self-recovery D-SRECV test group for the IMC. The new recovery tests are based on the original principle of a static limit test of estimated sensor input from its measured output and the known failure-free sensor model. The optimal approximation of transfer function numerators has been derived for reduction of computing complexity. The theoretical part results have been verified on a volume of real and simulated signals. They prove a high recovery and sensor fault detection quality. The study conclusions are useful for application in analogue sensor measuring validity verification by means of the IMC in safety systems or intelligent sensors working in industrial fieldbuses, e. g.

40|$|Stainless Steel is {{a family}} of {{versatile}} materials that has been put into {{a wide variety of}} application by mankind. Stainless steels are iron-based alloys containing minimum 12 % chromium and upto 25 % nickel with minor additions of carbon, nitrogen, molybdenum, tungsten, titanium, niobium, copper and selenium. It has a wide range of applications from small pins to the construction of automobiles, petrochemical, space, aeronautical, ship building industries, <b>nuclear</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> Certain grades of stainless steels, because of their biocompatibility are used for manufacture of biomedical implants. In fact steel touches every sphere of our daily life. By and large stainless steel family consists of hundreds of grades with varieties of compositions and a large spectrum of mechanical properties. The corrosion and oxidation resistance of stainless steels have been significantly improved through fine-tuned chemical compositions and microstructural constituents, leading to the evolution of super stainless steels. Stainless steel development from design to application is a long-term continuous effort. The recent advances in stainless steels are mainly due to new ways of manufacture, processing and usage of advanced equipments. In spite of inroads by a range of competing materials, stainless steels occupy an important place as structura...|$|R
40|$|Periodically {{perforated}} sheets(PS) are {{ubiquitous in}} nature {{as well as}} in engineered artifacts developed for aerospace, automotive, marine, nuclear and structural applications. PS are indispensable for saving weight and cost for aircraft; for enhancing safety and integrity of heat exchangers used in <b>nuclear</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> Ancient PS grills and lattice frames dating back to 1000 BC continue to inspire contemporary art and architecture, buildings and furniture. PS design and analysis, however, is a complex affair stemming from the inherent configurational anisotropy induced by periodicity. In addition, complex boundary conditions complicate the analysis. Unlike atoms in crystalline media, both shape and periodicity of perforations control this anisotropic nature. This thesis explores theoretical and numerical strategies for evaluating the effective anisotropic elastic moduli of PS. Following an experimental prelude for visualizing the PS stress field in a photoelastic sheet and a brief review of PS theory, this thesis proposes a novel theoretical numerical hybrid method for determining the Airy stress function constants. The proposed hybrid method can be exploited experimentally using automated vision based imaging technologies to measure the boundary displacements noninvasively. For determining the Airy constants periodic boundary conditions to the unit cell are applied, the displacement components around the PS hole boundary are obtained using FEM. Using these constants the PS stress field is reconstructed to assess the efficacy of the proposed hybrid method. It is observed that in general while the actual and the reconstructed stress fields agree reasonably well, more refined boundary data obtained either numerically or experimentally can enhance the accuracy further. The thesis then makes an extensive presentation of anisotropic moduli in a variety of PS designs configured on rectangular or square layouts. Conventional as well as some exotic patterns with cusps and satellite holes are examined, and the results are presented graphically to aid the designer. Finally, some special topics pertaining PS design and analysis are discussed to help overcome the inherent limitations of solutions based on applying periodic boundary conditions. In this vein, strategies for achieving a functionally graded PS are presented by altering the pitch and hole size. These strategies assume importance near boundaries as well as near concentrated forces inducing stress gradients. Other special topics include the applicability of tensor transformation rule to PS anisotropy. The effective bulk modulus which remains a scalar invariant is exploited to assess the validity of tensor transformation in a square PS. The rule of mixture widely used in homogenization of composite media is also discussed briefly. Thus, this thesis makes an attempt to demonstrate the power of blending micromechanics with experiments and FEM to aid in PS design and analysis...|$|R
