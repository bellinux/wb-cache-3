5|$|Bertie's and Lionel's {{relationship}} {{comes to}} be known to the King's advisors when there are preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. It comes to light that George <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> advice from his advisors about his speech defect treatment and that Lionel never had formal training to be a medical doctor. Lionel explained {{that at the time}} he started with speech defects there was no formal training and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shell-shocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience.|$|E
5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her {{to stand up for}} herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> anything in return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Jefferson's presidency, the United States {{had paid}} tribute {{to a number of}} Arab states in the Mediterranean to prevent attacks on its shipping. By the time Jefferson assumed office, the United States Navy had been {{developed}} {{to the point where it}} might adequately defend American shipping interests. Jefferson consequently refused to pay tribute in 1801 to Yusuf Karamanli, the ruler of Tripoli, after which the Tripolitans began attacking and seizing American merchant vessels. In a cabinet discussion held in early 1801 to formulate a response, it was suggested that the President declare war on Tripoli. Lincoln pointed out that only Congress had the authority to declare war, but the rest of the cabinet was intent on taking some sort of action. The matter was tabled until May 1801, when the cabinet voted to send a naval squadron to the area to defend the country's merchant interests. Jefferson <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> or received from Congress a formal war declaration against the Barbary states.|$|E

Baroni maintained that it was a verbal miscommunication and he <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> the fight to be stopped. To quell the controversy, the UFC agreed to give Baroni a rematch at UFC 48.|$|E
25|$|Alessandro Lessona (Minister of Mussolini's government), {{a friend}} of mine at the time, paid to you more than 4 million English Pounds from 1925 to 1931. Even I had the right to act, I <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> my part. That money, as anyone in Albania knows, have been washed by the blood of patriots as Bajram Curri, Hasan Prishtina, Luigj Gurakuqi, and {{thousand}} of them.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 1961, Mantle {{became the}} highest-paid player in {{baseball}} by signing a $75,000 ($ today) contract. DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg, and Ted Williams, {{who had just}} retired, had been paid over $100,000 in a season, and Ruth had a peak salary of $80,000. Mantle became the highest-paid active player of his time. Mantle's top salary was $100,000, which {{he reached for the}} 1963 season. Having reached that pinnacle in his 13th season, he <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> another raise.|$|E

25|$|The American {{strategy}} {{had become}} {{the pursuit of a}} war of attrition. The objective was to make the Viet Cong enemy suffer more losses than it could timely replace. Accordingly, the number of combatants fielded by the communist insurgency at any one time was a key factor in determining whether {{the course of the war}} was favorable or not. The political pressure on the CIA to conform to the military's figures of enemy casualties became intense. Under Helms CIA reports on the Viet Cong order of battle numbers were usually moderate; CIA also questioned whether the strategy employed by the U.S. Army would ever compel Hanoi to negotiate. Helms himself was evidently sceptical, yet Johnson <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> his personal opinion. This dispute between Army and CIA over the number of Viet Cong combatants became bitter, and eventually common knowledge in the administration.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{arguments}} {{began on}} October 20 with Barbra Schultz, the hotel's General Manager, taking the stand. Tinker asked if Selena had actually screamed {{out to them}} to lock the doors. She replied that Selena had <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> the doors to be locked and was only moaning on the floor. Schultz further stated that her former employee, Vela, was not trustworthy. Schultz also said that all the employees began formulating different opinions on what happened on March 31 when the prosecution called on them to testify. Motel staff maid, Gloria Magaña, doubted the validity of Espinoza and Martinez's accounts. She told the jury {{that it was impossible}} for both employees to have seen Saldívar chasing Selena because their work {{was on the other side}} of the motel building. Magaña claimed to have seen Selena running through the parking lot, but did not see Saldívar chasing after her. Tinker called Marilyn Greer, Selena's seventh grade teacher, to the stand. She told the jury that Selena had had the ability to graduate with honors and could have easily obtained a college scholarship. Greer then spoke about how Quintanilla, Jr. had taken away the possibility of college for Selena, wasting her youth by forcing her to sing at nightclubs and bars for money; something that was unhealthy for a thirteen-year-old girl.|$|E

500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Amish Paradise", {{caused a}} minor {{controversy}} after rapper Coolio said that Yankovic had <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> permission {{to record the}} parody. Yankovic traditionally secures permission from the artists he parodies, {{even though this is}} not legally required, as parodies are covered under fair use guidelines, but when he inquired about [...] "Gangsta's Paradise", Yankovic was told by Scotti Brothers Records that Coolio had given permission. Coolio later claimed that he had not given such permission, making a statement at the Grammys saying that he did not appreciate Yankovic [...] "desecrating" [...] his song.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} previewed to good reviews, and {{after an initial}} release in the Philippines on November 17, 2004, opened in cinemas in Manhattan, San Diego and Honolulu on March 11, 2005, as Magdalena, The Unholy Saint. It was given good reviews by both Filipino and American {{magazines}} and newspapers; Variety magazine's reviewer noted that [...] "Performances are solid, and former child actress Panganiban is impressive {{as a young woman}} who finds herself with a vocation she <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for....</b> Guillen's helming is slick and confident, and the HD-sourced photography and other technical credits are of good quality", and the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that [...] "Gorgeously crafted, 'Santa Santita's' strength lies in its illuminating take on man's neverending search for meaning, and in the thoughtful, truthful characterization of its leads".|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Hayman affirmed, [...] "every effort [...] {{been made}} to {{discover}} the deception, if any, but without effect." [...] The Home Secretary and local Magistrate corresponded about the case but the law was powerless to interfere, because despite accepting donations, Ellen's family <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> money outright, and she [...] "was not represented as a 'fasting girl, as Sarah Jacob had been. The Daily Telegraph journalist said, [...] "'s manner {{is that of a}} perfectly honest woman who would be too glad if her child could be restored to consciousness." [...] He spoke to neighbours, none of whom indicated anything other than trust in Ellen's parents and Hayman, and claimed that the family was receiving no money from Ellen's illness, although the latter point is contradicted by Hayman and others. The journalist concluded, [...] "I have no medical knowledge, and [...] unqualified to give an opinion beyond what is justified by close observation of the ordinary kind. I went to Turville prepared to find an imposture. I have returned—puzzled." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1988, President John Patrick Crecine {{pushed through}} a {{restructuring}} of the university. The Institute at that point had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal Arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> input regarding the changes and, consequently, many faculty members disliked his top-down management style; despite this, the changes passed by a slim margin. Crecine was also instrumental in securing the 1996 Summer Olympics for Atlanta. A large amount of construction occurred, creating most {{of what is now}} considered [...] "West Campus" [...] for Tech to serve as the Olympic Village, and significantly gentrifying Midtown Atlanta. The Undergraduate Living Center, Fourth Street Apartments, Sixth Street Apartments, Eighth Street Apartments, Hemphill Apartments, and Center Street Apartments housed athletes and journalists. The Georgia Tech Aquatic Center was built for swimming events, and the Alexander Memorial Coliseum was renovated. The Institute also erected the Kessler Campanile and fountain to serve as a landmark and symbol of the Institute on television broadcasts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{responsibility}} {{principle is}} that a clear conscience results when people {{realize that they are}} responsible to God for every thought, word, action, and motive.

2500|$|As {{a lifelong}} {{communist}} and {{supporter of the}} Cuban Revolution until his death, Alberto Korda claimed no payment for his picture. A {{modified version of the}} portrait through the decades was also reproduced on a range of different media, though Korda <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> royalties. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. Korda's refusal to seek royalties for the vast circulation of his photograph [...] "helped it become the ultimate symbol of Marxist revolution and anti-imperialist struggle." ...|$|E
