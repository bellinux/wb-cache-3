40|$|International audienceRoot {{essential}} oil of Pulicaria mauritanica Coss. (Asteraceae) collected from western Algeria was analysed {{using a combination}} of chromatographic (CC, GC/FID, GC(RI) ] and spectroscopic [GC–MS, 13 C-NMR] techniques. Thirty-eight compounds accounting for 90. 4 % of the whole composition were identified. The oil composition was dominated by thymyl derivatives (2, 5 -dimethoxy-p-cymene (37. 2 %), 6 -methoxythymyl isobutyrate (14. 2 %), 10 -isobutyryloxy- 8, 9 -dehydrothymyl isobutyrate (4. 8 %) and thymyl isobutyrate (3. 1 %)), as well as by <b>neryl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (11. 1 %). A new natural compound was isolated and the structure was elucidated as 1 S, 2 S, 5 S, 8 S-modhephan- 3 -one (relative stereochemistry...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEupatorium cannabinum subsp. corsicum (L.) is an endemic {{subspecies}} {{from the}} island of Corsica. The essential oil from the roots of this aromatic plant has been studied by GC, GC-MS and by 13 C-NMR. In contrast to the essential oil from the aerial parts, which is dominated by hydrocarbon compounds (76. 9 %) and particularly by sesquiterpene components (43. 3 %), the essential oil from the roots was characterized by a high content of oxygenated compounds (61. 0 %), particularly oxygenated monoterpenes (54. 0 %). In the root oil, 106 components were identified representing 96. 1 % of the total amount. This oil was dominated by the monoterpenes esters (33 %), the major components of which were <b>neryl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (17. 6 %), thymyl methyl oxide (15. 1 %), - 2 -carene (14. 5 %) and -pinene (5. 7 %). Aromatic esters, nerol derivatives (esters and diesters) and a benzofuran were investigated by GC-MS using different ionization modes including electron impact ionization, and positive- and negative-chemical ionization. These components have not previously {{been reported in the}} essential oil of aerial parts of E. cannabinum from Corsica...|$|E
