The band lent the mobile studio out to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, which used it to record Led Zeppelin III(1970) andLed Zeppelin IV(1971).|$|E
5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference {{compared to the}} TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> such capacities.|$|E

5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E

This limitation overburdens the right of free speech, and a person should not be prevented from raising rationally supported criticism simply because he or she does not have access to formal avenues.|$|E

25|$|Amendment 2's reach may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> {{specific}} laws {{passed for}} the benefit of gays and lesbians. It is a fair, if not necessary, inference from the broad language of the amendment that it deprives gays and lesbians even of the protection of general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings....The state court did not decide whether the amendment has this effect, however, and neither need we.|$|E
25|$|Further, the Court of Appeal {{rejected}} two arguments {{raised by}} the Prosecution circumscribing the scope of fair criticism. In the first place, the Court found that fair criticism should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> criticism that does not question the independence, impartiality and integrity of courts. This would overly restrict the scope of fair criticism and render the concept redundant, given that most allegedly contemptuous statements, by their nature, {{call into question the}} independence, impartiality and integrity of the courts. Furthermore, Commonwealth courts have previously held that imputation of judicial impropriety is not ipso facto scandalizing contempt.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the court's role should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> {{reviewing}} {{such cases}} {{on the classic}} Wednesbury ground of review because to limit the review to the rationality of the decision would make the public authority the judge of its own decision. Ordinarily, a justification for acting against a legitimate expectation would often be sufficient and rational from {{the position of the}} authority regardless of objective judgment. In Ex parte Coughlan, the Court of Appeal also held that the Wednesbury ground of judicial review is not compromised by the doctrine of legitimate expectation. Rather, the latter complements the classic doctrine by providing a further benchmark where public authorities are held accountable to good standards of public administration.|$|E

25|$|Again a {{human rights}} {{commission}} condemned the cramped conditions, so the government had the bars taken off the individual cells, and let the inmates move freely within each cell block. A prison riot in 1984 largely refigured the internal structure of the prison, and left the inmates with a greater measure of freedom to move around {{within the confines of}} the jail. The riot took place on the lower security lower floors; the maximum security cell blocks remained intact. The inmates ripped out the toilets in their cells to assure they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> individual cells again; they ripped out the glass in the visitors booths to assure direct contact with visitors. And they began knocking holes out of the outer walls to communicate between floors and gain access to sunlight. This also gave them a direct way of communicating with the outside world. According to neighbors who lived in apartments across the street from the prison during the 1980s and 1990s, girlfriends, mothers, brothers, friends, would fill the streets below the prison every day to chat with their loved ones living inside its walls.|$|E

500|$|Disagreeing with Douglass, {{and despite}} the racist {{language}} she sometimes resorted to, Stanton firmly believed in a universal franchise that empowered blacks and whites, men and women. Speaking on behalf of black women, she stated that not allowing them to vote condemned African American freedwomen [...] "to a triple bondage that man never knows," [...] that of slavery, gender, and race. She was joined in this belief by Anthony, Olympia Brown, and most especially Frances Gage, {{who was the first}} suffragist to champion voting rights for freedwomen. In her work The Slave’s Appeal, written in 1860, Elizabeth Cady Stanton brings awareness not only to feminism, but also to the issues and struggles of slavery. Although not African American, to convey her message best, she wrote from the perspective of one to show that she viewed women’s suffrage as something that should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> only Caucasian women.|$|E
500|$|... "Apple Shampoo" [...] was {{inspired}} by Elyse Rogers of Dance Hall Crashers, whom Hoppus dated; the title is culled from a particular brand of shampoo she often used. [...] "Josie" [...] makes further reference to Dance Hall Crashers and the band Unwritten Law ("My girlfriend likes UL and DHC"). [...] "A New Hope" [...] takes the standard rock subject matter of a hopeless crush and rewrites it with details of the Star Wars series. The original Star Wars trilogy were popular during Hoppus' childhood into the late 1970s and early 1980s, and a theatrical re-release in the late 1990s reinvigorated interest in the series. [...] "Degenerate" [...] is a re-recording of a track that first appeared on the band's demo cassette Demo #2. [...] "Lemmings" [...] is another re-recorded track, which had previously only been available on a 7-inch. The band felt the song was strong enough that it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> those owning record players.|$|E
500|$|Approached by Rhimes {{about the}} concept, Strickland {{agreed to the}} storyline on the {{conditions}} that it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a single episode and would significantly impact the character. She liked the script, describing it as [...] "humanizing the victims and just really creating a legitimate experience for the audience {{in a way that}} you may not see on network television". As well as communicating with RAINN representatives, the actress visited the Rape Treatment Center at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica and saw a young girl being admitted, which shaped her performance. Strickland also researched reactions to sexual assault by survivors, their friends and families. The decision to portray King's resistance to reporting her rape was reached after consultation with the Rape Treatment Center. Strickland defended the choice, calling it an essential aspect of King's character development. Most of the episode focused on King's psychological response to the rape. According to Strickland, ...|$|E

500|$|They {{call for}} a {{systematic}} and integrated study of literature, uniting literary theory, which outlines {{the basic principles of}} literature; criticism, which critiques individual works; and history, which outlines the development of literature. Although these aspects have clear distinctions, they are in a dialectical relationship and should not be separated; for example, a theory of literature is impossible without referring to works of literature. They reject Historicist approaches to literary history, which they find reduce literary history to [...] "a series of discrete and hence finally incomprehensible fragments" [...] and emphasize the author's intent too greatly. Instead, Wellek and Warren argue that a work must be seen {{from the point of view}} of both its own period and all subsequent periods, as a work's historical meaning is derived from [...] "the history of its criticism by its many readers in many ages." [...] Criticism should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> classical and medieval literature, but also include works by living authors.|$|E
500|$|Humphrey won the party's {{nomination}} on {{the first}} ballot after a two-hour debate among delegates the next day, defeating McCarthy 1759.25 to 601. McGovern finished in third with 146.5, and gave a lukewarm endorsement of Humphrey, asking him to be [...] "his own man". McCarthy refused to make an endorsement, although he privately confided to Humphrey that his supporters would not understand if he immediately showed his support. Humphrey also narrowly won the party plank {{in support of the}} Vietnam War, although his officials pleaded with Johnson to accept a compromise with the doves, which he refused. The results caused the protests to intensify, prompting the use of tear gas, which Humphrey could smell in his hotel room. He also received six death threats. The tactics used to quell the protests were criticized by certain Democrats as being excessive. During his acceptance speech, Humphrey tried to unify the party, stating [...] "the policies of tomorrow need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the policies of yesterday." [...] He asked former Republican candidate Nelson Rockefeller to be his running mate, but he declined. Several other names were mentioned to Humphrey during the convention. Texas Governor John Connally was suggested by a delegation of southern Democratic governors, but the Governor himself suggested Vietnam ambassador Cyrus Vance. O'Brien and Fred Harris appeared to suggest themselves for the position, and adviser Connell also suggested Harris, although Max Kampelman favored former Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver. Humphrey instead decided on Senator and former Governor Edmund Muskie of Maine, who had been his preferred choice. Observers noted the selection of the Senator, active in civil rights and labor and on neither side of the war issue, was a move to appeal to liberals while not upsetting establishment Democrats. Republican nominee Richard Nixon congratulated Humphrey on his victory as the general election campaign began.|$|E
