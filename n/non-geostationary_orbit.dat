40|$|Clusters {{of mobile}} (LEO) satellites, flying at a <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>orbit,</b> have been {{recently}} proposed, designed and made operational for achieving a global coverage of roaming users. An example {{of these is}} Teledesic. The satellites of these clusters are equipped with a radio frequency switch and connected via intersatellite links to form a specific topology. Uncoordinated packet transmission in these systems may result in collisions. Collided packets must be retransmitted, with an obvious degradation in performance, {{in terms of both}} bandwidth usage and delay. This performance degradation can be overcome by a proper scheduling of the packets. In this paper, we consider optimal (namely minimum length) packet scheduling in LEO satellite clusters. We present a preprocessing algorithm which, together with the optimal, polynomial time, packet scheduling algorithm for isolated satellites, produces an optimal schedule in tree-connected clusters.

40|$|The {{part of the}} {{geostationary}} (GEO) {{orbital arc}} used for United States domestic fixed, communications service is rapidly becoming filled with satellites. One of the factors currently limiting its utilization is that communications satellites must be designed to have sufficient capacity to handle peak traffic leads, and thus are under utilized most of the time. A solution is to use satellites in suitable non-geostationary orbits to unload the traffic peaks. Three different designs for a <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> communications satellite system are presented for the 1995 time frame.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is {{developing}} and demonstrating communications and network {{technologies that are}} helping to enable the near-Earth space Internet. GRC envisions several service categories. The first of these categories is direct data distribution or D 3 (pronounced "D-cubed"). Commercially provided D 3 {{will make it possible}} to download a data set from a spacecraft, like the International Space Station. as easily as one can extract a file from a remote server today, using a file transfer protocol. In a second category, NASA spacecraft will make use of commercial satellite communication (SATCOM) systems. Some of those services will come from purchasing time on unused transponders that cover landmasses. While it is likely there will be gaps in service coverage, Internet services should be available using these systems. This report addresses alternative methods of implementing a full duplex enhancement of the GRC developed experimental Ka-Band Direct Data Distribution (D 3) space-to-ground communication link. The resulting duplex version is called the Duplex Direct Data Distribution (D 4) system. The D 4 system is intended to provide high-data-rate commercial direct or internet-based communications service between the NASA spacecraft in low earth orbit (LEO) and the respective principal investigators associated with these spacecraft. Candidate commercial services were assessed regarding their near-term potential to meet NASA requirements. Candidates included Ka-band and V-band geostationary orbit and <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> satellite relay services and direct downlink ("LEO teleport") services. End-to-end systems concepts were examined and characterized in terms of alternative link layer architectures. Alternatives included a Direct Link, a Relay Link, a Hybrid Link, and a Dual Mode Link. The direct link assessment examined sample ground terminal placements and antenna angle issues. The SATCOM-based alternatives examined existing or proposed commercial SATCOM services that could be available in the 2005 time frame. The alternatives were evaluated and compared in terms of average daily system throughput and cost per bit. Throughput was estimated based on hypothetical scenarios supporting the International Space Station and polar orbiting missions.

40|$|A {{rapid growth}} of new {{satellite}} systems utilizing the Ka-band (27 – 40 Ghz) and even higher frequencies is expected in the coming years. The services offered will include broadband communication, interactive broadcasting, multimedia applications, interconnection of local area networks and Internet connectivity. Many of the new systems will use technologies as multiple spot-beams, onboard processing, and switching of packets between beams and inter satellite links. Because of congestion in the lower bands such ad C (4 – 8 Ghz) and Ku-band (12 – 18 Ghz), numerous of these services will use Ka-band. One additional advantage to the spectrum availability at Ka-band is the potential of smaller terminals compared to those used in lower frequency bands. Several mobile satellite systems have recently started operation and more are planned or scheduled for implementation {{within a few years}} to provide personal and data communication at L-band (1 – 2 Ghz) and S-band (2 – 4 Ghz) frequencies. The systems will utilize different orbit types, for example low, medium or geostationary earth orbits, to provide voice and data services to mobile users. Understanding of the propagation aspects is important for successful design of a satellite system obtaining the targeted service quality and availability. For systems operating above about 10 Ghz, attenuation caused by hydrometeor effects is the dominant propagation impairment on line-of-sight (LOS) links. For mobile communications systems operating at lower frequencies, the impairments resulting from multipath propagation, shadowing and blockage from obstacles on the ground severely affect the radio signals. Estimation of dynamic propagation is essential for the design of reliable and spectrum efficient communication systems. The system can adapt the transmission methodology that maximizes the throughput of information and optimizes the delivery time. The design of such mitigation techniques will depend on the dynamics and how often the events occur. The research conducted in this study on mobile propagation effects of terrain at L-band has led to an improved three-state channel model for land mobile satellite systems. The time spent in each of the states is quite realistic, facilitating better simulation of the performance of communication systems. A new methodology was developed to perform large area coverage estimation by calculating satellite visibility for low earth orbit and geostationary constellations based on digital terrain maps. The procedure takes into account large terrain obstacles and procedures a gross overview of the potential area covered with one or several satellites. A photogrammetric technique to assess performance of <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> (NGSO) systems in mid- and high latitude urban areas was used to estimate channel fading and diversity improvement. Some measurements of the maximum obtainable call duration for the Iridium system are included as well. The studies on atmospheric propagation effects between 20 and 60 Ghz included analyses of fade and inter-fade duration statistics, which are important when evaluating fade mitigation techniques and estimating system outages. Fade duration measurements were analyzed and an effort made to find a common statistical fade duration model. Based on this work, a new prediction method for fade durations on satellite-earth paths was developed. This ability to forecast rain attenuation was investigated with the aid of statistical prediction methods and terrestrial measurements on a 60 Ghz link. Finally, beacon measurements at 50 Ghz from Italsat F 1 were used to test and compare available scintillation prediction models. The work has improved the ability to estimate and simulate propagation effects on mobile and fixed satellite system performance. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|The next {{generation}} satellite communication system falls into three categories: broadcast system; beam switched bent pipe, {{also known as}} “network access ” system; and packet switched on-board processing systems. Many of these proposed satellite networks use geostationary <b>orbit</b> (GSO) and <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>orbits</b> (NGSO), e. g., medium earth orbit (MEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) constellations. Exponential growth of internet hosts, {{and the proliferation of}} new user applications warrant the development of new internet infrastructure.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in the co-existence of geostationary satellite <b>orbit</b> (GSO) and <b>non-geostationary</b> satellite <b>orbit</b> (NGSO) satellite networks is to mitigate the in-line interference caused by an NGSO satellite to the GSO earth terminal, while the NGSO satellite is crossing the GSO satellite's illumination zone. The method recommended in ITU-R S. 1325 - 3 involves utilizing a range-based power control on the NGSO satellite for downlink communication to the NGSO earth terminals. In this paper, we investigate a cognitive range-based power control algorithm while {{taking into account the}} imposed interference level to the GSO fixed satellite service (FSS) system. Results show that the proposed cognitive power control algorithm can mitigate the harmful in-line interference on the GSO terminal receiver, while also providing the desired link quality for the NGSO system. More importantly, we formulate and solve an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the inter-site distance (ISD) of the GSO-NGSO earth user-terminals.

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{interference}} between satellite constellation systems, fading and shadowing {{are a major}} problem for the successful performance of communication systems using the allocated L/S frequency bands for <b>Non-Geostationary</b> Earth <b>Orbit</b> (NGEO) satellites. As free spectrum is nonexistent, new systems wishing to operate in this band must co-exist with other users, both satellite and terrestrial. This research is mainly concerned with two subjects. Firstly, band sharing between different systems Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) has been evaluated for maximizing capacity and optimising efficiency of using the spectrum available. For the case of widened channel bandwidth of the CDMA channel, the overlapping was tested under different degrees of channel overlap and different orders of filters. The best result shows that at the optimum degree of channel overlap, capacity increases by up to 21 %. For the case of fixed channel bandwidth, the optimum overlapping between CDMA systems depends on the filtering Roll-off factor and achieves an improvement of the spectrum efficiency of up to 13. 4 %. Also, for a number of narrowband signal users sharing a CDMA channel, the best location of narrowband signals to share spectrum with a CDMA system was found to be {{at the edge of the}} CDMA channel. Simulation models have been constructed and developed which show the combination of DS- CDMA techniques, forward error correction (FEC) code techniques and satellite diversity with Rake receiver for improving performance of interference, fading and shadowing under different environments. Voice activity factor has been considered to reduce the effect of multiple access interference (MAI). The results have shown that satellite diversity has a significant effect on the system performance and satellite diversity gain achieves an improvement up to 6 dB. Further improvements have been achieved by including concatenated codes to provide different BER for different services. Sharing the frequency band between a number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation systems is feasible and very useful but only for a limited number of LEOS satellite CDMA based constellations. Furthermore, satellite diversity is an essential factor to achieve a satisfactory level of service availability, especially for urban and suburban environments...|$|R
