Nonsense suppressors can be generally divided into two classes: a) a mutated tRNA which can bind with a termination codon on mRNA; b) a mutation on ribosomes decreasing the effect of a termination codon. It's believed that nonsense suppressors keep a low concentration in the cell and do not disrupt normal translation most of the time. In addition, many genes do not have only one termination codon, and cells commonly use ochre codons as the termination signal, whose nonsense suppressors are usually inefficient.|$|E
5000|$|Suppressor {{mutations}} {{also occur}} in genes that code for virus structural proteins. To create a viable phage T4 virus (see image), {{a balance of}} structural components is required. An amber mutant of phage T4 contains a mutation that changes a codon for an amino acid in a protein to the nonsense stop codon TAG (see stop codon and nonsense mutation). If, upon infection, an amber mutant defective in a gene encoding a needed structural component of phage T4 is weakly suppressed (in an E. coli host containing a specific altered tRNA - see <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressor),</b> it will produce a reduced number of the needed structural component. As a consequence few if any viable phage are formed. However, {{it was found that}} viable phage could sometimes be produced in the host with the weak <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressor</b> if a second amber mutation in a gene that encodes another structural protein is also present in the phage genome. [...] It was found that the reason the second amber mutation could suppress the first one is that the two numerically reduced structural proteins would now be in balance. For instance, if the first amber mutation caused a reduction of tail fibers to one tenth the normal level, most phage particles produced would have insufficient tail fibers to be infective. However, if a second amber mutation is defective in a base plate component and causes one tenth the number of base plates to be made, this may restore the balance of tail fibers and base plates, and thus allow infective phage to be produced.|$|E

40|$|Ethionine-resistant mutants, mapping at {{the locus}} eth 2 —the product {{of which is}} {{involved}} in pleiotropic regulation of methionine biosynthesis—have been isolated in a strain carrying five ochre nonsense mutations. Selection for <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressors</b> in such a strain led to characterization of several allele-specific but gene non-specific suppressors which are active on the recessive heteroallele eth 2 – 2 (resulting in partial recovery of sensitivity toward ethionine) {{as well as on}} the five other suppressible alleles. Two of these suppressors are unlinked to the eth 2 gene and either dominant or semi-dominant. It is concluded that the mutation eth 2 – 2 resulted in a nonsense codon. Enzyme studies indicate that this mutation results in a complete absence of an active product of gene eth 2, in contrast with the effect of a former mutation eth 2 – 1 which was interpreted as leading to a modified product of this gene (Cherest, Surdin-Kerjan and de Robichon-Szulmajster 1971). This conclusion is based on the absence of repressibility of methionine group I enzymes and the observation that in a heteroallelic diploid, eth 2 – 1 expression is not masked by eth 2 – 2. The <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressors</b> studied lead to at least partial recovery of repressibility of methionine group I enzymes.

Additionally, this allele increased the suppressor efficiency of SRM 2 - 2, a weak tRNA(Gln) ochre suppressor, indicating that the allosuppres sor phenotype is not SUQ 5 -specific. A sup(+) sal 4 - 2 strain also showed a temperature-dependent omnipotent suppressor phenotype, enhancing readthrough of all three termination codons. Combining the sal 4 - 2 allele with an efficient tRNA <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressor</b> (SUP 4) increased the temperature-sensitivity of that strain, indicating that enhanced <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressor</b> levels contribute to the conditional-lethality conferred by the sal 4 - 2 allele. However, UGA suppression levels in a sup(+) sal 4 - 2 strain following a shift to the non-permissive temperature reached a maximum significantly below that exhibited by a non-temperature sensitive SUP 4 suppressor strain.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{decipher}} {{their role in the}} life history and senescence process of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, we have cloned the su 1 and su 2 genes, previously identified as implicated in cytosolic translation fidelity. We show that these genes are the equivalents of the SUP 35 and SUP 45 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encode the cytosolic translation termination factors eRF 3 and eRF 1, respectively. Mutations in these genes that suppress nonsense mutations may lead to drastic mycelium morphology changes and sexual impairment but have little effect on life span. Deletion of su 1, coding for the P. anserina eRF 3, is lethal. Diminution of its expression leads to a <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressor</b> phenotype whereas its overexpression leads to an antisuppressor phenotype. P. anserina eRF 3 presents an N-terminal region structurally related to the yeast eRF 3 one. Deletion of the N-terminal region of P. anserina eRF 3 does not cause any vegetative alteration; especially life span is not changed. However, it promotes a reproductive impairment. Contrary to what happens in S. cerevisiae, deletion of the N terminus of the protein promotes a <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressor</b> phenotype. Genetic analysis suggests that this domain of eRF 3 acts in P. anserina as a cis-activator of the C-terminal portion and is required for proper reproduction...|$|E

Surviving rosy 516 flies transformed with the amber suppressor showed an eye colour intermediate between the original ry 516 stock and the wild-type, suggesting that ry 516 is an amber nonsense mutant.

It is clear that inefficient processing of in-trons from precursor tRNATrp, or inaccurate overall processing, may explain why some of these constructs fail to promote nonsense suppression in vivo. However, deficient processing must be {{only one of the}} reasons why classical tRNATrp-based suppressors have not been characterized, as suppres-sion may still be extremely weak or absent in instances where the in vitro construct can lead to an accumulation of mature tRNATrp.

40|$|A new tRNA, THG 73, {{has been}} {{designed}} and evaluated {{as a vehicle for}} incorporating unnatural amino acids site-specifically into proteins expressed in vivo using the stop codon suppression technique. The construct is a modification of tRNAGln(CUA) from Tetrahymena thermophila, which naturally recognizes the stop codon UAG. Using electrophysiological studies of mutations at several sites of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, it is established that THG 73 represents a major improvement over previous <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressors</b> both in terms of efficiency and fidelity of unnatural amino acid incorporation. Compared with a previous tRNA used for in vivo suppression, THG 73 is as much as 100 -fold less likely to be acylated by endogenous synthetases of the Xenopus oocyte. This effectively eliminates a major concern of the in vivo suppression methodology, the undesirable incorporation of natural amino acids at the suppression site. In addition, THG 73 is 4 - 10 -fold more efficient at incorporating unnatural amino acids in the oocyte system. Taken together, these two advances should greatly expand the range of applicability of the in vivo nonsense suppression methodology...|$|R

The two phenomena differ essentially. Readthrough of UGA in wild-type cells is reduced by inactivation of tufB but is restored to the original level by introducing into the cell plasmid-borne EF-Tu. This shows that the natural UGA leakiness {{is dependent on the}} intracellular concentration of EF-Tu. Strains of E. coli harbouring mutant species of the elongation factor EF-Tu suppress the nonsense codons UAG, UAA and UGA. Suppression shows a codon context dependence. It requires the combined action of two different EF-Tu species: EF-TuAR(Ala 375 [...] Thr) and EF-TuBo(Gly 222 [...] Asp). Cells harbouring EF-TuAR(Ala 375 [...] Thr) and wild-type EF-TuB, or wild-type EF-TuA and EF-TuBo(Gly 222 [...] Asp) do not display suppressor activity. These data demonstrate that mutated tuf genes form an additional class of <b>nonsense</b> <b>suppressors.</b> The requirement for two different mutant EF-Tu species raises the question whether translation of sense codons also occurs by the combined action of two EF-Tu molecules on the ribosome...|$|R
