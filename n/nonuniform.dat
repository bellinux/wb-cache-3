5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against <b>nonuniform</b> noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

25|$|The {{general theory}} for non-baseband and <b>nonuniform</b> samples was {{developed}} in 1967 by Henry Landau. He proved that the average sampling rate (uniform or otherwise) must be twice the occupied bandwidth of the signal, assuming it is a priori known what portion of the spectrum was occupied.|$|E
25|$|These results {{agree with}} those above for <b>nonuniform</b> {{circular}} motion. See also {{the article on}} non-uniform circular motion. If this acceleration is multiplied by the particle mass, the leading term is the centripetal force and the negative of the second term related to angular acceleration is sometimes called the Euler force.|$|E
25|$|The {{sampling}} {{theory of}} Shannon can be generalized {{for the case}} of <b>nonuniform</b> sampling, that is, samples not taken equally spaced in time. The Shannon sampling theory for non-uniform sampling states that a band-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the average sampling rate satisfies the Nyquist condition. Therefore, although uniformly spaced samples may result in easier reconstruction algorithms, {{it is not a}} necessary condition for perfect reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell {{demonstrated}} that a <b>nonuniform</b> solid ring, solid ringlets or a continuous fluid ring would also not be stable, {{indicating that the}} ring must be composed of numerous small particles, all independently orbiting Saturn. Later, Sofia Kovalevskaya also found that Saturn's rings cannot be liquid ring-shaped bodies. Spectroscopic studies of the rings carried out in 1895 by James Keeler of Allegheny Observatory and Aristarkh Belopolsky of Pulkovo Observatory showed Maxwell's analysis was correct.|$|E
25|$|As the {{orientation}} of Earth's orbit changes, each season will gradually start earlier in the year. Precession means the Earth's <b>nonuniform</b> motion (see above) will affect different seasons. Winter, for instance, {{will be in a}} different section of the orbit. When the Earth's apsides are aligned with the equinoxes, the length of spring and summer combined will equal that of autumn and winter. When they are aligned with the solstices, the difference in the length of these seasons will be greatest.|$|E
25|$|The 46 uniform polychora {{constructed}} from the A4, B4, F4, H4 symmetry {{are given in}} this table by their full extended symmetry and Coxeter diagrams. Alternations are grouped by their chiral symmetry. All alternations are given, although the snub 24-cell, with its 3 family of constructions {{is the only one}} that is uniform. Counts in parenthesis are either repeats or <b>nonuniform.</b> The Coxeter diagrams are given with subscript indices 1 through 46.

25|$|Other {{alternation}}s, such as , as an alternation {{from the}} omnitruncated tesseract , {{can not be}} made uniform as solving for equal edge lengths are in general overdetermined (there are six equations but only four variables). Such <b>nonuniform</b> alternated figures can be constructed as vertex-transitive 4-polytopes by the removal of one of two chiral half set of the vertices of the full ringed figure, but will have unequal edge lengths. Just like uniform alternations, they will have half of the symmetry of uniform figure, like +, order 192, is the symmetry of the alternated omnitruncated tesseract.|$|E
25|$|In the {{discussion}} of special relativity, forces played {{no more than a}} background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run {{at the same rate as}} the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a <b>nonuniform</b> gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a global inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, local inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.|$|E

Extreme trans-Neptunian objects that reach high inclination orbits while in the higher order secular resonance can have their perihelia lowered sufficiently for their orbits to intersect that of Neptune or the other giant planets.

2500|$|Giuseppe Cocconi and Edwin Ernest Salpeter (1958) {{theorized that}} inertia {{depends on the}} {{surrounding}} masses according to Mach's principle. <b>Nonuniform</b> distribution of matter thus would lead to anisotropy of inertia in different directions.

In glass factories, molten glass was poured onto a large cooling table and allowed to spread. The resulting glass is thicker at the location of the pour, located at the center of the large sheet. These sheets were cut into smaller window panes with <b>nonuniform</b> thickness, typically with the location of the pour centered in one of the panes (known as [...] "bull's-eyes") for decorative effect.

2500|$|... 1737: French {{mathematician}} Pierre Bouguer made {{a sophisticated}} series of pendulum observations in the Andes mountains, Peru. [...] He used a copper pendulum bob {{in the shape}} of a double pointed cone suspended by a thread; the bob could be reversed to eliminate the effects of <b>nonuniform</b> density. He calculated the length to the center of oscillation of thread and bob combined, instead of using the center of the bob. He corrected for thermal expansion of the measuring rod and barometric pressure, giving his results for a pendulum swinging in vacuum. Bouguer swung the same pendulum at three different elevations, from sea level to the top of the high Peruvian altiplano. Gravity should fall with the inverse square of the distance from the center of the Earth. Bouguer found that it fell off slower, and correctly attributed the 'extra' gravity to the gravitational field of the huge Peruvian plateau. From the density of rock samples he calculated an estimate of the effect of the altiplano on the pendulum, and comparing this with the gravity of the Earth was able to make the first rough estimate of the density of the Earth.|$|E
