The contract was for a 53-year concession to build and operate the road as an early form of public private partnership with the operator paying for the construction and recouping its costs by setting and collecting tolls, allowing for a 3-year construction period followed by 50 years of operation. At the end of this period the infrastructure would be returned to the Government.

25|$|Unlike {{previous}} installments in the Mass Effect series, where players begin {{each new}} game by choosing from six different character classes that each {{have their own}} unique set of skills, players instead have free rein to assign any skills that they want and build towards a specialty {{over the course of}} the game. For example, if the player chooses to invest solely in biotic skills, Ryder will unlock the Adept profile, which results in bonuses related to that play style. Experience points for spending on skills are earned by completing missions, and there is <b>no</b> <b>cap</b> on the number of points that can be earned. Points assigned to each skill can be constantly reallocated so that players can experiment with multiple gameplay approaches without having to restart their games and build up their skills from scratch again.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1879, the {{drawings}} were sent to Sir William Pearce of John Elder & Co. Pearce agreed to build it, and in August Tsar Alexander II gave his assent. Pearce {{and the head of}} the Baltic Shipyard Mikhail Casi, representing Alexander II, signed the contract on September 5, 1879. Pearce agreed to complete the job by July 1, 1880. The deal excluded interior finishes, to be completed in Russia. Unusually for the period, Pearce agreed to guarantee the speed of an experimental craft. According to the contract, the full price was payable only if the ship attained 15 knots. Under-performance was punishable by hefty liquidated damages, and the Russians reserved the right for a full money back guarantee if the ship failed to make 14 knots. They agreed to pay generous premiums if speed and engine power exceeded design targets of 15 knots and 12,000 indicated horsepowers. Pearce was instructed to build his own state-of-the-art steam engines, with <b>no</b> <b>cap</b> on maximum power output. The Russians subscribed to supply the complete electrical system, including arc lighting by Yablochkov candles. The British press discussed the unusual project and concluded it was a test bed for future military ships and their powerplants in particular.|$|E

Moyes (2008) describes this as a [...] "flexible cap" [...] where New Zealand sourced emissions regulated by the NZETS are constrained only by the international market price for GHG emissions.|$|E

500|$|In early September 2009, Rod Oram [...] {{predicted}} that the National Government's goals would be; to adopt intensity-based allocation of free carbon credits to export industries; have <b>no</b> <b>cap</b> on greenhouse gas emissions; to have a temporary cap {{on the price of}} carbon; to delay bringing in sectors into the NZETS; to delay phasing out free emission units; and, maximum alignment with the Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

500|$|In 2007, the Ministry for the Environment {{released}} a detailed report [...] "The Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme" [...] {{which stated the}} NZ ETS {{would not have a}} binding, absolute limit on the total level of emissions allowed in New Zealand. While the quantity of domestic NZ Units gifted to eligible emitters would be fixed, the quantity of international 'Kyoto-compliant' units that could be imported in to match emissions would not be limited. In consequence, as there is no limit on the volume of international emissions units (CERs and ERUs) that may be imported, there is <b>no</b> <b>cap</b> or limit on the volume of emissions permitted in New Zealand provided that emissions units are imported into the country and surrendered. In that respect, the NZ ETS is unlike most other emissions trading schemes, ...|$|E
