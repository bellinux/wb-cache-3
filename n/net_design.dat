40|$|Abstract. —Trap nets {{of varying}} design are {{commonly}} used to assess fish populations, but {{the effect of the}} design on gear selectivity is not well known. In particular, it may be advantageous to use multiple net designs with different mesh and throat sizes to maximize the catch of specific length-classes and to minimize the risk of predation on small fish by larger fish. We compared the species composition, catch rate, and length distribution of fishes caught by three trap net designs with dimensions differing only in mesh size and throat size (0. 6 -cm delta mesh and 3. 8 -cm 3 3. 8 -cm square throats, 1. 3 -cm square mesh and 7. 6 -cm 3 7. 6 -cm square throats, or 2. 5 -cm square mesh and 12. 7 -cm 3 12. 7 -cm square throats). A total of 3, 473 fish of 18 species were captured from Sandy Lake, Portage County, Ohio, during 24 sample dates from June to August 1999. The large <b>net</b> <b>design</b> had a significantly higher average number of species captured (mean 5 11) than the medium or small <b>net</b> <b>design</b> (means 5 9 and 8, respectively). Whereas nets with larger mesh and throat size combinations typically caught larger fish for the six most commonly captured species, only rarely did nets capture fish as large or as small as possible based on their physical dimensions. Specific length-classes of some species were not captured in the nets or were very <b>net</b> <b>design</b> specific, indicating a possible difference in trap net vulnerability of different ontogeneti...|$|E

40|$|Three new {{zooplankton}} <b>nets</b> {{have been}} <b>designed</b> to enable improved collection of zooplankters from ice-covered waters. These nets also enable quantitative sampling of species not adequately sampled by other methods. The first net is a vertical tow net {{which can be}} folded like an umbrella to pass through a small ice hole (10 cm). This 2 ̆ 7 Umbrella Net 2 ̆ 7 takes an integrated sample of zoo-plankton from all sample depths. The second net is a collapsible free-fall <b>net</b> <b>designed</b> to collect mobile zooplankters capable of avoiding towed nets. This was the only net used which was capable of collecting all furcilia stages of Euphausia crystallorophias from Ellis Fjord, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica. The third net is a diver-operated push <b>net</b> <b>designed</b> to collect zooplankters in the top 15 cm of the under-ice water column. Because of the high standing crop of phytoplankton at and near the under-ice surface at particular times of the year, some species of zooplankton tend to congregate there. These species, particularly Paralabidocera antarctica, were collected in great abundance using the push net, but were rare in samples collected by other methods...|$|R
