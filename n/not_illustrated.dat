25|$|On {{the right}} is an {{illustration}} of the electric field vectors of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. The electric field vectors have a constant magnitude but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given {{that this is a}} plane wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a circularly polarized plane wave, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an electromagnetic wave each electric field vector has a corresponding, but <b>not</b> <b>illustrated,</b> magnetic field vector that is at a right angle to the electric field vector and proportional in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.|$|E

Olson described reconstructions {{made for the}} British zoologist Walter Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds and the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachusika's 1953 book The Dodo and Kindred Birds as [...] "rather fanciful". The English artist Frederick William Frohawk based his restoration in the former book on an outline illustration, which was in turn based on a sketch drawn by Herbert, which is now known to depict the red rail. The German zoologist Hermann Schlegel thought it depicted a species of dodo (which he called Didus herbertii) from Rodrigues when he drew the outline in 1854, {{and that it was}} the species mentioned by Leguat.|$|E

2500|$|Our Mutual Friend was {{the first}} of Dickens's novels <b>not</b> <b>illustrated</b> by Hablot Browne, with whom he had collaborated since The Pickwick Papers (1836–37). Dickens chose instead the younger Marcus Stone and, uncharacteristically, left much of the {{illustrating}} process to Stone's discretion. After suggesting only a few slight alterations for the cover, for instance, Dickens wrote to Stone: [...] "All perfectly right. Alterations quite satisfactory. Everything very pretty". Stone's encounter with a taxidermist named Willis provided the basis for Dickens' Mr. Venus, after Dickens had indicated he was searching for an uncommon occupation ("it must be something very striking and unusual") for the novel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1868, {{long before}} the advent of powered {{aircraft}} flight — and within a decade of the birth of both Orville and Wilbur Wright — Boulton patented the first aileron. [...] The aileron system he created was to be actuated by either a hand operated control (<b>not</b> <b>illustrated</b> on the patent's drawings) or by an automatic pendulum control device (depicted on the patent's drawing sheet), with the intended function of a single-axis autopilot. Boulton's inspiration for a lateral flight control device has been attributed to French Count Ferdinand Charles Honore Phillipe d'Esterno, whose detailed analysis of flapping and soaring bird flight, Du Vol des Oiseaux (On the flight of birds) was published as a pamphlet in 1864. Although Boulton's prescient aileron control system was fully functional, he, as did almost everyone of his era, lacked a detailed understanding of aerodynamics, and an airplane he designed never achieved flight.|$|E

[...] Each of these is in a compartment below {{the arms of the}} cross, paired with iconographically unusual female figures; the matching compartments above the arms each contain two angels. [...] Identifications for these lower figures vary; they are described by the Morgan Library as anonymous mourners, [...] "two dishevelled female figures thought to be personifications of Christian souls saluting their Redeemer" [...] as their file note puts it but Peter Lasko, calls them instead [...] "the curiously duplicated figure of St Mary Magdalen (?)" [...] To Needham they are Mary Magdalene and Mary Cleophas.

6000|$|The pencils seem to {{have been}} Apollo's first {{experiment}} in the service of Admetus; but others followed. [...] "I have thoroughly tried school-keeping," [...] he writes, [...] "and found that my expenses were in proportion, or rather out of proportion, to my income; for I was obliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe, accordingly, and I lost my time into the bargain. As I did not teach for the benefit of my fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was a failure. I have tried trade, but I found that it would take ten years to get under way in that, and that then I should probably be {{on my way to the}} devil." [...] Nothing, indeed, can surpass his scorn for all so-called business. Upon that subject gall squirts from him at a touch. [...] "The whole enterprise of this nation is <b>not</b> <b>illustrated</b> by a thought," [...] he writes; [...] "it is not warmed by a sentiment; there is nothing in it for which a man should lay down his life, nor even his gloves." [...] And again: [...] "If our merchants did not most of them fail, and the banks too, my faith in the old laws of this world would be staggered. The statement that ninety-six in a hundred doing such business surely break down is perhaps the sweetest fact that statistics have revealed." [...] The wish was probably father to the figures; but there is something enlivening in a hatred of so genuine a brand, hot as Corsican revenge, and sneering like Voltaire.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{probable}} that the influence of Mr. Browne's art reacted in some degree on Dickens. In the old times every one whom the author invented the artist was pretty certain to caricature. Thus the author may have felt the temptation {{to keep pace with}} the frolic humour of the artist. Mr. Browne cannot be blamed for a tendency to exaggerate noses and other features, which was almost universal in his time. None of us can say what conception would now be entertained of Dickens's characters if Mr. Browne had not drawn them. In the later works of Dickens (when they were illustrated) other artists were employed, as Mr. Stone and Mr. Fildes. These are accomplished painters of established reputation, and they of course avoided the old system of caricature, the old forced humour. But we doubt whether their designs are so intimately associated with the persons in the stories as are the designs of Mr. Browne. The later artists had this disadvantage, that the later novels (except [...] "Great Expectations," [...] which was <b>not</b> <b>illustrated)</b> were neither so good nor so popular as [...] "Pickwick," [...] "Nicholas Nickleby," [...] "Martin Chuzzlewit," [...] "David Copperfield," [...] or even [...] "Bleak House." [...] We never can have any Mr. Micawber but Phiz's indescribably jaunty Micawber. His Mr. Pecksniff is not very like a human being, but his collars and his eye-glass redeem him, and after all Pecksniff is a transcendental and incredible Tartuffe. Tom Pinch is even less sympathetic in the drawings than in the novel. Jonas Chuzzlewit is also [...] "too steep," [...] as a modern critic has said in modern slang. But in the novel, too, Mr. Jonas is somewhat precipitous. Nicholas Nickleby is a colourless sort of young man in the illustrations, but then he is not very vividly presented in the text. Ralph Nickleby and Arthur Gride may pair off with Jonas Chuzzlewit, but who can disparage the immortal Mr. Squeers? From the first moment when we see him at his inn, with the starveling little boys, through all the story, Mr. Squeers is consistently exquisite. In spite of his cruelty, coarseness, hypocrisy, there is a kind of humour in Mr. Squeers which makes him not quite detestable. In [...] "David Copperfield" [...] Mr. Micawber is perhaps the only artistic creation of much permanent merit, unless it be the waiter who consumed David's dinner, and the landlady who gave him a pint of the Regular Stunning. In [...] "Bleak House" [...] Mr. Browne made some credible attempts to be tragic and pathetic. Jo is remembered, and the gateway of the churchyard where the rats were, and the Ghost's Walk in the gloomy domain of Lady Dedlock.|$|E
