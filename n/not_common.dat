5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is <b>not</b> <b>common</b> in the breed, {{although it}} occurs sufficiently often for many breeders {{to have their}} breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are <b>not</b> <b>common.</b> Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E

A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are <b>not</b> <b>common</b> and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E
5|$|Beauty Revealed was {{completed}} {{during a period}} of popularity of portrait miniatures, a medium which had been introduced in the United States in the late 18th century.

The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History describes Beauty Revealed as a play on the eye miniatures which were then popular as tokens of affection in England and France, but <b>not</b> <b>common</b> in the US. Such miniatures allowed portraits of loved ones to be carried by their suitors without revealing the sitters' identities.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is <b>not</b> <b>common,</b> fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E
