50|$|HMS Cilicia {{arrived at}} Freetown on 17 June 1941, and de Neumann volunteered as Second Officer aboard the Royal Navy prize vessel HMS Criton (captured from the Vichy French). HMS Criton sailed from Freetown for the UK on 19 June 1941, but was intercepted by two Vichy France warships, Air France IV and Edith Germaine, on 21 June and sunk by gunfire. Critons crew were escorted under armed guard to Conakry, where the {{executive}} officers were tried and {{found guilty of}} piracy by a Vichy French <b>naval</b> <b>court-martial</b> and imprisoned in Timbuktu. They managed to escape, and walked 400 mi up the Niger River before they were recaptured and returned to Timbuktu. De Neumann was eventually released {{at the end of}} December 1942, and arrived back in the UK aboard the armed merchant cruiser HMS Asturias in mid-January 1943.|$|E
5000|$|On July 19, 1921, a {{subcommittee}} of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs denounced both Daniels and Roosevelt for the methods used in the Newport investigations. The New York Times reported {{that most of the}} details of the affair were [...] "of an unprintable nature", but explained that the committee believed that Daniels and Roosevelt knew that [...] "enlisted men of the navy were used as participants in immoral practices for the purpose of obtaining evidence." [...] The committee report declared that using enlisted men in this way [...] "violated the code of the American citizen and ignored the rights of every American boy who enlisted in the navy to fight for his country." [...] The committee report also made public the earlier determination of a <b>naval</b> <b>court-martial.</b> To that court's assessment that Roosevelt's behavior was [...] "unfortunate and ill-advised", the committee added [...] "reprehensible". Daniels's rejection of the court's judgment, the committee declared, [...] "is to be severely condemned." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{concluding}} {{sections of}} the Articles of War treat of the <b>naval</b> <b>courts-martial</b> before which officers are tried for serious offences {{as well as the}} seamen. The oath administered to members of these courts--which sometimes sit upon matters of life and death--explicitly enjoins that the members shall not [...] "at any time divulge the vote or opinion of any particular member of the court, unless required so to do before a court of justice in due course of law." ...|$|R
500|$|The Admiralty {{division}} {{housed a}} few prisoners under <b>naval</b> <b>courts-martial</b> for mutiny, desertion, piracy, {{and what the}} deputy marshal in 1815 preferred to call [...] "unnatural crimes". Unlike {{other parts of the}} prison that had been built from scratch in 1811, the Admiralty division—as well as the northern boundary wall, the dayroom and the chapel—had been part of the old Borough gaol and were considerably run down. The cells were so rotten they were barely able to confine the prisoners; in 1817 one actually broke through his cell walls. The low boundary wall meant that Admiralty prisoners were often chained to bolts fixed to the floor in the infirmary.|$|R
5000|$|A harsh disciplinarian, Raeder {{was obsessed}} with the fear that the Navy might [...] "disgrace" [...] itself {{as it did in}} the last war with High Seas mutiny of 1918, and to prevent another mutiny, Raeder imposed a [...] "ruthless discipline" [...] {{designed}} to terrorize his sailors into obedience. Under the leadership of Raeder and even more so under his successor Karl Dönitz, it was official policy for <b>naval</b> <b>courts-martial</b> to impose the death penalty as often as possible, no matter how slight the offence, so that the sailors would fear their officers more than the enemy. Historians have described Raeder as someone who [...] "supported the Nazi regime unflinchingly and proved merciless against malingerers, deserters and those who questioned the authority of the Führer".|$|R
5000|$|He the {{commanded}} the destroyer Panthir (1923) {{and the light}} cruiser Elli (1923-25). In June 1924, as captain of the Elli, he participated in the so-called [...] "Navy Strike". Promoted to Captain on 12 October 1925, he again assumed command of the Elli in 1926-27, before commanding the training ship Aris (1927-28) and the battleships Kilkis and Limnos in 1929. In 1929-30 he served as Superior Submarine Commander, {{a position where he}} distinguished himself by the drastic overhaul and modernization of crew training. In 1931 he served briefly as Commander of the Destroyer Flotilla, and subsequently, until 1834, as Chief of the Training Squadron. Promoted to Rear Admiral on 21 February 1934, on 3 March 1935 he was appointed Chief of the Hellenic Navy General Staff, as well as Director-General in the Ministry of Naval Affairs. In May he was president of the Extraordinary <b>Naval</b> <b>Court-Martial</b> that tried the naval officers who had participated in the failed pro-Venizelist March coup attempt. He nevertheless immediately requested, with success, that the death sentences passed out not be carried out. On 10 October, along with the heads of the Army, Lt. General Alexandros Papagos, and the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Georgios Reppas, he toppled the Second Hellenic Republic, restored the Greek monarchy, and installed Georgios Kondylis as Prime Minister and Regent pending the return of the exiled King George II.|$|E
5000|$|On {{reaching}} Plattsburgh, Prévost {{delayed the}} assault until {{the arrival of}} Downie in the hastily completed 36-gun frigate [...] Prévost forced Downie into a premature attack, but then unaccountably failed to provide the promised military backing. Downie was killed and his naval force defeated at the naval Battle of Plattsburgh in Plattsburgh Bay on September 11, 1814. The Americans now had control of Lake Champlain; Theodore Roosevelt later termed it [...] "the greatest naval battle of the war". The successful land defence was led by Alexander Macomb. To the astonishment of his senior officers, Prévost then turned back, saying {{it would be too}} hazardous to remain on enemy territory after the loss of naval supremacy. Prévost was recalled and in London, a <b>naval</b> <b>court-martial</b> decided that defeat had been caused principally by Prévost's urging the squadron into premature action and then failing to afford the promised support from the land forces. Prévost died suddenly, just before his own court-martial was to convene. Prévost's reputation sank to a new low, as Canadians claimed that their militia under Brock did the job and he failed. Recently, however, historians have been more kindly, measuring him not against Wellington but against his American foes. They judge Prévost's preparations for defending the Canadas with limited means to be energetic, well-conceived, and comprehensive; and against the odds, he had achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest.|$|E

50|$|Blake {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the 'Father of the Royal Navy'. As well as being largely responsible for building the largest navy the country had then ever known, from a few tens of ships to well over a hundred, he was first to keep a fleet at sea over the winter. Blake also produced the navy's first ever set of rules and regulations, The Laws of War and Ordinances of the Sea, the first version of which, containing 20 provisions, was passed by the House of Commons on 5 March 1649, with a printed version published in 1652 as The Laws of War and Ordinances of the Sea (Ordained and Established by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England), listing 39 offences and their punishments — mostly death. The Instructions of the Admirals and generals of the Fleet for Councils of War, issued in 1653 by Blake, George Monck, John Disbrowe and William Penn, also instituted the first <b>naval</b> <b>courts-martial</b> in the English navy.|$|R
60|$|In final {{reference}} {{to all that}} has been said in previous chapters touching the severity and unusualness {{of the laws of}} the American Navy, and the large authority vested in its commanding officers, be it here observed, that White-Jacket is not unaware of the fact, that the responsibility of an officer commanding at sea--whether in the merchant service or the national marine--is unparalleled by that of any other relation in which man may stand to man. Nor is he unmindful that both wisdom and humanity dictate that, from the peculiarity of his position, a sea-officer in command should be clothed with a degree of authority and discretion inadmissible in any master ashore. But, at the same time, these principles--recognised by all writers on maritime law--have undoubtedly furnished warrant for clothing modern sea-commanders and <b>naval</b> <b>courts-martial</b> with powers which exceed the due limits of reason and necessity. Nor is this the only instance where right and salutary principles, in themselves almost self-evident and infallible, have been advanced in justification of things, which in themselves are just as self-evidently wrong and pernicious.|$|R

6000|$|The {{disasters}} of 1853-54 cast {{a deeper}} gloom than ever over {{the search for}} Franklin. Moreover, the rising clouds in the East and presently {{the outbreak of the}} Crimean War prevented further efforts. Ships and men were needed elsewhere than in the northern seas. It began to look as if failure was now final, and that nothing more could be done. Following <b>naval</b> precedent, a <b>court-martial</b> had been held to investigate the action of Captain Sir Edward Belcher. 'The solemn silence,' wrote Captain M'Clure afterwards, 'with which the venerable president of the court returned Captain Belcher his sword, with a bare acquittal, best conveyed the painful feelings which wrung the hearts of all professional men upon that occasion; and all felt that there was no hope of the mystery of Franklin's fate being cleared up in our time except by some unexpected miracle.' ...|$|R
