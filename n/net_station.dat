WGBH-TV maintained a splintered operation, basing its master control operations at Newman Catholic Center at Boston University, production facilities (for which it was reserved to use late nights and on weekends) at the studios of CBS affiliate WHDH-TV (channel 5, now defunct; allocation now operated by ABC affiliate WCVB-TV) on Morrissey Boulevard in Boston's Dorchester section, and its film and tape library (including those which were salvaged from the fire) was housed at the studios of fellow <b>NET</b> <b>station</b> WENH-TV (channel 11) in Durham, New Hampshire.|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} of a semi-real time system for synchronizing the Deep Space <b>Net</b> <b>station</b> clocks by radio interferometry was successfully demonstrated on August 30, 1972.

Synchronization accuracies as good as 100 ns rms were achieved between Deep Space Stations 11 and 12, both at Goldstone, Calif. The accuracy can be improved by increasing the system bandwidth until the fundamental limitations due to baseline and source position uncertainties and atmospheric effects are reached.

40|$|A major {{deliverable}} of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) project ``Engineering Development of Advanced Coal-Fired Low-Emissions Boiler Systems`` (LEBS) is {{the design}} of a large, in this case 400 MWe, commercial generating unit (CGU) which will meet the Project objectives. The overall objective of the LEBS Project is to dramatically improve environmental performance of future pulverized coal fired power plants without adversely impacting efficiency or the cost of electricity. The DOE specified the use of near-term technologies, i. e., advanced technologies that partially developed, to reduce NO{sub x}, SO{sub 2 } and particulate emissions to be substantially less than current NSPS limits. In addition, air toxics must be in compliance and waste must be reduced and made more disposable. The design being developed by the ABB Team is projected to meet all the contract objectives and to reduce emission of NO{sub x}, SO{sub 2 } and particulates to one-fifth to one-tenth NSPS limits while increasing <b>net</b> <b>station</b> efficiency significantly and reducing the cost of electricity.

40|$|The Moray Firth Seal Management Plan (MFSMP) was {{introduced}} in Scotland in 2005 as a pilot for resolving conflict between Atlantic salmon fisheries and conservation imperatives for protected harbour and grey seals. This adaptive co-management model is now being applied nationally through the Marine (Scotland) Act (2010). However, no information exists on salmon fishery stakeholders' perceptions of seal predation impacts and related costs, which could influence {{the success of the}} MFSMP and other similar initiatives. In 2006 a questionnaire survey of the 95 salmon rod fisheries in seven major Moray Firth rivers was undertaken, and all 20 active salmon <b>netting</b> <b>stations</b> in the Firth. Forty-five fishery owners, 39 ghillies, 120 anglers and 11 netsmen (representing 17 <b>netting</b> <b>stations)</b> responded. The majority (81 %) believed that seals had a significant or moderate impact on stocks and catches, 77 % believed that all seals were responsible and 47 % supported seal culling. Seals were sighted by 38 % of rod fisheries, and 18 % lost angler days from seal interference. Overall, 0. 2 % of total reported angler days were lost annually. The estimated direct cost of seal interference for responding rod fisheries was £ 14, 960  annum- 1, and losses of catches and damage to nets was £ 16, 500  annum- 1 for responding netsmen. Stakeholders' perceptions were largely inconsistent with their low direct costs and the aims of the MFSMP. Possible reasons for this are discussed, and implications for the governance of future adaptive co-management initiatives for seal-fishery conflict.
