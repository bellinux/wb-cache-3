500|$|In the {{documentary}} Living With Michael Jackson (2003), Michael alleged that {{near the beginning}} of their relationship, the 12-year-old actress tried to seduce the then 17-year-old singer. According to Jackson, the incident happened at her home, where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex. O'Neal's behavior apparently proved too much for Jackson, who became scared and covered his face, before she walked away. When confronted with the allegation, O'Neal claimed to have been [...] "just as shocked as everyone else". She stated that while having respect for Jackson as an artist and a person, he had [...] "a very vivid imagination". The actress described his statements as [...] "inaccurate"; [...] "at 12 years old, there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed". O'Neal released her autobiography A Paper Life in 2004, a year after the Jackson documentary. In the book, she claimed it was Jackson who attempted to make out with her. The actress wrote, [...] "I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter Michael, who was sweating profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. He jumped up nervously and said, 'Uh ... gotta go.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since first {{being brought}} to {{scholarly}} attention in 1958, numerous media sources and publications have asserted {{over the years that}} a single surviving print reportedly showing the only known image of Mozart's widow is that of Constanze (Mozart) Nissen herself at age 78. The photograph, or daguerreotype, was supposedly taken in Altotting, Bavaria in October 1840 outside the home of composer Max Keller. However, several Mozart scholars have refuted the claim as a hoax for various reasons. First, the photograph could not have been taken outdoors since claims that the lenses to produce such images were not invented by Joseph Petzval until after Constanze had died in 1842. Second, it is documented that Constanze was crippled from debilitating arthritis in her final years of life. As Agnes Selby, author of Constanze, Mozart's Beloved, offered her opinion regarding the photograph on the Classical Music Guide Forums website on July 8, 2006: [...] "There is absolutely <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> could have traveled to visit Maximillian Keller during the period when the photograph was taken. Contrary to the statements made in the newspaper, Constanze had no contact with Keller since 1826." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davies felt {{pressure}} to remain true {{to the original}} character of Jo. In an interview with SFX he stated that he watched old episodes of the show [...] "for the first time ever" [...] in planning a story within the Doctor Who universe. He wanted to [...] "preserve the absolute beauty of what Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks did" [...] with Manning's last Doctor Who story, The Green Death. Manning was [...] "surprised at how it all came back" [...] and felt that Davies had [...] "done a wonderful job of showing how Jo has developed over the years". She felt that Jo was still [...] "the young and awestruck girl she was" [...] but [...] "tempered by experience and maturity." [...] Davies expressed his contention that the character had been left [...] "with the promise of happiness, of adventure, of love and joy" [...] {{and it would be}} wrong to interfere with that. At the official Doctor Who Convention 'Panopticon' organized by the Doctor Who Appreciation Society to celebrate the show's 30th anniversary in 1993, Manning was interviewed on stage with Jon Pertwee and insisted that Jo would have divorced Dr Jones, stating [...] "I tell you what, she's left him! The one she went.. <b>no</b> <b>way!</b> <b>She</b> definitely left him. She got half way up the Amazon and said 'this is not going to work'. So I would only come back if she wasn't still married". However, in the commentary for the DVD releases of both The Green Death (revised edition) and Death Of The Doctor, Manning contradicted this statement, stressing that Jo would never have divorced and would have remained with Jones.|$|E
2500|$|All Saints {{returned}} in February 2000 {{with the single}} [...] "Pure Shores", written by Shaznay Lewis and William Orbit for the soundtrack of the film The Beach (starring Leonardo DiCaprio). [...] "Pure Shores" [...] was their fifth number-one single in the UK and the second best-selling single of 2000, with 600,000 copies sold; it also became their first and only number-one single in Ireland and was a substantial hit across Europe and Australia. The song won an Ivor Novello Award for Most Performed Work. All Saints performed the song at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards. In October 2000, All Saints released the single [...] "Black Coffee", which became their sixth and final number-one single in the UK, selling 200,000 copies. This preceded their second studio album, Saints & Sinners, which debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart, eventually reaching double platinum certification in the UK for sales of 600,000 copies. The third and final single was [...] "All Hooked Up" [...] in January 2001, which peaked at number seven. In February 2001, All Saints announced that they were to take a break so that they [...] "could clear the air" [...] between themselves. Melanie Blatt said later that year that it was uncertain if they would reform, citing their difficulties with the financial and business aspects of the group. Shaznay Lewis later explained that the catalyst for the break-up was a disagreement over who would wear a certain jacket for a photoshoot: [...] "I would never in a million years have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident.
