40|$|Based on {{research}} {{conducted at the}} French Ministry of Foreign Affairs' African Cinémathèque, this article explores the narrative and aesthetic manifestations of alienation in francophone West African films {{of the past five}} decades. Rather than examine ‘immigration’ films, it focuses on francophone West African films that interrogate the concept of alienation from points of view firmly grounded within Africa, such as Sembene's <b>Niaye</b> (1964), La Noire de… (1966), and Xala (1974), Samb-Makharam's Et La Neige N'Était Plus (1965), Mambety's Touki Bouki (1973), and Sissako's Waiting for Happiness (2002). The choice to ‘centre’ Africa in this way within Francophone Studies has political value, and seeks to acknowledge the ‘internal’ (psychological) as well as ‘external’ (bodily) dimensions of exile. After a theoretical consideration of alienation in relation to contemporary Africa, the article identifies and analyses similarities that traverse specific films dealing with exilic experience, attempting to account for the prevalence of images of feet, the inscription of voices, and a palimpsestic aesthetic. Ultimately, the article acknowledges the painful and repetitive nature of exile while also arguing that alienation, in the context of francophone West African cinema, has become a source of creativity and psychological survival against hostility from both without and within...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHorticulture {{production}} in Senegal {{is an important}} agricultural activity that is mainly located in the <b>Niayes</b> zone. However, {{the increasing use of}} fertilizers and pesticides to boost {{production in}} order to meet a growing demand has many implications for the environment. The recognition of the negative impact this system of production has on the health of the soil and farmers, but also on the atmosphere with the emission of GHGs, has increased in recent years and some leading NGOs have started promoting organic farming systems. Therefore, the rising level of environmental hazards from conventional farming system made it attractive to farmers in the <b>Niayes</b> to adopt sustainable agriculture practices based on organic farming. A whole farm model is used to study the economic and environmental performances of the organic farming system compared to the conventional farming system in the horticulture production in the <b>Niayes</b> region in Senegal. The gross margin is regarded as the economic indicator, while carbon emissions are regarded as environmental indicators. The results indicate that the organic farming system will be economically more attractive to farmers in the <b>Niayes</b> compared with the conventional farming system only when a premium price is applied to organic crops. Simulation results also reveal that there exist a “win-win” situation for conventional farmers when they go for organic farming for certain types of crops. However, environmental results based on carbon emissions reduction show that organic system is found to be more effective in mitigating climate change. Our study suggests that, through appropriate investment in agro-ecological research to improve organic management and the establishment of a local organic market for organic crops, organic farming can be a very competitive alternative to conventional farming, when it comes to healthy food production with less environmental impact in the horticultural sector. However, further studies are needed on components of sustainable intensification to see which system of production is more profitable for farmers of the <b>Niayes</b> region, but also beneficial for the environment, and at regional and even national levels...|$|R

There are several strategies and methods {{that can be used}} for control, each being more or less efficient depending on several factors. The Government of Senegal wants to sustainably eliminate trypanosomosis from the <b>Niayes</b> region by controlling the tsetse vector, Glossina palpalis gambiensis. To reach this objective, two different strategies may be used: suppression (decrease in tsetse densities) or eradication (remove all the tsetse in the region until last one). For eradication, the approach has to be area-wide, i. e. the control effort targets an entire pest population within a circumscribed area, to avoid any possible reinvasion. Three different tools (microsatellite DNA, mitochondrial DNA and morphometrics) were used, and all showed an absence of gene flow between G. p. gambiensis from the <b>Niayes</b> and from the nearest known population in the south east of the country (Missira). This genetic isolation of the target population leads to the recommendation that an eradication strategy for the <b>Niayes</b> populations is advisable.

40|$|International audienceLocal {{agriculture}} in Senegal {{is dependent on}} truck farming, which is concentrated in the narrow interdunal zone of peat deposits, called ``niayes''. The viability of the <b>niayes</b> significantly depends on the sand dune aquifer, {{as a consequence of}} recent over-pumping. In the present paper, we discuss the ability of GPR to locate the water table, in a highly vegetated interdunal area which includes peat fields, as well as internal dips, which were shown to be complex. Three profiles determined in the interdunal zone have been associated with several boreholes. Analysis of the radargrams clearly shows that 1) the presence of dense vegetation is not a penalising factor; 2) phase inversion in the measured signal could be useful in distinguishing between the presence of a significant water contrast, and that of a strong stratigraphic reflector; 3) in sand dunes, the electromagnetic contrast resulting from a wetting front is likely to be of the same order as that of the water table.

40|$|The {{riverine}} tsetse species Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank 1949 (Diptera: Glossinidae) inhabits riparian forests along river {{systems in}} West Africa. The government of Senegal {{has embarked on}} a project to eliminate this tsetse species, and African animal trypanosomoses, from the <b>Niayes</b> area using an area-wide integrated pest management approach. A stratified entomological sampling strategy was therefore developed using spatial analytical tools, remote sensing and mathematical modeling. A preliminary phyto-sociological census identified eight types of suitable habitat, which could be discriminated from LandSat 7 ETM+ satellite images and denominated wet areas. At the end of March 2009, 683 unbaited Vavoua traps had been deployed, and the observed infested area in the <b>Niayes</b> was 525 km 2. In the remaining area, a mathematical model was used to assess the risk that flies were present despite a sequence of zero catches. The analysis showed that this risk was above 0. 05 in 19 % of this area that will be considered as infested during the control operations. The remote sensing analysis that identified the wet areas allowed a restriction of the area to be surveyed to 4 % of the total surface area (7, 150 km 2), whereas the mathematical model provided an efficient method to improve the accuracy and the robustness of the sampling protocol. The study thus allowed defining the limits of the target population for the eradication campaign. This entomological sampling procedure might be used for other vector or pest control scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Tsetse flies are vectors {{of human}} and animal trypanosomoses in sub-Saharan Africa and are {{the target of the}} Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). Glossina palpalis gambiensis (Diptera: Glossinidae) is a {{riverine}} species that is still present as an isolated metapopulation in the <b>Niayes</b> area of Senegal. It is targeted by a national eradication campaign combining a population reduction phase based on insecticide-treated targets (ITTs) and cattle and an eradication phase based on the sterile insect technique. In this study, we used species distribution models to optimize control operations. We compared the probability of the presence of G. p. gambiensis and habitat suitability using a regularized logistic regression and Maxent, respectively. Both models performed well, with an area under the curve of 0. 89 and 0. 92, respectively. Only the Maxent model predicted an expert-based classification of landscapes correctly. Maxent predictions were therefore used throughout the eradication campaign in the <b>Niayes</b> to make control operations more efficient in terms of deployment of ITTs, release density of sterile males, and location of monitoring traps used to assess program progress. We discuss how the models' results informed about the particular ecology of tsetse in the target area.

Obtaining stable and durable resistances seems the most effective solution for controlling the disease. In this context, a breeding programme with two steps was conducted in the <b>Niayes</b> ecological area of Senegal: i) 41 tomato varieties from different origins were screened to assess their reaction to TYLCV disease, ii) 12 resistant varieties and two susceptible were tested in an experimental field. The first step was a preliminary trial in unreplicated plots, to identify promising varieties. However, disease assessments (incidence and severity) were done three times and we used longitudinal data analyses to classify the varieties for resistance. Yields in t/ha were also measured for the different varieties. Among our accessions, Roma VF and Xina known for their susceptibility, and Nadira known for its tolerance, were used as controls. Our results revealed 12 resistant varieties, 16 tolerant varieties and 8 susceptible varieties. The yield values were well correlated to the resistance measured by both incidence and by severity right from the second date of symptom observations, at the time of flowering. TYLCV disease is thus one of the main factors limiting tomato-growing the <b>Niayes</b> agro-ecological area. The second step of the selection process was done in a complete block design with three replications. This trial allowed a confirmation of the 12 resistant varieties. The final selection of the varieties took into account the other traits, like yield and traits related to the fruit characters. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Background: African horse {{sickness}} (AHS) is an equine disease {{endemic to}} Senegal. The African horse sickness virus (AHSV) is {{transmitted to the}} mammalian hosts by midges of the Culicoides Latreille genus. During the last epizootic outbreak of AHS in Senegal in 2007, 1, 169 horses died from this disease entailing an estimated cost of 1. 4 million euros. In spite of the serious animal health and economic implications of AHS, very {{little is known about}} determinants involved in transmission such as contact between horses and the Culicoides species suspected of being its vectors. Methods: The monthly variation in host/vector contact was determined in the <b>Niayes</b> area, Senegal, an area which was severely affected by the 2007 outbreak of AHS. A horse-baited trap and two suction light traps (OVI type) were set up at each of five sites for three consecutive nights every month for one year. Results: Of 254, 338 Culicoides midges collected 209, 543 (82. 4 %) were female and 44, 795 (17. 6 %) male. Nineteen of the 41 species collected were new distribution records for Senegal. This increased the number of described Culicoides species found in Senegal to 53. Only 19 species, of the 41 species found in light trap, were collected in the horse-baited trap (23, 669 specimens) largely dominated by Culicoides oxystoma (22, 300 specimens, i. e. 94. 2 %) followed by Culicoides imicola (482 specimens, i. e. 2. 0 %) and Culicoides kingi (446 specimens, i. e. 1. 9 %).

But we also used those models to map the potential distribution of G. p. gambiensis through our area of study. Theoretical knowledge on the species were operated through the theory of ecological nichesfrom which distribution models are based.

Parasitism due to O. sokolowskii was greater during {{the first part of the}} dry season whereas parasitism due to A. litae was greater during the second part of the dry season. Parasitism due to Brachymeria sp. was not affected by time of season but was greater in the Centre and North than in the South of <b>Niayes.</b> Parasitism due to C. vestalis was equal in the three zones but was higher in the late part of the dry season. The diversity of parasitoids was constant across zones but was greater during the second part of dry season. A positive relationship between diversity (Shannon diversity index H′) and parasitism rate was observed, suggesting a positive effect of parasitoid diversity on natural pest control. Parasitoids have a promising role to play as biocontrol agents of P. xylostella populations in Senegal, provided significant changes to current insecticide use are made. Better knowledge of their resource requirements including crop and non-crop habitats, and provision of these in and around crops is also needed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{patterns}} {{of variation in}} cestode communities of 3 abundant rodent species that live in sympatry in the <b>Niayes</b> of the Retba Lake, Western Senegal. We evaluated whether the host species have the same parasites and, within host species, whether the variability in parasite community is related to intrinsic (sex, age of the host individual) or extrinsic (habitat, season) factors. Arvicanthis niloticus was parasitized by 2 cestode species, namely Inermicapsifer madagascariensis and the highly dominant Raillietina trapezoides. henna baeri was the only cestode species found in Mastomys erythroleucus, {{and there was no}} cestode in M. huberti. Prevalence and abundance levels of cestodes were very high in A. niloticus, especially in adults. Seasonal and habitat effects were found in both cestode communities of M. erythroleucus and A. niloticus. Local host specificity and abundance/prevalence levels suggested variations in the interaction between rodents and cestode intermediate host species among habitats and seasons...|$|R
40|$|Isolated tsetse populations {{constitute}} {{a target for}} tsetse control programmes in endemic countries, since their isolation, if demonstrated, allows control without reinvasion risk from neighbouring populations. Population genetic parameters, such as the fixation index, have proven useful to assess isolation status, and should also give important information on the divergence time since isolation. We gathered results obtained from different datasets regarding several examples of putatively totally isolated tsetse populations of different tsetse species: Glossina palpalis gambiensis in Guinea, in the <b>Niayes</b> of Senegal, and in the sacred wood of Bama in Burkina Faso; G. tachinoides from Bitou and Pama in South-East Burkina Faso. The different levels of isolation were compared to differentiation between the two subspecies G. p. gambiensis and G. p. palpalis which both occur allopatrically along the Comoe River in Ivory Coast. We also use some historical evidence to calibrate differentiation speed and give estimates of time since separation for the different cases studied. Discrepancies mostly come from underestimate of effective population sizes, and we propose improving sampling design and genetic markers quality to circumvent such caveats. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The Government of Senegal has {{embarked}} since several {{years on a}} project that aims to create a tsetse-free area in the <b>Niayes.</b> The project was implemented using an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) strategy where the sterile flies used for the sterile insect technique (SIT) component were derived from a colony originating from Burkina Faso. Monitoring {{the efficacy of the}} sterile male releases requires the discrimination between wild and sterile males that are sampled in monitoring traps. Before being released, sterile males were marked with a fluorescent dye powder. The marking was however not infallible with some sterile flies only slightly marked or some wild flies contaminated with a few dye particles in the monitoring traps, making it difficult to discriminate between wild and sterile males using a UV camera. We developed a molecular technique based on the cytochrome oxidase gene that efficiently discriminates between wild and sterile males. This tool might be useful for other tsetse control campaigns with a SIT component or for other vector or insect pest control programs...|$|R
40|$|Background The role of {{environmental}} factors in driving adaptive trajectories of living organisms {{is still being}} debated. This {{is even more important}} to understand when dealing with important neglected diseases and their vectors. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we analysed genetic divergence, computed from seven microsatellite loci, of 614 tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina palpalis palpalis, major vectors of animal and human trypanosomes) from 28 sites of West and Central Africa. We found that the two subspecies are so divergent that they deserve the species status. Controlling for geographic and time distances that separate these samples, which have a significant effect, we found that G. p. gambiensis from different landscapes (<b>Niayes</b> of Senegal, savannah and coastal environments) were significantly genetically different and thus represent different ecotypes or subspecies. We also confirm that G. p. palpalis from Ivory Coast, Cameroon and DRC are strongly divergent. Conclusions/Significance These results provide an opportunity to examine whether new tsetse fly ecotypes might display different behaviour, dispersal patterns, host preferences and vectorial capacities. This work also urges a revision of taxonomic status of Glossina palpalis subspecies and highlights again how fast ecological divergence can be, especially in host-parasite-vector systems...|$|R
