40|$|Background: <b>Non-documented</b> {{palpitations}}, or phantom tachycardias, are palpitations {{deemed to}} be of unknown origin after evaluation with conventional diagnostic tools, such as 12 -lead electrocardiogram and Holter recordings. Our aim {{was to determine the}} diagnostic value of an electrophysiologic study (EPS) and its role in the management of patients presenting with <b>non-documented</b> palpitations. Methods: We performed EPS in 78 consecutive patients with repeatable, poorly tolerated symptoms of paroxysmal, <b>non-documented</b> tachycardia, the absence of structural heart disease and at least one 24 -h Holter recording. The duration and frequency of palpitations was registered in each patient. Results: Long-lasting palpitations (> 1 hour) were present in 15. 4 % of patients. Half of patients reported symptoms less often than once per week. Only 13 / 78 patients (16. 6 %) had normal EPS findings, while dual pathways at the AV node Â± echo beats were identified in another 13 patients without inducible tachycardia. At least one tachycardia event was induced in 52 patients (66. 6 %). AVNRT was provoked in 32 patients (41. 2 %). Ablation was performed in 14 / 52 patients with inducible tachycardia (26. 9 %). Slow pathway ablation was also performed in three patients with dual AV pathways and atrial echo-beats but without provoked tachycardia. Follow-up data were available in 52 patients, and 84. 6 % had fewer or no clinical recurrences. Conclusions: EPS is safe and of enhanced diagnostic value in patients with unexplained palpitations because only 1 / 6 had negative results. EPS also provided an explanation about the mechanism of arrhythmia and successfully guided the management of these patients, as well as enhanced improvement in the quality of life...|$|R

40|$|The {{conversion}} of document image to its electronic version {{is a very}} important problem in the saving, searching and retrieval application in the official automation system. For this purpose, analysis of the document image is necessary. In this paper, a hierarchical classification structure based on a two-stage segmentation algorithm is proposed. In this structure, image is segmented using the proposed two-stage segmentation algorithm. Then, the type of the image regions such as document and <b>non-document</b> image is determined using multiple classifiers in the hierarchical classification structure. The proposed segmentation algorithm uses two algorithms based on wavelet transform and thresholding. Texture features such as correlation, homogeneity and entropy that extracted from co-occurrenc matrix and also two new features based on wavelet transform are used to classifiy and lable the regions of the image. The hierarchical classifier is consisted of two Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a database consisting of document and <b>non-document</b> images that provides from Internet. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed approach in the region segmentation and classification.

40|$|With today's {{advances}} in Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) searching technology, {{a lot of}} <b>non-document</b> content has become searchable and usable. In the near future, since {{a huge amount of}} content is distributed over the networks, not only index server searching but also P 2 P searching will become important because of its scalability and robustness. Typical P 2 P contents sharing services have some problems, such as low search precision ratio, significant increase in traffic and inundations of malicious content such as virus. In this paper, with ideas of the CAN (Content Addressable Network) topology and a vector space method where vectors have a variable length, we propose a new P 2 P content searching method in which a query is effectively forwarded only to peers that have indices of content semantically similar to the desired one but not forwarded to the same peer repeatedly. The main part of our proposal is to map <b>non-document</b> content to a vector space based on users' evaluation and to manage vector space or to route queries using the CAN topology control. The effectiveness of the proposal is shown both by analytical estimations and simulation experiments. Our simulation experiments clarify that the proposed method is effective in improving the precision and recall ratios while reducing the amount of traffic compared with the Gnutella flooding and the vector space method in which vector lengths are fixed (close to pSearch method). In particular, when {{there is a lot of}} malicious content, the proposed method exhibited a higher precision ratio than other methods. </p...|$|E

Deploying such a system using current text recognition systems, however, is difficult since even state-of-the-art systems have difficulty reading text from <b>non-document</b> images. Despite these difficulties we present a series of additions to the typical mapping pipeline that nevertheless allow us to create highly usable results.

In this framework, using a two-stage segmentation algorithm (consisting of wavelet-based and threshold-based segmentation algorithms) and hierarchical classification by two multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers and a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, a document image divides to text, pure picture and logo candidate regions.

Because observation of inpatients is challenging, chart abstraction {{is an attractive}} option. However, the quality of inpatient charts is unknown. We employed three methods in five hospitals to assess 11 signs of malaria and severe disease: 1) chart abstraction (probability sample of inpatients), 2) chart abstraction compared to interviews of inpatients and health workers (HWs), and 3) abstraction from charts of recently discharged inpatients compared to interviews with HWs. Method 1 showed that of 473 malaria signs (from 43 charts), 178 (38 %, 95 % confidence interval 24 â 51 %) were documented. Method 2 showed that 96 % (45 of 47) of documented signs were valid.
