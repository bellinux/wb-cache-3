A new nematode species, Proparasitylenchus <b>californicus</b> <b>n.</b> sp., is described from the intertidal rove beetle Tarphiota geniculata (Mäklin) (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) in California, USA. The new species differs from European representatives of the genus by possessing a cleft stylet in both sexes. The parasitic female is ovoviviparous and produces numerous juveniles that moult twice in the beetle host, then exit and moult twice to the adult stage in the environment. After mating, the free-living fertilised females enter a new host. Heavy infections sterilise the beetles. This is the first record of the genus Proparasitylenchus Wachek, 1955 in the New World and the first allantonematid parasite of a marine, intertidal beetle...|$|R
40|$|Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis) and California Gulls (L. californicus) {{have been}} implicated in depredations on {{migrating}} salmon smolt in the Columbia River. As part of a gull management program conducted in 1995 and 1996, we collected L. delawarensis (n = 120) and L. <b>californicus</b> (<b>n</b> = 45) near Priest Rapids Dam, Washington, and analyzed stomach contents to determine food habits and thus the importance of fish in gull diets. Percent volume measurements and index of relative importance rankings suggested a greater reliance on fish by L. californicus than by L. delawarensis. Peak percent consumption of fish by both species occurred in May, coinciding with peak salmon outmigration through Priest Rapids Dam; and for both species number of fish consumed by gulls was higher below Priest Rapids Dam. Gulls collected prior to, and after, peak smolt migration indicated low importance rankings for fish in both L. delawarensis and L. californicus diets. However, the importance ranking of fish in gull diets changed over time and was higher for both species as the smolt migration peaked in May...|$|R

The new genus with type species, Ekphymatodera thomasoni n. gen., n. sp., shares many characteristics with Hylonema Luc, Taylor, &Cadet, 1978, but it is distinguished by its much greater vulva-anus distance and unique cuticular pattern. Hypotheses of relationships of Ekphymatodera and Hylonema with Sarisodera Wouts and Sher, 1971 versus Heterodera Schmidt, 1871 are discussed.

40|$|The generalist {{predatory mite}} Amblyseius swirskii is an {{economically}} important {{biological control agent}} of several key pests in greenhouses, such as whiteflies, thrips, eriophyid mites and broad mites. The use of artificial and factitious foods can reduce {{the costs associated with}} the rearing of this natural enemy. These foods can also give the predator a head-start upon release or support its populations in the crop in times of prey scarcity so as to reduce the frequency of releases. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop alternative food sources for A. swirskii in support of it mass production and use as food supplements to sustain it populations after release in the crop. Two factitious foods (Ephestia kuehniella eggs and decapsulated cysts of Artemia franciscana) and meridic artificial diets (composed of honey, sucrose, tryptone, yeast extract, and egg yolk) supplemented with pupal hemolymph of Antheraea pernyi, with E. kuehniella eggs, with A. franciscana cysts or prepupal hemolymph of Hermetia illucens were investigated. The predatory mite performed best on decapsulated Artemia cysts and the artificial diet enriched with these cysts, indicating the potential for use of these foods in (parts of) the production cycle of the predator. A powdered artificial diet supplemented with A. franciscana cysts is believed to have potential for use as a supplemental food to sustain populations of the predatory mite in greenhouse crops. Further, our findings indicate the potential of using H. illucens as a cheap source of hemolymph in artificial diets for predatory mites and possibly other predatory arthropods. The artificial diet supplemented with A. franciscana also supported the development and reproduction of four species of other phytoseiid mites which are commercially available for biological control (Neoseiulus <b>californicus,</b> <b>N.</b> cucumeris, Amblyseius andersoni, and Amblydromalus limonicus) ...|$|R
40|$|Solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) {{radiation}} is deleterious to plant-dwelling mites. Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) is a predominant predator of agriculturally important pest species of spider mite. However, phytoseiid mites {{are more vulnerable}} to UVB radiation than spider mites. Thus, the UVB radiation may influence decision making in foraging phytoseiid mites whether disperse or not. We tested the difference in impact and behavioral response among wavelengths of monochromatic UV radiation using a spectroscopic light source in <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> in the laboratory. We also examined whether the behavioral responses of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> females to UV radiation varied based {{on the presence of}} prey (Tetranychus urticae Koch) eggs and residues (webs and excreta of T. urticae: foraging cue). The impact of UV radiation on the <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> egg hatchability varied drastically between wavelengths of ≤ 300 nm (0 %) and ≥ 310 nm (100 %). The <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> females escaped from UV radiation more quickly when they were irradiated with UV at shorter wavelength. Presence of T. urticae eggs had no effects arresting the escape of phytoseiid mites. In contrast, prey residues (including eggs) markedly detained <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> females from escaping under UV irradiation at ≥ 310 nm. However, <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> females quickly escaped when irradiated with UV at harmful 300 nm wavelength, regardless of prey cues. This indicates that the eyeless phytoseiid mite is capable of perceiving UV radiation, and whether escape or not is determined on the basis of harmful/harmless UV wavelength and presence/absence of foraging cues...|$|E
40|$|When {{multiple}} predator {{species are}} introduced to control a single prey species, predator species may act synergistically if {{the rate of mortality}} of the prey exceeds the rate of mortality from all single predator species combined. Alternatively, the release of multiple predator species may yield a lower than expected prey mortality due to competitive interactions (including intraguild predation) amongst predators. The question of whether and when multiple natural enemies interact to produce lower or higher prey mortality than each predator species acting alone depends on the details of predator-predator interactions. In this study, we investigated whether combined releases of Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus provide better biological control of Tetranychus cinnabarinus on strawberry than releases of each predator species alone. Experiments were conducted in two commercial strawberry fields (Fragaria ananassa Duch. cv. ‘Camarosa’). The release of P. persimilis alone and the combined release of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> and P. persimilis reduced the numbers of T. cinnabarinus on strawberry equally. The densities of T. cinnabarinus in the treatment with <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> alone were significantly higher than in the other treatments, and this was the only treatment in which the economic injury level was surpassed. The densities of P. persimilis in absence of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> were similar to those in presence of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus.</b> Hence, there was no significant adverse effect of the presence of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> on the densities of P. persimilis. The densities of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> in the absence of P. persimilis were lower than the densities in the presence of P. persimilis, but this difference was not significant.

The present study aimed to characterize molecular and morphological intraspecific variations for assisting in the diagnosis of the species and to build baseline information about expected variations within a commercially important phytoseiid species. Morphological and molecular [12 S rRNA, cytochrome b mitochondrial (mt) DNA, and internal transcribed spacer] analyses were carried out on fourteen populations collected worldwide and on one mass-reared strain. The genetic distances between the specimens of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> and another related species were high and no overlap was observed, sustaining the reliability of such molecular methods for assisting a specific diagnosis. Furthermore, the genetic distances between populations of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> were very low and overlap between intra- and interpopulations distances was observed, except for two populations collected in France (Marsillargues and Midi-Pyrénées).

40|$|Abstract. Species at {{the same}} trophic level may {{interact}} through competition for food, but can also interact through intraguild predation. Intraguild predation is widespread at {{the second and third}} trophic level and the effects may cascade down to the plant level. The effects of intraguild predation can be modified by antipredator behaviour in the intraguild prey. We studied intraguild predation and antipredator behaviour in two species of predatory mite, Neoseiulus californicus and Phytoseiulus persimilis, which are both used for control of the two-spotted spider mite in greenhouse and outdoor crops. Using a Y-tube olfactometer, we assessed in particular whether each of the two predators avoids odours emanating from prey patches occupied by the heterospecific predator. Furthermore, we measured the occurrence and rate of intraguild predation of different developmental stages of P. persimilis and <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> on bean leaves in absence or in presence of the shared prey. Neither of the two predator species avoided prey patches with the heterospecific competitor, both when inexperienced with the other predator and when experienced with prey patches occupied by the heterospecific predator. Intraguild experiments showed that <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> is a potential intraguild predator of P. persimilis. However, P. persimilis did not suffer much from intraguild predation as long as the shared prey was present.

40|$|Ambient ultraviolet-B (UVB) {{radiation}} impacts plant-dwelling arthropods including herbivorous and predatory mites. However, {{the effects}} of UVB on prey-predator systems, such as that between the herbivorous spider mite and predatory phytoseiid mite, are poorly understood. A comparative {{study was conducted to}} determine the vulnerability and behavioral responses of these mites to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. First, we analyzed dose-response (cumulative irradiance-mortality) curves for the eggs of phytoseiid mites (Neoseiulus californicus, Neoseiulus womersleyi, and Phytoseiulus persimilis) and the spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) to UVB radiation from a UV lamp. This indicated that the phytoseiid mites were more vulnerable than the spider mite, although P. persimilis was slightly more tolerant than the other two phytoseiid mites. Second, we compared the avoidance behavior of adult female <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> and two spider mite species (T. urticae, a lower leaf surface user; Panonychus citri, an upper leaf surface user) in response to solar UV and visible light. <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> actively avoided both types of radiation, whereas P. citri showed only minimal avoidance behavior. T. urticae actively avoided UV as well as <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> but exhibited a slow response to visible light as well as P. citri. Such variation in vulnerability and avoidance behavior accounts for differences in the species adaptations to solar UVB radiation. This may be the primary factor determining habitat use among these mites on host plant leaves, subsequently affecting accessibility by predators and also intraguild competition...|$|E

Furthermore, in clementine nurseries, tender foliage is highly susceptible to attack and natural enemies are almost always absent. Therefore, acaricides are often used indiscriminately. Alternative control measures are necessary, both in commercial orchards and clementine nurseries. In order to assess the efficacy of inoculative releases of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> and P. persimilis to reduce T. urticae populations in young Spanish clementine plants, a semi-field experiment was conducted and repeated in three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). Phytoseiulus persimilis was highly effective in reducing both T. urticae infestations and the damage level inflicted on plants at both release rates evaluated (40 and 80 phytoseiids/plant) and all three periods considered. By contrast, <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> demonstrated low performance under certain conditions.

40|$|Biological {{control of}} Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), a key pest of clementines, can be {{improved}} in this crop {{with the establishment of}} a ground cover of Festuca arundinacea Schreber (Poaceae). This cover houses an abundant and diverse community of predatory Phytoseiidae mites including Euseius stipulatus (Athias-Henriot), Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes, Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) and Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and a dense population of the grass thrips Anaphothrips obscurus Müller (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) throughout the year. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the presence of this thrips species could be related to the improvement in the biological control of T. urticae. Therefore, the capacity of the abovementioned phytoseiids to feed and reproduce on A. obscurus and their feeding preferences when T. urticae and A. obscurus were simultaneously offered, were analyzed. The results show that E. stipulatus, N. barkeri and <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> have a type II functional response when offered A. obscurus nymphs, whereas P. persimilis barely feeds on this thrips species. Furthermore, N. barkeri and <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> can reproduce feeding only on thrips. Regarding prey preference, the Tetranychus spp. -specialist P. persimilis preferably preyed on T. urticae, the generalists N. barkeri and E. stipulatus preferred A. obscurus, and the selective predator of tetranychid mites <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> showed no preference. Therefore, we hypothesize that the enhanced biological control of T. urticae observed could be related to A. obscurus becoming an alternative prey for non-specialist phytoseiids, without altering the control exerted by the T. urticae-specialist P. persimilis and likely reducing intraguild predation...|$|E

Individuals of either predator {{were randomly selected from}} colonies of well-fed, mixed-age adult females and moved to test plants. When tested separately in each plant system, median leaf positions of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> from the point of release were greater than those of N. fallacis at 1 - 8 d. A fan placed in front of a common source unit (1 x 3 m) containing T. urticae and near equal densities of both predaceous mites, provided continuous air (wind) to 3 isolated receiver units located 2. 5, 5, and 7. 5 m downwind. Receiver units consisted of continuous bean foliage with excess T. urticae, but no predators. Wind speeds at the source and each receiver unit averaged 2. 2, 0. 9, 0. 4, and 0. 03 m/s respectively. As predators eliminated prey, N. fallacis dispersed earlier at higher prey densities and further downwind than <b>N.</b> <b>californicus,</b> but cumulative densities of each predator in all receiver units were alike after 20 d. Results of both plant movement studies supported the hypothesis that <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> has dispersal traits more like those of a generalist predator of spider mites than does N. fallacis. Spatial patterns of dispersal and biological control of pest mites are discussed in relation to predation types within the Phytoseiidae...|$|E

Foram testados tebufenozida, fosmete, metidationa, clorpirifós, abamectina, fenpiroximato, piridabem, captana, mancozebe (duas dosagens) e ditianona. Para o cálculo do efeito total (E%) sobre os adultos, avaliaram-se a mortalidade, a oviposição e a viabilidade dos ovos, e para os imaturos, somente a mortalidade. Os resultados do E% foram avaliados 96 horas após a pulverização. Os produtos foram classificados quanto ao efeito total (E%) de toxicidade proposta pela IOBC/WPRS. Fosmete, tebufenozida e metidationa foram inócuos; abamectina, fenpiroximato, clorpirifós, captana, mancozebe (nas duas dosagens testadas) e ditianona foram levemente nocivos, e piridabem foi moderadamente nocivo aos adultos de <b>N.</b> <b>californicus.</b> O fungicida mancozebe, na maior dosagem (320 g,i. a. / 100 L), foi o que mais afetou o ácaro predador. Quanto à seletividade dos agrotóxicos aos imaturos, constatouse que abamectina e piridabem foram moderadamente nocivos, e os demais foram inócuos. Nenhum produto foi classificado como nocivo, evidenciando a tolerância de <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> a estes agrotóxicos.

The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the side effects of the main pesticides used in adult and immature Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). The tests were carried out in the laboratory by using the contact and residual spraying method on the leaf surface. It was tested tebufenozide, phosmet, methidation, chlorpyrifos, abamectin, fenpyroximate, pyridaben, captan, mancozeb (two concentrations) and dithianon. To calculate the total effect (E%) on the adults, it was evaluated the mortality, oviposition and viability of eggs, and for the immature ones, only the mortality. The results of E% were assessed 96 hours after the spraying. The products were classified considering the total effect (E%) of toxicity proposed by the IOBC/WPRS. Phosmet, tebufenozide and methidation were innocuous; abamectin, fenpyroximate, chlorpyrifos, captan, mancozeb (two concentrations), and dithianon were slightly harmful, and pyridaben was moderately harmful to the <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> adults. As the pesticide selectivity for the immature ones, it was verified that abamectin and pyridaben were moderately harmful, and the others were innocuous.

40|$|Neoseiulus californicus {{has been}} the {{dominant}} mite predator in the Elgin district of the Western Cape Province, South Africa, since the 1994 / 95 season {{when it was first}} recorded. During the 2002 / 03 season relatively high numbers of Euseius addoensis, a local specialist pollen feeder/generalist predator, were also recorded. While <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> has been present, population levels of the phytophagous mites, Tetranychus urticae and Panonychus ulmi, have declined steadily. <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> usually appeared when there were between two and four phytophagous mites per leaf. However, during the 2001 / 02 and 2002 / 03 seasons, it was recorded before the phytophagous mites appeared. The population peak of phytophagous mites usually varied between an average of two to 13 mites per leaf, while during the 2001 / 02 and 2002 / 03 seasons the phytophagous mite population peaked at less than one mite/leaf. Prior to the appearance of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus,</b> apple orchards in the Elgin area received at least one acaricide spray per season. Acaricides are no longer used on apples.

40|$|Abstract. Predatory {{behaviors}} of Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) and Galendromus helveolus (Chant) attacking Oligonychus perseae Tuttle, Baker and Abbatiello on avocado leaves were videotaped and analyzed. Behaviors were recorded for “fresh ” predators {{that were used}} 48 hr post receipt from a commercial insectary and “cold stored ” predators that were maintained at 12 °C for 14 days. Fresh and cold stored G. helveolus were observed to attack O. perseae only after invading webbed nests. Con-versely, fresh and cold stored <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> employed three different modes of predatory attack: (1) intercepting and attacking migrant O. perseae outside of web nests; (2) attacking prey through nest webbing; or (3) invading and attacking O. perseae inside nests. Predatory efficacy of both N. californi-cus and G. helveolus was reduced following cold storage, as both species engaged in certain predatory behaviors less frequently in comparison to predators that were not stored at low temperatures. Our ob-served results for <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> and G. helveolus attacking O. perseae are interpreted {{in relation to the}} chaetotaxy hypothesis, which proposes that phytoseiid invasion efficiency and propensity of webbed nests is facilitated by dorsal setal lengths...|$|E

40|$|Conservation and augmentative {{biological}} control strategies {{have been developed}} {{to take full advantage of}} the natural enemies that occur in Spanish citrus orchards. Among them, the predatory mites Euseius stipulatus, Neoseiulus californicus and Phytoseiulus persimilis play an important role in the {{biological control}} of tetranychid mites. However, these predatory mites are often affected by pesticides and information about the side-effects of these products against these beneficial arthropods is essential to guarantee their efficacy. The side-effects of some pesticides remain unknown and the primary aim of this study was to fill this gap. We have further used this information and that collected from other sources to compare the response of these three mite species to pesticides. Based on this information, E. stipulatus has the most tolerant species, followed by <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> and P. persimilis. Therefore, using E. stipulatus as an indicator species in citrus may have led to the paradox of selecting presumed selective pesticides resulting in excessive impact on <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> and, especially on P. persimilis. Because these two latter species are considered key for the biological control of T. urticae in citrus, especially clementines, in Spain, we propose to use P. persimilis as the relevant indicator of such effects on predacious mites occurring in citrus instead of E. stipulatus. This change could have a dramatic impact on the satisfactory control of tetranychid mites in citrus in the near future...|$|E

All experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions, at 25 +/- 1 °C, 60 +/- 5 % RH and a photoperiod of 16 : 8 (L:D) h. Most enriched diets reduced the total developmental time of the predator compared to the basic artificial diet (AD 1). All enriched artificial diets (except AD 10 (diet enriched with multivitamin syrup) and AD 5 (diet enriched with serum albumin protein)) increased the total fecundity of <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> compared with AD 1, and the highest fecundity was observed on the diet supplemented with Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs (AD 2).

O presente trabalho teve o objetivo de verificar o efeito da densidade de <b>N.</b> <b>californicus</b> a ser liberada em pomar de macieira, Malus domestica (Borkh.) Mansf., para o controle do ácaro-vermelho. Foi selecionado um pomar {{comercial}} em Fraiburgo (SC) e liberados os fitoseídeos nas densidades de 50. 000, 100. 000 e 150. 000 por ha, originados da criação comercial situada na Renar Maçãs (Fraiburgo). O controle do ácaro foi medido através da injúria, devido à alimentação de P. ulmi, e avaliado por meio de uma escala de sintomas de bronzeamento, e do monitoramento de ovos hibernantes em maio, julho e setembro. O tratamento com 150. 000 fitoseídeos reduziu a população de ácaros- vermelhos após 16 dias da liberação, enquanto os demais tratamentos necessitaram de 21 dias. A injúria das folhas foi menor no tratamento com 150. 000. Os ovos hibernantes em maio, nas parcelas de 50. 000 e 100. 000, foram, respectivamente, 75 % e 69 % maiores do que na parcela com 150. 000 fitoseídeos.

A commercial orchard in Fraiburgo (SC) was chosen and populations of 50, 000, 100, 000 and 150, 000 phytoseiidae per ha were released. These populations were from the commercial breeding centre located at Renar Maçãs, in Fraiburgo. The damage, due to the feeding of P. ulmi was measured in terms of the range of brownish symptoms. The monitoring of hibernating eggs was carried out in May, July and September. The treatment with 150, 000 phytoseiidae reduced the population of red mite 16 days after the release, while the other treatments required three weeks. The damage to the leaves was less in the treatment with 150, 000 phytoseiidae.
