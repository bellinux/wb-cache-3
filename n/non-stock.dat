40|$|Stocking {{of native}} fishes is {{conducted}} to augment riverine fisheries {{in many parts}} of the world, yet most stocking activities are conducted without empirical information on their effectiveness or impacts. In the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB), Australia, stocking has been underway for several decades to maintain recreational fisheries. We stocked chemically tagged golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) fingerlings in three rivers to determine the proportions of stocked fish within populations of the species. Stocked sites were monitored for up to 5 years in the Murrumbidgee River, Edward River and Billabong Creek and <b>non-stocked</b> sites were monitored in the Murray River. Catch per unit effort of stocked year classes increased substantially in Billabong Creek, with stocked fish contributing 100 (2005), 79 (2006) and 92 % (2007). Chemically tagged fish comprised 18 – 38 % of the respective age classes in the Murrumbidgee and Edward rivers and there was little evidence of natural recruitment in the <b>non-stocked</b> Murray River. Tagged fish generally attained the legal minimum size within 4 years and had dispersed up to 60 km from the original release location.

40|$|Abstract Stocking {{programs}} have been used extensively to mitigate declines in anadromous fishes, but these pro-grams can have long-term unintended genetic conse-quences. Stocking can homogenize population structure, impede local adaptation, and hinder the use of genetic stock identification as a fishery management tool. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we evaluate the spatiotemporal genetic structure of 16 anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharen-gus) populations in Maine, USA, to determine whether inter-basin stocking practices have influenced population structure and the genetic diversity of the species in this region. Although, no pre-supplementation samples exist, comparative analyses of stocked and <b>non-stocked</b> popula-tions show that stock transfers have influenced alewife population genetic structure. Genetic isolation by distance (IBD) was non-significant among stocked populations, but significant among <b>non-stocked</b> populations. However, two populations, Dresden Mills and Sewell Pond, appear to have resisted genetic homogenization despite stocking. Non-significant genic and genetic differentiations were broadly distributed among alewife populations. Hierarchi-cal AMOVA indicated highly significant differentiation among temporal replicates within populations, and Baye-sian clustering analysis revealed weak population structure. A significant correlation was observed between stocking (time and events) and pairwise F 0 ST among alewife collec-tions, and an analysis of IBD residuals showed a significant decline {{in the amount of}} genetic differentiation among populations as the extent of stocking activity increased. These findings call for an increased awareness of evolu-tionary processes and genetic consequences of restoration activities such as inter-basin stock transfers by fisheries management and conservation practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Stocking {{with eggs}} {{has been widely}} used as a {{management}} measure to support degraded salmonid stocks. In Finland, Atlantic salmon and both seamigrating and lake-migrating brown trout are stocked as eggs, alevins, fry, parr, and smolt, whereas trout are also stocked as mature fish. The aim of this stocking is to improve catches and to support collapsed spawning stocks. We assessed the success of stocking with brown trout eggs {{in a study of}} 17 Finnish boreal forest rivers, of which 9 were subject to egg stocking. All rivers contained some naturally spawning trout. In 16 rivers, including <b>non-stocking</b> years and unstocked rivers, egg stocking did not increase the total (wild and stocked) density of 0 -year-old parr. However, those rivers with higher existing trout densities in <b>non-stocking</b> years seemed to benefit most from stocking, suggesting some role of river-specific extrinsic factors affecting egg-to-parr survival. In one river monitored for 14 years, only a weak correlation was found between the total density of 0 -year-old parr and the number of eggs stocked. However, in nine parr samples from five rivers, the mean proportion of parr derived from stocked eggs was 40 %. The mean survival to first autumn parr of egg-stocked and wild individuals was 1. 0 and 3. 3 %, respectively. Probable reasons for the detected low to moderate impact of egg-stocking are (i) large variation in total parr density between years and rivers, (ii) small number of stocked eggs, (iii) placing egg boxes and egg pockets in unsuitable microhabitats, and (iv) unsuitable emergence time of egg-stocked individuals, or other extrinsic factors creating extra mortality. We recommend field and laboratory experiments to improve and standardize stocking methods, and monitoring the connection of wild spawning stocks and parr recruitment. Finally, we encourage fishery authorities to create clear management goals for threatened wild salmonid stocks. 201...|$|R

40|$|Coordination {{among the}} {{different}} stakeholders at policy planning, implementation and target beneficiary level, particularly among the agencies responsible for development and management of water resources, agriculture and fisheries, is essential for overall sustainable development. Stocking of larger fingerlings at suitable stocking densities of endemic (rohu, catla, mrigal) and exotic (silver carp, bighead carp, common carp/mirror carp) species should be stocked at varying proportion. Floodplain fish production depends only on the natural fertility of the water bodies. Technological interventions should include the installation of low cost bamboo fencing at water inlet and outlet points and setting of ring culverts for maintaining suitable levels of water for fish culture without hampering the production of rice and other crops in the intervention areas, selective stocking with native and exotic carps, restricted fishing for {{certain period of time}} and guarding. It is expected to exert positive influences in enhancing the standing crop and biodiversity of <b>non-stocked</b> species of fishes in the intervention seasonal floodplain. Entry of fish larvae, hatchlings and young fry of wild <b>non-stocked</b> fishes into the seasonal floodplains because of large fence spacing (approximately 1. 0 cm), could restrict fishing for certain period, undisturbed habitat and guarding could contribute to higher productivity and enhancement of fish biodiversity in the seasonal floodplains.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of a multistage with probability proportional to size (FPS) sampling design using aerial photography to sample coniferous regeneration on clearcuts. To date, aerial photography has not proven to be as economical (because of the high cost of specialized photography required) or accurate as a ground survey. Double sampling with regression using aerial photography and limited field measurements did improve the accuracy. A large land area was inventoried using three scales of aerial photography (1 : 60, 000, 1 : 20, 000 and 1 : 5, 000) in the multistage sampling design, picking PPS samples and using double sampling with regression between the largest scale of photography and the field checked plots.

This sampling interval from 2001 to 2010 was used because it had a consistent protocol, and true plot coordinates were generally within 0.8  km (0.5  mi.) of the reported location (Woudenberg et al. 2010; distances were greater in earlier plots sampled during the 1990 s that were excluded from the analysis). Within this sampling interval, we filtered the FIA data to only include plots within the elevation range of the historical timber survey data (1229 to 2438  m; n[*]=[*] 117). We then removed non-forested plots when the reported basal area was below 9  m 2  ha− 1 (n[*]=[*] 21). This threshold excluded plots that were <b>non-stocked</b> and likely recently harvested (n =[*] 8), young stands with a stand age of < 25  yr that were likely plantations (n =[*] 8), plots with substantial insect damage (n[*]=[*] 2), and one plot with no clear reason for a low basal area.

Transportation costs are assessed as a function of distance and total shipment weight. The per-unit transportation cost is a decreasing function of shipment weight. A constant per-unit cost is assessed for goods processed by any distribution point. Transit time, a surrogate for inventory leadtime, is a function of distance and also shipment weight. ^ A primary objective of this research is to demonstrate the dependency between the inventory model decisions and the transportation and warehousing model decisions and the effect of this dependency on the total system expected cost of a distribution system. More specifically, it is desired to demonstrate that the optimization of a distribution system with respect to only the inventory costs without taking into account the effect of inventory routing decisions on the transportation and warehousing costs as well as the transit times (i. e., leadtimes) resulting from the routing decisions, will, in most cases, lead to a sub-optimal solution. Similarly, optimization with respect to only the transportation and warehousing costs while ignoring the impact of the transportation decisions on the inventory costs may also lead to a sub-optimal solution. ^ The information gained from the examination of both the source and the magnitude of the dependency between the inventory, transportation, and warehousing considerations will be valuable in attaining another primary objective of this research which is the identification of the distribution system that minimizes the total expected cost per order cycle. In order to attain the second objective, a multi-phased heuristic is developed and tested. The results of the tests demonstrating the value of the heuristic and the insights provided by these tests are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the drastic decline of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla (L.)) fisheries have been reduced and elvers are stocked in areas where natural abundances are low. Are these measures adequate? To answer different aspects of this question, we have analysed {{more than a century}} of eel tagging, using both traditional and more novel capture – recapture analyses. Based on these long-term data, we have evaluated the impact of the Swedish eel coastal fisheries using Survival analysis. Our analysis indicates that the fishing mortality just prior the 2009 fishing restrictions were in the order of 10 %. More recent tagging programs have focused on issues related to the fate of stocked fish. If and how they migrate out of the Baltic Sea and further on towards the Atlantic Ocean. Both earlier and our new studies reveal that all eels recaptured on the Swedish East Coast, no matter of their origin, migrate at a reasonable speed and direction towards the outlets of the Baltic Sea. Even though it is sometimes difficult to determine their origin, our analyses indicate that stocked fish were scarce among the recaptures. In an experiment on the Swedish West Coast, we knew the individuals’ origin (stocked or wild) and they had similar migration patterns. In contrast, silver eel in Lake Mälaren – assumed to have been stocked as elvers or bootlace eels – seemed to have difficulties in finding the outlets. Instead they overwintered and lost weight. However, weight losses are also significant among <b>non-stocked</b> individuals in the Baltic Sea, both if they overwinter and if they appear to be on their way out from the area. It remains an open question whether eels from the Baltic region in general, and whether the overwintered fish in particular, manage to reach the spawning area in the Atlantic Ocean. Based on current knowledge, I advocate invoking the precautionary approach and to concentrate Swedish eel stockings to the West Coast and allow the young fish to spread out on their own. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following paper was unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Manuscript.  </p...|$|R
