40|$|Abstract. A host of economic, institutional, and {{political}} forces have thwarted {{the development of}} an appropriate comprehensive federal rural development policy in the U. S. This article examines those in-fluences from an historical perspective. Some of the changes noted are the emergence of rural development leadership in agencies other than the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the birth of a new Congres-sional Rural Caucus, the formation of a <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> <b>Network</b> of rural advocacy groups, and the coming realization that the destinies of central cities and rural areas are intertwined. An encouraging sign is the move toward a different type of rural policy governance in Washington, one in which a sensitivity to rural contexts and issues is being articulated in Transportation, Health and Human Services, and other program units that are not expressly rural-oriented. At the same time there continues to be too much emphasis placed on agri-culture’s role in the rural economy, which leads to policies that can...|$|E

40|$|Local {{development}} has been always considered an important instrument in the renewal of the rural economy, society and settlements, but recent changes of rural areas led to the conceptual expansion of the term. Besides locality-based development, {{the significance of the}} novel concept of place-based {{development has}} also been recognised. Place-based development not only takes the local characteristics into account, but tries to harmonise the development processes of the different sectors and territorial levels. The core of place-based approach is the well-coordinated, multilateral and continuous communication between the actors and institutes from different territorial levels and different sectors.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of National Rural Networks is a requisite for all EU member states following {{adoption of the}} 2005 Rural Development Regulation. Although networking, particularly {{in the form of}} exchanging experience and/or establishing partnerships, is not a novelty, the setting up of national rural networks is envisaged by policy makers in Brussels as an instrument that will enhance the effectiveness of rural development policy across the Community. However, the implementation of such an instrument represents a challenge for the new member states. This is particularly the case for Romania, where experience with networking is sparse. Building on a survey of network members in Romania, this paper identifies major challenges for the actors involved and explores the potential for networking in that country. Findings show that Romania's NRN faces difficulties in exploiting the benefits that ânetworkingâ theoretically offers. For Romania, where administration and beneficiaries lack experience and capacities, and where the policy delivery process needs to be improved, the potential technical assistance through the NRN is likely to have a significant impact, but there is a long way to go. Keys for successful implementation are clearly defined endogenously grown objectives, sufficient communication and the political will. <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> <b>Network,</b> Romania, Rural Development, Policy instrument, EU, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|E

In total there will be, 1000 delegates attending a forum focussing on mental health and self care entitled, “When the Cowpat Hits the Windmill. ”The <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> Health <b>Network</b> is the peak body for health students and has a membership of more than 5000. It currently comprises of 19 rural health clubs from a range of health disciplines. One of the aims of the conference is to encourage the formation of rural health clubs in areas not currently represented. It is a goal also shared by the three Notre Dame Nursing students. “We want to start up a rural health club here so we can go around visiting remote schools to get school children interested in joining medical, nursing or allied health organisations,” Mr Moore said. Mr Moore said Northern Territory Health Clubs were inviting Perth clubs to visit their remote locations and he hoped a Broome Club could do the same. “We are going to this conference more to listen, but being so remote we will pass on our experiences too,” he said. “It will be a two way thing. ”Ms Kennedy believed the conference would provide ideas on how to establish the health club and encourage more to join. “It will be the three of us to start and hopefully we can get many people involved after that,” she said. “We are hoping to formalise it between all three nursing years on campus and the Enrolled Nursing too. It’s not just health. It is health orientated, but not exclusively,” she said. All three students agreed the forum was a great opportunity to network and hear from leading people in the industry including representatives from the Department of Health and Ageing, Health organisation CEOs and former Victorian Premier and Beyond Blue director, Jeff Kennett. “It will make for an intense week,” Ms Ballagh said. “But this is what we want to do. We want to work in rural areas and gain more insight into what goes on, the issues they are dealing with and how we can help. ...|$|R

The methodology used {{is based on the}} model of Working with People (WWP), which integrates elements of social learning and planningand Project management international models, which integrate competences that have an influence on regional development. WWP model is the result of experience in rural development planning from the research group GESPLAN at the Technical University of Madrid in several European contexts and emerging countries. The results show that the main skills and competences for regional development in Rumania are focused on three components: technical-entrepreneurial,social-ethical and political-contextual. Experience lessons {{in the first years of}} the Romanian <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> Development <b>Network</b> (NRDN) demonstrate the right project management approach for Regional Development, exceeding the “technical” approach of the management and emphasizing the behaviour of individuals and the contexts where they work.

Two different cases were identified: placement in a city network (urban road network) and in a regional or <b>national</b> <b>network</b> (<b>rural</b> roads and highways). For a city and a regional network, the methodology identifies high-potential areas for the installation of charging station. In contrast, for a highway network the methodology provides explicitly the suggested locations: the charging stations should preferably be placed in already built areas, gas stations or rest areas, to minimize additional investment costs.

40|$|Background: India’s {{economic}} growth rate {{in recent years}} has been fairly impressive. But, it has been consistently failing to make considerable progress in achieving health related Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. Lack of coherence between provisions and utilization becomes the face of the problem. Inadequacies in outreach, access and affordability coupled with escalating healthcare costs have aggravated the problem. Here the application of PublicPrivate Partnership (PPP) model seems to have enormous potential to ease the impasse. Methods:This paper tries to find the gap between the provisions and access in healthcare. The paper attempts to construct a Health Infrastructure Index (HII) and Health Attainment Index (HAI) for different states of India. Considering the presence of regional variations found in health infrastructure and attainment among the states, two states, viz. Maharashtra (MAH) and West Bengal (WB) have been chosen. Then contributions of health programs like Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> Telemedicine <b>Network</b> (NRTN) and Fair Price Shops (FPS), all PPP initiatives, have been assessed for both the states by carrying out comprehensive benefit-cost analysis. Results:The health infrastructure for population per unit area captures the outreach/delivery issue and the health attainment reveals the true scenario about how far the infrastructure has been accessed by the people; and the gap between the two, as the paper finds, is the root of the problem. The combined effect of RSBY and NRTN will leave both MAH and WB higher benefits in terms of health attainment. The contributions of RSBY and NRTN have been assessed for both the states by carrying out comprehensive benefit-cost analysis. FPS comes up with immense benefits for WB. It is yet to be implemented in MAH. Conclusion:The outreach and access problems arising from deficiencies in infrastructure, human resources and financial ability are expected to be well-addressed by the spread of RSBY and NRTN jointly. The FPS mechanism under PPP initiative can be an effective tool in solving affordability problem by reducing the cost of treatment...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League {{created a}} strong central {{organization}} with connections to numerous newspapers. 1928 were 190 press organs {{associated with the}} <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League, belonging to it, or belonging {{to members of the}} association. In 1924 the league had about 500 district offices. As a result, in the areas were the organization was strong large parts of the agricultural population that were not members of the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League could be greatly influenced by League positions. Politically the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League was near the German National People's Party (DNVP) because both were opposed to the Republic. In 1924 the party supported this association particularly strongly, but also promoted candidacies of senior members of other right-wing parties, especially the German People's Party (DVP). In the German presidential election, 1925, the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League supported the election of Paul von Hindenburg. In the mid-1920s, leading <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League members of the DNVP were represented in the government. This phase of government cooperation was short-lived. Import tariff issues and the agrarian crisis exacerbated the distance between the League and the government and the Republic. The support of the government had led, especially in Hesse and Silesia, to massive membership losses. Rural League officials were involved with the 1927/28 country people's movement. They split several Landbund leaders from the DNVP and founded the Christian-National Peasants' and Farmers' Party (CNBLP, The CNBLP was renamed German Country People's in 1930). The new party took 10 seats from the DNVP in the 1928 Reichstag elections. There was significant turbulence within <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League. The battle against other farmers' organizations was largely discontinued. In order to obtain greater influence in the agricultural and economic crisis, in 1929 the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League was the driving force establishing a new umbrella organization of farmers' associations, the Green Front. In 1929 The <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League supported the referendum against the Young Plan which was initiated by the DNVP, Nazi Party (NSDAP [...] ) and other legal associations. Through their leading member, Martin Schiele, the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League was involved in the government of Heinrich Brüning, which led to the expulsion of the Schiele group from the DNVP and helped the German Country People's Party (CNBLP) to make large gains in the German federal election, 1930. However, as the Nazi Party achieved great progress in the countryside with construction of their agrarian political apparatus, the Nazis now gained more and more influence in the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League. In October 1930 Martin Schiele had to resign as President of the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League, and the new board moved to the right. The Schiele group was repressed and the Nazis gained ground. Other groups in the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League believed they could win back lost ground in agriculture through an alliance with the Nazi influence. The agitation against the Brüning Government, democracy and the Weimar Republic increased and in 1931 the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League joined the Harzburg Front. In the presidential election in 1932, the leadership of the <b>National</b> <b>Rural</b> League recommended a vote for the national German Stahlhelm leader Theodor Duesterberg or Adolf Hitler, because Hindenburg had not distanced himself from his support of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The transfer of power to Hitler on 30 January 1933 was welcomed by the League leadership, so that there was no resistance by the largest German agriculture organization to the Nazi Coordination (Gleichschaltung) of agriculture and their state administrative body regulating food production (Reichsnährstand).|$|R
