5|$|The {{notion of}} making an {{animated}} adaptation of Valérian dates back to at least 1976. In 1982, Mézières produced concept art for an episode titled The Asteroids of Shimballil (Les Astéroïdes de Shimballil) which was later published in 2000 as an appendix to the album release of Bad Dreams. In 1991, Dargaud Films financed {{the production of a}} three-minute pilot, directed by Bernard Deyriès and animated by Studio 32 in Paris and Luxembourg, but <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> of this venture. Several stills from this pilot episode were published in Mézières Extras. Another pilot, directed by Florient Ferrier, was made by the French animation studio 2 Minutes in 2001. <b>Nothing</b> <b>came</b> of this attempt either.|$|E
5|$|Development of an Ant-Man film {{began as}} early as the late 1980s, when Ant-Man co-creator Stan Lee pitched the idea to New World Pictures, Marvel Comics' parent company at the time. However, Walt Disney Pictures was {{developing}} a film based on a similar concept, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and although Ant-Man went into development, <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} more ambitious {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, {{the aim was}} to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. <b>Nothing</b> <b>came</b> of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of San Juan were furious with Capt. Rivero-Méndez and blamed {{him for the}} destruction wreaked on their city by American bombardments. <b>Nothing</b> <b>came</b> of those recriminations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered {{to turn over the}} keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.|$|E
5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} private operations along the line. Continental Railway Systems {{was established by}} Rasmus Surdal.

However, it was not possible for the company to get the necessary bank surety demanded by NSB, and <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> of the plans.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase ex nihilo {{also appears}} in the {{classical}} philosophical formulation ex nihilo nihil fit, which means [...] "Out of <b>nothing</b> <b>comes</b> nothing".|$|R

5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear. The adventure would involve the planet Erinella {{and two men}} fighting over a princess. The Doctor would become involved in his own timeline by arriving {{at the wrong time}} and becoming accused of being a poisoner. Roberts resubmitted the story in the mid-1980s to script editor Eric Saward, but <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> of the submission.|$|E
5|$|Although Ruth knew he {{was nearly}} {{finished}} as a player, he desired to remain in baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated {{that he was not}} yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> of them.|$|E
5|$|Beaty {{continued}} to distinguish {{himself in the}} 5th Regiment's further engagements. His actions during the Battle of Fair Oaks & Darbytown Road in October 1864 earned him a mention in the general orders to the Army of the Potomac. The regimental commander, Colonel Giles Shurtleff, twice recommended him for a promotion to commissioned officer. <b>Nothing</b> <b>came</b> of Colonel Shurtleff's requests, however Beaty did receive a brevet promotion to lieutenant. By {{the time he was}} mustered out of the Army he had participated in thirteen battles and numerous skirmishes.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Poldek Pfefferberg {{approached}} director Fritz Lang {{and asked}} him to consider making a film about Schindler. Also on Pfefferberg's initiative, in 1964 Schindler received a $20,000 advance from MGM for a proposed film treatment titled To the Last Hour. Neither film was ever made, and Schindler quickly spent the money he received from MGM. He was also approached in the 1960s by MCA of Germany and Walt Disney Productions in Vienna, but again <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> of these projects.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Shaughnessy {{was rumored}} as a {{candidate}} for the vacant Washington Redskins head coaching job, but <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> of it. From 1951 to 1962, Shaughnessy served {{on the staff of the}} Chicago Bears as a technical advisor, vice president, and defensive specialist. Halas retained responsibility for the offense, including the Bears' T formation. Ironically, Shaughnessy was tasked with developing a defense to counter the T formation. One of his solutions was the 5–3–3 defense, which left outside linebackers available to defend against end runs and passes in the flat.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of {{meetings}} beginning on 25 April, Eichmann met with Joel Brand, a Hungarian Jew and member of the Relief and Rescue Committee (RRC). Eichmann later testified that Berlin had authorised him to allow emigration of a million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks equipped to handle the wintry conditions on the Eastern Front. <b>Nothing</b> <b>came</b> of the proposal, as the Western Allies refused to consider the offer. In June 1944 Eichmann was involved in negotiations with Rudolf Kasztner that resulted in the rescue of 1,684 people, who were sent by train to safety in Switzerland in exchange for three suitcases full of diamonds, gold, cash, and securities.|$|E

5|$|Neuer {{was born}} in Fremont, Ohio, {{and was one of}} eight {{children}} born to Henry Neuer and Jennie Catherman. He and his family moved to Sunbury, Pennsylvania, when he was a child. In 1898, Neuer enlisted in the Spanish–American War as a private, and was discharged the following year. After his discharge, he worked as a brakeman for a local railroad for the next few years. In late 1904, the Detroit Tigers intended to sign Neuer to a contract. However, <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> of it and he never played a game with the organization.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>came</b> of the proposal, which The Times of London {{called one}} of the most loathsome stories of the war. Historians believe that the SS, {{including}} its commander, Heinrich Himmler, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and perhaps even Adolf Hitler. Whatever its purpose, the proposal was thwarted by the British government. They arrested Brand in Aleppo (then under British control), where he had gone to propose Eichmann's offer to the Jewish Agency, {{and put an end to}} it by leaking details to the media.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} {{periodic}} attempts to restore service in southern Montana and North Dakota. A proposed plan from 1982–1983 would have involved North Dakota and Montana paying 45% of costs {{in the first year}} and 65% thereafter of a new section of the Empire Builder operating tri-weekly between Fargo and Sandpoint. This proposal went nowhere as neither state voted funds. Another proposal mooted in 1991 would have required an additional yearly federal appropriation of $12–15 million plus new equipment. In this scenario the Portland section would operate over the old route. Again, <b>nothing</b> <b>came</b> of it.|$|E
