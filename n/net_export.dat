5|$|In other words, {{a country}} that imports more than it exports must either {{decrease}} its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports. Conversely, Germany's large trade surplus (<b>net</b> <b>export</b> position) means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital, lending money to other countries {{to allow them to}} buy German goods.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a <b>net</b> <b>export</b> of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

50|$|The sectoral {{balances}} equation {{says that}} total private savings (S) minus private investment (I) has to equal the public deficit (spending, G, minus net taxes, T) plus <b>net</b> <b>exports</b> (exports (X) minus imports (M)), where <b>net</b> <b>exports</b> represent the <b>net</b> spending of non-residents on this country's production.

There is no distinction between consumption and investment or between {{the private and public}} sectors; a consumer's imported television, a corporation's imported lab equipment, and the government's use of imported food on military bases count equally.

25|$|This {{exported}} energy may {{be accounted}} for in the simplest case by the meter running backwards during periods of <b>net</b> <b>export,</b> thus reducing the customer's recorded energy usage by the amount exported. This in effect results in the customer being paid for his/her exports at the full retail price of electricity. Unless equipped with a ratchet or equivalent, a standard meter will accurately record power flow in each direction by simply running backwards when power is exported. Where allowed by law, utilities maintain a profitable margin between the price of energy delivered to the consumer and the rate credited for consumer-generated energy that flows back to the grid.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{interesting}} dynamics of conservation of this butterfly is associated with increased nitrogen through air pollution. Increased nitrogen increases the fertility of serpentine soils, soils naturally low in nitrogen. This increased fertility allows invasive plants to thrive and exclude the nectar sources that the Bay checkerspot needs. This is where moderate grazing brings help to the threatened checkerspot. In a large metapopulation south of San Jose, removal of cattle from grasslands that the butterfly inhabited led to {{a significant decrease in}} the butterfly population because grazing leads to a <b>net</b> <b>export</b> of nitrogen as the cattle are removed for slaughter after eating the plants of the grasslands. In this way, moderate grazing enhances the butterfly's chance for survival.|$|E
60|$|Let us {{run over}} the chief items again: (1) Iron goods. In view of Germany's loss of resources, an {{increased}} <b>net</b> <b>export</b> seems impossible {{and a large}} decrease probable. (2) Machinery. Some increase is possible. (3) Coal and coke. The value of Germany's <b>net</b> <b>export</b> before the war was $110,000,000; the Allies have agreed that {{for the time being}} 20,000,000 tons is the maximum possible export with a problematic (and in fact) impossible increase to 40,000,000 tons at some future time; even on the basis of 20,000,000 tons we have virtually no increase of value, measured in pre-war prices;[129] whilst, if this amount is exacted, there must be a decrease of far greater value in the export of manufactured articles requiring coal for their production. (4) Woolen goods. An increase is impossible without the raw wool, and, having regard to the other claims on supplies of raw wool, a decrease is likely. (5) Cotton goods. The same considerations apply as to wool. (6) Cereals. There never was and never can be a <b>net</b> <b>export.</b> (7) Leather goods. The same considerations apply as to wool.|$|E

60|$|Next on {{the list}} come cereals, leather goods, sugar, paper, furs, {{electrical}} goods, silk goods, and dyes. Cereals are not a <b>net</b> <b>export</b> and are far more than balanced by imports of the same commodities. As regards sugar, nearly 90 per cent of Germany's pre-war exports came to the United Kingdom.[128] An increase in this trade might be stimulated by a grant of a preference {{in this country to}} German sugar or by an arrangement by which sugar was taken in part payment for the indemnity on the same lines as has been proposed for coal, dyes, etc. Paper exports also might be capable of some increase. Leather goods, furs, and silks depend upon corresponding imports {{on the other side of}} the account. Silk goods are largely in competition with the trade of France and Italy. The remaining items are individually very small. I have heard it suggested that the indemnity might be paid to a great extent in potash and the like. But potash before the war represented 0.6 per cent of Germany's export trade, and about $15,000,000 in aggregate value. Besides, France, having secured a potash field in the territory which has been restored to her, will not welcome a great stimulation of the German exports of this material.|$|E
