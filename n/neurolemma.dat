In this paper, we present a 24 -year-old male referred to our clinic for a lump located at the volar side of the left wrist and a lump located in his left palm and numbness at his 3 rd and 4 th fingers. Total excision was performed for both lesions. Histopathological examination of the masses revealed typical features of schwannoma. At the 6 th-month followup the patient was symptom-free except for slight paresthesia of the 3 rd and the 4 th fingers.

40|$|Microtransplantation of {{mammalian}} <b>neurolemma</b> into Xenopus laevis oocytes {{has been}} used to study ion channels in terms of their structure and function in the central nervous system. Use of microtransplanted <b>neurolemma</b> is advantageous in that tissue can be obtained from various sources, ion channels and receptors are present in their native configuration and they can be used to evaluate numerous channelpathies caused by environmental toxicants. Here we show that Xenopus oocytes injected with fragments of rat brain <b>neurolemma</b> successfully express functional native ion channels that are assembled in their own plasma membrane. Using a high throughput two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) electrophysiological system, currents that were sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX), omega-conotoxin MVIIC, and tetraethylammonium (TEA) were detected, indicating the presence of multiple voltage-sensitive ion channels (voltage-sensitive sodium, calcium and potassium channels, respectively). In this current research, a “proof-of-principle” experiment was conducted where TTX-sensitive voltage-sensitive sodium channel (VSSC) currents were measured. VSSCs are a well-established site of action for 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -di(4 -chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) but not for its non-toxic metabolite 1, 1 -bis-(4 -chlorophenyl) - 2, 2 -dichloroethene (DDE). A differential sensitivity of DDT versus DDE on TTX-sensitive sodium current in neurolemma-injected oocytes was determined. DDT elicited an increase in depolarization-dependent, TTX-sensitive sodium current while DDE had no significant effect. Additionally, DDT resulted in a slowing of sodium channel inactivation kinetics whereas DDE has no similar effect. These results are consistent with the findings obtained using heterologous expression of single isoforms of rat brain VSSCs by injecting cRNA into Xenopus oocytes. By demonstrating the classic structural activity relationship of DDT and DDE on mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels isolated in rat brain <b>neurolemma,</b> this study supports the use of automated high-throughput electrophysiology to study the effects of various environmental toxicants on multiple mammalian cellular targets. More importantly, using rat brain <b>neurolemma</b> ensures that the proteins of interest have been transcribed and have undergone all the necessary post-translational modifications before they were injected and expressed in the Xenopus oocytes which is not the case for traditional heterologous expression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe rapid {{transition}} of a stationary axon into a motile growth cone requires {{the recruitment of}} membrane and its strategic insertion into the <b>neurolemma.</b> The source of membrane to support the initial rapid growth postaxotomy is not known. Using membrane capacitance measurements, we examined quantitative aspects of membrane dynamics following axotomy of cultured Aplysia neurons. Axotomy activates two processes in parallel: membrane retrieval and exocytosis. Unexpectedly, membrane retrieval is the dominant process {{in the majority of}} the experiments. Thus, while a growth cone is vigorously extending, the total neuronal surface area decreases. We suggest that the initial rapid extension phase of the newly formed growth cone postaxotomy is supported by a pool of intracellular membrane that is rapidly retrieved from the <b>neurolemma...</b>|$|E
30|$|Electrospinning is a {{versatile}} method for producing nanofibers of polymers or blends of polymers and biological components. Manipulation of the voltage, collection distance, flow rate, and solution viscosity impacts the resulting fiber diameter. The conditions were optimized {{for our purposes}} to produce nanofibers of diameters {{in the range of}} 400 – 1, 000  nm. Fibers with diameters smaller than the size of the cell have been shown to produce faster neurite outgrowth (Corey et al. 2007). This {{may be due to the}} nanoscale fibers mimicking extracellular matrices present in the <b>neurolemma</b> during peripheral nerve regeneration.|$|E

40|$|Gangliosides are a {{group of}} glycosphingolipids that {{have at least one}} sialic acid residue. These lipids are {{structural}} and functional components of the external leaflet of the plasma membrane, particularly in neurons. Gangliosides together with cholesterol and sphingomyelin form lipid rafts that contain specific proteins involved in many important cellular processes, including signal transmission, cell growth and proliferation. Changes in the membrane gangliosides profile induce disturbances in the cell functions and finally lead to numerous diseases, mostly in the nervous system. The majority of such nervous system disorders can be recognized on the basis of analysis of the serum gangliosides profile and/or the presence of anti-ganglioside antibodies. Supplementation with exogenous gangliosides also seems to be a successful procedure for the recovery of ganglioside homeostasis in the <b>neurolemma...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{traditional}} {{hypothesis that}} is used to explain the electroencephalogram (EEG) is shown not to be valid and a more accurate theory is developed in this paper based upon a logical evaluation of current data. The cerebral electric wave obviously emerges from oscillation, and this oscillation is caused by the flowing K + current and the variation in K + concentration which is created from simultaneous depolarization of some certain neurogliocytes. This wave rhythm acts mainly on Cl- directly by the variation in its potential which drives the Cl- out of or into <b>neurolemma</b> thereby contributing to and even controlling the depolarization or hyperpolarization of certain neurons. This concept has the clinical application of using the EEG to predict which comatose patients have the potential for coming out of the coma. Additionally, the metabolism and health of neurons is herein predicted to be influenced by it being depolarized under a certain amplitude of brain wave. Dreams {{may be the result of}} the depolarization of neurons that have been inactive for longer than usual time period. Finally, this paper may lead to the use of electrical stimulation of the brain in specific manners to enhance the recover of comatose or brain damaged patients...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{models to}} {{describe}} the endocytosis phase of synaptic vesicle recycling are associated with time scales of vesicle recovery ranging from milliseconds to tens of seconds. There have been suggestions {{that one of the}} major models, envisioned as a slow process that occurs only after complete fusion of the vesicle membrane with the <b>neurolemma,</b> might be applicable only under conditions of heavy, nonphysiological stimulation. Using FM 1 - 43 and similar fluorescent probes to label recycling synaptic vesicles in rat hippocampal neurons, we have measured the kinetics of endocytosis {{with a wide range of}} action-potential-driven exocytotic loads. Our results indicate that when either 5 % or 25 % of the vesicle pool is used, vesicles are recovered with a half-time on the order of 20 s (24 degrees C). This endocytosis rate was not influenced by operations designed to alter intracellular Ca 2 + during membrane retrieval, suggesting that residual Ca 2 + after strong stimuli probably does not greatly retard endocytosis. Finally, we have shown that vesicle-destaining kinetics are not strongly influenced by the substantially differing rates at which two marker dyes tested dissociate from membranes. This observation suggests that vesicles remain open long enough for essentially complete dissociation of even the slower dye (a few seconds) or, alternatively, that both dyes readily escape vesicle membrane by lateral diffusion through any exocytotic opening. These data seem most consistent with applicability of the slow-endocytosis, complete-fusion model at low as well as high levels of exocytosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomy and}} {{histology}} {{of the heart}} of Limulus Polyphemus have been described by Patten and Redenbaugh, Milne-Edwards and Walter Meek, {{but they are not}} in complete agreement. In the case of Branchio cardiac canal, for instance, Milne-Edwards reported six pairs of veins but Patten and Redenbaugh five pairs. There is little recorded work on the anatomy and histology of the heart of Tachypleus tridentatus in Japan, and although Dr. Nukada and Dr. Hoshino made brief anatomical and histological description for the purpose of Physiological study, they also disagree on some points. The former maintains and the later denies the presence of Volhof and Spezifische Muskelfasern. On account of these discrepancies, I made certain studies in comparison with previous results and some researches into new ground. Most of the materials were fixed in formalin and after subsequent treatment in the usual manner, the specimens were embedded in paraffin, trimmed and cut in transverse serial sections and longitudinal sections with thicknesses of 5. 0, 25. 0, and 50. 0 microns. The sections were stained with Eosin-Hämatoxylin and Nissl's method was used. A model was prepared according to Born-Peter's method of wax-plate reconstruction. From the results of my experiments, the following summary and conclusions were made: 1) The heart of Tachypleus tridentatus is a long tubular organ consisting of one ventricle, situated longitudinally on the lower part of median line of the carapace. It lies in a large pericardial sinus and is pupported by three holding tissues, Ligamentum suspensoria cordis superior, Alary muscle, and Veno-pericardiac muscle. 2) Around the heart is a large pericardial sinus, enclosed by a pericardium. Pericardium is a thin menbrane consisting of connective tissue fibres. There are eight pairs of Ostia on the dorsal wall of the heart, and they are the doors by which the blood in the pericardial sinus enters the heart. 3) There are eleven arteries leading off from the heart; one pair of Aortic arches and Arteria frontalis from the frontal end of the heart, and four pairs of Arteriae laterales arise from the lateral wall of the heart. Each artery has a valve. The aortic valve, much like a vertebrate Semilunar valve, lies upon the dorsal wall of the heart {{at the base of the}} Aortic arches. The Arteriae laterales are supplied with paired Semilunar valves at their points of origin from the heart. Each valve consists of connective tissues. 4) Pericardial sinus has veins, namely Branchio cardiac canal. I found five pairs of Branchio cardiac canal. I could not recognize six-pairs as described by Milne-Edwards. 5) The structure of the cardiac walls is composed of three layers. The outer most layer consists of the longitudinal elastic conective tissue fibres. The middle layer is the Basement membrane consisting of annular connective tissue fibres. The inner most layer is the circular muscular layer consisting of cross-striated muscular fibres. No membrane limiting the lumen, corresponding to the Endocardium of the mamalian heart is present. The cross-striated muscular fibres of Tachypleus tridentatus, resemble the mammalian heart, branching and anastomosing with each other, so form a syncytium. Also the individual muscular fibres are much like those of nammals, having nuclei surrounded by sarcoplasm and the fibrils make numerous bundles or Cohnheim's field. I think that the muscular fibres have no sarcolemma. 6) The author could not recognize the existence of Volhof and Spezifische Muskelfasern which were Dr. Nukada. 7) An median Cardiac nerve and one pair of Lateral cardiac nerves lie longitudinally on the heart. The branches of these two kinds of cardiac nerves anastomosing with each other, thus make the Cardiac nerve plexus. Median Cardiac nerve communicates with the centre by the Segmental cardiac nerve, Haemal nerve and Ventral cord. The structure of the nerve fibre consists of <b>neurolemma</b> and axis cylinder. There is no medullary sheath. The median cardiac nerve fibers possess the ganglion cells...|$|E
