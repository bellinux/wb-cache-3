5|$|Aletheia– The former Oracle of Delphi who was gifted with prophetic sight. When she was {{encountered}} by Kratos, she {{was shown to}} be an elderly woman who had no eyes. Castor and Pollux crushed her under rocks so that Kratos could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> Her dying words to Kratos told him to seek the Eyes of Truth across the sea in the Lantern of Delos—the Eyes being her own eyes that were taken by the Furies. The character was voiced by Adrienne Barbeau in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|Castor and Pollux– An elderly {{conjoined}} twin, they usurped the Oracle of Delphi {{and decided}} who could see her. When Kratos attempted {{to see the}} Oracle without any offerings, the twin made themselves younger by using the Amulet of Uroborus and then fought Kratos. They attempted to kill the Oracle so that Kratos could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> After crushing the Oracle under rocks, Kratos then killed the twin and took the amulet. Castor and Pollux were voiced by David W. Collins and Brad Grusnick, respectively, in Ascension.|$|E

25|$|In March 1908, Gunness sent several {{letters to}} a farmer and horse dealer in Topeka, Kansas, named Lon Townsend, {{inviting}} him to visit her; {{he decided to}} put off the visit until spring, and thus did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> before a fire at her farm.

25|$|Blanche's aunt {{gives her}} a {{positive}} conception of dark skin and instead of being ashamed, Blanche utilizes this concept of being invisible in to a powerful liberation. It allows her to move unseen, to discover the Carter family secrets, and ultimately turns her in to a crafty detective who solves all the crime in the novel. Her disguise is a social constructed one based off her race, gender, and social class, however by turning these into positive tools, she proves to her oppressors {{that she is not}} confined or constructed by how others see (or do <b>not</b> <b>see)</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

25|$|Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979– March 16, 2003) was an American Evergreen State College {{student and}} member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who {{traveled}} to the Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada. She was killed in the Gaza Strip by a Caterpillar D9R armored bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while protecting the family home of local pharmacist Samir Nasrallah from demolition by the IDF. According to the Israeli authorities the demolitions were carried out to eliminate weapons smuggling tunnels. According to human rights groups the demolitions were collective punishment.The exact nature of her death and the culpability of the bulldozer operator are disputed, with fellow ISM protesters saying that the Israeli soldier operating the bulldozer deliberately ran over Corrie, and Israeli eyewitnesses saying that it was an accident since the bulldozer operator could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yasuna's unique affliction to {{be unable}} to see males is changed from the manga to the anime. While in the manga Yasuna says she has never once {{been able to see}} males {{completely}} clearly (Hazumu being the only slight exception), Yasuna explains in the anime that she at one time was able to see males, but one day she could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> father anymore after he got angry with her as a child, and it escalated from there to encompass all males. Additionally, in the eleventh anime episode, Yasuna becomes unable to see females as well, though this is later rectified in episode twelve when Yasuna is completely healed and is able to see both males and females. In the anime, Yasuna is shown to be terrified of males, even those in her own class, but in the manga she merely pays very little attention to males around her, even when spoken to directly, or otherwise ignores males completely. In the anime, Yasuna is shown at one time accidentally ignoring her father at the dinner table, but the only time Yasuna is shown speaking to her father in the manga has her smiling to him.|$|E

Mrs. Starks {{ran out of the}} house, but was not chased. At the end of the film, the officers chase the Phantom and shoot him in the leg, but the real Phantom was never chased or shot at all.|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the younger}} captives, however, were not ransomed, as they were adopted into the tribes. [...] Such {{was the case with}} Williams' {{daughter}} Eunice, who was eight years old when captured. She became thoroughly assimilated in her Mohawk family, and married a Mohawk man when she was 16. She did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> family of origin again until much later and always returned to Kahnawake. Other captives also remained by choice in Canadian and Native communities such as Kahnawake {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
500|$|Pauline's exit in December 2006 was {{described}} by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a [...] "significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as [...] "the most moving in a soap this year" [...] and added that [...] "it was a delight to finally alight on an episode... that was so satisfying." [...] Conversely, Pauline's exit {{was described}} as a [...] "mess" [...] by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: [...] "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead." ...|$|E
500|$|For this game, Dante {{was made}} young, {{consumed}} by hatred and inexperienced {{resulting in a}} fighting style similar to a street brawler rather {{than that of a}} skilled swordsman. As a result of the reboot's theme being [...] "rebellion" [...] most of Dante's actions are based around it. Antoniades stated that Dante is about [...] "being cool and making you feel cool when you're playing it," [...] and, as such, they felt that his attire from previous games would be found comical. Antoniades added he felt the classic Dante was not appealing anymore and when comparing the new Dante with the title character from Bayonetta he did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> style to be what he wanted for the reboot. Antoniades responded to criticism stating they would not change it as it is supposed to fit within the game's setting. Additionally, he stated he would have liked this Dante in response to the criticism.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 31 January 1918, the Light Cruiser Force sortied from Rosyth to {{participate}} in a training exercise with elements of the Grand Fleet. The 12th and 13th Submarine Flotillas were sandwiched by squadrons of battlecruisers and battleships as the ships departed in poor visibility. Around 19:14 the steering gear of one of the 13th SF's submarines failed and she fell out of the formation. One of the trailing submarines did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> in time and accidentally rammed her, badly damaging both boats. Commander William Leir commanded the 13th SF and decided to turn his flotilla around to their aid after he was notified of the accident around 17:40. In doing so, his ships crossed the path of the oncoming 12th SF and Fearless accidentally rammed and sank the submarine [...] Captain Charles Little attempted to avoid her, but the cruiser was moving too fast to do so. She launched her boats in a failed attempt to rescue any survivors, but the few found were recovered by one of the other submarines. The bulkheads in Fearless bow had to be shored up to prevent further flooding, but she was not in any danger of sinking and returned to Rosyth at a very slow speed. She was repaired and survived the war, but was sold for scrap in November 1921.|$|E
500|$|As the {{postcard}} effort was reaching its peak, tabloid newspapers {{speculated that the}} Labour Party wanted to put Hewson up for the Irish presidential election of 2004, with the Daily Mirror quoting an unnamed party insider as saying, [...] "She's a mother of four but she has always had world issues at heart and she'd make the perfect candidate." [...] (Labour had succeeded with its candidate Mary Robinson in the 1990 election but came in fourth with Roche in the 1997 election.) Hewson stated {{that she had not}} been approached, and that [...] "It's not a serious proposition. It would obviously be a huge honour if I was asked to take on such a huge task, but for one thing I'm not sure I'm qualified, and for another I've got four small kids to bring up first." [...] She also expressed contentment with incumbent President Mary McAleese staying for another term. She jokingly added that she could not see Bono agreeing to live in a smaller house. Hewson received a media mention two years later as a possible Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate in the 2004 European Parliament elections after John Hume had stood down. [...] The notion of her running for Irish president came up again in 2008 in conjunction with the 2011 election; columnist Fiona Looney wrote in the Daily Mail that while [...] "she is certainly a decent and smart woman", the position was better held by someone with a stronger background and more diplomatic experience. Hewson demurred once more, saying she did not speak the Irish language well enough, this time adding humorously that she could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> husband being willing to walk behind her at events. The candidate that Labour did put up, Michael D. Higgins, won the post. Notwithstanding this speculation, Hewson generally shies away from political comments in the media.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Tony Sawicki, a trans man {{and another}} clone played by Maslany. The character was first imagined by Manson and Fawcett {{during the development}} of the show's first season; they thought that introducing a transgender clone character would be [...] "very tied to the themes of our show about identity" [...] and would fit well with the previous season's themes of gender and sexuality. When they approached Maslany with the idea {{at the end of the}} first season, she told them that she had already thought about playing a transgender character herself. It took the show's creators longer than with any other character to develop and refine Tony's personality and wardrobe, the entire process taking six months. In preparation for the part, Maslany researched and met with transgender people and grew out her underarm hair for six weeks, although she eventually had to shave her underarms to attend an awards ceremony before the episode was filmed. The new character was kept secret from most of the crew until scripts for the episode were distributed, and the show's hair and makeup department trialled different looks for Tony on Maslany's days off and weekends so that other members of the crew would <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> in Tony's costume. Tony's final look was created by Stephen Lynch, Sandy Sokolowski and Debra Hanson, in the show's makeup, hair and wardrobe departments, respectively. Manson, Fawcett and Maslany sought advice from GLAAD on how to best go about introducing a transgender character. In response to the perception that Tony's introduction had created [...] "a minefield of sexual politics", Fawcett said that that had not been the writers' intention; rather, their aim was to [...] "just throw this character in there and treat them like a normal human being like we would anyone else on the show".|$|E
