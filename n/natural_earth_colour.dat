The system is a liquid silicate paint which comprises a potassium silicate binder with inorganic fillers (feldspar) and <b>natural</b> <b>earth</b> oxide <b>colour</b> pigments. When applied onto a mineral substrate the binder is absorbed and forms a micro-crystalline silicate structure. This crystalline structure allows the substrate to breathe but prevents the ingress of driven rain.|$|R
40|$|A {{historical}} paint manufactory in Staicele, Latvia (1967), {{was using}} local resources – <b>colour</b> <b>earth.</b> Oil paint composition consisted of pigment, drying oil, varnish and siccative. It had two different tones that are obtained by using <b>natural</b> <b>colour</b> <b>earth</b> pigments: ochre and its burnt form (burnt umber). Pigment quality was analyzed using historical documents, modern pigment tests, and manufactory technology. Chemical composition, particle size, and pigment tone were determined, and the coating ability was calculated. A palette of oil paints {{based on the}} historical recipes for restoring Staicele oil paints was created. Properties of <b>colour</b> <b>earth</b> pigments were compared to specimens taken from the local source of iron that is located near the old paint factory.

40|$|Pigments, colours and mediums are {{the tools}} of an artist. Ever since human beings stood upright, freeing their hands, they have been using <b>natural</b> pigments, <b>earth</b> <b>colours</b> and {{synthetic}} pigments to record their experiences. If the language is meant to communicate ideas and record events, then art was truly yhe first language. Colour is the most immediate form of non- verbal communication. We naturally react to colour as we have evolved with a certain understanding of it, partly because the survival of our ancestors depended on it with regard to what to consume and avoid. Colour is used to represent thoughts and emotions {{in a way that}} no other element of design can, and it can act as an instant attention grabber whether in print, on screen or on a supermarket shelf. As such, colour is an important face og contemporary design. We all, inherently, have preferences that inform our decisions when dealing with colour, and we are subject to all the cultural norms and understandings of colour usage that surround us. Colour is perhaps the first element that we register when we view something for the first time. Our cultural development and conditioning mean that we will naturally make associations based upon the colours we see, and these provide an idea of how we should react to an object or design that incorporates them. Colour attach meaning, and our reaction to this will depend upon cultural associations, trends, age and individual preferences...|$|R

The <b>Natural</b> <b>Earth</b> II projection has a unique shape compared to most other pseudocylindrical projections. At high latitudes, meridians bend steeply toward short pole lines resulting in a map with highly rounded corners that resembles an elongated globe. Its distortion properties are similar to most other established world map projections. Equations consist of simple polynomials. A user study evaluated whether map-readers prefer <b>Natural</b> <b>Earth</b> II to similar compromise projections.
