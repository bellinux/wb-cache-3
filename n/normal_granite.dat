5|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, {{had been found in}} drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than <b>normal</b> <b>granite,</b> a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth, and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating much deeper in the earth, and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest known layered bed of sand, around 100 m deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.|$|E

Acesso restrito. p. 263 - 271 The Jequie granulitic {{complex is}} part of the {{extensive}} high-grade metamorphic terrain located within the Sao Francisco craton of northeastern Brazil. Some Jequie rocks appear to have been formed in the middle Archean (~ 3. 1 Ga) from preexisting sialic crust_ The dominant mineral composition of these rocks is quartz-microcline-plagioclase-hypcrstene and occurs over an extensive area (~ 2, 000 km 2). Scattered enTichment of <b>normal</b> <b>granites</b> with many minor elements (e. g. Rb, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, REE), and the non-depletion of other elements (e. g. Cs, U), normally considered mobile during granulite facies metamorphism, must lead either to the reconsideration of regional metasomatism subsequent to granulite facies metamorphism, or at least raise some doubts about common wisdom concerning the distribution of heat-producing elements at depth. The region includes large-scale thrust structures, which could play a part in influencing high-level emplacement of the rocks and their regional metasomatism and structures...|$|R
25|$|An earlier gold event 2660-2655 Ma was {{associated}} with major extension (<b>normal</b> faulting and <b>granite</b> doming) resulting {{in the formation of}} late basins and the intrusion of mantle-derived magmas (syenites and Mafic-type granites/porphyries) and tight anticlockwise PTt paths.|$|R
60|$|The {{material}} {{of the four}} crests is the <b>normal</b> grey <b>granite,</b> enormous lumps and masses rounded by degradation; all chasms and naked columns, with {{here and there a}} sheet burnished by ancient cataracts, and a slide trickling with water, unseen in the shade and flashing in the sun like a sheet of crystal. The granite, however, is a mere mask or excrescence, being everywhere based upon and backed by the green and red plutonic traps which have enveloped it. And the prism has no easy inland slopes, as a first glance suggests; instead of being the sea-wall of a great plateau, it falls abruptly to the east {{as well as to the}} west. The country behind it shows a perspective of high and low hills, lines of dark rock divided from one another by Wadys of the usual exaggerated size. Of these minor heights only one, the Jebel el-Sahhárah looks down upon the sea, rising between the Dibbagh-Kh'shabríyyah block to the north, and the Shárr to the south. Beyond the broken eastern ground, the ruddy Hismá and the gloomy Harrah form the fitting horizon.|$|R
40|$|Crushed large {{oil palm}} shell (OPS) {{was used as}} a coarse {{aggregate}} in four different concrete mixtures. The stress-strain behavior and modulus of elasticity of OPS concrete were investigated and compared to <b>granite</b> <b>normal</b> weight concrete (NWC) and expanded clay lightweight concrete (LWC). The stress-strain curve of the OPS concrete showed that this type of LWC, in contrast to many types of structural LWC, is a ductile material. The highest E value of about 18. 4. GPa was achieved in this study, which is significantly higher than previous studies. It was found that the E value of crushed OPS LWC was approximately 53 of the control NWC, which is approximately twice that of the uncrushed OPS concrete reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Oil palm shell (OPS) {{is a waste}} {{lightweight}} aggregate originating from the palm oil industry, which is approximately 50 lighter than conventional aggregate. In this study, crushed old OPS was used as coarse aggregate. Compressive strength under different curing conditions and the splitting tensile and flexural strengths were {{compared with those of}} the <b>normal</b> weight <b>granite</b> concrete. The test results showed that OPS concrete with a compressive strength in the range of 34 - 53 MPa has a splitting tensile strength range of 2. 8 - 3. 5 MPa and flexural strength range of 4. 4 - 7. 0 MPa. The sensitivity of compressive strength of OPS concrete in this study is significantly lower than uncrushed OPS concrete reported in the literature. The sensitivity of OPS concrete, under poor curing regime, can be reduced by decreasing the water/cement ratio, increasing the OPS content or reducing the cement content. It was found that there was no substantial difference in 28 -day compressive strength for OPS concretes cured initially for 3, 5 and 7 days. The 28 -day compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths of OPS concrete was found to be 38, 28 and 17, lower than that of granite concrete, respectively...|$|R
6000|$|We made {{a general}} reconnaisance (December 27th) {{of a place}} whence {{specimens}} of pavonine quartz had come to hand. Following the Wady 'Ifriyá round {{the north and east}} of the White Mountain, we fell into the Wady Simákh (of [...] "Wild Sumach"), that drains the great gap between the Pinnacles and the Buttresses of the 'Urnub-Tihámah section. After riding some two miles, we found to the south-east fragments of dark, iridescent, and metallic quartz: they emerge from the plain like walls, bearing north-south, with 36 degrees of westing and a westward dip of 15 degrees to 20 degrees--exactly the conditions which Australia seeks, and which produced the huge [...] "Welcome Nugget" [...] of Ballarat. They crop out of the <b>normal</b> trap-dyked grey <b>granite,</b> and select specimens show the fine panaché lustre of copper. M. Marie afterwards took from one of the geodes a pinch of powder weighing about half a gramme, and cupelled a bright dust-shot bead weighing not less than two centigrammes. Without further examination he determined it to be argentiferous, when it was possibly iron or antimony. On the other hand, the silver discovered in the Grand Filon by so careful and conscientious an observer as Gastinel Bey, {{and the fact that we}} are here on the same line of outcrop, and at a horizon three hundred feet lower, are reassuring.|$|R
