40|$|Nutrition is {{major concern}} for the mankind. Food determines body {{condition}} right from the womb to tomb; it is main source of energy. Abnormal nutrition may cause both over and under nutrition hazards. It causes {{more than half of}} the nearly 11 million deaths each year among children under age five. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> disorders are viewed under Apatarpanajanya vyadhis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore {{incidence}} and prevalence rates of <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> in adults in general practice. METHODS: Six Dutch general practice research and registration networks supplied {{incidence and}} prevalence rates of <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> by the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) or 'E-list' labels ('loss of appetite, feeding problem adult, iron, pernicious/folate deficiency anaemia, vitamin <b>deficiencies</b> and other <b>nutritional</b> disorders, weight loss'). In case of disease-related <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency,</b> we asked {{whether this was}} labelled separately ('co-registered') or included in the registration of the underlying disease. RESULTS: 'Iron deficiency anaemia' had highest incidence (0. 3 - 8. 5 / 1000 person years), and prevalence rates (2. 8 - 8. 9 / 1000 person years). <b>Nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> was mostly documented in the elderly. In two networks 'co-registration' was additional, two only documented the underlying disease and two did not specify 'co-registration'. No clear difference was found between networks considering the difference in 'co-registration'. CONCLUSION: <b>Nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> is little documented in general practice, and generally is not registered separately from the underlying disease. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E
5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the studies}} {{conducted}} that observe alcoholic polyneuropathy in patients are often criticized for their criteria used to assess <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the subjects because {{they may not have}} completely ruled out the possibility of a <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the genesis of the polyneuropathy.

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> is an {{independent}} risk factor for mortality. Despite its clinical relevance, the prevalence in a primary care setting is poorly documented. We performed a systematic review of reported prevalence and clinical assessment of <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> in general practice. Methods: From MEDLINE, Current Contents and EMBASE, we derived articles and checked the initially included ones for references on prevalence data. Of the eligible articles, we assessed the quality of research and results. Results: We finally included eight studies. The prevalence ranged from 0 to 13 %. However, the study populations were heterogeneous and all studies contained methodological flaws, especially selection bias. In addition, the clinical assessment differed between studies. Conclusion: Literature on the prevalence of <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> within general practice is rare and provides disputable prevalence assessment...|$|R

No scientific evidence has established the efficacy of such diets in treating autism in children. An elimination diet may create <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> that harm overall health unless care is taken to assure proper nutrition. For example, a 2008 study found that autistic boys on casein-free diets have significantly thinner bones than usual, presumably because the diets contribute to calcium and vitamin D deficiencies.|$|E

25|$|Shedding. Reptiles {{shed their}} skin {{through a process}} called ecdysis which occurs {{continuously}} throughout their lifetime. In particular, younger reptiles tend to shed once every 5–6 weeks while adults shed 3-4 times a year. O Younger reptiles shed more because of their rapid growth rate. Once full size, the frequency of shedding drastically decreases. The process of ecdysis involves forming a new layer of skin under the old one. Proteolytic enzymes and lymphatic fluid is secreted between {{the old and new}} layers of skin. Consequently, this lifts the old skin from the new one allowing for shedding to occur. Snakes will shed from the head to the tail while lizards shed in a “patchy pattern”. Dysecdysis, a common skin disease in snakes and lizards will occur when ecdysis, or shedding, fails. There are numerous reasons why shedding fails and can be related to inadequate humidity and temperature, <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> dehydration and traumatic injuries. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> decreases proteolytic enzymes while dehydration reduces lymphatic fluids to separate the skin layers. Traumatic injuries on the other hand, forms scars that will not allow new scales to form and disrupt the process of ecdysis.|$|E

25|$|Central neuropathic pain {{is found}} in spinal cord injury, {{multiple}} sclerosis, and some strokes. Aside from diabetes (see diabetic neuropathy) and other metabolic conditions, the common causes of painful peripheral neuropathies are herpes zoster infection, HIV-related neuropathies, <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> toxins, remote manifestations of malignancies, immune mediated disorders and physical trauma to a nerve trunk. Neuropathic pain is common in cancer {{as a direct result}} of cancer on peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor), or as a side effect of chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), radiation injury or surgery.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholism is {{normally}} associated with <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> which {{may contribute to}} the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Thiamine, vitamin B-12, and folic acid are vitamins that play an essential role in the peripheral and central nervous system and should be among the first analyzed in laboratory tests. It has been difficult to assess thiamine status in individuals due to difficulties in developing a method to directly assay thiamine in the blood and urine. A liver function test may also be ordered, as alcoholic consumption may cause an increase in liver enzyme levels.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{biochemistry}} {{deals with}} the structures, functions and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life.

The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine, nutrition, and agriculture. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of diseases.
