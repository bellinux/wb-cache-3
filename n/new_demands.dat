During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.|$|E

Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes {{that it needs to}} make a contribution to maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E

5|$|The Chilembwe {{uprising}} was {{a rebellion}} against British colonial rule in Nyasaland (modern-day Malawi) in January 1915, led by John Chilembwe, an American-educated Baptist minister, whose radical evangelical views of racial injustice {{may also have}} been influenced by millenarian Christian. Based around his church in the village of Mbombwe in the south-east of the country, the revolt was centred on the black middle class and encouraged by grievances against the colonial system, including forced labour, discrimination and the <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> on the indigenous population caused by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E

But the said <b>new</b> <b>demand</b> being evaded, or rather refused, agreeably to the fair construction of the treaty, by the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, the matter was for the present dropped.|$|R

25|$|With {{the rise}} of the Assyrian Empire, <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> were placed on {{transport}} and communication. Prior to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, roads in Mesopotamia were little more than well-trodden pathways used by the locals. However, this was inadequate for an empire whose armies were constantly on the move, repressing one revolt after another. The Assyrians were the first to institute, control and maintain a system of roads throughout their empire. Pony expresses with regular way stations for messengers to rest and/or exchange horses were established. Later, these would form the basis for the Persians to expand this system to their own empire.|$|E

Her activity agenda included the challenges that families and the youth face in today's world, or the <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> in social assistance.

30|$|Technology windows {{occur when}} new {{technology}} allows for radical innovation. When {{a new technology}} or radical innovation is introduced, the incumbent may fall behind if it is locked into existing technology. This situation {{is known as the}} “incumbent trap” (Chandy and Tellis 2000). The incumbent continues to invest and enhance its existing technology, which impedes its ability to seize opportunities arising from technological change, whereas latecomer firms can more easily and actively adopt new technologies to forge ahead. Demand windows describe the creation of <b>new</b> <b>demand</b> in a market. Unlike incumbents, latecomers have stronger motivations to respond to such <b>new</b> <b>demand.</b> If <b>new</b> <b>demand</b> grows rapidly, the effect may provide ample possibilities for late entrants to catch up (Lee and Malerba 2017 b). Institutional windows of opportunity describe government intervention through public policies or institutional change. In certain instances, institutional support in emerging markets can be the only source of market creation and support for local firms (Wei et al. 2016 c). By capturing these windows of opportunities, Chinese firms have the potential to capture huge market shares, both domestically and globally.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a <b>new</b> <b>demand</b> for money that {{incorporates}} the major characteristic of digital money, privacy. This <b>new</b> <b>demand</b> {{is an extension}} of the theories of Clower (1968) and Hayek (1978). According to the former author, the <b>demand</b> for a <b>new</b> type of money will depend upon its reduction in transaction costs. For the latter author there is an inherent element in the demand for money. This element is the heterogeneity which generates a need for different types of money. We combine these two conditions with our theory which relates the <b>new</b> <b>demand</b> for money, with the condition of undertaking transactions anonymously and privately. As a result of privacy and of a reduction in transaction costs there will be an impact on fiscal and monetary policy. Using data referent to Brazil, we analyze the impact on the monetary policy. The substitution of 1 % of M 1 by digital money may cause a monetary expansion amounting to R$ 2. 4 billion, depending on compulsory tax. ...|$|R
25|$|Prior to World War II, the {{branches}} of the United States military generally trained their staff independently, but <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> for collaborative efforts by services dedicated to ground, sea and air made clear the need for joint education. In December 1942, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, General Hap Arnold, proposed a War College that might train officers for joint operations between the United States Army and Navy and develop new methods and doctrines for cooperative efforts during the war. To meet this need, in 1943 Hap and his fellow Joint Chiefs of Staff established a temporary Army and Navy Staff College that provided four-month courses for officers {{through the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|The coldbloods of Germany {{were already}} well-suited to the <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> of farming given their immense power, and the Ostfriesen {{had to prove}} it could offer these same qualities. The one {{advantage}} for the warmbloods was their versatility. They were subsequently bred to have greater depth, breadth and strength, {{at the expense of}} the dryness, nerve, expression and gait qualities for which they had previously been selected. From 1908 to 1940, the average height of Ostfriesisches decreased 4cm while average weight increased from 630kg to 760kg. Other regions began to breed heavy warmbloods: Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, Bavaria, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, and Silesia. While they were founded on their own stock, horses from Oldenburg and Ostfriesland were sold there each year to help them realize their goals.|$|E

Sapp attended all the pre-fight press conferences and even attended the opening ceremonies for the show. It is unclear at the moment as to why, but Sapp pulled out of the event midway through the show. K-1 issued a statement claiming Sapp pulled out due to <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> he brought to promoters during the show. K-1 would not agree to those demands since they felt their written contract was final and Sapp left. The full K-1 press release can be viewed on the organization's website.

25|$|Yet {{the great}} {{expansion}} of Rome {{and the consequent}} transformations worked to subvert the ancient order. Gradually, older institutions grew incapable of effectively meeting new and challenging circumstances, of performing the required civic tasks. The purported sovereignty of the comitia (people's assembly) became only a fiction, which might be exploited by demagogues for their own purposes. In the Senate, the old aristocratic oligarchy began to become corrupted by the enormous wealth derived from military conquest and its aftermath; it no longer served well its functional purpose, it failed to meet <b>new</b> <b>demands</b> placed on Rome, and its members would selfishly seek to preserve inherited prerogatives against legitimate challenge and transition. A frequently unpatriotic capitalism abused its power in politics and by irresponsible speculation. The free peasantry became squeezed by the competing demands of powerful interests; accordingly its numbers began to dwindle, which eventually led to a restructuring of Army recruitment, and later resulted in disastrous consequences for the entire commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|In the {{digestive}} system, the anterior {{region of the}} foregut has been modified to form a pharyngial sucking pump as they need it for the food they eat, which {{are for the most}} part liquids. An esophagus follows and leads to the posterior of the pharynx and in some species forms a form of crop. The midgut is short and straight, with the hindgut being longer and coiled. Ancestors of lepidopteran species, stemming from Hymenoptera, had midgut ceca, although this is lost in current butterflies and moths. Instead, all {{the digestive}} enzymes other than initial digestion, are immobilized at the surface of the midgut cells. In larvae, long-necked and stalked goblet cells are found in the anterior and posterior midgut regions, respectively. In insects, the goblet cells excrete positive potassium ions, which are absorbed from leaves ingested by the larvae. Most butterflies and moths display the usual digestive cycle, however species that have a different diet require adaptations to meet these <b>new</b> <b>demands.</b>|$|E
25|$|On December 22, the WBO made Álvarez the {{mandatory}} challenger {{to the world}} middleweight title, skipping the previous number 1, Avtandil Khurtsidze, which was considered controversial, due to Álvarez currently not fighting at middleweight. Khurtsidze, who had ten days to appeal decision, decided not to. On December 24, Álvarez and his team gave Chávez a week to accept the terms, which included a purse of $7m, or he would consider other options. On January 12, 2017 De La Hoya and Álvarez called for the contract to be signed, which was supposedly sent to Al Haymon, who advises Chávez Jr. and urged him to sign it.
