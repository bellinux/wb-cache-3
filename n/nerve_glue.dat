40|$|Reparation of {{peripheral}} <b>nerves</b> with fibrin <b>glue</b> prepared from snake venom. Preliminary results Universidade do Estado de sao Paulo (UNESP) - sao Paulo, Brazil A new fibrin glue {{obtained from}} snake venom is presented, with possible utilization in various fields of medicine. The preparation procedures and {{tests in the}} reparation of peripheral nerves are described. The preliminary results were similar to the conventional fibrin glue procedure. UNITERMS: Fibrin glue. Snake venom. Peripheral nerves. Rats. A trombim-like fraction was isolated from crudeCrotalus snake venom through molecularexclusion and affinity chromatography (1). The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by dialysis (1, 2, 8). The pool was analyzed for protein concentration (6) and characterized by sodium-dodecil-sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (SDS-PAGE).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was designed}} to compare the histological analysis of nerve anastomosis with 10 - 0 microsurgical sutures and fibrin adhesive. Wistar albino rats&#x 2032; sciatic nerves were transected and repaired either with fibrin adhesive-Beriplast P (M/s Centeon-Cadila Health Care) or with 10 - 0 monofilament microsutures. Histological assessment was performed at 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery. Functional recovery of the sciatic nerves started at two months and was near normal by three months. Separation of the stumps did not occur in any of the <b>glued</b> <b>nerves.</b> Histological evaluation showed no appreciable difference in the outcome of nerve regeneration after microsurgical repair using sutures or fibrin tissue adhesive. However, inflammation and granuloma formation were appreciated at the suture site, which presented a focal hindrance to myelin and axonal regeneration. Fibrin glueing is attractive for clinical purposes, since it is simpler and less time consuming than suturing...|$|R
40|$|Microsurgical suturing is {{the gold}} {{standard}} of nerve coaptation. Although literature on the usefulness of fibrin glue as an alternative is becoming increasingly available, it remains contradictory. Furthermore, no data exist on how both repair methods might influence the morphological aspects (arborization; branching) of early peripheral nerve regeneration. We used the sciatic nerve transplantation model in thy- 1 yellow fluorescent protein mice (YFP; n = 10). Pieces of nerve (1 cm) were grafted from YFP-negative mice (n = 10) into those expressing YFP. We performed microsuture coaptations {{on one side and}} used fibrin glue for repair on the contralateral side. Seven days after grafting, the regeneration distance, the percentage of regenerating and arborizing axons, the number of branches per axon, the coaptation failure rate, the gap size at the repair site and the time needed for surgical repair were all investigated. Fibrin glue repair resulted in regenerating axons travelling further into the distal nerve. It also increased the percentage of arborizing axons. No coaptation failure was detected. Gap sizes were comparable in both groups. Fibrin glue significantly reduced surgical repair time. The increase in regeneration distance, even after the short period of time, is in line with the results of others that showed faster axonal regeneration after fibrin glue repair. The increase in arborizing axons could be another explanation for better functional and electrophysiological results after fibrin glue repair. Fibrin <b>glue</b> <b>nerve</b> coaptation seems to be a promising alternative to microsuture repair...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose. Studies {{reporting}} {{the effect of}} retinal cooling on the electroretinogram of mammals have, in most cases, made use of an in vitro approach where {{the temperature of the}} retina was lowered by reducing the temperature of the bathing media. The purpose of our study was to investigate, in rabbits, the effect of in vivo retinal cooling using an experimental approach never before reported in order to determine if some of the temperature-related ERG effects previously shown could have been, in part, amplified by alterations in the physiological status of the retina due to preparation for in vitro study. Methods. In order to reduce the temperature of the retina, a 20 gauge plastic tubing was coiled around the eye from the limbus to the optic <b>nerve</b> head and <b>glued</b> to the sclera. Cold (15 °C) tap water entered the tubing at the limbal extremity and exited (18 °C) at the optic nerve extremity. Intraretinal temperature was measured to be within 1 °C of that of the circulating water. Results. Our results indicate that with progressive retinal cooling the a- and b-waves are gradually reduced to 66. 9 ± 17. 3 and 90. 9 ± 10. 4 % of control respectively. The most dramatic temperature induced ERG modifications were observed in the oscillatory potential recordings where the mean summed OP amplitude (OP 2 + OP 3 + OP 4) was reduced to less than 23. 9 ± 13. 5 % of control with OP, being the least affected. The peak times of all the ERG components were significantly delayed with cooling. Conclusions. Of all the ERG components examined, the OPs were those most severely affected by our manipulation. We believe that our results constitute further evidence in support of the concept that the OPs are more sensitive to retinal disturbance than the b-wave...|$|R
40|$|Regeneration of long fiber tracts {{does not}} occur spontaneously in the adult {{mammalian}} brain or spinal cord. The present work {{is an attempt to}} develop a repair strategy that may overcome this lack of recovery and apply it to spinal cord injury. The strategy is based on bridging the spinal cord gap with multiple peripheral nerve grafts supported by several facilitating additional measures. To be able to reconnect and reroute several descending and ascending spinal cord tracts, multiple nerve implants are needed. Intercostal nerves were found to be a useful alternative, since they were thin, and could be collected in sufficient amount for autologous grafting without causing severe functional deficits. Primate intercostal nerves were also tested for their ability to "deliver" a mixed population of regenerating nerve fibers to a target environment. Grafting intercostal nerve segments to the rat spinal cord was carried out after removal of 5 mm of the cord at T 8. Eighteen grafts were placed to specifically initiate regeneration of, and reroute defined fiber tracts from white matter proximal to the gap to corresponding termination areas in gray matter below the gap, and vice versa. Fibrin glue was evaluated as a biodegradable stabilization agent. The glue was shown not to cause any disturbance of brain tissue grafts, and to allow penetration of growing nerve fibers. The fibrin glue was further evaluated as a possible vehicle for slow release of trophic proteins. Both acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and glial cell line- derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) could be effectively incorporated into the glue. Acidic FGF, a normal constituent of the spinal cord hypothetized to be of importance in injury, was then included in fibrin glue and such glue infused into the engrafted area of the spinal cord. Several methods for vertebral column stabilization were tested in a vertebral shortening paradigm allowing the cut spinal cord stumps to meet and leading to a degree of proxim- odistal regeneration of descending 5 -HT fibers. Based on these tests, a method using com- pressive wiring of spinal processes and securing the monofilament stainless steel wire to the rib cage, was chosen for the repair strategy. Analysis of rats made paraplegic and subjected to the full repair strategy (18 white-to-gray bridges, fibrin glue with aFGF, compressive wiring) demonstrated return of hind limb positioning, followed by return of hindlimb movements and partial weight bearing. None of these changes were noted in any of several different types of paraplegic control animals. Structural analysis using anterograde and retrograde WGA-HRP axonal tracing revealed many regenerated descending fiber tracts, including the corticospinal tract. Detailed analyis of gait demonstrated that the repaired ani- mals were able to use their four limbs in controlled order and patterns similar to those found in normal rats. While the repaired animals remain functionally inferior to normal animals, the data demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} regain some hindlimb function after complete spinal cord injury. If this method can be improved, and applied to animals with chronic spinal cord injury, it may have future clinical potential.
