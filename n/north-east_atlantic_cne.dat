40|$|The {{international}} community has recognised Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as an important tool for area-based management of ecosystems. Regional organisations have {{taken the lead in}} areas beyond national jurisdiction to create MPAs. This paper will compare the issues facing the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the relevant Antarctic Treaty bodies in the Southern Ocean, to the <b>North-East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean where the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the <b>North-East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> (OSPAR) and the <b>North-East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) are the lead bodies. Many of the issues that face each region in designating MPAs differ due to geopolitical differences; resulting in the <b>North-East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> producing more success in designating a network of MPAs. The <b>North-East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> organisations, however, face more difficulties to ensure the comprehensive management of MPAs. As CCAMLR and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty sit within the Antarctic Treaty System, the potential exists for a better integrated management framework in the Southern Ocean. The themes from both regions will then be put into a wider global context to provide some guidance and identify issues for other regional organisations seeking to establish MPAs in ABNJ...|$|R

40|$|The {{systematics}} {{and distribution}} of the cirrate octopod genus Grimpoteuthis in the <b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> are reviewed. Three new species are described and Grimpoteuthis wuelkeri (Grimpe, 1920) is redescribed. A new generic diagnosis is proposed. Five species of Grimpoteuthis are recognized in the <b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The type species, G. umbellata (Fisher, 1883) is known only from the type specimen, which is in such poor condition that comparison with recently captured material was not possible. G. wuelkeri is a large, slope species, caught between 1600 in and 2200 in in the <b>north-east</b> and north-west <b>Atlantic.</b> Of the three new species, both G. boylei and G. challengeri are large abyssal species. G. boylei {{is found in the}} <b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) and the Madeira Abyssal Plain and may be found at abyssal depths throughout the <b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> G. challengeri is known from the PAP, with a single specimen from the north-west Atlantic. G. discoveryi is a small, lower slope and abyssal species found in the <b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The Grimpoteuthis species can be separated based on shell form, presence of a radula and posterior salivary glands, arrangement of suckers and cirri and gill morphology. Two species, G. megaptera Verrill and G. plena Verrill, have been described from the north-west Atlantic, but the types are either lost (G. megaptera) or in poor condition (G. plena), hindering comparisons. Material examined from the north-west Atlantic included G. wuelkeri, G. challengeri and at least two other species...|$|R

40|$|This work aims at characterising the {{seamount}} physiography {{and biology}} in the OSPAR Convention limits (<b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean) and Mediterranean Sea. We first inferred potential abundance, location and morphological characteristics of seamounts, and secondly, summarized the existing biological, geological and oceanographic in situ research, identifying examples of well-studied seamounts. Our {{study showed that}} the seamount population in the OSPAR area (<b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic)</b> and in the Mediterranean Sea is large with around 557 and 101 seamount-like features, respectively. Similarly, seamounts occupy large areas of about 616 000 km 2 in the OSPAR region and of about 89 500 km 2 in the Mediterranean Sea. The presence of seamounts in the <b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> has been known since the late 19 th century, but overall knowledge regarding seamount ecology and geology is still relatively poor. Only 37 seamounts in the OSPAR area (3. 5 % of all seamounts in the region), 22 in the Mediterranean Sea (9. 2 % of all seamounts in the region) and 25 in the <b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> south of the OSPAR area have in situ information. Seamounts mapped in both areas are in general very heterogeneous, showing diverse geophysical characteristics. These differences will likely affect the biological diversity and production of resident and associated organisms...|$|R

40|$|Driven by {{interest}} in measuring the oceanic velocity field from space, sea surface temperature (SST) {{has been suggested}} {{as a proxy for}} potential vorticity (PV), which may then be inverted to give velocity. However, {{little is known about the}} relationships between PV and other water mass tracers, as these have not previously been thoroughly examined. In this thesis, the inter-relationships between PV, SST, potential temperature and salinity in three quite different frontal regions of the ocean are investigated. The regions studied were in the <b>North-east</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> the Sargasso Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea (Southern Ocean). The only earlier work known in this field was by Fischer et al. (1989), which found a near-linear relationship between PV and isopycnic potential temperature on a shallow isopycnal in the North Atlantic. This relationship was also evident in climatological values of PV and temperature in the North Atlantic. The results from the three regions considered in this thesis vary considerably, and are believed to be due to different frontal dynamics and water mass formation mechanisms. All the <b>North-east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> results are in close agreement, despite differences in measurement scales and the year of survey. The reasons for different relationships occurring are examined. Theories for setting PV and tracer values are investigated, and in particular the models of Woods (1985) and Spall (1995) are found to explain the relationships found in the <b>North-east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and Sargasso Sea, respectively. However, a combination of these models, applied to different scales of motion, is needed to explain the Bellingshausen Sea results. Preliminary work is carried out using a one-dimensional computer model to follow the development of the relationship in the <b>north-east</b> <b>Atlantic...</b>|$|R
