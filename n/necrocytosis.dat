30|$|LDL (low density lipoprotein) is {{responsible}} for transporting cholesterol to the body cells. It transports about 60 – 70  % of total cholesterol. Therefore, an increase in TC level consequently increases LDL-c. The increased LDL-c which was not removed {{in the process of}} lipid metabolism is likely to flow into the subendothelial space, and subsequently undergo oxidation. The oxidized LDL is phagocytized by the scavengers of macrophages and the fat-laden macrophage is left with the lipid core filled with cholesterol after <b>necrocytosis</b> and then arteriosclerosis is initiated [27]. This work shows significant (P[*]<[*] 0.05) reduction in LDL-c levels by all Garcinia kola biflavonoid fractions (Tables  1 and 2), the biflavonoid fractions may have increased LDL-c receptors densities in the liver binding to apolipoprotein B thereby making liver cells more efficient to remove LDL-c from blood as reported by Baum et al. [28].|$|E

Materials and methods: A microemulsion was prepared using the dropwise addition method. Mouse skin fibroblasts were cultured in vitro to {{investigate the}} optimal conditions for evodiamine and rutaecarpine uptake with different drug concentrations and administration times. Under optimal conditions, the cellular uptake of microemulsified drugs was assayed and compared to tinctures and aqueous suspensions. Rhodamine B labeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were used to explore the distribution of fluorochrome transferred with the microemulsion in fibroblasts. Cellular morphology was also investigated, using optical microscopy to evaluate microemulsion-induced cellular toxicity. Results: The maximum cellular drug uptake amounts were obtained with a 20 % concentration (v/v) of microemulsion and an 8 hour administration time. Drug uptake by mouse skin fibroblasts was lowest when the drugs were loaded in microemulsion. After incubation with rhodamine B-labeled microemulsion for 8 hours, the highest fluorescence intensity was achieved, and the fluorochrome was primarily distributed in the cytochylema. No obvious cellular morphologic changes were observed with the administration of either the microemulsion or the aqueous suspension; for the tincture group, however, massive cellular <b>necrocytosis</b> was observed. Conclusion: The lower cellular uptake with microemulsion {{may be due to}} the fact that most of the drug loaded in the microemulsion vehicle was transported via the intercellular space, while a small quantity of free drug (released from the vehicle) was ingested through transmembrane transport. Mouse skin fibroblasts rarely endocytosed evodiamine and rutaecarpine with a microemulsion as the vehicle. The microemulsion had no obvious effect on cellular morphology, suggesting there is little or no cellular toxicity associated with the administration of microemulsion on mouse skin fibroblasts.
