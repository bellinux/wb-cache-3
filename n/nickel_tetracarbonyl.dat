5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with <b>nickel</b> <b>tetracarbonyl,</b> for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E

500|$|This {{dimerisation}} {{process has}} {{the overall effect}} of decreasing the electron count around the rhodium centre from 19 to 18.

The term hapticity is used to indicate the [...] "number of carbon (or other) atoms through which [...] binds (n)" [...] to a metal centre and is symbolised as ηn. For example, the ethylene ligand in Zeise's salt is bound to the platinum centre through both carbon atoms, and it hence formally has the formula K·H2O. The carbonyl ligands in <b>nickel</b> <b>tetracarbonyl</b> are each bound through only a carbon atom and are hence described as monohapto ligands, but η1-notations are typically omitted in formulae.

50|$|Compounds {{of nickel}} are {{chemical}} compounds containing the element nickel {{which is a}} member of the group 10 of the periodic table. Most compounds in the group have an oxidation state of +2. Nickel is classified as a transition metal with nickel(II) having much chemical behaviour in common with iron(II) and cobalt(II). Many salts of nickel(II) are isomorphous with salts of magnesium due to the ionic radii of the cations being almost the same.

Jones were able to determine the structure of di-iron nonacarbonyl, which is produced from iron pentacarbonyl {{by the action of}} sunlight. After Mond, who died in 1909, the chemistry of metal carbonyls fell for several years in oblivion. The BASF started in 1924 the industrial production of iron pentacarbonyl by a process which was developed by Alwin Mittasch. The iron pentacarbonyl was used for the production of high-purity iron, so-called carbonyl iron, and iron oxide pigment. Not until 1927 did A. Job and A.

40|$|The {{recycling}} of batteries {{is an important}} issue in a sustainable society where materials {{recycling of}} complex products is a necessity. Without an efficient recycling there will be an unnecessary loss of both materials and energy due to inefficient or non-existent recycling. This project concerns the recycling of nickel metal hydride (NiMH) hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) batteries and aims to outline the potentials and possibilities inherent in this waste stream. The main valuable metals in the batteries are nickel, cobalt and lanthanoids. The active cathode material is a triprecipitate of mainly nickel with zinc and cobalt in hydroxide form with yttrium and magnesium added, pasted onto a nickel metal foam-mesh support. The active anode material is a hydrogen absorbing alloy containing approximately 54 % nickel and 31 % lanthanoids and smaller amounts of manganese, cobalt, aluminium and yttrium. The recovery of these metals should be performed using a method which minimizes the use of energy and chemicals. The work presented in this thesis is a characterization of the batteries and a dissolution study of individual electrode materials as a first step in a hydrometallurgical recycling process. A nickel removal and purification process has also been investigated, the so called Mond process, by which nickel reacts with carbon monoxide and forms <b>nickel</b> <b>tetracarbonyl.</b> The <b>nickel</b> <b>tetracarbonyl</b> both forms and is highly volatile at a low temperature, unlike other relevant carbonyl compounds. This means that the volatilized nickel can easily be separated {{from the rest of the}} material and thereby purified. This gives both pure nickel and an interesting residue to work with. The positive electrode active material, nickel hydroxide, can be dissolved without dissolving the electrode backing material (nickel metal). A rapid dissolution of the active material on the positive electrode can be achieved at low temperature and relatively low acid concentration (pH 0. 5 - 1. 5), while leaving the major part of the nickel metal undissolved.

40|$|The {{high-pressure}} {{carbon monoxide}} (HiPco) process for producing single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) uses iron pentacarbonyl {{as the source}} of iron for catalyzing the Boudouard reaction. Attempts using <b>nickel</b> <b>tetracarbonyl</b> led to no production of SWNTs. This paper discusses simulations at a constant condition of 1300 K and 30 atm in which the chemical rate equations are solved for different reaction schemes. A lumped cluster model is developed {{to limit the number of}} species in the models, yet it includes fairly large clusters. Reaction rate coefficients in these schemes are based on bond energies of iron and nickel species and on estimates of chemical rates for formation of SWNTs. SWNT growth is measured by the co-formation of CO 2. It is shown that the production of CO 2 is significantly greater for FeCO due to its lower bond energy as compared with that ofNiCO. It is also shown that the dissociation and evaporation rates of atoms from small metal clusters have a significant effect on CO 2 production. A high rate of evaporation leads to a smaller number of metal clusters available to catalyze the Boudouard reaction. This suggests that if CO reacts with metal clusters and removes atoms from them by forming MeCO, this has the effect of enhancing the evaporation rate and reducing SWNT production. The study also investigates some other reactions in the model that have a less dramatic influence...|$|E
