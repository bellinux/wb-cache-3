Together with other illegal parties, his DASU formed the <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Rally</b> in 1980, {{to act as a}} sort of mirror version to the NPF. Jamal al-Atassi became its official spokesman. Such was his stature {{at the time of his}} death, that Assad ordered him a semi-official state funeral, honoring him as a patriot of conviction and principle. In a family of political giants, Jamal al-Atassi managed to carve for himself a distinct place in the Syrian political landscape, and commanded wide respect among his countrymen despite his continued opposition to the Assad government. He was known as a great political mind with his own views on Arabism and socialism. His death was followed closely by the death of Assad himself in 2000.|$|E
