40|$|International audienceThe {{quartz crystal}} {{microbalance}} (QCM) {{is a very}} accurate sensor for measuring small changes of mass of thin films spread on the quartz surface. Under certain conditions, the resonance frequency of a quartz crystal {{can be used for}} monitoring the mass change caused by solvent adsorption or dissolution inside a film. However, when a quartz crystal is immersed in a high-pressure <b>non-inert</b> <b>gas,</b> various effects such as pressure, viscosity, roughness {{on the surface of the}} quartz crystal, adsorption of gas or even gas film formation slipping at the solid-gas interface can influence the resonance frequency of the quartz crystal and consequently complicate the relation between mass and frequency changes. In order to determine experimentally such effects in contact with carbon dioxide in the neighborhood of the critical conditions, the resonance curve of a quartz crystal under gas pressure was examined with a network analyzer which is able to determine both resonance frequency and half-band-half-width on several overtones...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and applicability of different methods for estimating resistance to gas diffusion through {{the analysis of}} the efflux of preloaded inert gas out of a fruit were critically assessed. The inert gas neon was introduced as a good replacement for the <b>non-inert</b> <b>gas</b> ethane. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the importance of the different parameters and indicated the importance of the internal free space volume and of the fruit surface area. Experiments with fruit of two apple and two pear cultivars confirmed that the results obtained with non-linear regression were more accurate. The largest resistance to gas diffusion was found in 'Doyenne du Comice' pears, followed by 'Conference' pears and 'Braeburn' apples, and the lowest value was found for 'Jonica' apples. Storage duration did not influence the resistance to gas diffusion except for 'Doyenne du Comice' pears where a significant increase in resistance to gas diffusion during storage was found. Harvest date had no influence on resistance to gas diffusion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|The gas in {{the tube}} {{has to be kept}} pure to {{maintain}} the desired properties; even small amount of impurities can dramatically change the tube values; presence of <b>non-inert</b> <b>gases</b> generally increases the breakdown and burning voltages. The presence of impurities can be observed by changes in the glow color of the gas. Air leaking into the tube introduces oxygen, which is highly electronegative and inhibits the production of electron avalanches. This makes the discharge look pale, milky, or reddish. Traces of mercury vapors glow bluish, obscuring the original gas color. Magnesium vapor colors the discharge green. To prevent outgassing of the tube components during operation, a bake-out is required before filling with gas and sealing. Thorough degassing is required for high-quality tubes; even as little as 10−8 torr (≈1 μPa) of oxygen is sufficient for covering the electrodes with monomolecular oxide layer in few hours. <b>Non-inert</b> <b>gases</b> can be removed by suitable getters. for mercury-containing tubes, getters that do not form amalgams with mercury (e.g. zirconium, but not barium) have to be used. Cathode sputtering may be used intentionally for gettering non-inert gases; some reference tubes use molybdenum cathodes for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{tends to}} be used up during the tube operation, by several {{phenomena}} collectively called clean-up. The gas atoms or molecules are adsorbed on the surfaces of the electrodes. In high voltage tubes, the accelerated ions can penetrate into the electrode materials. New surfaces, formed by sputtering of the electrodes and deposited on e.g. the inner surfaces of the tube, also readily adsorb <b>gases.</b> <b>Non-inert</b> <b>gases</b> can also chemically react with the tube components. Hydrogen may diffuse through some metals.|$|R
40|$|A getter/electrode {{assembly}} {{has been}} devised {{to suppress the}} regeneration mechanism of the electron cloud effect in the arc dipoles of LHC. The assembly consists of a copper foil electrode, supported through insulators on a stainless steel skid. The assembly {{is attached to the}} bottom surface of the beam screen using BeCu hairpins. The top surface of the Cu electrode can be coated with nonevaporative getter (NEG) to provide distributed pumping of all <b>non-inert</b> <b>gases</b> within the beam screen. When the electrode is biased + 100 V, electrons from beam ionizations and photoionization are cleared in < 25 ns, killing the regeneration mechanism for any feasible bunch spacing. The NEG surface can be regenerated by passing a current through the electrode to heat it to ~ 240 C. The heat transfe...|$|R
40|$|A getter/electrode {{assembly}} {{has been}} devised {{to suppress the}} regeneration mechanism of the electron cloud effect in the arc dipoles of LHC. The assembly consists of a copper foil electrode, supported through an insulating layer on a stainless steel skid, which would rest upon the flat bottom of the beam screen. The electrode is coated with NEG to provide effective pumping of all <b>non-inert</b> <b>gases</b> from the vacuum. Pumping should be enhanced by electron bombardment. By biasing the electrode ~+ 100 V secondary electrons produced on the surface would be fully re-absorbed, killing the regeneration mechanism. The NEG surface can be regenerated by passing a current through the electrode to heat it to ~ 240 C. The heat transfer (radiant + conductive) to the beam screen during regeneration is estimated ~ 10 W/m, within limits to maintain the beam screen at nominal 20 K temperature during regeneration. The entire assembly has been designed so that installation does not require modification of any hardware currently being built for the LHC arcs. The electrode assembly would occupy 1 mm in the vertical aperture of the beam screen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTorrefaction {{refers to}} a {{thermochemical}} treatment that reduces the moisture content of biomass and increases its energy density by removing water and lower energy volatiles. Torrefaction process requires mild treatment temperature between 200 to 300 ˚C {{in the absence of}} oxygen (inert atmosphere). Through torrefaction, biomass transformed into a char-like solid with higher value than the raw biomass. Industries found it applicable for the torrefied biomass to be co-fired with coal in power plants because of the close similarity in properties. The torrefied biomass can also be used as feedstock for entrained-flow gasifier, or for residential heating. During torrefaction, a continuous supply of nitrogen to create the needed inert state incurs certain cash flow to the torrefaction plant; meanwhile the nitrogen price is depending on the volatile prices of natural gas that is currently suffered from depletion. The alternative of this problem is to utilize flue gas as a replacement of the nitrogen in parallel with the fact that nitrogen is a major composition of flue gas. A fundamental study is needed to support the idea, for that reason this paper studied how the behaviour of torrefaction diverged when the process was carried out in the presence of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The chosen biomass is oil palm kernel shell (PKS) due to its abundance in Malaysia. The torrefactionis carried out 250 ˚C for 30 min. In comparison to the solid yield of torrefied PKS in inert torrefaction, the solid yield in oxygen and carbon dioxidetorrefactionis practically unaffected by the <b>non-inert</b> <b>gases.</b> Liquid yield is almost similar in each torrefactioncondition;however the gas yield in carbon dioxide torrefaction is produced intensely compared to the gas yield in oxygen torrefaction...|$|R
