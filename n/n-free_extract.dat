The experiment 1 (growth trial) was carried out on 120 one-day-old broiler chickens Ross 308 which were randomly divided into four homogenous groups, 30 birds per group (15 males and 15 females). Each treatment consisted of six replicates of 5 birds. A control diet contained soybean meal whereas in the experimental, a part of the soybean meal was replaced by 15 % rape cake from the Kaszub cultivar and supplemented with enzyme preparations containing xylanase or phytase added individually or in combination. On the 21 st day of experiment six birds from each group were scarified and the ileum and caeca were isolated for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) determination. The experiment 2 (digestibility trial) was carried out on 60 seven-day-old chickens divided into four treatments of 20 birds (4 replications of 5 birds) to determine nutrient digestibility of diets used in the growth trial. The digestibility test was carried out by the total collection method. The inclusion of 15 % rape cake instead of soybean meal and the addition of enzyme preparations did not decrease body weight gain and feed intake. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was higher in the group fed the diet in which phytase was added separately. A simultaneous application of xylanase and phytase statistically (P< 0. 05) increased the digestibility of crude fibre and <b>N-free</b> <b>extracts.</b> The lactic acid bacteria number was the highest in the caecum and ileum of birds fed the diet containing the xylanase preparation, whereas xylanase and phytase preparations added in combination had no effect on lactic acid bacteria number.

From each breed six purebred German Holstein (H) bulls representing the secretion type and six Charolais (CH) bulls representing the accretion type were raised and fattened under identical conditions with semi ad libitum feeding of a high energy diet. The animals were used for a digestion trial started at nine months of age and animals were slaughtered at 18 months of age. Body weight (668 vs. 764 kg, P = 0. 011), body weight gain (1 223 vs. 1 385 g/day, P = 0. 043), and body protein gain (93 vs. 128 g/day, P = 0. 001) were lower in H compared to CH bulls. Protein expense per kg protein accretion was higher in H bulls (13. 8 vs. 10. 2, P = 0. 001). No significant differences were found in concentration and pattern of ruminal short chain fatty acid and in apparent digestibility of organic matter, crude fibre, and <b>N-free</b> <b>extracts.</b> There were no significant differencs in all morphometric traits of rumen mucosa between both cattle breeds. Compared to H, the villi of CH bulls were higher in duodenum (586 vs. 495 µm, P = 0. 001) and proximal jejunum (598 vs. 518 µm, P < 0. 001), the crypt were deeper in duodenum (295 vs. 358, P < 0. 001) and proximal jejunum (292 vs. 344 µm, P = 0. 020).

Although the feeding ecology of cats in the wild {{has been well documented}} in the literature, there is no information on the precise nutrient profile to which the cat's metabolism has adapted. The present study aimed to derive the dietary nutrient profile of free-living cats. Studies reporting the feeding habits of cats in the wild were reviewed and data on the nutrient composition of the consumed prey items obtained from the literature. Fifty-five studies reported feeding strategy data of cats in the wild. After specific exclusion criteria, twenty-seven studies were used to derive thirty individual dietary nutrient profiles. The results show that feral cats are obligatory carnivores, with their daily energy intake from crude protein being 52 %, from crude fat 46 % and from <b>N-free</b> <b>extract</b> only 2 %. Minerals and trace elements are consumed in relatively high concentrations compared with recommended allowances determined using empirical methods. The calculated nutrient profile may be considered the nutrient intake to which the cat's metabolic system has adapted.

Thus, two complete extruded isoproteic diets with different crude fat to <b>N-free</b> <b>extract</b> ratio (CF/NFE: L= 1. 0 vs. H= 1. 5) were tested in juvenile shi drum to evaluate productive performances and quality traits of the final product. Experimental trial was conducted over summer 2001 using 4 groups of 200 fish (IBW = 83  25 g) fed 2 % BW. Growth parameters and feed efficiency were recorded and fish were submitted to morphometric, chemical and reological analysis. Considering a 4 months feeding period L-diet fed fish showed a significant greater weight gain than H-fed fish due to a higher specific growth rate (SGR) and a lower food conversion ratio (FCR). Chemical composition of whole body fish resulted in higher crude protein and lower lipids contents for animals of L-diet thesis. This suggests that the better rearing performances obtained with fish fed the low CF/NFE kind of diet are probably related to a more efficient utilization of dietary energy and/or crude protein.

The daily retentions of protein, lipid, water and ash were estimated over time using a published pig growth model. Food intakes were estimated using published methods. WI was {{estimated by adding}} the amounts required for digestion (WD), faecal excretion (W(fec)), growth (WG), evaporation (WE), urinary excretion (WU) and by then subtracting the water arising from feed (WF), from nutrient oxidation (WO) and synthesis of body constituents (WS). WD was predicted assuming an absorption of water of 0. 10, 0. 16 and 0. 07 kg/kg digestible carbohydrate, crude protein and lipid respectively. W(fec) was estimated {{taking into account the}} water associated with the undigested protein (0. 86 kg/kg), diethyl ether extract (- 12. 11 kg/kg), crude fibre (1. 86 kg/kg), ash (- 0. 42 kg/kg) and <b>N-free</b> <b>extract</b> (4. 4 kg/kg). The basal level of WE was estimated from the heat production of the pig fed ad libitum (MJ/d) as: 0. 25 x (metabolizable energy - energy retained as protein and lipid) x 0. 4, where 0. 25 is the assumed proportion of the insensible heat loss at the comfort temperature and 0. 4 is the water lost per MJ dissipated heat. WE in a hot environment was predicted by assuming that evaporation increased up to three times the basal level to offset the decreased sensible heat loss. To predict WU a water requirement for renal excretion of 2. 05 and 3. 40 kg/osmol excreted N as urea and minerals respectively was assumed. The urinary load of N and minerals was predicted from the intake of digestible nutrients and their retention. From the oxidation of 1 kg carbohydrate, protein, and fat it was assumed that 0. 6, 0. 42 and 1. 07 kg water (WO) were released respectively. WS was predicted by assuming a release of 0. 16, 0. 07 and 0. 57 kg water per kg retained protein, retained lipid coming from digestible lipid, and retained lipid coming from digestible carbohydrate respectively. The model is strongly rooted in a theoretical structure. When its predictions were compared with data from suitable experiments, the results were not significantly different.

40|$|Hulls, which {{dilute the}} {{nutritional}} quality of oats, {{are perhaps the}} most important reason why oats has been replaced by other cereals, like rice, corn, wheat and barley, in the nutrition of dogs. The high crude fibre and cellulose contents of hulls have negative effects on the dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, energy and mineral digestibilities (K, Na, Cl) of cereals in dogs (Fahey et al. 1992, Lewis et al. 1994, Kienzle et al. 2001). However, when dehulled, oat groats are superior to other cereals in digestible energy value and digestible crude protein value in dogs (Kempe et al. 2004). Also the digestibility of the main nutrients of oat groats are comparable to those of rice and better than in wheat, barley or corn (Kempe et al. 2004). The efficiency of dehulling is dependent on rotation speed of the dehuller. It is important that the nutritionally valuable kernels are intact after hulling process. To determine the effect of dehulling on apparent nutrient digestibilities and feed values for dogs, oats was dehulled at three different rotation speeds: 200, 300 and 400 rpm using small laboratory dehuller. The oat groats were heat treated in a flower mill with indirect steam (160 oC, 30 min). A digestibility trial was carried out in metabolism cages on eight female Alaskan huskies according to a replicated 4 × 4 Williams square design. Dehulling the oats at the rotation speed 300 rmp increased the faecal digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude fibre, <b>N-free</b> <b>extract,</b> crude carbohydrates and gross energy compared to low rotation speed. High rotation speed 400 rpm did not induce further increase in the nutrient digestibility, except dry matter and crude carbohydrates. Digestibility of crude protein, fat and starch were unaffected by the treatment and were an average 82 %, 87 % and 99 %, respectively. However, the amount of digestible protein (DCP) and energy (DE) increased when dehulling level increased: 121, 134 and and 140 g DCP kg- 1 DM and 15. 1, 16. 7 and 17. 0 MJ DE kg- 1 DM, respectively.

The changes during the storage were carefully observed and the quality was investigated by estimation of odour, taste, color, tactile, palatability and chemical composition of the silage made. Moreover the digestibilities of these samples were respectively determined by using goats and rabbits. The results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) The glucose-silage was generally superior to the control-silage in quality, the former showing less loss during the storage than the latter. Namely the properties of glucose-silage and the control-silage of chinese milk-vetch were 4. 13, 4. 46 respectively in pH value, 4. 70, 3. 10 % respectively in lactic acid content and 0, 0. 35 % respectively in butyric acid content. (2) The glucose added silage {{seemed to be the}} most palatable feed to various animals(cf. Tables 6 and 17). (3) The digestibilities of the glucose-silage were higher than those of the control-silage. Average digestibilities of the glucose-silage and the control-silage of Italian ryegrass, given to 2 goats, 2 kg daily per head as the only feed for 14 days, were 60, 48 in organic matter, 48, 37 in crude protein, 61, 54 in crude fat, 57, 34 in <b>N-free</b> <b>extract,</b> and 66, 61 per cent in crude fibre respectively. (4) The conservation of pro-vitamin A during the storage was better in the glucose-silage than in the control-silage.

In the second experiments a mixture of corn and green soybeans was ensiled in the silo and samples of the resulted silage were taken from three parts, i. e. the top, the middle, and the bottom layers (Fig. 2). In each sample the chemical composition, especialiy the contents of organic acids, the total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen as well as the pH value were determined in the usual manner. It was found that the differences in quality and nutrient contents were not significant, although a slight difference was sometimes found when the resulted silage was not of good quality. In further investigation conducted with the bag sample method, also, the results were almost the same. Small scale experiments of silage-making were carried out with "Sekishomo", Vallisneria spralis L. var. asiatica MAKINO, cale, alfalfa, the peel of "Hassaku", a variety of citrus, the peel of "Unshiu", Citrus Unshiu MAKINO, beet tops and mint feed, i. e. the residual of distillation of mint for obtaining menthol and mint oil. Satisfactory silages were found to be prepared from peel of Unshiu, peel of Hassaku, cale, beet tops and mint feed, but not from Sekishomo. The peels of Unshiu and Hassaku gave fragrant and paratable products rich lactic acid, free of butyric acid, and of pH between 3. 1 and 3. 8. The silage prepared from the peel of Unshiu contained dry matter 23. 35, crude protein 2. 03, ether extract 0. 45, <b>N-free</b> <b>extract</b> 10. 08, crude fiber 0. 35, and ash 0. 89 per cent. The digestibility of the protein in these silages was determined by the usual WEDEMEYER method (Table 14). The protein of the silages Prepared from cale, peels of both Unshiu and Hassaku, and beet tops possessed a satisfactory digestibility, but that of Sekishomo and mint feed did not. The results of the calculation of the digestibility of silage protein by three different methods, WATSON'S, DIJKSTRA'S, and BARNETT'S, may be considered almost to agree...|$|E
