40|$|IN {{their paper}} on the Treatment and Prophylaxis of Neurosyphilis which is {{published}} elsewhere in this number of the JOURNAL, Nicol and Hutton have spoken well of a double <b>needle</b> <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> which I have helped to make known in this country. I agree that {{with the use of}} this needle the bugbear of headache following lumbar puncture is largely eliminated, and the following note on lumbar puncture with it may therefore be of interest. The instrument is on the principle first advocated by Hoyt of puncturing the skin and ligaments with a needle which is stout enough to take the strain of overcoming the resistance of these moderately tough tissues but puncturing the dura and arachnoid with a much finer needle carried inside the stouter one, beyond the point of which it can be projected when required. The Dattner pattern was first brought to my notice by Messrs. Down Bros. {{a few years ago when}} I was experimenting with a very fine needle in the hope of preventing lumbar puncture headache by obviating leakage of fluid through the puncture wound in the membranes. Previously I had tried a needle of the Hoyt pattern bought in America in I 929, but had discarded it because the inner needle was only slightly thinner than the single needle which I had previously used (2 I SWG as compared with I 9) and did not project far enough (only a quarter of an inch) beyond the outer needle to make it easy to avoid puncturing the membranes with this also. As the gauge of the outer needle was I 7, the risk of leakage would be much greater if the outer needle punctured the membrane than if one were to use a single needle of gauge I 9. Dattner's account of the pedigree of this needle is that Hoyt first advocated the use of a double needle in lumbar puncture, but the first account of its use on any large scale was by Antoni, Stockholm, in I 923, and Wechselmann, followed by Mulzer and then Dattner, modified it chiefly in respect of its grip.

40|$|SUMMARY A 5 {{year old}} boy {{developed}} an implanta-tion dermoid tumour after a lumbar puncture in infancy. A survey of senior paediatricians has shown {{it to be}} common practice to use an unstiletted <b>needle</b> <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> in small children. A stiletted needle is recommended for all such proce-dures. There is considerable evidence that epidermoid spinal cord tumours may be a late complication of lumbar puncture, particularly when it is carried out with a needle without a stylet. 1 Because of this possibility {{it is recommended that}} lumbar puncture is always done with a stiletted needle. 2 We report the occurrence of such a tumour in a 6 year old child who had had a lumbar puncture as an infant. Case report A chinese boy first presented at the age of 10 weeks with a short history of fever and vomiting. Menin-gitis was suspected and two unsuccessful lumbar punctures were performed. The type of needle used was not recorded. Subsequently pus cells were found in a specimen of urine and the urinary tract infection was treated with an antibiotic. An in-travenous pyelogram was carried out and was normal. He was well until 5 years and 9 months of age when he developed a pain in his left hip for which no cause was found. The pain persisted, however, and he also developed a dull ache in the lumbar region that radiated into the buttocks and was aggravated by coughing. Examination at this time showed a very stiff lumbar spine with straight leg raising limited to 450 on both sides. There was a mild weakness of hip flexors and reduced ankle jerks. There was no disturbance of sphincter function. There was no clinical evidence of either spinal dysraphism or neurofibromatosis. Plain radiographs of the lumbar spine were normal. A myelogram was then performed, and this showed a mass extending from L 3 to L 4 and displacing nerve roots bilaterally around it. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. A laminectomy of L 3 and L 4 was carried out and a 'pearly ' mass was removed. The tumour measured 30 x 5 mm and was shown histologically to be a typical implantation dermoid. He made a complete recovery after the operation with no abnormal neurological signs, but he has developed noticeable keloid formation of the scar...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} ease of use of atraumatic needles with {{standard}} <b>needles</b> <b>for</b> diagnostic <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> and the incidence of headache after their use. DESIGN: Double blind, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Investigation ward of a neurology unit in a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 116 patients requiring elective diagnostic <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> INTERVENTIONS: Standardised protocol <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> with 20 gauge atraumatic or standard needles. Outcome measures: The primary end point was intention to treat analysis of incidence of moderate to severe headache, assessed at one week by telephone interview. Secondary end points were incidence of headache at one week analysed by needle type, ease of use by operator according to a visual analogue scale, incidence of backache, and failure rate of puncture. RESULTS: Valid outcome data were available for 97 of 101 patients randomised. Baseline characteristics were matched except for higher body mass index in the standard needle group. By an intention to treat analysis the absolute risk of moderate to severe headache with atraumatic needles was reduced by 26 % (95 % confidence interval 6 % to 45 %) compared with standard needles, {{but there was a}} non-significantly greater absolute risk of multiple attempts at <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> (14 %, - 4 % to 32 %). Higher body mass index was associated with an increased failure rate with atraumatic needles, but the reduced incidence of headache was maintained. The need for medical interventions was reduced by 20 % (1 % to 40 %). CONCLUSIONS: Atraumatic needles significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to severe headache and the need for medical interventions after diagnostic <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures,</b> but they were associated with a higher failure rate than standard needles...|$|R
40|$|Jacksonville, FL: We {{read the}} article by Dakka et al. 1 {{analyzing}} incidence of PLPH with cutting needles with interest. Our current research offers substantial evidence supporting their conclusions regarding the advantages of noncutting, atraumatic needles. In an ongoing longitudinal biomarker study, we collected CSF by standard <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> in 20 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We used only Quincke (cutting) needles initially but we transitioned to Whitacre 2 (noncutting) needles {{in an effort to}} minimize risk of PLPH. Fifteen of 20 patients had at least 1 of 3 <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> using a Quincke or Whitacre needle, allowing di-rect comparison of PLPH rate with cutting vs non-cutting needles in the same subjects. PLPH rate was 30 % with Quincke needles and 9 % with Whi-tacre <b>needles</b> <b>for</b> patients undergoing <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> Hence, the rate of occurrence of PLPH with a noncutting needle was one-third the fre-quency of PLPH with a cutting needle.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Children with leukaemia undergo several {{invasive}} procedures. Sedation {{is used to}} {{make these}} procedures more comforting to the patient as {{it is necessary for}} successful outcome. However sedatives can have devastating effects. In our centre as well as others, combination of ketamine with midazolam has been used for years without specific protocol. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of combination ketamine and midazolam against higher dose of ketamine as procedural sedation <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> in paediatric leukemic patients. METHOD: A total of 29 paediatric leukaemia patients underwent 58 <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> in a double blinded crossover clinical trial. The 2 regimes compared were KM regime who received combined intravenous midazolam 0. 1 mg per kg with ketamine 1 mg per kg against K 2 regime who received higher dose of intravenous ketamine i. e. 2 mg per kg. The main outcomes measured were time to achieve the desired sedation (Ramsay level of sedation at 6), time to complete <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> time to regain consciousness (Aldrete recovery score of at least 8) and adverse effects. RESULTS: Twenty seven patients (93 %) were successfully sedated with each of the regimens. Mean time taken for sedation and mean time to be fully conscious after sedation were significantly less (p value < 0. 05) in K 2 regime. Mean time taken for sedation in K 2 regime was 7. 56 minutes (SD 4. 4) and in KM regime it was 8. 74 minutes (SD 3. 6). Mean time to be fully conscious was 132 minutes (SD 93. 5) for K 2 regime while it took 173 minutes (SD 88. 8) for patients in KM regime. There is no statistically significant difference in mean time taken to complete LP between the 2 regimes (P= 0. 06). Two patients in K 2 regime developed tachycardia and one patient had pain after procedure while no patient in KM regimen had either of these. Five patients from either of the groups had desaturation. This was not statistically significant (McNemer Test 0. 250) but it could be clinically relevant. Eight patients (30 %) in KM regime required top-up doses of ketamine and 7 patients (26 %) required top-up doses of ketamine in K 2 regime. CONCLUSION: Ketamine as a sole agent is as effective and safe as combination of midazolam and ketamine. It should be considered in procedural sedation <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> in paediatric leukemic patients. It has faster induction and reversibility but it cause more adverse reactions and do not reduce time taken <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> An initial dose of 2 mg per kg is safe to be used with another top up dose of 0. 5 mg per kg.

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of all newborns admitted to four university neonatal intensive care units during one month in 2001, 2006, and 2011. The frequency of analgesic prescription for painful procedures was evaluated. Of the 202 neonatologists, 188 answered a questionnaire giving their opinion on the intensity of pain during <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and postoperative period using a 10 -cm visual analogic scale (VAS; pain > 3 cm). RESULTS: <b>For</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> 12 % (2001), 43 % (2006), and 36 % (2011) were performed using analgesia. Among the neonatologists, 40 - 50 % reported VAS > 3 <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> in all study periods. For intubation, 30 % received analgesia in the study periods, and 35 % (2001), 55 % (2006), and 73 % (2011) of the neonatologists reported VAS > 3 and would prescribe analgesia for this procedure. As for mechanical ventilation, 45 % (2001), 64 % (2006), and 48 % (2011) of patient-days were under analgesia; 56 % (2001), 57 % (2006), and 26 % (2011) of neonatologists reported VAS > 3 and said they would use analgesia during mechanical ventilation. For the first three post-operative days, 37 % (2001), 78 % (2006), and 89 % (2011) of the patients received analgesia and more than 90 % of neonatologists reported VAS > 3 for major surgeries.

40|$|Objective: <b>Lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> is a {{procedure}} that at times can be difficult where it may take multiple attempts to obtain a fluid sample and an opening pressure. While {{it is recommended that}} the patient be placed in the lateral recumbent position, many physicians find that placing patients in an upright or sitting position provides an easier access. The theoretical concern is that obtaining an opening pressure in the sitting position may be altered. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if there is no difference in opening pressure in cerebrospinal fluid in patients placed in a flexed lateral position vs. upright sitting position during <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> Methods: 20 consenting patients were entered into a prospective, crossover study who required a diagnostic <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> Opening pressure was measured in both recumbent and sitting positions.

We observed that CATT titres decreased after treatment both in patients who experienced treatment failure as well as in cured patients. We conclude that CATT, though a good screening test, is unreliable for monitoring treatment outcome. We also showed that the sensitivity of CATT in relapse cases was as low as 78 %, and as a consequence some relapse cases might be missed in screening programs if they have no clinical signs yet...|$|R

For Mini-CEX {{the focus was on}} gathering data (22 %), diagnosis (31 %), manage-ment (34 %) and counselling (7 %) (focus not recorded in 6 %). <b>For</b> DOPS, <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> was the most common evaluated procedure (57 %) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to develop a {{rational}} basis <b>for</b> performing <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> in sepsis workups, the hypothesis was tested that, for each of eight variables with a known association with bacteremia, the frequencies for patients having bacterial meningitis would be significantly greater than those in patients having bacteremia alone. In a one-year period, 168 <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> were performed in children having {{a mean age of}} 7. 3 months. Patients were assigned to four groups: bacterial meningitis, bacteremia only, aseptic meningitis, and normal. Mean age, frequencies of symptoms, clinical appearances, ethnic groups, and sex ratio were determined for all groups. Frequencies of eight variables were determined and compared between Groups I and II...|$|R
40|$|Background: Beliefs of {{caregivers}} about patient’s pain {{have been shown}} to influence assessment and treatment of children’s pain, now considered an essential part of cancer treatment. Painful procedures in hematologyoncology are frequently referred by children as the most painful experiences during illness. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate professionals’ beliefs about painfulness of invasive procedures repeatedly performed in Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Units. Methods: Physicians, nurses, psychologists and directors working in Hemato-Oncology Units of the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology (AIEOP) were involved in a wide-nation survey. The survey was based on an anonymous questionnaire investigating beliefs of operators about painfulness of invasive procedures (<b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy) and level of pain management. Results: Twenty-four directors, 120 physicians, 248 nurses and 22 psychologists responded to the questionnaire. The score assigned to the procedural pain on a 0 - 10 scale was higher than 5 in 77 % of the operators <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture,</b> 97. 5 % for bone marrow aspiration, and 99. 5 % for bone marrow biopsy. The scores assigned by nurses differed statistically from those of the physicians and directors for the pain caused by <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> and bone marrow aspiration. Measures adopted for procedural pain control were generally considered good. Conclusions: Invasive diagnostic-therapeutic procedures performed in Italian Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Units are considered painful by all the caregivers involved. Pain management is generally considered good. Aprioristically opinions about pain depend on invasiveness of the procedure and on the professional role...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrospinal fluid {{drainage}} {{is often}} indicated {{in patients with}} acute hydrocephalus after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage but is believed to {{increase the risk of}} rebleeding. We studied the risk of rebleeding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage during treatment for acute hydrocephalus. METHODS: We included patients with hydrocephalus treated with external ventricular drainage or <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> within 4 days after the hemorrhage and before aneurysm occlusion. Each treated patient was matched with a control patient with untreated hydrocephalus and a control patient without ventricular enlargement. Patients and controls were matched for interval since subarachnoid hemorrhage, duration of exposure, use of tranexamic acid, clinical condition on admission, and age. We used Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios and we adjusted for rebleeding that had occurred before starting the cerebrospinal fluid drainage. RESULTS: In the group treated with external ventricular drainage, rebleeding occurred in seven of 34 patients (21 %) with treatment, in seven of 34 controls (21 %) with untreated hydrocephalus, and in six of 34 controls (18 %) without hydrocephalus. In the group treated with one or more <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures,</b> rebleeding occurred in one of 21 patients (5 %) with treatment, in three of 21 controls (14 %) with untreated hydrocephalus, and in none of the 21 controls without hydrocephalus. The hazard ratios for rebleeding were 1. 0 (95 % CI: 0. 4 to 2. 7) for external ventricular drainage treatment and 0. 7 (95 % CI: 0. 1 to 6. 4) <b>for</b> <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not confirm an importantly increased risk of rebleeding during external ventricular drainage or <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> <b>for</b> acute hydrocephalus after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{use of the}} <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> in the {{diagnosis}} of central nervous system infection in acutely ill children is controversial. Recommendations have been published but {{it is unclear whether}} they are being followed. Methods The medical case notes of 415 acute medical admissions in a children's hospital were examined to identify children with suspected central nervous system infection and suspected meningococcal septicaemia. We determined whether <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> were indicated or contraindicated, whether they had been performed, and whether the results contributed to the patients' management. Results Fifty-two children with suspected central nervous system infections, and 43 with suspected meningococcal septicaemia were identified. No <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> were performed in patients with contraindications, but only 25 (53 %) of 47 children with suspected central nervous system infection and no contraindications received a <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture.</b> <b>Lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> findings contributed to the management in 18 (72 %) of these patients, by identifying a causative organism or excluding bacterial meningitis. Conclusion The recommendations <b>for</b> undertaking <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> in children with suspected central nervous system infection are not being followed because many children that should receive <b>lumbar</b> <b>punctures</b> are not getting them. When they are performed, <b>lumbar</b> <b>puncture</b> findings make a useful contribution to the patients' management. </p...|$|R
