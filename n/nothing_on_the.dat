5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|The new European {{states that}} had {{formed in the}} second half of the 19th century {{typically}} had traditions of war memorials, but <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scale that would later emerge from World War I. Italy built various war memorials after unification in the 1860s, but there was little agreement about who should be responsible for these within the new Italian state. Romania erected a number of heroically styled memorials after the Romanian War of Independence in 1877 and 1878, usually celebrating famous leaders associated with Romanian independence, but also including the occasional modest local monuments Bulgaria and Serbia constructed many war memorials after the end of the First Balkan War in 1913. The public played little role in these eastern European memorials, however, which were typically constructed by the central state authorities.|$|E

25|$|East of the station, {{the tunnel}} widens {{on both sides}} to {{accommodate}} an additional trackway diverging from the local tracks. These bellmouths were built for a proposed extension along the BMT Jamaica Line, or for a proposed Jamaica Avenue Subway. It was not a provision for the IND Second System, as were similar structures on other IND lines, but rather date from an earlier plan for the IND Fulton Street Line, which would have connected the IND tracks west of the station to two lines {{to the east of}} the station: the BMT Jamaica Line tracks, and the BMT Fulton Street Line tracks to Lefferts Boulevard (which were eventually connected to the IND Fulton Street Line anyway, albeit past Grant Avenue). One of these bellmouths has an emergency exit. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> model board in the Broadway/East New York tower to show this provision.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato is a {{technique}} of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies subtly in a pulsating rhythm. While {{various parts of the}} hand or arm may be involved in the motion, the end result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating string length, which causes an undulation in pitch. Some violinists oscillate backwards, or lower in pitch from the actual note when using vibrato, since it is believed that perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound. Vibrato does little, if anything, to disguise an out-of-tune note; in other words, misapplied vibrato is a poor substitute for good intonation. Scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without vibrato to make the work easier and more effective. Music students are often taught that unless otherwise marked in music, vibrato is assumed. However, it has to be noted that this is only a trend; there is <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sheet music that compels violinists to add vibrato. This can be an obstacle to a classically trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no vibrato at all, such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles.|$|E
25|$|The main {{fighting}} of the Nine Years' War {{took place}} around France's borders: in the Spanish Netherlands; the Rhineland; Catalonia; and Piedmont-Savoy. The {{importance of the}} Spanish Netherlands {{was the result of}} its geographic position, sandwiched between France and the Dutch Republic. Initially Marshal Humières commanded French forces in this theatre but in 1689, while the French concentrated on the Rhine, it produced little more than a stand-off – the most significant engagement occurred when William's second-in-command, the Prince of Waldeck, defeated Humières in a skirmish at the Battle of Walcourt on 25 August. However, by 1690 the Spanish Netherlands had become the main seat of the war where the French formed two armies: Boufflers' army on the Moselle, and a larger force to the west under Humières' successor – and Louis XIV's greatest general of the period – Marshal Luxembourg. On 1 July Luxembourg secured a clear tactical victory over Waldeck at the Battle of Fleurus; but his success produced little benefit – Louis XIV's concerns for the dauphin on the Rhine (where Marshal de Lorge now held actual command) overrode strategic necessity in the other theatres and forestalled a plan to besiege Namur or Charleroi. For the Emperor and the German princes, though, the most serious fact of 1690 was that the Turks had been victorious on the Danube, requiring them to send reinforcements to the east. The Elector of Bavaria – now Imperial commander-in-chief following Lorraine's death in April – could offer <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower or upper Rhine, and the campaign failed to produce a single major battle or siege.|$|E

Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), working for The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), covers up the death by deleting the file on the case from agent Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) computer, cleaning up all the evidence at the scene, burning the woman's body in an incinerator and replacing the police's blood sample for the case by impersonating Mulder. As he leaves the police station, Skinner is chased down by Detective Ray Thomas, who believes he is Mulder. Skinner tells him there is <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> case warranting his involvement, and leaves.|$|E

500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over 9kilograms (20 pounds) of weight from when he appeared at the 2002 Winter Games. [...] He went down to a 65.7kg (145lb) bodyframe and a 2.5% Body fat percentage enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. [...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter than me. There's just no way. Whether I can put it together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story. But I know, from a physical training standpoint, nobody's even close...

500|$|For {{the cover}} of Reckoning, Stipe drew {{a picture of a}} two-headed snake, which he then gave to artist Howard Finster to fill in as a painting. Stipe stated that the imagery was an attempt to define the elements, explaining, [...] "Part of it is rocks and part of it is the sun and part of it the sky." [...] The end result was {{considered}} a disappointment, as Stipe had to work with Finster on a long-distance basis, and the reproduction of the artwork for the album sleeve was problematic. The spine of the vinyl version of the album features the phrase [...] "File Under Water". Stipe told NME in 1984 the phrase is the true title of the record. He added [...] "In America, both titles are on the spine, with <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cover. Here [...] they insisted on Reckoning being on the cover." [...] Instead of labeling the sides of the record as [...] "side one" [...] and [...] "side two", the sides were designated as [...] "L" [...] and [...] "R", respectively.|$|E
500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: she {{wondered}} if she had focused the novel too much on her own personal life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked as an antidote to Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E
