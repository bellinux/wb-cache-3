50|$|The {{method for}} {{converting}} moneyline to decimal odds depends <b>on</b> whether the <b>moneyline</b> value is positive or negative. If the moneyline is positive, it is divided by 100 and add 1. Thus, +400 moneyline {{is the same}} as 5.0 in decimal odds. If the moneyline is negative, 100 is divided by the absolute moneyline amount (the minus signed is removed), and then 1 is added. For example, -400 moneyline is 100/400 + 1, or 1.25, in decimal odds.|$|R
