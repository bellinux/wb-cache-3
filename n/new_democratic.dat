5|$|Opposition MPs {{complained that}} several {{recommendations}} for access-to-information reform were {{omitted from the}} bill, and were instead sent to committee for further review. <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party MP Pat Martin suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future.

5|$|The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit {{especially}} hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The {{collapse of the}} world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The Speaker is Liberal Peter Milliken. Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on April 3, 2006. The Speaker only {{votes in}} a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus was {{effectively}} reduced by one. This, {{along with the}} defection of Wajid Khan to the Conservatives enabled the Conservatives to pass legislation {{with the cooperation of}} any one of the three opposition parties: Liberals, Bloc Québécois, or <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party (NDP).|$|E

5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power. None had come close to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party (NDP)).|$|E

5|$|Baird was {{appointed}} President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006. Following his appointment, {{he said that}} one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes. Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues. One of the members was Frances Lankin, a former Ontario <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party cabinet minister.|$|E
5|$|Each of the 338 {{members of}} {{parliament}} in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the governor general, either {{on the advice of}} the prime minister, or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House. Constitutionally, an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October. The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition, the <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she would}} not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party candidate, notary public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding was considered to be a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E
