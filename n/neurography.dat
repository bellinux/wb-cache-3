2500|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} is a somewhat controversial {{diagnosis of a}} neuromuscular disorder which {{is related to the}} sciatic nerve. [...] According to the terms of the syndrome, the sciatic nerve becomes compressed or otherwise irritated by the piriformis muscle causing pain, tingling and numbness in the hip/ buttocks and along the path of the sciatic nerve descending the lower thigh and into the leg. It {{is one of the few}} conditions which causes posterior hip pain. [...] The condition has no external signs. [...] Diagnosis is often difficult due to few validated and standardized diagnostic tests, but two tests have been well-described and clinically validated: one is electrophysiological, called the FAIR-test, which measures delay in sciatic nerve conductions when the piriformis muscle is stretched against it. The other is magnetic resonance <b>neurography,</b> a type of MRI that highlights inflammation and the nerves themselves. Some say that the most important criterion is the exclusion of sciatica resulting from compression/irritation of spinal nerve roots, as by a herniated disc. However, compression may be present, but not causal, in the setting of sciatica due to piriformis syndrome. [...] Recovery time ranges between a few days to six weeks or more for complete recovery.|$|E
5000|$|The endoneurial fluid {{compartment}} in nerve can be unmasked {{by similar}} techniques {{resulting in a}} [...] "T2" [...] based <b>neurography</b> {{as well as the}} original diffusion based <b>neurography</b> technique. Endoneurial fluid increases when nerve is compressed, irritated or injured, leading to nerve image hyperintensity in an magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> image. Subsequent research has further demonstrated the biophysical basis for the ability of MR <b>Neurography</b> to show nerve injury and irritation.|$|E
5000|$|Use of {{magnetic}} resonance <b>neurography</b> is increasing in neurology and neurosurgery as {{the implications of}} its value in diagnosing various causes of sciatica becomes more widespread. There are 1.5 million lumbar MRI scans performed in the US each year for sciatica, leading to surgery for a herniated disk in about 300,000 patients per year. Of these, about 100,000 surgeries fail. Therefore, there is successful treatment for sciatica in just 200,000 and failure of diagnosis or treatment in up to 1.3 million annually in the US alone. The success rate of the paradigm of lumbar MRI and disk resection for treatment of sciatica is therefore about 15%(Filler 2005). <b>Neurography</b> has been applied increasingly to evaluate the distal nerve roots, lumbo-sacral plexus and proximal sciatic nerve in the pelvis and thigh to find other causes of sciatica. It is increasingly important for brachial plexus imaging and for the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. [...] Research and development in the clinical use of diagnostic <b>neurography</b> has taken place at Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, UCLA, UCSF, Harvard, the University of Washington in Seattle, University of London, and Oxford University (see references below) {{as well as through}} the <b>Neurography</b> Institute. Recent patent litigation concerning MR <b>Neurography</b> has led some unlicensed centers to discontinue offering the technique. Courses have been offered for radiologists at the annual meetings of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and at the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and for surgeons at the annual meetings of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The use of imaging for diagnosis of nerve disorders represents a change from the way most physicians were trained to practice over the past several decades, as older routine tests fail to identify the diagnosis for nerve related disorders. The New England Journal of Medicine in July 2009 published a report on whole body <b>neurography</b> using a diffusion based <b>neurography</b> technique. In 2010, RadioGraphics - a publication of the Radiological Society of North America that serves to provide continuing medical education to radiologists - published an article series taking the position that <b>Neurography</b> has {{an important role in the}} evaluation of entrapment neuropathies.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} reports dealing with specialized uses of magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> for nerve pathology such as cervical radiculopathy, guidance for nerve blocks, demonstration of cysts in nerves, carpal tunnel syndrome, and obstetrical brachial plexus palsy.

5000|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} <b>neurography</b> {{does not}} pose any diagnostic disadvantage relative to standard {{magnetic resonance imaging}} because <b>neurography</b> studies typically include high resolution standard MRI image series for anatomical reference along with the neurographic sequences. However, the patient will generally have a slightly longer time in the scanner compared to a routine MRI scan. Magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> can only be performed in 1.5 tesla and 3 tesla cylindrical type scanners and can't really be done effectively in lower power [...] "open" [...] MR scanners - this can pose significant challenges for claustrophobic patients. Although {{it has been in}} use for fifteen years and is the subject of more than 150 research publications, most insurance companies still classify this test as experimental and may decline reimbursement, resulting in the need to file appeals. Patients in some plans obtain standard insurance coverage for this widely used procedure.|$|E
50|$|Imaging {{studies using}} MR <b>neurography</b> may be useful. In {{patients}} with unilateral pudendal entrapment in the Alcock's canal, it is typical to see asymmetric swelling and hyperintensity affecting the pudendal neurovascular bundle.|$|E

50|$|Within the endoneurium, the {{individual}} nerve fibres {{are surrounded by}} a low-protein liquid called endoneurial fluid. This acts {{in a similar way}} to the cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system and constitutes a blood-nerve barrier similar to the blood-brain barrier. Molecules are thereby prevented from crossing the blood into the endoneurial fluid. During the development of nerve edema from nerve irritation or (injury), the amount of endoneurial fluid may increase at the site of irritation. This increase in fluid can be visualized using magnetic resonance <b>neurography,</b> and thus MR <b>neurography</b> can identify nerve irritation and/or injury.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurography</b> {{has also}} been helpful for {{improving}} image diagnosis in spine disorders. It can help identify which spinal nerve is actually irritated {{as a supplement to}} routine spinal MRI. Standard spinal MRI only demonstrates the anatomy and numerous disk bulges, bone spurs or stenoses {{that may or may not}} actually cause nerve impingement symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{endoneurium}} {{contains a}} liquid known as endoneurial fluid, which contains little protein. In the {{peripheral nervous system}} the endoneurial fluid is notionally equivalent to cerebro-spinal fluid in the central nervous system. Peripheral nerve injuries commonly release increased amounts of endoneurial fluid into surrounding tissues; these can be detected by magnetic resonance <b>neurography,</b> thereby assisting in locating injuries to peripheral nerves.|$|E
5000|$|Measurements of the T2 {{relaxation}} rate {{of nerve}} by Filler and Howe revealed that previous {{reports of a}} short relaxation time were wrong and that - once signal from lipid protons was suppressed - the primary image signal from nerve had long T2 relaxation rates best imaged with pulse sequence echo times {{in the range of}} 50 to 100 milliseconds. In addition, they later showed that T2-neurography differs from most other MR imaging in that the conspicuity or relative prominence of nerve is affected by the angle of voxel orientation during the acquisition of the image. When acquisitions are done with echo times below 40 milliseconds, there can be [...] "magic angle effects" [...] that provide some spurious information, so MR <b>Neurography</b> is always done with echo times greater than 40 milliseconds. The need for long echo times also characterizes the type of inversion recovery fat suppression sequences used for <b>neurography</b> nerve imaging.|$|E
50|$|Many nerves, such as {{the median}} and ulnar nerve in the arm or the tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel, are just below the skin surface and can be tested for {{pathology}} with electromyography, but this technique has always been difficult to apply for deep proximal nerves. Magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> has greatly expanded the efficacy of nerve diagnosis by allowing uniform evaluation of virtually any nerve in the body.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} impact of magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> {{is on the}} evaluation of the large proximal nerve elements such as the brachial plexus (the nerves between the cervical spine and the underarm that innervate shoulder, arm and hand), the lumbosacral plexus (nerves between the lumbosacral spine and legs), the sciatic nerve in the pelvis, as well as other nerves such as the pudendal nerve that follow deep or complex courses.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} <b>neurography</b> (MRN) is {{the direct}} imaging of nerves {{in the body}} by optimizing selectivity for unique MRI water properties of nerves. It is a modification of magnetic resonance imaging. This technique yields a detailed image of a nerve from the resonance signal that arises from in the nerve itself rather than from surrounding tissues or from fat in the nerve lining. Because of the intraneural source of the image signal, the image provides a medically useful set {{of information about the}} internal state of the nerve such as the presence of irritation, nerve swelling (edema), compression, pinch or injury. Standard magnetic resonance images can show the outline of some nerves in portions of their courses but do not show the intrinsic signal from nerve water. Magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> is used to evaluate major nerve compressions such as those affecting the sciatic nerve (e.g. piriformis syndrome), the brachial plexus nerves (e.g. thoracic outlet syndrome), the pudendal nerve, or virtually any named nerve in the body. A related technique for imaging neural tracts in the brain and spinal cord is called magnetic resonance tractography or diffusion tensor imaging.|$|E
50|$|Two most {{commonly}} used and effective examination method for Tarlov Cysts are MRI and CT. Both CT and MRI are good imaging procedures that allow the detection of extradural spinal masses such as Tarlov cysts. Magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> is an emerging imaging technology based on MRI that highlights neurologic tissue. Often cysts are under reported and under diagnosed as radiologists and neurosurgeons have been traditionally taught to ignore these cysts. Patients frequently experience difficulty in diagnosis, however this is changing as Tarlov cysts have now been recognized by NORD as a rare disease.|$|E
50|$|Tarlov cysts are {{relatively}} common {{when compared to}} other neurological cysts. Initially, Isadore Tarlov believed them to be asymptomatic, however as his research progressed, Tarlov found them to be symptomatic in a number of patients. These cysts are often detected incidentally during MRI or CT scans for other medical conditions. They are also observed using magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> with communicating subarachnoid cysts of the spinal meninges. Cysts with diameters of 1 cm or larger {{are more likely to be}} symptomatic; although cysts of any size may be symptomatic dependent on location and etiology. Some 40% of patients with symptomatic Tarlov cysts can associate a history of trauma or childbirth. Current treatment options include CSF aspiration, complete or partial removal, fibrin-glue therapy, laminectomy with wrapping of the cyst, amongst other surgical treatment approaches. Interventional treatment of Tarlov cysts is the only means by which symptoms might permanently be resolved due to the fact that the cysts often refill after aspiration. Tarlov cysts often enlarge over time, especially if the sac has a check valve type opening. They are differentiated from other meningeal and arachnoid cysts because they are innervated and diagnosis can in cases be demonstrated with subarachnoid communication.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic brachial plexopathy is a non-progressive {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} the sudden onset of shoulder pain associated with weakness and sometimes paraesthesia of the arm. Clinical and electrophysiological examinations are the primary diagnostic tools and allow physicians to localize the site of damage. MRI <b>neurography</b> is rarely performed in this setting. METHODS: We herein describe the cases of eight consecutive patients suffering from idiopathic brachial plexopathy. All patients underwent clinical visits, neurophysiological evaluations and MRI <b>neurography.</b> RESULTS: We confirmed the primary role of clinical and neurophysiological evaluations in the diagnosis of idiopathic brachial plexopathy and demonstrate the usefulness of brachial plexus MRI <b>neurography</b> for confirming the presence of inflammatory changes.

Â  Material and Method: In this report it was presented the unusual entrapment of the ulnar nerve and the neurographic findings in an illustrative case. The case was admitted to our neurosurgery department with the symptoms of ulnar nerve entrapment. Results:Â  Electrophisiologic examination revealed that ulnary nerve entrapment before entering ulnary nerve canal. We examined the patient by using ultrasound assisted neurographic examination before operation. Ultrasonographic <b>neurography</b> demonstrated ulnary nerve compression 5 cm proximal portion from its entrance into the ulnary nerve canal. The patient was operated.

40|$|Background Sciatica without {{evidence}} of lumbosacral root compression is often attributed to piriformis syndrome. However, specific diagnostic tools {{have not been}} available to demonstrate sciatic nerve entrapment by the piriformis muscle. Objective To evaluate the use of magnetic resonance (MR) <b>neurography</b> in identifying abnormalities of the sciatic nerve in patients with unexplained sciatica. Design Case series from a retrospective medical record review. Patients Fourteen patients with sciatic distribution pain and normal results on MR imaging for lumbosacral radiculopathy were referred for MR <b>neurography</b> of the lumbosacral plexus and sciatic nerves. Results In 12 patients, MR <b>neurography</b> demonstrated increased fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal in the ipsilateral sciatic nerve. In most patients, this abnormal signal was seen at the sciatic notch, at or just inferior {{to the level of}} the piriformis muscle. To date, 4 patients have undergone surgical decompression, with excellent relief of symptoms in 3 of them. Conclusion Magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> often identifies an abnormal increased signal in the proximal sciatic nerve in patients with extraspinal sciatica and allows more accurate diagnosis of sciatic nerve entrapment in suspected cases...|$|E

40|$|The common peroneal nerve (CPN), a major {{terminal}} {{branch of}} the sciatic nerve, can {{be subject to a}} variety of pathologies, which may affect the nerve at any level from the lumbar plexus to its distal branches. Although the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy is traditionally based on a patient's clinical findings and electrodiagnostic tests, magnetic resonance <b>neurography</b> (MRN) is gaining an increasing role in the definition of the type, site, and extent of peripheral nerve disorders. Current high-field MR scanners enable high-resolution and excellent soft-tissue contrast imaging of peripheral nerves. In the lower extremities, MR <b>neurography</b> has been employed in the demonstration of the anatomy and pathology of the CPN, {{as well as in the}} detection of associated secondary muscle denervation changes.

40|$|Ultrasound (US) -guided high {{intensity}} focused ultrasound (HIFU) {{has been proposed}} for noninvasive treatment of neuropathic pain and has been investigated in in-vivo studies. However, ultrasound has important limitations regarding treatment guidance and temperature monitoring. Magnetic resonance (MR) -imaging guidance may overcome these limitations and MR-guided HIFU (MR-HIFU) has been used successfully for other clinical indications. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing 3 D MR <b>neurography</b> to identify and guide ablation of peripheral nerves using a clinical MR-HIFU system. Volumetric MR-HIFU was used to induce lesions in the peripheral nerves of the lower limbs in three pigs. Diffusion-prep MR <b>neurography</b> and T 1 -weighted images were utilized to identify the target, plan treatment and immediate post-treatment evaluation. For each treatment, one 8 or 12 mm diameter treatment cell was used (sonication duration 20 s and 36 s, power 160 - 300 W). Peripheral nerves were extracted < 3 hours after treatment. Ablation dimensions were calculated from thermal maps, post-contrast MRI and macroscopy. Histological analysis included standard H&E staining, Masson's trichrome and toluidine blue staining. All targeted peripheral nerves were identifiable on MR <b>neurography</b> and T 1 -weighted images and could be accurately ablated with a single exposure of focused ultrasound, with peak temperatures of 60. 3 to 85. 7 Â°C. The lesion dimensions as measured on MR <b>neurography</b> were similar to the lesion dimensions as measured on CE-T 1, thermal dose maps, and macroscopy. Histology indicated major hyperacute peripheral nerve damage, mostly confined to the location targeted for ablation. Our preliminary results indicate that targeted peripheral nerve ablation is feasible with MR-HIFU. Diffusion-prep 3 D MR <b>neurography</b> has potential for guiding therapy procedures where either nerve targeting or avoidance is desired, and may also have potential for post-treatment verification of thermal lesions without contrast injection...|$|E

40|$|<b>Neurography</b> is {{the most}} {{objective}} and reliable measure of the peripheral nerve function, and {{it is used to}} diagnose both local and generalized neuropathies. <b>Neurography</b> can measure both motor and sensory nerve functions. The principle for sensory neurgraphy is to stimulate over the nerve and record proximal or distal from the stimulated electrode. At the Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, University Hospital Uppsala, a problem has been identified, in that young adult patients tend to show unexpected abnormal <b>neurography</b> values in relation to the expected, indicated by the reference limits, without clinical correlates. This concerns foremost the sensory amplitudes in median and ulnar nerves. The hypothesis is that the requirement of young adultsâ€™ amplitudes is too high. A reference material better including more subjects in this age group may solve the problem. Sensory nerve conduction studies were performed in 33 subjects, aged 15 - 30. The nerve functions were tested on median, ulnar and radial nerves. Surface electrodes were used for both recording and stimulation. The result shows that the presently used reference material for some nerves indeed has too high requirement for young adults. After increasing the reference material for younger age groups, the new reference limits has been changed and this should cause fewer false positive findings...|$|E

40|$|Background: Charcotâ€“Marieâ€“Tooth (CMT) {{disease is}} {{clinically}} and genetically heterogeneous. There are no published series describing clinical, electrophysiological, and genetic information on CMT from the Indian subcontinent. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <b>neurography</b> technique provides useful {{information about the}} plexus and roots and can be employed in patients with CMT. Settings and Design: A prospective, observational study carried out at a tertiary care hospital in Western India. Subjects and Methods: CMT patients fulfilling the UK Genetic Testing Network criteria were included. They underwent clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and multigene panel testing. Results: Totally 22 patients (19 males, 3 females; 18 sporadic and 4 familial cases) were studied. Pes cavus (19), hammer toes (16), and scoliosis was seen in 1 patient. Electrophysiology revealed motor predominant neuropathy with 15 demyelinating (10 uniform and 5 multifocal) and 7 axonal patterns. Thickened lumbosacral plexuses on MRI <b>neurography</b> were evident in 6 / 10 studied patients, all 6 having demyelinating neuropathy. Genetic analysis identified PMP 22, GJB 1, SH 3 TC 2, HSPB 1, SPTLC 2, MPZ, AARS, and NEFH gene mutations. Conclusions: This small series documents the pattern of CMT neuropathies as seen in Western India. Clinico-electrophysiological and genetic diagnosis showed general concordance some overlaps and reiterated advantages of gene panel testing in this heterogeneous group of neuropathies.

Our purpose was to visualize the lumbar nerve root and to analyze its morphology, and to measure its apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in healthy volunteers and patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis using 1. 5 -T magnetic resonance imaging. Fourteen patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis and 14 healthy volunteers were studied. Regions of interest were placed at {{the fourth and fifth}} lumbar root at dorsal root ganglia and distal spinal nerves (at L 4 and L 5) and the first sacral root and distal spinal nerve (S 1) on DWI to quantify mean ADC values. The anatomic parameters of the spinal nerve roots can also be determined by <b>neurography.</b> In patients, mean ADC values were significantly higher in entrapped roots and distal spinal nerve than in intact ones. <b>Neurography</b> also showed abnormalities such as nerve indentation, swelling and running transversely in their course through the foramen. In all patients, leg pain was ameliorated after selective decompression (nÂ =Â  9) or nerve block (nÂ =Â  5).
