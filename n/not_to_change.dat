5|$|In short, the Wrights {{discovered}} the true {{purpose of the}} movable vertical rudder. Its role was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the direction of flight (as a rudder does in sailing), but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances. The actual turn—the change in direction—was done with roll control using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.|$|E
5|$|In July 1961, Sutcliffe {{decided to}} leave the group to {{continue}} painting. After being awarded a postgraduate scholarship he enrolled at Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where he studied under the tutelage of Eduardo Paolozzi. He briefly lent McCartney his bass until the latter could earn enough to buy a specially made smaller left-handed Höfner 500/1 bass guitar of his own in June 1961, but specifically asked McCartney (who is left-handed) <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the strings around or restring the instrument, so McCartney had to play the bass as it was. In 1967, a photo of Sutcliffe was among those {{on the cover of the}} Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album (extreme left, in front of fellow artist Aubrey Beardsley).|$|E
5|$|The music used in {{the titles}} {{was derived from the}} classic game consoles, and {{arranged}} by Go Ichinose. Masuda and Ichinose decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the reused music from the basic background sounds {{used in the}} originals, and instead updated them by adding additional sounds. Some of the songs have additional key changes compared to the original soundtrack and some songs that are re-written for the GBA contain sliding between notes. A two-disc set of the music entitled GBA Pokémon FireRed & LeafGreen Super Complete was released, with the first disc featuring all the music used normally in-game, while the second disc featured bonus tracks based on and inspired by the music in the games. Among these are two vocal tracks.|$|E

5|$|Buemi elected <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> tyres {{and gained}} the overall lead. Conway later served a drive-through penalty for his {{collision}} with Shaytar. The repairs to Van der Garde's vehicle {{meant he was}} stationary in his pit stall for four minutes which allowed Merhi to inherit fifth position in LMP2. Tréluyer reported to Audi that his car had no front downforce, while Buemi went off the track at Raidillon {{in his effort to}} push hard to extend his lead over Bernhard. Buemi was held up by one of the SMP entrants and an Aston Martin at Fagnes causing his advantage to be reduced to 1.015 seconds. The Toyota driver missed his braking point at the Bus Stop chicane and went wide at La Source shortly afterwards, causing him to lose the first position to Bernhard. Buemi reclaimed the position at Eau Rouge but temporarily fell to second again after Bernhard overtook him on the Kemmel straight and retook the place before the entry to Les Combes. At Blanchimont corner, Bernhard avoided colliding heavily with the rear-end of Buemi's car after the latter slid while lapping Gulf Racing's Porsche entry.|$|E
5|$|Torrential rain {{prevented}} {{the resumption of}} the Grand Prix for over two hours, until the rain eased at 15:50 local time. The race was restarted behind the safety car with the drivers in the positions held before the suspension. Vettel was first, followed by Kobayashi, Massa, Heidfeld, Petrov and di Resta. Webber was in seventh place with Alonso, de la Rosa and Button behind. The safety car remained out for seven laps, during which the circuit began drying enough to be suitable for intermediate tyres, and D'Ambrosio pitted on lap 33 to change from the full wets. Vettel began to extend the lead over Kobayashi once the safety car came in on lap 35, as Massa and Heidfeld fought for Kobayashi's second place. Schumacher led several cars into the pitlane to change to intermediate tyres, while Button, Heidfeld and di Resta were among those who pitted the next lap. Vettel and Karthikeyan were the only drivers <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> tyres by lap 37, when Button came upon tenth placed Alonso as he exited the pitlane. As Button attempted to pass at turn 3 the two cars touched, and Alonso's Ferrari spun and beached upon a curb, bringing out the safety car. When the race resumed three laps later, Vettel, Kobayashi and Massa retained their positions, as Heidfeld, di Resta, Webber and Schumacher fought for fourth place. Button had a punctured tyre after the collision and was in twenty-first and last place, but immediately began to make up positions and was 14th by lap 44. Di Resta damaged his front wing attempting to overtake Heidfeld; the subsequent pit-stop and drive-through penalty dropped him down to last. Schumacher, having overtaken Webber, passed Heidfeld in fourth place, and set the fastest lap of the race.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to legal}} complications, the band decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the video {{portion of the}} {{original}} movie for the re-release. Instead, Shirley created an entirely new mix of the three 1973 Madison Square Garden concerts so that the audio portion of the film would better match the on-screen visuals. The audio on the new CD release was nearly identical to the soundtrack of the new DVD release. One difference was that the songs included on the CDs that were not featured in the original movie were included as bonus tracks on the DVD.|$|E
25|$|He {{has also}} been known {{to reach out to}} younger golfers. One notable example came in 1984, when a teenage Canadian golfer who had {{previously}} met Nicklaus at an exhibition wrote him for career advice. The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> if he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus' letter framed in his home.|$|E

25|$|Test {{audience}} reactions led {{to several}} minor changes before {{the film was}} released. Originally, {{it was clear that}} Carmen was torn between Rico and Zander. Test audiences, regardless of gender, strongly felt that a woman could not love two men at once, so scenes which portrayed this were cut. These audiences also felt it was immoral for Carmen to choose a career ahead of being loyal to Rico, to the extent that many commented that, in so doing, Carmen should have been the one to die instead of Dizzy. While admitting {{it may have been a}} bad commercial decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the film to accommodate this, the directors did cut a scene from after Zander's death where Carmen and Rico kiss, which the audience believed made the previous betrayal even more immoral.|$|E
25|$|Heidfeld was {{overtaken}} by de la Rosa for 13th on lap three, while Gené passed Fisichella for 17th position. On the next lap, Coulthard's lead to Michael Schumacher was reduced by one second. de la Rosa continued {{moving up the}} field by passing Wurz for twelfth. On the same lap, Alesi became the first driver to pit for dry tyres. Michael Schumacher began attacking Coulthard for the lead on lap five with the McLaren driver moving to defend his position. On lap six, Barrichello became {{the first of the}} frontrunners to pit, while Irvine lost eleventh position to de la Rosa. Häkkinen led several cars in the pit lane to change to dry tyres on lap seven, while Ralf Schumacher, Zonta, Verstappen, Irvine and Wurz. Coulthard took his penalty on lap eight and dropped from second to sixth. Fisichella made a pit stop to serve his identical penalty on the same lap, from twenty-second position and remained in that position. Michael Schumacher, Frentzen, Diniz and Mazzacane were the only drivers <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> tyres by lap 9, while Coulthard made a pit stop and rejoined in 16th.|$|E
25|$|Most sieve {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} dry. But there are some applications {{which can only be}} carried out by wet sieving. This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to agglomerate (mostly < 45nbsp&µm) – in a dry sieving process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the sieve meshes and this would make a further sieving process impossible. A wet sieving process is set up like a dry process: the sieve stack is clamped onto the sieve shaker and the sample is placed on the top sieve. Above the top sieve a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the sieving process additionally to the sieving motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample residues on the sieves have to be dried and weighed. When it comes to wet sieving it is very important <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the sample in its volume (no swelling, dissolving or reaction with the liquid).|$|E
