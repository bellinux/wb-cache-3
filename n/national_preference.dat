Further, as none of the republics have had their Scout movements returned for much more than a decade, it is viewed that they would benefit from the expertise of the neighboring Scout associations in those Regions.|$|E

It examines how EU member states might {{differ from the}} common EU position and from each other. By exploring the approaches of the EU and of member states, it aims to provide some valuable insights on the complexity of decision-making in trade policy with China {{and at the same}} time contribute to the theoretical debate on supranational vs. national policy-making within the EU. Through analysing official documents and policy statements of the EU and of four member states, namely France, Germany, Sweden and Poland, differences in views and approaches on the trade policy with China have been identified. A theoretical framework that incorporates both traditional and modern trade theory, IPE and rational choice contributes to explaining why preferences in EUSino trade policy are divergent. The empirical findings show a difference between the common <b>preference</b> and <b>national</b> <b>preferences.</b> Member states prioritise different issues and have diverging positions on the level of openness in EU-Sino trade. <b>National</b> <b>preferences</b> are driven by national interests. Trade intensity and comparative advantages or disadvantages with the trading partner as well as domestic forces are influential factors in forming <b>national</b> <b>preferences...</b>|$|R

This thesis aims {{to understand}} the bilateral relations of five key member states of the European Union, namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Austria, with Russia in supplying their energy need and to discover how these relations affect the EU policy making process in creating a common energy policy {{in the light of}} two theories of European integration: intergovernmentalism and liberal intergovernmentalism. The thesis reaches three main conclusions on how the <b>national</b> <b>preferences</b> of five key member states are formed, to what extent these preferences affect intergovernmental bargaining or interstate negotiations on creating a common EU energy policy, and whether the result of this bargaining process is in favour or against the goal of EU to achieve a common energy policy. First, the <b>national</b> <b>preferences</b> of these states are driven by issue-specific economic interests. Second, <b>national</b> <b>preferences</b> of these states have a considerable impact on their decisions on creating a common EU energy policy. Finally, diverse and plural interests of these states on the liberalisation of EU electricity and gas sectors and their relations with Russia to differing degrees had an impact on EU policy making process in achieving a common EU energy policy.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explain the {{preferences}} of the seven northern euro area member states on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) concerning the threshold set for direct European Central Bank (ECB) control over bank supervision. Building {{on the concept of}} the ‘financial trilemma’, it argues that different bank internationalisation patterns in the seven northern member states explain different preferences on the transfer of supervisory powers over less significant banks to the ECB. In particular, the reach of internationalisation into a national banking system – notably the extent to which even smaller banks were exposed to foreign banking operations – is shown to be the core factor explaining different <b>national</b> <b>preferences</b> on threshold. In the five countries with a large number of small and parochial alternative (cooperative and savings) banks, it is necessary to examine the system-specific structures of these banks to explain better the reach of internationalisation and <b>national</b> <b>preferences</b> on the threshold. Determined German opposition to ECB supervision of smaller alternative banks is juxtaposed with either less hostile or more positive support of at least four other countries despite the important presence of small alternative banks...|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} some {{discussion}} of <b>national</b> <b>preferences</b> for banking versus financial markets, there is little research on how <b>national</b> financing <b>preferences</b> are determined by legal, cultural, and other national characteristics. Using panel analysis on data for a recent eight-year period for sixteen emerging-economies, this paper documents that, in such countries, an increased predilection for equity markets is associated with increased prevention of corruption and countries being Asian. A decreased predilection for financing via equity markets is associated both with greater power of bank regulators and with more globalization and an English legal origin. One interpretation of our results suggests that while common law promotes both banking and financial markets, common law and societal openness act to promote banking more than markets in less developed environments.
