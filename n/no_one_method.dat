50|$|EFA {{assumes that}} any indicator/measured {{variable}} {{may be associated}} with any factor. When developing a scale, researchers should use EFA first before moving on to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

50|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>method</b> of {{synaptic}} vesicle recycling {{seems to}} hold true in all scenarios, which suggests {{the existence of}} multiple pathways for synaptic vesicle recycling. Multiple proteins have been linked with synaptic vesicle reuptake and then subsequently been linked to different synaptic vesicle recycling pathways. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) {{are the two most}} predominant forms of synaptic vesicle recycling, with ADBE being more active during periods of high neuronal activity and CME being active {{for long periods of time}} after neuronal activity has ceased.|$|E
50|$|Although {{variable}} geometry is a universally recognized {{approach to}} improve aircraft efficiency and performance over {{a range of}} Mach numbers, there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>method</b> to achieve variable geometry. The F-15 Eagle employs wedge inlets with adjustable flaps to control the flow. For subsonic flow, the flaps are completely closed and for supersonic flow, the flaps are open. The Concorde employed an external-compression inlet, using a series of oblique shocks followed by a normal shock to slow the flow sufficiently for the turbojet engine. Perhaps the most recognizable supersonic aircraft, the SR-71, used a hydraulically actuated cone to reduce {{the speed of the}} supersonic flow through the aircraft inlet.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, the New York Times {{featured}} {{research findings}} {{that supported the}} merits of offering rewards to children for good behavior. Expert economists argued children experiencing trouble with their behavior or schoolwork should have numerous helpful options, including rewards. Although children might well experience an initial attraction to financial or material, a love for learning could develop subsequently. Despite the controversy {{regarding the use of}} rewards, some experts believe the best way to motivate a child is to offer rewards {{at the beginning of the}} school year, but if unsuccessful they recommend teachers and parents stop using the reward system. Because of individual differences among children, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>method</b> will work for everyone. Some children respond well to the use of rewards for positive behavior, while others evidence negative effects. The results seem to depend on the person.|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing Destiny in The Independent, Robert Hanks {{declared}} it “an uncommonly satisfying book, richly thoughtful and informative, balancing ideas and their symbols with bewitching preciseness.” [...] For Valentine Cunningham, writing in The Times Literary Supplement: “Morley’s modern Germany is given us as {{a sequence of}} impossible — shocking, monstrous, buried — facts, which, like the blood of Abel that in the Bible ‘cries out from the ground’, demand explanation.

Destiny refuses to settle for any one thing: story, history, art history, documentary, essay, travel-writing. It will be {{all of these things}} in turn. And some of these kinds are done with great power.” In his review of the book in The Spectator, Tom Hiney said of Morley's prose: [...] "His writing has soul as well as brains and it is this that makes his fiction engaging." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} methods used by {{scientists}} to define bear species and subspecies as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>method</b> is always effective. Brown bear taxonomy and subspecies classification {{has been described}} as [...] "formidable and confusing" [...] with few authorities listing the same specific set of subspecies. Genetic testing is now perhaps the most important way to scientifically define brown bear relationships and names. Generally genetic testing uses the word clade rather than species because a genetic test alone cannot define a biological species. Most genetic studies report on how closely related the bears are (or their Genetic distance). There are hundreds of obsolete brown bear subspecies, each with its own name, and this can become confusing; Hall (1981) lists 86 different types and even as many as 90 have been proposed. However, recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five main clades which contain all extant brown bears. As of 2005, 16 extant or recently extinct subspecies are recognized by the general scientific community.|$|E
50|$|Special Agents {{evaluate}} {{allegations of}} possible criminal acts {{received from the}} civil tax sections of the IRS as well as traditional law enforcement sources and direct participation and leadership in Federal task forces and multi-agency investigations. There is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>method</b> by which Special Agents receive information or make recommendations of prosecution to the Department of Justice or the U.S. Attorney. The criminal referral process in connection with U.S. Federal tax-related offenses generally consists of two stages. An initial stage referral may {{be made by the}} Examination or Collection personnel of the Internal Revenue Service to the IRS Criminal Investigation function, using Form 2797. After the Criminal Investigation Division investigates, evaluates the result of the investigation, and concludes that a recommendation for prosecution should be made, the second stage is a referral made by the Criminal Investigation Division to the U.S. Department of Justice under Internal Revenue Code section 6103(h)(3)(A) and Treasury Order 150-35. At any time prior to the second stage referral, the Department of the Treasury has the legal authority to reach a compromise settlement of a criminal case arising under the U.S. internal revenue laws; after the second stage referral is made, however, only the Department of Justice may compromise the case.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fusion of}} a boron nucleus with a proton {{produces}} slow-moving helium particles but <b>no</b> neutrons. <b>One</b> <b>method</b> of producing proton-boron fusion uses one laser {{to create a}} boron-11 plasma and another to create a stream of protons that smash into the plasma. The laser-generated proton beam produces a tenfold increase of boron fusion because protons and boron nuclei collide directly. Earlier methods used a solid boron target, [...] "protected" [...] by its electrons, which reduced the fusion rate.|$|R

5000|$|While {{explaining}} {{the theory behind}} consciousness raising in a 1973 talk, Kathie Sarachild remarked that [...] "From the beginning of consciousness-raising ... there has been <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>method</b> of raising consciousness. What really counts in consciousness-raising are not methods, but results. The only 'methods' of consciousness raising are essentially principles. They are the basic radical political principles {{of going to the}} original sources, both historic and personal, going to people—women themselves, and going to experience for theory and strategy". However, most consciousness raising groups did follow a similar pattern for meeting and discussion. Meetings would usually be held about once a week, {{with a small group of}} women, often in the living room of one of the members. Meetings were women-only, and usually involved going around the room for each woman to talk about a predetermined subject—for example, [...] "When you think about having a child, would you rather have a boy or a girl?"—speaking from her own experience, with no formal leader for the discussion and few rules for directing or limiting discussion. (Some c.r. groups did implement rules designed to give every woman a chance to speak, to prevent interruptions, etc.) Speaking from personal experience was used as a basis for further discussion and analysis based on the first-hand knowledge that was shared.|$|E
5000|$|Direct and {{indirect}} methods {{are two ways}} in which bed material can be measured. Direct measurement is done {{through the use of}} a physical trap, placing the device in contact with the bed, “allowing the sediment transported as bedload to accumulate (or be trapped) inside the sampler for a certain amount of time, after which the sampler is raised to the surface and the material is emptied and weighed to determine a weight transported per unit time." [...] There are three types of direct samplers, which include a box or basket, pan or tray, and pressure difference as described by Hubbell (1964). Measurements of bedload discharge are rare and frequently of unknown accuracy because no bedload sampler has been extensively tested and calibrated over a wide range of hydraulic conditions. The box sampler has an opening that allows sediment to enter, the pan or tray samplers are placed in front of the open front of a box, and the pressure difference sampler is made to produce a pressure drop at the end of the nozzle. Accurate field measurements are very difficult to make, errors principally associated with the measuring devices themselves and with the extreme temporal variations in transport rate, which are a characteristic feature of bed material movement. Indirect measurements can be performed by a tracer, repeated channel surveys, bedform velocimetry, or velocimetry. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>method</b> is entirely satisfactory, but indirect channel surveys, provided they are detailed enough at the reach scale, can produce reliable results, and have the advantages of minimum disturbance to the flow and time-integrated sampling which averages out short-term fluctuations in the transport rate.|$|E

Finally, philosophic sagacity suggests that the only true African philosophies are those that have developed with no contact with the West whatsoever. Rather than a specific approach, this idea simply notes the huge range of educational techniques which may exist through the continent by a wide variety of people.
