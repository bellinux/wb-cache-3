Contigs were assembled from sequenced total siRNA from plants using small sequence assembly software and could positively identify RNA, ssDNA and dsDNA reverse transcribing viruses and in one case spanned the entire genome. The results present a novel approach which cannot only identify known viral pathogens, occurring at extremely low titers, but also <b>novel</b> <b>viruses,</b> without the necessity of any prior knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Shrews {{are small}} insectivorous mammals that are {{distributed}} worldwide. Similar to rodents, shrews {{live on the}} ground and are commonly found near human residences. In this study, we investigated the enteric virome of wild shrews in the genus Crocidura using a sequence-independent viral metagenomics approach. A large portion of the shrew enteric virome was composed of insect <b>viruses,</b> whilst <b>novel</b> <b>viruses</b> including cyclovirus, picornavirus and picorna-like virus were also identified. Several cycloviruses, including variants of human cycloviruses detected in cerebrospinal fluid and stools, were detected in wild shrews at a high prevalence rate. The identified picornavirus was distantly related to human parechovirus, inferring the presence of a new genus in this family. The identified picorna-like viruses were characterized as different species of calhevirus 1, which was discovered previously in human stools. Complete or nearly complete genome sequences of these <b>novel</b> <b>viruses</b> were determined in this study and then were subjected to further genetic characterization.

40|$|Worldwide, {{approximately}} 1. 8 {{million children}} die from diarrhea annually, and millions more suffer multiple episodes of nonfatal diarrhea. On average, {{in up to}} 40 % of cases, no etiologic agent can be identified.

40|$|AbstractInfluenza A viruses cause {{respiratory}} {{infections that}} range from asymptomatic to deadly in humans.

Here, we examine this issue, focusing on Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), which is a particularly pertinent choice, as it is both a major plant pathogen and also the virus with which this question has been studied in the most detail. Using recent results on recombination in CMV, we employ a novel framework giving particular prominence to the formulation of the risk hypothesis and to hypothesis testing via examination of the potential pathway to harm.

We also performed a survey of CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, evolution and control of avian CoVs...|$|R
