In extreme cases, all significant digits of precision can be lost (although gradual underflow ensures that the result will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>zero</b> unless the two operands were equal). This cancellation illustrates the danger in assuming {{that all of the}} digits of a computed result are meaningful.

25|$|When {{the heat}} and work {{transfers}} in the equations above are infinitesimal in magnitude, they are often denoted by , rather than exact differentials denoted by , {{as a reminder that}} heat and work do not describe the state of any system. The integral of an inexact differential depends upon the particular path taken through the space of thermodynamic parameters while the integral of an exact differential depends only upon the initial and final states. If the initial and final states are the same, then the integral of an inexact differential may or may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>zero,</b> but the integral of an exact differential is always zero. The path taken by a thermodynamic system through a chemical or physical change is known as a thermodynamic process.|$|E

Further info: What is the mass of a photon? http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/photon_mass.html has no electric charge, and is a stable particle. A photon has two possible polarization states. [...] In the momentum representation of the photon, which is preferred in quantum field theory, a photon is described by its wave vector, which determines its wavelength λ and its direction of propagation. A photon's wave vector may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>zero</b> and can be represented either as a spatial 3-vector or as a (relativistic) four-vector; {{in the latter case}} it belongs to the light cone (pictured). Different signs of the four-vector denote different circular polarizations, but in the 3-vector representation one should account for the polarization state separately; it actually is a spin quantum number. In both cases the space of possible wave vectors is three-dimensional.|$|E
