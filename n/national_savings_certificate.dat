40|$|Purpose – Considering the {{popularity}} of the premium <b>savings</b> <b>certificate</b> (PSC) of the <b>National</b> <b>Savings</b> Bank of Malaysia (Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN)) the paper aims to justify the Shari'ah compliancy of this product by analyzing its underlying contracts and to propose a Shari'ah compliant <b>savings</b> <b>certificate,</b> if the current practice is invalid in the Shari'ah. Design/methodology/approach – Inductive methodology is first used to obtain a basic understanding of this product and the characteristics of Shari'ah approved contracts as well as the views of the jurists. Interviewing method is also used to acquire first-hand information when the inductive method is not sufficient. Afterwards, an analytical approach is adopted to justify the validity of this contract with the Shari'ah principles. Finally, an innovative methodology is used to propose a Shari'ah compliant <b>savings</b> <b>certificate.</b> Findings – The paper argues that the underlying contract used in PSC violates the conditions of wadi'ah contract, as in wadi'ah, the bank is not allowed to spend the money for investment, but in practice, BSN uses the money for investment. Therefore, the underlying contract in PSC turns into qard (loan) contract. Since the scholars unanimously declare that giving any kind of benefit like prizes to the creditor is riba, then PSC is considered as invalid according to the Shari'ah. On the other hand, although PSC might seem like gambling, it is different from gambling as the prizes given to PSC are from a third party. The paper proposes implementing mudarabah contract in PSC where the bank is allowed to invest according to its interest and the depositors share the profit and loss but the huge fluctuation of profit and loss could be shrunk by a special fund method. Originality/value – In particular, it attracts the attention of BSN management to change their product's features. In general, it discovers a non-Shari'ah compliant feature of <b>savings</b> <b>certificates</b> and outlines the feature of a Shari'ah compliant <b>saving</b> <b>certificate</b> for the practitioners of Islamic banking all over the world.

5000|$|<b>National</b> <b>Savings</b> and Investments {{was founded}} by the Palmerston {{government}} in 1861 as the Post Office Savings Bank, the world's first postal savings system.

As an example, <b>savings</b> <b>certificates</b> were issued in World Wars I and II to help finance the war effort.

50|$|The primary, interest-earning stamp issued was the War <b>Savings</b> <b>Certificate</b> stamp, {{which was}} worth 5 dollars at {{maturity}} on January 1, 1923. These stamps {{needed to be}} affixed to an engraved folder called the War <b>Savings</b> <b>Certificate,</b> which carried {{the name of the}} purchaser, and could only be redeemed by that individual. Between December 3, 1917 and January 31, 1918, each stamp could be purchased at the price of $4.12. If purchased on January 2, 1918, the return on the investment would be 4 percent, compounded quarterly. The price of the stamp increased by one cent for each month after January 1918 until sales ended in December 1918. Owners of these stamps could also redeem them for cash prior to the maturity date and receive the amount paid plus one cent for every month after the original purchase. The Treasury issued a new series of War <b>Savings</b> <b>Certificate</b> stamps in subsequent years, with the same interest rate and time to maturity.

40|$|Wessex Archaeology was {{commissioned}} by IMB Management, on behalf of Carillion (Maple Oak) Ltd., to create a historic building record of Milburngate House, Durham. Milburngate House was constructed between 1965 - 69 and designed by T. F. Winterburn with input from associate architects Gollins, Melvin, Ward and Partners. The building {{was commissioned}} by the <b>Savings</b> <b>Certificates</b> Division of the Post Office and comprised multiple blocks and towers representative of the Brutalist movement in architecture. The building was not listed but was within the Durham Conservation Area and had been identified as being of architectural interest. The building recording included documentary, cartographic, photographic and digital survey and was undertaken over two phases of work. The start of the Second World War in 1939 led to many offices leaving London for fear of bomb damage. This included the Certificate Office that was based in North London. Several departments of the Certificate Office relocated to Morecambe, Lancashire, however, the main certificate work remained in London throughout the war. After the war, many staff returned to North London. However, {{the whole of the}} <b>Savings</b> <b>Certificates</b> Division was relocated to Milburngate House, Durham, in 1970. The relocation to Durham coincided with the division of the Post Office Savings Bank from the Post Office in 1969 and transferral to the Treasury, changing its name to <b>National</b> <b>Savings</b> in the process. Between 1965 and 1969, the Stage 1 building was constructed first with Stage 2 constructed shortly after. Built to a concrete and steel frame, with pre-cast concrete wall panels and features, the building was typical of post-war office development. It was built, in part, in fulfilment of Thomas Sharp's 1944 Master Plan for the re-development of Durham City and originally built as a comprehensive development of 360, 000 square feet of office space within one large building including integrated car parking...|$|R
