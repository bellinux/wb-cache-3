40|$|The {{standard}} nonparametric, rank-based {{approach to}} the analysis of dependent data from factorial designs is based on an estimated unstructured (UN) variance [...] covariance matrix, but the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variance [...] covariance terms in many designs can seriously affect test performance. In a simulation study for a factorial arranged in blocks, we compared estimates of type-I error probability and power based on the UN structure with the estimates obtained with a more parsimonious heterogeneous-compound-symmetry structure (CSH). Although tests based on the UN structure were anti-conservative with small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> levels, especially with four or six blocks, they became conservative at higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> levels. Tests based on the CSH structure were anti-conservative, and results did not depend on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>factor</b> levels. When both tests were anti-conservative, tests based on the CSH structure were less so. Although use of the CSH structure is concluded to be more suitable than use of the UN structure for the small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> blocks typical in agricultural experiments, results suggest that further improvement of test statistics is needed for such situations. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Transcription factor {{proteins}} bind specific DNA sequences {{to control}} the expression of genes. They contain DNA binding domains which belong to several super-families, each with a specific mechanism of DNA binding. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transcription <b>factors</b> encoded in a genome increases with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> genes in the genome. Here, we examined the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transcription <b>factors</b> from each super-family in diverse organisms. Results: We find that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transcription <b>factors</b> from most super-families appears to be bounded. For example, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> winged helix <b>factors</b> does not generally exceed 300, even in very large genomes. The magnitude <b>of</b> the maximal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transcription <b>factors</b> from each super-family seems to correlate with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> DNA bases effectively recognized by the binding mechanism of that super-family. Coding theory predicts that such upper bounds on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transcription <b>factors</b> should exist, {{in order to minimize}} cross-binding errors between transcription factors. This theory further predicts that factors with similar binding sequences should tend to have similar biological effect, so that errors based on mis-recognition are minimal.

5|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>factors</b> are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>factors</b> can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk}} of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E

Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E

40|$|Forming a {{subjective}} risk judgment in circumstances that feature multiple risk factors is a common, yet complex task. One would expect {{variations in the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>factors</b> in a given situation to have an important influence on risk judgments, yet {{the exact nature of}} this influence remains empirically untested. We conducted three studies to address this issue. In Study 1, we found that, when individuals were confronted with a preset <b>number</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>factors</b> (zero, one, two or three) in the same scenario, their risk judgments were virtually identical for zero, one and two risk factors, yet markedly higher for three risk factors. By contrast, Study 2 showed that when confronted with variations in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>factors</b> (zero, one, two and three) for that same scenario, individual’s risk judgments increased/decreased in relatively even increments concurrent with increases/decreases in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>factors.</b> Study 3 identified that pronounced increases in risk judgments, like those observed in Study 1, may occur when the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>factors</b> is ‘high’ relative to the potential victim’s vulnerability to those factors. Our results show that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>factors</b> in given circumstances can have an important influence on risk judgments and that this influence can differ based on the characteristics of the situation.

30|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} the model involves the section <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> latent <b>factors.</b> Score plots help to select the optimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> latent <b>factors</b> {{that will be used}} in the model. Unlike the principal component analysis (PCA), the PLS scores plots are calculated to explain the variation in x and y and to maximize the relationship between x- and y-variables. Choosing the optimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> latent <b>factors</b> is a complicated process and requires trial and error until reaching the optimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> latent <b>factors.</b> Using too many latent factors will lead to overfitting the model which in return will flip the sign of some variables and make the model unrealistic. On the other hand, using a very low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> latent <b>factors</b> will not explain the variability of x and y. Two criteria are used to select the optimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> latent <b>factors.</b> The first one is by minimizing at the root mean of the predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS). The second one is by inspecting the score plots of x- and y-variables, and each latent factor will have one score plot of x versus y. If there is a trend in the score plot, it means that the latent factor {{should be included in the}} model. However, if no trend is presented in the score plot, the latent factor should be ignored (Tufféry 2011).|$|R
