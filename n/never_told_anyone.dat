5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> of this invention.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, on {{an episode}} of Viceland's The Therapist, Taylor {{revealed}} that he was sexually assaulted {{at the age of}} 10 by a 16-year-old friend. Taylor stated that he <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> about the incident until he was [...] "probably 18" [...] because his abuser [...] "threatened to hurt [...] and threatened to hurt [...] mom". At age 18, when Taylor was living with his grandmother, he attempted suicide by way of overdose. His ex-girlfriend's mother drove him to the hospital in Des Moines and doctors were able to resuscitate him. He describes this as the lowest point in his life. Taylor first met his father when he was 30 years old, and now has a relationship with him, although he said their paths do not cross that often.|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{also ran}} an Explorers group of which Steve Reinboldt was a member, {{and led the}} group on a diving trip to the Bahamas. In the interview, Burdge stated that in 1979 (eight years after Reinboldt's high school {{graduation}} in 1971), her brother {{had told her that}} he had been sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years of high school. Burdge said that she was [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he had <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> before, because he did not think he would be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation. [...] Jolene said that Hastert [...] "damaged Steve I think more than any of us will ever know." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{subject of}} Matthews' {{possible}} candidacy was raised at an October dinner fundraiser for presidential candidate Barack Obama held by Robert Wolf, president of UBS's investment bank. Discussing the dinner later, Matthews told The New York Times, [...] "People {{have asked me}} about it. I've <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> that I'm running." [...] On November 28, The Patriot-News of Harrisburg reported that Matthews met that week with Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman T.J. Rooney and Executive Director Mary Isenhour to discuss possibly running against Specter. Isenhour told the paper Matthews had not formed a campaign committee or begun raising money, {{and she did not}} believe he had yet come to a firm decision, adding, [...] "He's got a really good job with MSNBC. I think he's going to put some thought into it before he jumps in." [...] The same day as that Patriot-News report, the political blog FiveThirtyEight.com reported that Matthews had already met with potential campaign staff, something Matthews claimed was [...] "absolutely not true".|$|E
500|$|Manager Al López' {{decision}} not to start Pierce in the 1959 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers was highly controversial. After Cy Young Award winner Early Wynn started for Chicago in Game 1, Lopez chose to start Bob Shaw (18–6 in the regular season) and Dick Donovan (9–10) {{in the next two}} contests, which the White Sox lost by scores of 4–3 and 3–1. Pierce was held back until Game 4, and relieved in each of the final three games of the Series, allowing only two hits and no runs in four innings of work. In Game 4 he entered in the fourth inning with Chicago trailing 4–0, and pitched a hitless three innings before being pulled for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning, when the Sox tied the game; the Dodgers went on to win 5–4. In Game 5 he entered in the eighth inning to protect a 1–0 lead, but only issued an intentional walk before Lopez again changed pitchers; the White Sox held on for the 1–0 win. Lopez even chose to start Wynn in Game 6 on two days' rest, but he was ineffective, and Chicago was behind 8–3 by the time Pierce was brought in to start the eighth inning; the Dodgers later added a run in the ninth inning to complete the 9–3 win and capture the Series championship. Being used out of the bullpen was a deep letdown for Pierce, who said in a 1982 interview, [...] "Other guys, Early Wynn and Bob Shaw, had better years than I did that year. And against the left-handed-heavy lineup the Dodgers threw at us, Al wanted his right-handers like Dick Donovan. There was no question I was disappointed, but I understood." [...] However, there have been suggestions that Lopez' decision had other, undisclosed motivations; noting his surprise that Lopez chose to use Pierce out of the bullpen, outfielder Al Smith recalled, [...] "We all knew why Al López didn't pitch him, but we <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> and I won't say now. I will say that I thought he should have pitched. He'd been pitching all year, hadn't he?" ...|$|E

At a young age Kelly was often sexually abused by a woman who was at least ten years older than himself.

Entitled Porpoises and People, {{it was published in}} 1930. Although in part dedicated to his wife ('Topsy' in the book), in her own memoirs, June states that Burns <b>never</b> <b>told</b> her or <b>anyone</b> else he was writing it.|$|R
50|$|Dong-ji suffers under Mrs. Choi's abuse {{for a long}} time, but Mrs. Choi {{eventually}} {{sees that}} Dong-ji is a good person, and accepts both her and Baek-ho {{as members of the}} family. At the end of the series, Baek-ho is revealed to be the biological son of Man-soo. It is never revealed why Dong-ji <b>never</b> <b>told</b> this to <b>anyone,</b> or whether she knew it herself. With this, all opposition by Mrs. Choi is dropped permanently. In the final episode, we learn that Dong-ji is pregnant.|$|R
5000|$|Rick {{notices that}} the [...] "knocked out" [...] Tyler woke up {{instantly}} when the shots rang out and, {{after studying the}} fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect. Tyler confesses that he threw the fight {{in order to pay}} gambling debts, but he was <b>never</b> <b>told</b> that <b>anyone</b> would be killed and reveals that he was paid to take a dive by Serena, the redhead who tricked Kevin into leaving his post. With the involvement of Tyler, Serena and the sniper - in addition to the man who signaled Tyler to go down and whoever gave him the go-ahead - Rick suspects a conspiracy and reveals everything he has learned to Kevin. The commander confesses that the trip to Norfolk was for a test of the AirGuard missile defense system, which Powell's company was backing. He deduces that the sniper, a known Palestinian terrorist named Tariq Rabat, assassinated Kirkland in order to stop the sale of the system to the U.S. government.|$|R

2500|$|In the 2012 film Men in Black 3, Apollo 11 {{was used}} by Agent K to carry the Arc Net (a shield that protects Earth from Alien invasion) to space. [...] The three astronauts see the Men in Black {{fighting}} the alien villain from the cockpit, but Aldrin realizes that if they report it over the radio to Mission Control the launch will be aborted and they might never {{be sent to the}} Moon. [...] Armstrong nonchalantly responds to Aldrin that [...] "I didn't see anything", and simply doesn't report it. Collins apparently agreed as well. As a result, the Men in Black never realized the astronauts saw them and thus never wiped their memories with their neuralizers as is standard protocol, implying that the astronauts always remembered what happened and just <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> that I wanted to go back or {{anything}} like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was not an easy thing to do, but it was something I had to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, Abrams ComicArts {{published}} the graphic novel adaptation of Leguizamo's one-man Broadway show, Ghetto Klown. As with the live show, the graphic novel explores the actor/comedian's life and career, beginning with his adolescence in Queens, New York, {{his involvement in}} '80s avant-garde theater, his feature film career, {{and some of the}} colorful characters he encountered throughout his life. Leguizamo describes the work thusly: [...] "Ghetto Klown is the history that I probably <b>never</b> should have <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> but my therapist, but it's a real lesson that even if you suffer a certain amount (a lot) of self-doubt and anxiety, you can still accomplish great things. It’s a lesson I'm really excited to impart to a whole new audience." [...] The comic [...] is illustrated by Christo Cassano.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, David Clark of the British {{magazine}} Amateur Photographer {{commented on}} Blisss aesthetic qualities. [...] "Critics {{might argue that}} the image is bland and lacks a point of interest, while supporters would say that its evocation of a bright, clear day in a beautiful landscape is itself the subject," [...] he wrote. He notes the [...] "dreamlike quality" [...] created by the filtered sunlight on the hillside as distinguishing the image. [...] "What made Microsoft choose the image above all others?" [...] he asked. Although the company had <b>never</b> <b>told</b> O'Rear or <b>anyone</b> else, Clark thought he could guess. [...] "It's attractive, {{easy on the eye}} and doesn't detract from other items that might be on the screen are all contributing factors.

6000|$|On {{one point}} I must {{acknowledge}} {{that you have}} proved yourself {{a master of the}} art of fiction. What Hetty and I said to one another that day when she came upon me in the shrubbery at Alton College was known only to us two. She <b>never</b> <b>told</b> it to <b>anyone,</b> and I soon forgot it. All due honor, therefore, to the ingenuity with which you have filled the hiatus, and shown the state of affairs between us by a discourse on [...] "surplus value," [...] cribbed from an imperfect report of one of my public lectures, and from the pages of Karl Marx! If you were an economist I should condemn you for confusing economic with ethical considerations, and for your uncertainty as to the function which my father got his start by performing. But as you are only a novelist, I compliment you heartily on your clever little pasticcio, adding, however, that as an account of what actually passed between myself and Hetty, it is the wildest romance ever penned. Wickens's boy was far nearer the mark.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 May 1917, the {{children}} reported seeing a woman [...] "brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer {{and stronger than}} a crystal goblet filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun." [...] The woman wore a white mantle edged with gold and held a rosary in her hand. She asked them to devote themselves to the Holy Trinity and to pray [...] "the Rosary every day, {{to bring peace to}} the world and an end to the war". While {{the children}} had <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> about seeing the angel, Jacinta told her family about seeing the brightly lit woman. Lúcia had earlier said that the three should keep this experience private.

It's only right they're wanting, that is, most of the Dutchmen and the Americans--but there's the mad red rabble behind them, and the bitter rage of hard men who have been trampled on, to hold in. It's a crushing weight we who hold the reins have got to carry. Still, we were made only plain farmer men, and I guess we're not going to be saddled with more than we can bear." ...|$|E
60|$|The culprit {{tried to}} defend himself by {{saying that he had}} <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>anyone</b> what he had noticed; but the emperor, instead of listening, only drew his sword from its sheath, which so frightened the poor fellow that he confessed exactly what he had done, and how he had whispered the truth three times to the earth, and how in that very place an elder tree had sprung up, and flutes had been cut from it, which would only repeat the words he had said. Then the emperor {{commanded}} his coach to be made ready, and he took the youth with him, and they drove to the spot, for he wished to see for himself whether the young man's confession was true; but when they reached the place only one stem was left. So the emperor desired his attendants to cut him a flute from the remaining stem, and, when it was ready, he ordered his chamberlain to play on it. But no tune could the chamberlain play, though he was the best flute player about the court--nothing came but the words, 'The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears.' Then the emperor knew that even the earth gave up its secrets, and he granted the young man his life, but he never allowed him to be his barber any more.|$|E

[...] Yet, West was soon proved wrong, when just on the [...] "first two days, 1,000 emails had landed in his inbox", and according to West the emails [...] "mostly began 'I've <b>never</b> <b>told</b> this to <b>anyone</b> before.' Tales of both heartache and happiness poured in. More than 10,000 before he headed to the cabin, which he soon reserved for an additional month." [...] To these stories, West was highly careful and sensitive because [...] "'people were intrusting me with their deepest confessions. I wanted to respect that...I am honored {{to be able to}} share this journey with my fans...that they allowed me a glimpse into their lives and what God is doing in and through them.'" [...] Due to this, West stated [...] "he enlisted the help of his 'most trusted advisors' (aka, mom and dad) to comb through the stacks of stories, he was the primary reader and most of the songwriting was done solo.
