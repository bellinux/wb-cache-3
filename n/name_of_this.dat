The <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> species is derived from the Ancient Greek leukos 'white' and notos 'back'. Birds in the southern parts of its range tend to be smaller than those in the north.|$|E

5|$|In 1295 he {{is found}} at the papal court acting as the commensalis ("table companion") and {{chaplain}} of Cardinal Hugh Aycelin (Hugh Seguin), the Dominican Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia. Hugh was probably making use of Dundee's training as a lawyer. At this time Thomas {{is said to be}} Dean of Brechin Cathedral. The last known dean, William, is attested in 1269, and another dean was in possession by 24 May 1275, but the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dean is not known. This person is probably not Thomas as it is unlikely that he was Dean of Brechin and Subdean of Glasgow at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> species was often given as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), {{native to the}} western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E
5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show adaptability or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships. Confronted with a desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity. Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion and mistrust. But, in spite of all, the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> great defender of the faith {{is one of the most}} memorable in Ethiopian history.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent authors {{moved the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} to the genus Carcharhinus; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{designated}} it as the type species for the genus. In some earlier literature, the scientific <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> shark was mistakenly given as C. spallanzani, now recognized as a synonym of the spottail shark (C. sorrah). Other common names for this species include blackfin reef shark, black-finned shark, blacktip shark, reef blacktip shark, and guliman.|$|E

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species of}} longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the {{epaulette shark}} has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E

5|$|Hasbro {{owns the}} rights of both Blythe and Littlest Pet Shop, toy lines {{respectively}} introduced in 1972 and 1992. Manufactured through their Kenner Products division, Hasbro acquired the Cincinnati-based company, then owned by Tonka, in 1991. Hasbro sold these toys under the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> division until they closed down Kenner's original Cincinnati headquarters in 2000. Claster Television had produced an earlier animated show based on Littlest Pet Shop in 1995 for Hasbro, but the 2012 Littlest Pet Shop series marked the first adaptation of the Blythe doll to a character on television. A prior incarnation of such a character is the protagonist of Littlest Pet Shop Presents, an unrelated animated miniseries produced by Cosmic Toast Studios. This series was released by Hasbro exclusively on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|K'inich Popol Hol {{inherited}} {{the throne of}} Copán from K'inich ax K'uk' Mo', who was his father. He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph. K'inich Popol Hol oversaw {{the construction of the}} first version of the Mesoamerican ballcourt at the city, which was decorated with images of the scarlet macaw, a bird that features prominently in Maya mythology. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.|$|E
