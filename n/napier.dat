Batman escapes and <b>Napier</b> is presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|Albert Downing {{was born}} on 12 July 1886 in Port Ahuriri, <b>Napier,</b> New Zealand, the eldest son of Mr and Mrs John Downing. He {{attended}} <b>Napier</b> Boys' High School until 1904. He was a farmer before joining Barry Brothers, carriers and coal merchants, choosing {{to work as a}} carter outdoors, rather than join the clerical staff. Later, he worked as a storeman for the Ellison and Duncan Company.|$|E
5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis <b>Napier</b> and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, <b>Napier</b> as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and <b>Napier</b> and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.|$|E

5|$|The Parkway begins where US20 expands to {{a divided}} highway {{southeast}} of Elkhart. To the east in Indiana the freeway feeds into an undivided segment of US20 at County Road 17 (CR17). From there it runs westward {{along the south}} sides of Elkhart and Mishawaka. South of South Bend, US31 joins the Parkway, and then the Parkway turns northward along {{the west side of}} South Bend. Along this segment, US20 turns back west and leaves the Parkway. The Parkway meets the Indiana Toll Road which carries I-80/I-90 before crossing the state line into Michigan. West of Niles, the Parkway meets US12 and continues northwesterly running west of Berrien Springs. From there it runs northward to end at <b>Napier</b> Avenue east of St. Joseph. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway ends at <b>Napier</b> Avenue, but US31 continues as a five-lane highway west along <b>Napier</b> to connect with I-94 {{and the rest of the}} US31 routing north of there on I-196.|$|E

5|$|Both of Britain's {{athletes at}} the Games competed in alpine skiing events, {{funding for the}} two athletes was {{provided}} by the British Paralympic Association. Russell Docker, who was paralysed from the waist down following a skiing accident in 1995, appeared at the Paralympics {{for the first time and}} competed in the LW12 classification. He crashed out in the downhill event and failed to complete his other three races. Stephen <b>Napier,</b> who was disabled after being knocked off a motorbike by an unmarked police car in 1995, also competed in four events in the LW10 classification. His highest finish was sixth in the Super-G and he also had three seventh-place finishes. In each of his events <b>Napier</b> was the lowest ranked athlete to complete the course.|$|E
5|$|Cunard, who {{was back}} in Halifax, {{unfortunately}} {{did not know of}} the tender until after the deadline. He returned to London and started negotiations with Admiral Parry, who was Cunard's good friend from when Parry was a young officer stationed in Halifax 20 years earlier. Cunard offered Parry a fortnightly service beginning in May 1840. While Cunard did not then own a steamship, he had been an investor in an earlier steamship venture, Royal William, and owned coal mines in Nova Scotia. Cunard's major backer was Robert <b>Napier</b> whose Robert <b>Napier</b> and Sons was the Royal Navy's supplier of steam engines. He also had the strong backing of Nova Scotian political leaders at the time when London needed to rebuild support in British North America after the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 14–15 April 1809, contact was {{maintained}} with the French squadron by Recruit, Captain Charles John <b>Napier</b> firing on the rearmost ship Hautpoult and coming under fire from the French stern-chasers, guns situated {{in the rear of}} a ship to fire on pursuers. Shortly after 04:00, Pompee came within range and began to fire her bow-chasers, the chase continuing westwards into the Caribbean Sea. Frustrated by her inability to escape Recruit, Hautpoult eventually turned and fired a broadside at 10:45, causing severe damage but failing to dissuade <b>Napier,</b> who immediately counter-attacked. Hautpoults manoeuvre caused her to lose ground to her pursuers and throughout the day the squadrons exchanged shots, neither causing significant damage but the French being driven deeper into British held waters and unable to drive off their opponents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Napier</b> {{assisted}} in the evacuation of British and Commonwealth troops from the island of Crete in late May, following the successful Axis invasion. On one such occasion the vessel embarked 296 soldiers, three women, one Greek and one Chinese civilian, ten sailors, two children and a dog. Returning to Alexandria, the destroyer came under attack but arrived unscathed. Two days later <b>Napier</b> was less fortunate; having taken 705 soldiers on board, she was targeted on her return journey by a formation of twelve German dive-bombers. The ship was struck twice by bombs and suffered damage to the stern, the engine room and boiler room. One of the aircraft was shot down and a further three damaged. Although no allied casualties were sustained and the destroyer arrived safely in Alexandria, she spent the next two-and-a-half months in Port Said under repair.|$|E

5|$|Orhaniye {{was built}} by the Robert <b>Napier</b> and Sons {{shipyard}} in Glasgow, where she was ordered in 1862. Her keel was laid down in 1863 and she was launched on 26 June 1865. She began sea trials in 1866 and was commissioned into the fleet later that year.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of Westpac Stadium in 1999, Wellington's test venue was Athletic Park. Athletic Park was the venue for the first All Blacks test match in New Zealand against Great Britain in 1904. The first home test match played outside the main centres of Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin or Wellington was in 1996 at McLean Park in <b>Napier.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sennheiser sound {{equipment}} {{was used for}} the audio. According to Matt <b>Napier,</b> Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software to tweak frequencies. Madonna used an HSP 4 headset {{at the beginning of the}} show, later switching to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld transmitter. Sennheiser transmitters were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. <b>Napier</b> said in a Mix article that they needed gold-plated transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge of wireless sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from tour, Warbrick moved to <b>Napier,</b> and in 1885 represented Hawke's Bay provincially, including captaining them against Poverty Bay. By 1886 {{he was back}} playing for Auckland, and that year captained them in their wins over both Wellington, and also New South Wales – who were again touring the country. He returned to Hawke's Bay for the 1887 season, and played for them against Wellington, Poverty Bay, and Canterbury. Warbrick had returned to Wellington by the 1888 season when he again played for the province.|$|E
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John <b>Napier</b> of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted his portrait of George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Declan <b>Napier</b> is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian Network Ten soap opera Neighbours, played by James Sorensen from 2007 to 2010, and Erin Mullally from 2010 to 2011. In January 2010 {{it was announced}} that Sorensen had quit the role of Declan and the decision to recast was taken, with Mullally making his first on-screen appearance on 3 May 2010. In October 2010, it was announced the character was to leave Neighbours and he made his final appearance on 15 March 2011.|$|E
5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing {{a number of}} pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert <b>Napier.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, Chile {{completed}} {{the acquisition of}} Hunters from Britain for service in the Chilean Air Force. In June 1973, the Liberian oil tanker <b>Napier</b> ran aground on Guamblin Island, accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil. After the rescue of the crew, the vessel was fired upon and set on fire by Chilean Hunters {{in an effort to}} burn the oil to avoid further environmental contamination.|$|E
5|$|HMS Audacious {{was ordered}} on 29 April 1867 from Robert <b>Napier</b> in Govan, Glasgow. She was laid down on 26 June 1867 and {{launched}} on 27 February 1869 in a gale. The winds caught {{the rear of}} the ship as she was about halfway down the slipway and twisted her enough that some plates and frames of her bottom were damaged. The ship was completed on 10 September 1870 and commissioned the following month. She cost £256,291 to build.|$|E
5|$|Hautpoult {{had fought}} hard during the {{engagement}} and was badly damaged, suffering between 80 and 90 casualties. Pompee was also badly damaged, losing nine killed and 30 wounded, including Fahie wounded. Other casualties were suffered on Castor, with one killed and five wounded; Neptune one killed and four wounded and Recruit one wounded. In total, British losses were 11 killed and 40 wounded. Cochrane ordered Pompee {{and the newly}} captured French ship back to port, promoting <b>Napier</b> to command the ship of the line for his service on Recruit and despatching York and Captain to hunt for Troude's remaining squadron. Despite their efforts, Troude evaded pursuit and eventually reached Cherbourg in May. In addition to <b>Napier</b> there were further promotions and awards and Hautpoult was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Abercromby. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It was at this point that the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca <b>Napier.</b> The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, a 25th-anniversary {{celebration for}} The Blues Brothers {{was held at}} Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.

5|$|Kodandera Madappa Cariappa, OBE (28 January 1899– 15 May 1993), was {{the first}} Indian to be {{appointed}} as commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the Indian Army. His distinguished military career spanned almost three decades. Cariappa joined the British Indian Army on 1 December 1919, and was commissioned as temporary second lieutenant in the 2/88 Carnatic Infantry. He was later transferred to 2/125 <b>Napier</b> Rifles, then to the 7th Prince of Wales Own Dogra Regiment in June 1922, and finally to the 1/7 Rajput, which became his parent regiment.|$|E
5|$|Kohli {{continued}} to amass {{runs on the}} subsequent New Zealand tour. He averaged 58.21 in the five-match ODI series in which his efforts of 111-ball 123 at <b>Napier,</b> 65-ball 78 at Hamilton and 78-ball 82 at Wellington all went in vain as India were defeated 4–0. He made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match Test series that followed including an unbeaten 105 {{on the last day}} of the second Test at Wellington that helped India save the match.|$|E
5|$|Lumsden's next {{period of}} active service was as {{quartermaster}} general {{on the staff}} of General <b>Napier,</b> who commanded the 2nd division of the expeditionary force to China during the Second Opium War, in 1860. Lumsden took part in the operations of the Anglo-French forces, including the action of Sin-ho, the capture of Tang-ku and the capture of the Taku Forts that led up to the advance on and occupation of Beijing. He was again mentioned in despatches and promoted to brevet-Major and then brevet-lieutenant-colonel.|$|E
5|$|Mahmudiye {{was built}} by the Thames Iron Works {{shipyard}} in Blackwall, London; {{she was the only}} member of her class not built at Robert <b>Napier</b> and Sons.

She began sea trials on 27 June 1865, by which time she had been renamed Osmaniye, and she was commissioned into the Ottoman fleet in November that year.|$|E
5|$|P. imperialis {{crossed the}} waters between Australia and New Zealand some time between 1960 and 1972, and {{seedlings}} {{of the previously}} infertile trees of F. rubiginosa began appearing in brick and stone walls, and on other trees, particularly in parks and gardens around Auckland. They have been recorded {{as far south as}} <b>Napier.</b> P. imperialis has been transported to Hawaii, California and Israel, where it has been observed to pollinate its host.|$|E

5|$|The 1905 International Tourist Trophy was an {{automobile}} motor race held on 14 September 1905 on closed public roads along the Highroads Course on the Isle of Man. It was organised by the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland, {{and was the}} first time that what became known as the RAC Tourist Trophy was awarded.

Percy Northey finished second in a Rolls-Royce, while the Vinot-Deguingand driver Norman Littlejohn was third.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William <b>Napier</b> repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from <b>Napier,</b> Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{logarithm}} in seventeenth century Europe is {{the discovery of}} a new function that extended the realm of analysis beyond the scope of algebraic methods. The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by John <b>Napier</b> in 1614, in a book titled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms). Prior to Napier's invention, there had been other techniques of similar scopes, such as the prosthaphaeresis or the use of tables of progressions, extensively developed by Jost Bürgi around 1600.|$|E
