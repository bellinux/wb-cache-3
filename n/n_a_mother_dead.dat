The Dead is a section of its own, and serves as an epilogue to the short story collection.

40|$|O tema desta Dissertação é o suicídio como conseqüência da identificação com a mãe morta. Trata-se de uma pesquisa teórica fundamentada na teoria psicanalítica, que recorre à análise do personagem Richard Brown, do filme As Horas, para ilustrar o argumento teórico de que a revivescência da identificação com a mãe morta pode ser um fator desencadeante do suicídio do melancólico na vida adulta. Inicialmente procura explicitar o conceito de mãe morta, caracterizada como uma mãe que mesmo quando está presente mostra-se ausente nos cuidados e no investimento amoroso ao filho em função de sua depressão. Assim, para a criança, a imagem materna será a de uma mãe sem vida, de uma mãe morta. Mostra a identificação com a mãe morta como saída psíquica para a situação traumática proveniente do desinvestimento amoroso maternal. A criança na relação com esta mãe vive uma catástrofe psíquica chamada por Green de trauma narcisista, o que vai determinar o destino do investimento libidinal, objetal e narcisista do sujeito. Assim sendo, considera-se a melancolia como uma psicopatologia manifestada na vida adulta pelo sujeito subjugado pelo complexo da mãe morta. O estudo da melancolia no texto Luto e Melancolia, de Freud, fornece subsídios para se compreender os processos do mundo {{interior}} daqueles que querem dar cabo à sua própria existência. A melancolia evidencia o embate entre o Eu e o Supereu nos papéis de acusado e acusador. Mostra que o Supereu se torna sádico ao cobrar perfeição do Eu masoquista empobrecido narcisicamente pela identificação com a mãe morta. Quando chega às raias do sadismo esse embate leva o Eu, identificado com a mãe morta, a desejar eliminar o objeto mau introjetado numa parte do Eu, para resgatar o seu valor narcísico idealizado. Aponta o suicídio como a saída psíquica encontrada pelo melancólico para livrar-se da identificação com a mãe morta. Conclui que no suicídio os conflitos inconscientes manifestados na vida adulta são revivescências dos conteúdos psíquicos registrados na infância. No caso estudado em questão, a revivescência da identificação com a mãe morta teria sido o fator desencadeante do suicídio de Richard Brown na vida adulta. ABSTRACT: The {{theme of}} such Dissertation is suicide {{as a consequence}} of identification with the <b>dead</b> <b>mother.</b> It is <b>a</b> theoretical research based on the psycho-analytical theory which recurs to the analysis of the character Richard Brown, from the motion picture The Hours, in order to illustrate the theoretical argument that the identification revival with the <b>dead</b> <b>mother</b> may be <b>an</b> unlinking factor for the suicide of the melancholic patient in the adult life. Initially, it is tried to explicit the <b>dead</b> <b>mother</b> concept, characterized as <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> who, even when present, is quite absent as for the cares and love investment towards the child due to her depression. Thus, to the child, the maternal image shall be one of <b>a</b> lifeless <b>mother,</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>mother.</b> It shows identification with the <b>dead</b> <b>mother</b> as <b>a</b> psychic defense to the traumatic situation provoked by the maternal love underinvestment. The child, in the relationship with the <b>mother,</b> lives <b>a</b> psychic catastrophe which Green has called narcissist trauma, what will determine the fate of the libidinal, objective and narcissist investment of the individual. Hence, melancholy is considered a psycho-pathology, manifested at an adult age by the individual subjugated by the complex of the <b>dead</b> <b>mother.</b> The study of melancholy in the Mourning and Melancholy of Freud furnishes subsidies {{to the understanding of the}} inner world processes of those ones who want to terminate their own existence. Melancholy evidences the struggle between the I and the Super-I on the roles of accuser and accused ones. It shows that the Super-I becomes sadistic when asking for perfection to the masochist I narcissistically impoverished by the identification with the <b>dead</b> <b>mother.</b> When it gets to the sadistic borders, such struggle leads the I, identified with the <b>dead</b> <b>mother,</b> to desire to eliminate the object badly introduced to a part of the I, in order to rescue its idealized narcissist value. It points out suicide as the psychical exit found by the melancholic patient to get free from the identification with the <b>dead</b> <b>mother.</b> It is concluded that in the suicide, the unconscious conflicts manifested in the adult life are revivals of the psychic contents registered in childhood. In this paper, the revival of the identification with the <b>dead</b> <b>mother</b> would have been the unlinking factor of suicide of Richard Brown in his adult life.

5000|$|Paz played Cheba, {{the lead}} role in La Tirisia, a film written, produced, and {{directed}} by Jorge Pérez Solano (2014). The plot, inspired by a popular term tirisia (which means [...] "a perpetual sadness defined as 'the death of the spirit'"), {{is set in the}} Mixteca region of Mexico, and centers on two women (Paz and Gabriela Cartol) who were impregnated by Sylvestre (Gustavo Sánchez Parra). When Cheba's estranged husband returns to town, he finds her sunk into a deep depression since she had to give away her newborn (Sylvestre's child). About the film, Paz said to Diario de Xalapa: [...] "It is a very well-written story that required characters with depth; when I read it, it brought me great joy and made me say 'I want to watch this'. The first time I watched it I was shocked; it left a lump in my throat. It is beautiful". The film was not exhibited in commercial movie theaters in Mexico because distribution was too expensive. Instead, La Tirisia was screened at film festivals such as the Chicago International Film Festival, Thessaloniki International Film Festival, and the Toulouse Latinoamerican Film Festival, and later had a month-and-a-half stretch at the Mexican art house Cineteca Nacional. Paz commented about it: [...] "It is not very fair. We {{do not have the same}} resources that the big production companies have, and we don't have the same possibilities for making films. It is very difficult to produce a project and know that there is not a fair distribution and exhibition of these films". Paz' performance was praised by Boyd van Hoeij of The Hollywood Reporter, who stated that she was [...] "exceptional as a passionate woman who has needs and desires of her own but who’s boxed in by society’s rigid expectations for her gender". Jaime López Blanco of Sputnik magazine referred to her acting as [...] "fascinating on that introspection of <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>dead</b> inside, suffering the absence of one of their children". At the 57th Ariel Awards, Paz received the Best Actress award for her role in the film. Upon winning, Paz said: [...] "it definitely forces me to not lower the quality of my work... the other part is the joy it generates in me, the support that I am getting from the Academy, because it gives me the chance to be known as a good actress. This award speaks for myself and my duty is to continue along that line and go for characters that challenge me more".|$|R
5000|$|The cost of {{maintaining}} <b>a</b> brain <b>dead</b> <b>mother</b> {{on life support}} depends {{on the number of}} days spent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

[...] Of the twelve viable children known to be delivered from brain <b>dead</b> <b>mothers</b> on prolonged somatic support between 1982 and 2010, the mean gestational age at the time of brain death was 22 weeks and the mean gestational age at delivery was 29.5 weeks, leading to an average length of somatic support for the mothers in the ICU of 7.5 weeks (52.5 days).|$|R
