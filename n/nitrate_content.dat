40|$|Nitrates {{form part}} of the {{essential}} chemistry of soils and plants. Thus, plant roots are able to absorb nitrate directly from the soil. It has been discovered that human nitrate intake is mainly from vegetables. Vegetables {{play an important role}} in human nutrition since they are an outstanding source for vitamins, minerals, and biologically active compounds. In risk assessment of <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents,</b> this study reports the nitrate levels of 8 commonly consumed fruits and vegetables grown in Fiji, tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), eggplant (Solanum melongena), capsicum (Capsicum annuum var. grossum), breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), long bean (Vigna sesquipedalis), jackfruit (A. heterophyllus), pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo), and cucumber (Cucumis sativus). The effects of different types of cooking methods, baking, boiling, and frying, have also been studied. The validated flow injection analysis technique has been used to quantify the nitrate-N levels in the chosen products following nitrate extraction using the activated carbon technique. The mean values of nitrate levels in fresh products ranged from 25. 83 to 281. 02 mg NO 3 − kg− 1. The study shows that boiling reduced <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> by 65. 37 % to 25. 25 %. The frying in soy bean oil elevated <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> from 354. 79 % to 86. 69 %, but after baking, <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> remained almost constant with slight increasing trend in the case of tomato (19. 97 %).

40|$|Monitoring of nitrate {{leaching}} in croplands by lysimeters. The European Nitrates Directive (91 / 676 /CEE) aims at moderating or preventing water pollution with nitrates issued from agricultural practices. The Walloon region transposed it into its law and initiated a Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program on 2002, also called PGDA in French. Six lysimeters {{have been implemented}} in agricultural open fields, being under real condition of industrial harvest crops, especially vegetable ones. The lysimeters are used as follow up tools to monitor and quantify the amount of nitrates leaching beyond root zone towards underground water ressource. This study demonstrates that lysimeters are efficient and permit to collect representative quantity of seepage water. Their <b>nitrates</b> <b>content,</b> combined with data related to agricultural practices, fertilisation rates and advised, climate, the defined environmental indicator (APL) provide a global approach to link agricultural practices and underground water protection from nitrates pollution. The lysimeters validate {{the reliability of the}} environmental indicator (APL) with the <b>nitrates</b> <b>content</b> in leaching water, which will not be catched up by the next crop. Unfortunately, it is also demonstrated that even when the nitrogen management is respectful of the related legislation, the warranty to respect the targeted norms of water quality on nitrates is not ensured. The lysimeter tool clearly shows that the respect of seepage water quality standards issued from industrial agriculture {{does not have to be}} considered crop per crop but rather from an integrated and global approach of the complete crop sequences and rotations, in respect with best agricultural practices, reasonable fertilisation rates, inset crops, etc. for each individual crops. Some favourable and non favourable crop sequences to <b>nitrates</b> <b>content</b> of underground water are listed.

40|$|Abstract The prime factors affect of <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> of {{vegetables}} are fertiliza- tion and nitrate reduction rate in plants. The assimilation of NO 3 - by plants {{related to the}} uptake of NO 3 -, reduction to NO 2 -, the conversion of NO 2 - to NH 4 +, and the incorporation of NH 4 + into organic compounds. Nitrate availability, growth regulations, light, products of nitrate assimila- tion and other physiological and environmental parameters are all factors that regulate nitrate assimilation. The nitrate reductase activity is limited by energy, which comes from photosynthates. The first subject of this thesis was to study the effect of application of three nitrogen forms (urea, ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate) and spraying organic sources (citric acid and concentrated molasses) at night to the <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> of Pak-choi. The second subject was to {{study the effects of}} potassium and chloride concentrations, and with or without supplying nitrate nitrogen in nutrient at night on the growth and <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> of Pak-choi. In first study, three pot experiments, Shiow Shui soils was used. The fertilizers of total P, half of N and K were mixed into soil before seedding. The leftover N and K fertilizers were quadrisected to use at 14, 17, 20 and 23 days after planting. The organic sources used were citric acid and concentrated molasses, were used singly or mixed up as foliar fertilizers at 18, 21, 24 and 27 days after planting. In second study, two hydroponics experiments, the basic composition of nutrient solution used NCHU formula (Wu and Wang, 1995). Some treatments modifying the basic formula with concentrations of potassium (1. 5, 2 times), chloride (0. 5, 1. 5 times), and deprivation of nitrate nitrogen to grow Pak-choi. The results from pot experiment indicate that the application of different nitrogen forms and organic sources had no effect on yields and <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> of Pak-choi grown in calcareous soil. The high concentra- tion of organic sources would cause some leaf burn of Pak-choi leaf. The result from hydroponics experiment indicate that increasing the potassium concentration of nutrient solution will increase the yields of Pak-choi, but {{will not be able to}} decrease the <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> in Pak-choi. As increasing the potassium concentration and the chloride concentration simultaneouly the <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> in Pak-choi were decreased. But if only the chloride concentration increased the growth of Pak-choi were inhabited. When stop supplying of nitrate nitrogen at night did not effect the yields but decreased the <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> dramatically, lowered 40 and 43 % in the two experiments. If deionized water instead of nutrient solution at night, the <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> of Pak-choi were decreased 48 and 45 % for the high potassium treatments and 50 and 43 % for the high chloride treatments. 摘 要 影響蔬菜硝酸態氮含量最主要的因子是肥料施用及植體內硝酸還原速率。硝酸態氮代謝受硝酸還原速率的限制，硝酸還原酵素活性的表現除受氮吸收量影響外，亦受光照、養分含量比例的影響，夜間硝酸態氮持續吸收，硝酸還原酵素活性變低，導致植體硝酸態氮累積，硝酸還原酵素作用需消耗能量，本研究第一部分探討：以相同肥料施用量，三種不同形態氮肥(尿素態氮、硝酸銨和硝酸鈣) 及夜間噴施有機養液(味素發酵母液、檸檬酸) 補充碳源，探討其對小白菜生長及植體硝酸態氮含量的影響。第二部分則以水耕試驗探討不同鉀、氯濃度以及夜間中斷供應硝酸態氮對小白菜生長及植體硝酸態氮含量之差異。 盆栽試驗採用秀水系土壤進行試驗，磷肥全量、氮鉀肥半量以基肥施用，剩餘氮、鉀肥等分四次在種植第 14 、 17 、 20 、 23 天之上午七點以灌施輔以葉面噴施方式施用，在栽植第 18 、 21 、 24 、 27 天之下午七點葉面噴施味素發酵母液、檸檬酸、二者各半和不噴施有機養液等處理，在栽種第 32 天採收分析。水耕試驗以吳及王 1995 年所提出的中興大學小白菜養液(nchu) ，調整鉀(氮濃度之 1. 5 、 2 倍) 、氯(原液之 0. 5 、 1. 5 倍) 濃度及夜間停止硝酸態氮供應等 10 個處理，栽植小白菜，定植後每七天更換養液一次，在第 21 天採收分析。 盆栽試驗結果，施用不同型態氮肥在試驗中，對小白菜生長未造成顯著的差異，而噴施高濃度有機養液會造成小白菜葉面受損現象，且對植體硝酸態氮並不能有效的降低，對小白菜產量及植體養分含量也無顯著性的影響。水耕試驗結果顯示在提高鉀濃度時小白菜產量會提高且差異達極顯著，而對植體硝酸態氮含量不能有效降低；降低氯濃度之養液，除植體氯含量降低外，不會影響小白菜生長及植體養分含量，而升高氯濃度之處理會使小白菜生長受阻，若提高氯濃度同時提高鉀濃度(氮的 2 倍) ，則小白菜生長不會受阻，植體硝酸態氮含量之降低現象較僅提高鉀濃度而未提高氯濃度之處理更為顯著。夜間停止提供硝酸態氮之處理，二次試驗的結果，植體硝酸態氮在提高鉀濃度的處理降低 40 、 43 %，提高氯濃度的處理則為 32 、 36 %，差異均達極顯著(P< 0. 01) ，此時植體氯離子濃度會有升高的趨勢，二者呈負線性相關；夜間以去離子水取代養液處理，其產量並未降低，且可有效降低植體硝酸態氮含量，在二次試驗的結果，就提高鉀濃度之處理硝酸態氮降低 48 、 45 %，提高氯濃度的處理則為 50 、 43 %，差異均達極顯著，其他離子亦同時減少。綜合水耕試驗結果小白菜水耕液在N、P、K、Cl及夜間不供應養液下，產量不降低而硝酸態氮可極顯著降低。中文摘要 ………………………………………………………….

50|$|One of the unwelcome {{attributes}} of Kali tragus {{is that it}} commonly presents a fire hazard, firstly because it is flammable once it is thoroughly dry, no doubt {{partly as a result}} of its <b>nitrate</b> <b>content,</b> which may be very high, sometimes over 6% dry weight. Secondly, in a season in which the Kali growth has been heavy, high winds often accumulate shocking tangles of the tumbleweeds, covering entire buildings or trapping vehicles so completely as to prevent unaided escape, particularly in the event that the dry material ignites. When they bank up against wire fences, the force of the wind against the mass is likely to damage the fence, and so will the fire if the mass ignites. In wildfire conditions in open country, strong winds often blows burning tumbleweeds across firebreaks, frustrating standard fire control measures. When the burning weeds are stopped by buildings or stacks, they ignite such objects more effectively than any other tumbleweed on the open plains, being compact and woody at maturity, as well as highly flammable.|$|E

The film stock was then melted down to release its marketable silver <b>nitrate</b> <b>content</b> and it is presumed that most of the Hepworth company's full-length features of the 1910s and early 1920s were irretrievably lost at this time. No print of Lily of the Alley is held in the British Film Institute's National Archive, although they do possess a number of screenshots from the film on file. A modicum of hope remains that the film may one day surface unexpectedly (as was the case with Hepworth's 1920 feature Helen of Four Gates, rediscovered in a Canadian archive in 2008 after an absence of almost 90 years) and the film's official status is [...] "missing, believed lost". In view of its historical interest, Lily of the Alley is listed as one of the BFI's [...] "75 Most Wanted" [...] missing British feature films.|$|E
50|$|The {{water is}} {{estimated}} {{to come from a}} container approximately 150 m underground. It owes its excellent quality to the rock formations at Mount Anthemounta which consist of semi-metamorphic, metamorphic and igneous rocks. Water flowing in the substrate is slow-moving and as it passes through the various rocks it is filtered and enriched with beneficial elements giving it its unique mineral composition and distinctive taste. Water in the spring is cold at a steady temperature of around 16 °C. Its special features are a high magnesium content with the ideal calcium to magnesium ratio and a low sodium and <b>nitrate</b> <b>content.</b> It also contains potassium and fluorine as well as valuable trace elements such as iron, copper, manganese, lithium, selenium, chromium and zinc. It has exceptional taste and is very pleasant to drink, assists in the functioning of the digestive and urinary systems and it has several other health benefits. One liter of Souroti water meets 1/4 of the body's daily needs in calcium and magnesium. All this makes it different from soda water, which is ordinary potable water to which sodium bicarbonate has been added so that it acquires approximately the same properties as natural mineral water.|$|E
40|$|A code of good {{practices}} {{was established by}} each European member state according to the nitrate directive. In Belgium, the nitrogen (N) inputs from slurry or compost are limited to 230 kg N/ha in pastures. Larger amounts can be applied when a program of additional measurements, including soil nitrates analysis, {{is followed by the}} farmer. This trial aims to measure nitrogen balance and soil nitrates in pastures fertilised with mineral nitrogen fertiliser (min N), pig slurry (S) or cattle compost (C). The pastures were grazed by dairy cows and the fertilisation allowed similar efficient N levels. N inputs by fertilisation were different at 169, 170 and 102 kg N/ha in C, S and min N plots respectively. The use of pig slurry and cattle compost as compared with mineral N fertiliser increased N balance and reduced apparent N efficiency. The nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus nutrition indexes, the number of grazing days and the milk yields per ha were not different. The soil <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> were not increased by use of slurry or compost. The overall low <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> suggested a low nitrate leaching with the three types of fertilisation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} the {{agricultural}} policy during 1950 - 1980, which aimed at increasing production levels, inputs of fertiliser and purchased fodder increased considerably, resulting in higher milk production levels per hectare and per cow on Dutch dairy farms. This intensification of the dairy farming system resulted in a nitrogen soil surplus of 400 kg/ha and a phosphate surplus of 82 kg/ha on average on dairy farms in 1985, which led to high <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents</b> in the water leaving the root zone, especially in the Sand region...|$|R

The {{examinations}} {{were aimed}} at determining the dependence between form and rate of applied nitrogen fertilizer vs. yield and chemical composition of leaves of Swiss chard cultivated in greenhouse in spring. Nitrogen was applied in a form of urea, potas-sium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate at three amounts: 0. 2; 0. 4; 0. 6 g N·dm- 3 of substrate. Following items were assessed: yield, nutrients contents, as well as chemical analyses of substrate after plant harvest were made. Increase of nitrogen rate in objects with potas-sium nitrate and ammonium nitrate resulted in the decrease of fresh matter yield, while in objects with urea, the yield remained at constant level. The highest yield of above ground parts (356 g·plant- 1) was achieved by fertilizing the plants with the lowest nitrogen rate (as ammonium <b>nitrate).</b> <b>Contents</b> of <b>nitrates</b> in leaf dry matter was {{within the range of}} 0. 59 – 1. 27 % depending on nitrogen rate and form. The highest nitrate levels were found when potassium nitrate was applied as fertilizer, whereas the lowest – when applying ammonium nitrate; however, regardless the fertilizer type, higher rates caused the increase of <b>nitrate</b> <b>contents.</b> Studies revealed that at increasing nitrogen concentration in a sub...|$|R
