5|$|In 1831, Morehead {{was also}} a {{delegate}} to the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Party Convention in Baltimore, Maryland that nominated Henry Clay for president. During the convention, he was nominated {{for the office of}} lieutenant governor. Though his <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> running mate, Richard A. Buckner, was defeated by Democrat John Breathitt, Morehead was elected the ninth Lieutenant Governor.|$|E
5|$|Although many Old Court supporters—typically the state's wealthy aristocracy—gravitated to the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Party (later to {{be called}} Whigs) that formed in the 1820s, it is {{inaccurate}} to assume the Anti-Relief Party as a whole became National Republicans and the Relief Party became Democrats. The primary factor in determining which party Kentuckians aligned with was their faith in Whig Party founder and native son, Henry Clay. From the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828 to the expiration of John L. Helm's term in 1851, only one Democrat held the office of governor: John Breathitt, who died {{a year and a}} half into his term and was succeeded in office by his lieutenant governor, James Turner Morehead, a <b>National</b> <b>Republican.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} {{political}} career, Crittenden {{served in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives and was chosen as speaker on several occasions. With {{the advent of the}} Second Party System, he allied with the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> (later Whig) Party and was a fervent supporter of Henry Clay and opponent of Democrats Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren.|$|E

5|$|James Turner Morehead (May 24, 1797 – December 28, 1854) was a United States Senator and the 12th Governor of Kentucky. He was {{the first}} {{native-born}} Kentuckian to hold the governorship of the state. A member of Henry Clay's <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, Morehead entered politics just as his party was beginning to challenge the Democratic Party's dominance in the state.|$|E
5|$|The RNC spent $100,000 on Tedisco's behalf. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $150,000 and the Service Employees International Union spent $315,000 for Murphy.

5|$|Breathitt {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Logan County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1811, and was re-elected every year until 1815. In the gubernatorial election of 1828, the Democrats chose William T. Barry as their candidate for governor. Initially, they offered the nomination for lieutenant governor to Judge John P. Oldham, but Oldham declined, and Breathitt was chosen as his replacement. Barry lost the governorship to <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Thomas Metcalfe, but Breathitt defeated Metcalfe's running mate Joseph R. Underwood by more than 1,000 votes.|$|E
50|$|On a {{very short}} {{timetable}} between its formation, nomination of candidates, and the fall election, the candidates of the Working Men's Party performed acceptably well in a three-way race with the Democratic Party dominated by Tammany Hall and the <b>National</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Final results showed the Tammany Democrats winning 8 of 11 contested legislative seats, the <b>National</b> <b>Republicans</b> winning 2, and one candidate of the Working Men's Party emerging victorious — Ebenezer Ford, President of the Journeymen Carpenters Society.|$|R
2500|$|Jackson's {{policies}} united his enemies, including southerners, Antimasons, and <b>National</b> <b>Republicans.</b> In an 1834 speech criticizing Jackson, Clay compared Jackson's {{opposition to}} the Whigs, a British political party opposed to absolute monarchy. Jackson's opponents took on the name [...] "Whig," [...] which {{proved to be a}} more unifying term than [...] "National Republican" [...] had, as the latter term was too closely associated with northern business interests. The Whig Party thus succeeded the <b>National</b> <b>Republicans</b> as the principal opposition party to the Democrats.|$|R

5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> nominee for governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E
5|$|Governor Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} on February 21, 1834, and Morehead {{was sworn in}} as governor the following day. The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats, but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much to allay their fears.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky's {{politicians}} became divided between the Democrats and the National Republicans. Crittenden's alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him squarely in the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. Because of Crittenden's support of his presidential bid, President Adams appointed him United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian Robert Trimble as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but Jackson supporters in the Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson's financial policies.|$|E

5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley {{was born}} on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter's Street, Bethnal Green in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake. William Bottomley's {{background}} is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family of well-known radical agitators—her brother George Jacob Holyoake was {{a founder of the}} Secularist movement and in later life a leading figure in the growth of Co-operative societies. Among Holyoake's close associates was Charles Bradlaugh, who founded the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> League and became a controversial Member of Parliament. A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{was active}} in {{organizing}} the Whig Party from {{the remnants of the}} defunct <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Party in 1834. On July 4, 1834, he called to order the party's first organizational meeting in the state at Cove Spring, Kentucky. He was chosen as chair of the committee on resolutions and in a speech on July 5, bitterly condemned President Jackson. Later in 1834, Kentucky governor James T. Morehead appointed Crittenden Secretary of State. In the August elections, Whigs won a majority in both houses of the General Assembly. When the Assembly convened, they elected Crittenden to the U.S. Senate over Democrat James Guthrie by a vote of 94–40.|$|E

5|$|Each {{candidate}} {{aimed to}} discredit the other by pointing out his opponent's flaws or mistakes. Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure {{to pay taxes on}} a start-up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in <b>national</b> <b>Republican</b> polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|Metcalfe {{resigned}} {{his seat}} in the House on June 1, 1828 in order {{to run for the}} governorship of Kentucky. He was chosen as the candidate of the <b>National</b> <b>Republican</b> Party at their nominating convention and was the first gubernatorial candidate in the state to be chosen using this method. He defeated William T. Barry by a margin of 709 votes, but his running mate, Joseph R. Underwood, was badly defeated by the Democratic-Republican nominee, John Breathitt. Metcalfe's election in 1828 marked the first time the governorship had been won by a candidate who was not a Democratic-Republican. However, only one Democratic-Republican would hold the office between Metcalfe's term and the election of Lazarus W. Powell in 1851.|$|E
50|$|At this time, {{there were}} three {{political}} parties: the Jacksonians (supporting President Andrew Jackson; led by U.S. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren), the Anti-Masons, and the <b>National</b> <b>Republicans</b> (supporting Henry Clay for the presidency).|$|R
