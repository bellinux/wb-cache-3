5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
25|$|To {{provide more}} {{protection}} {{to the head}} against impact, to secure the airway, and to permit easy communication with the surface and between divers, a rigid metal or fibre-reinforced plastic diving helmet may be worn with the dry suit. This can be separate from the dry suit with its own watertight neck seal, {{or it can be}} clamped onto a <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> attached to the suit, so that air can flow between the helmet and the suit.|$|E
25|$|Waterwear of Newport Beach, California, {{produced}} the natural gum-rubber Seal suit for US Divers from 1953 or earlier. Several versions were available, including one piece and two piece suits. The one piece suits were available with long or short legs and sleeves, and with front, neck or back entry. Neck entry suits were sealed by overlapping the neck opening and the hood over a grooved <b>neck</b> <b>ring,</b> and clamping {{with a large}} elastic O-ring. The two piece suit shirt and pants were also available separately and could be sealed together at the waist by a system similar to the neck entry suit.|$|E
50|$|The {{young males}} can be {{identified}} {{as soon as they}} display one (or more) pitch-black feathers of their <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> and/or one (or more) pink feathers of their nape bands. Often, the young males develop their <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> and nape bands in two or sometimes three successive moulting seasons. Adult parakeets with neither pitch-black feathers in their <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> nor pink feathers in their nape bands are usually females.|$|R
50|$|<b>Neck</b> <b>rings,</b> or neck-rings, are {{any form}} of stiff {{jewellery}} worn as an ornament {{around the neck of}} an individual, as opposed to a loose necklace. Many cultures and periods have made <b>neck</b> <b>rings,</b> with both males and females wearing them at various times.|$|R
5000|$|The South Ndebele {{peoples of}} Africa also wear <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> {{as part of}} their {{traditional}} dress and as a sign of wealth and status. Only married women are allowed to wear the rings, called dzilla. Metal rings are also worn on different parts of the body, not just the <b>neck.</b> The <b>rings</b> are usually made of copper or brass. Although it can vary from person to person whether the removal of <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> can cause pain, if they are removed incorrectly this may result in death. The custom requires that the girls who do choose to wear the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> start before puberty {{in order to get the}} body used to them. These heavy coils can weigh as much as 11 pounds (before puberty, as they will add more rings later down the line.) The <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> put a huge strain on the body. Once a persons  neck has adjusted to the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> they have to leave the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> on permanently. Because the rings have been on these women for such a long time, this weakens the neck muscles causing the neck to essentially not being able to support itself. The neck muscles will tire quickly  and not be able to carry the weight of the head in other words; when the neck is no longer able to fulfill its function it is very likely that it will collapse, thus resulting in suffocation.|$|R
2500|$|Padaung {{women in}} Myanmar place large golden rings around their necks. From {{as early as}} five years old, girls are {{introduced}} to their first <b>neck</b> <b>ring.</b> Over the years, more rings are added. In addition to the twenty-plus pounds of rings on her neck, a woman will also wear just as many rings on her calves. [...] At their extent, some necks modified like this can reach [...] long. [...] The practice has health impacts and has in recent years declined from cultural norm to tourist curiosity. [...] Tribes related to the Paduang, {{as well as other}} cultures throughout the world, use jewellery to stretch their earlobes or enlarge ear piercings. [...] In the Americas, labrets have been worn since before first contact by Innu and First Nations peoples of the northwest coast. Lip plates are worn by the African Mursi and Sara people, as well as some South American peoples.|$|E

50|$|One of the torcs is {{a smaller}} {{bracelet}} decorated with ornament {{in the style}} of Celtic art, and the other three are <b>neck</b> <b>rings.</b> The bracelet and one of the <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> are made with twisted gold wire, and the other <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> have finials shaped like trumpets. One of the latter has been broken into two pieces. The gold content of the four torcs has been measured using x-ray fluorescence to be between 74-78% (roughly equivalent to 17-18 carat), with 18-22% silver, some copper, and traces of iron, mercury and tin - a mix consistent with other Iron Age gold finds in Europe. The weight of the pieces varies from 31 g to 230 g, and over 350 g in total.|$|R

50|$|The Aleutian cackling goose has {{the typical}} black head and neck, white cheek patches, grayish brown back and wings, white rump, black tail feathers, legs, and {{feet of the}} species. It is {{distinguished}} by a conspicuous white <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the base of}} the neck that, in adult plumage, is usually greater than 10 mm wide and is subtended by a ring of darker feathers. The cheek patches are usually separated by a black line under the throat and the breast is a pale grayish-brown color, although a small number of lighter and darker breasted birds occur. The westernmost population did not appreciably differ in color, except that the <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> was always very wide and white in the few attested specimens.|$|E

50|$|The {{custom of}} wearing <b>neck</b> <b>rings</b> {{is related to}} an ideal of beauty: an {{elongated}} <b>neck.</b> <b>Neck</b> <b>rings</b> push the clavicle and ribs down. The neck stretching is mostly illusory: {{the weight of the}} rings twists the collarbone and eventually the upper ribs at an angle 45 degrees lower than what is natural, causing the illusion of an elongated neck. The vertebrae do not elongate, though the space between them may increase as the intervertebral discs absorb liquid.|$|R
50|$|A related brace is the Boston brace (underarm brace, {{also known}} as a thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis, or TLSO), which is more {{commonly}} used for scoliosis. That brace does not have a <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> and is more easily concealed under clothing, thus more acceptable to patients. However, it is not suitable for high thoracic or cervical spinal curvatures.|$|E
50|$|Many {{everyday}} {{objects were}} placed into the wetlands during this period, {{in some cases}} as single finds and in others of assemblages containing {{a variety of different}} form of artifact.

50|$|The green {{pheasant}} (P. versicolor) is very similar, and hybridization {{often makes}} {{the identity of}} individual birds difficult to determine. Green pheasant males on average have a shorter tail than the common pheasant and have darker plumage that is uniformly bottle-green on the breast and belly; they always lack a <b>neck</b> <b>ring.</b> Green pheasant females are darker, with many black dots on the breast and belly.|$|E
50|$|Commencing with a cameo {{appearance}} in the Doctor Who serial The Five Doctors (1983), Mark III Dalek variants seen during this decade feature a neck bin raised so that a strip of it is visible between the lower <b>neck</b> <b>ring</b> {{and the top of}} the shoulders.
