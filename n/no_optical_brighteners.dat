The presence of organochlorine residues in the pulp reduced the effectiveness of the <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners.</b> Therefore, bleaching sequences that use low chlorine dioxide charge favors for greater gains in whiteness with the application of <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners.</b> The replacement of the final chlorine dioxide bleaching stage with a hydrogen peroxide one in the sequence increased the efficiency of the optical brightening agents...|$|R

Application of the <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> Tinopal CBS increased reflectance of leaf surfaces, particularly in the region 420 - 470 nm. In glasshouse trials, foliar applications of 5 % solutions reduced growth of maize by about 25 %, while 1 % solutions reduced growth of barley by about 30 - 40 %.

40|$|In {{integrated}} factories of {{pulp and}} paper, the bleaching control {{is made by}} kappa number and/or brightness. However, the product paper is evaluated and valued for its whiteness. The level of final brightness of pulp certainly affects the demand for <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> in paper manufacturing, nevertheless, {{there is not a}} direct correlation between consump tion of <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> and final brightness, being the method of bleaching pulp, especially from the final stage of bleaching, also important in relation to this demand. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of using the parameter whiteness as a tool to control bleaching pulp, instead of the traditional brightness and evaluate the impacts of different methods of bleaching and the pulp final brightness level in action of <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners,</b> to improve their per formance. It was observed that the whiteness and brightness of the pulp are highly correlated and that the control of the bleaching plant can be done by any one of these two parameters. It was also concluded that, considering current prices of bleaching reagents and of <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners,</b> it is better to bleach the pulp up to lower brightness values (e. g. 88 % ISO) and use larger amounts of <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> to brighten the mass until the whiteness of 130 CIE.

These compounds are being extensively tested for control of forest-feeding lepidopterous insects in North America; <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> may thus become a common ingredient in commercial baculovirus formulations in the near future. Many flower species use UV signals to attract insects and to direct them to the nectaries. We examined a possible consequence of field applications of optical brighteners: their effects {{on the ability of}} pollinators to find and handle flowers. In field studies carried out in Mexico and the United Kingdom on three different flower species, application of dilute (0. 1 % or 1 %) concentrations of the <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> Tinopal CBS reduced recruitment of bees to flowers. Bees that approached flowers were less likely to land and feed on flowers treated with Tinopal than on controls. On one plant species, Trifolium repens, the time taken for bees to handle inflorescences was longer following applications of Tinopal. It seems that this <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> may both reduce recruitment of insects to flowers and interfere with their ability to locate rewards. Field-scale applications could reduce pollination of crops, weeds, and wildflowers and adversely affect bee populations. These possibilities should be examined in more detail before widespread applications of these compounds to the environment are made. (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|R

In contrast to other studies, the mean time to death of larvae exposed to virus and Tinopal LPW was significantly extended compared to larvae inoculated with virus alone. Analysis of the results of eight independent field trials in Mexico and Honduras revealed a significant positive relationship between log virus dose and percentage mortality observed in S. frugiperda larvae. Virus-induced mortality was approximately 50 % at the highest application rate tested: 1000 larval equivalents (LE) of virus/ha. When the impact of parasitism was taken into account, larval mortality increased to 45. 0 – 90. 7 % in plots treated with virus at 250 LE/ha or more.
