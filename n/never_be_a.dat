5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves. He never gave {{his reasons for}} the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> full citizen of Leuven; Catholic {{intolerance}} of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; {{there was to be}} a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; over the years to come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{examiner}} Blythe (Wendy Hughes) {{leaves her}} visiting son Danny (Stivi Paskoski) {{with her boyfriend}} Bolander (Ned Beatty) for the day, with the hopes they will {{get to know each}} other better. Danny rides along with Bolander and Munch (Richard Belzer) on their murder investigations, but acts very wild and constantly asks inappropriate questions. At dinner later, Danny asks Bolander about his sex life with Danny's mother, making Bolander extremely uncomfortable. Bolander later tells Blythe he believes her son is crazy. Meanwhile, Crosetti (Jon Polito) spends a lot of time with his friend Officer Chris Thormann (Lee Tergesen), who is recovering from a recent shooting that has left him blind. At one point, Thormann defecates on himself and is humiliated, but Crosetti helps him clean up. Thormann's wife, Eva (Edie Falco), tells Crosetti she is pregnant, but that her husband reacted angrily to the news. Thormann tells Crosetti he should have died at the hospital and can <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good father, but Crosetti encourages him.|$|E
5|$|Mei Lanfang, one of {{the most}} famous Dan {{performers}} of all time, was also {{one of the}} greatest popularizers of Peking opera abroad. During the 1920s, he performed Peking opera in Japan. This inspired an American tour in February 1930. Although some, such as the actor Otis Skinner, believed that Peking opera could <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> success in the United States, the favorable reception of Mei and his troupe in New York City disproved this notion. The performances had to be relocated from the 49th Street Theater to the larger National Theater, and the duration of the tour extended from two weeks to five. Mei traveled across the United States, receiving honorary degrees from the University of California and Pomona College. He followed this tour with a tour in the Soviet Union in 1935.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear {{power and}} mankind cannot coexist. We {{survivors}} {{of the atomic bomb}} have said this all along.

25|$|One week later, the Rump, {{sitting in}} the House of Commons, passed a bill abolishing the monarchy. Ardent Royalists refused to accept it {{on the basis that}} there could <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> vacancy of the Crown. Others refused because, as the bill had not passed the House of Lords and did not have Royal Assent, it could not become an Act of Parliament.|$|E

25|$|In March 1938, Siegel and Shuster {{sold all}} {{rights to the}} {{character}} to Detective Comics, Inc. for $130 (ten dollars per page, the equivalent of $ when adjusted for inflation). It was the company's policy to buy the full rights to the characters it published.

25|$|From {{the very}} {{earliest}} years {{there were problems}} with seepage of water, {{with a number of}} floods, especially in the later years of the 18th century, caused by the surrounding branches of the River Poddle – even in the 20th century, it is reported that the water table was within 2.3 metres (7.5feet) of the floor.

25|$|The Harold R Henderson Pavilion is {{the latest}} stand to be built. It was {{constructed}} in the late '60s following the club's disastrous move to the Coburg City Oval. Led by Allen Aylett and Harold R. Henderson, a committee was formed that aimed to redevelop the ground so that there would <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> repeat of the club's relocation to Coburg. Along with new administration facilities, a new first rate social club was built that became the envy of other VFL clubs during the 70s.|$|E
25|$|However, {{just as the}} {{librarian}} cannot go wrong with the first master catalogue, he is doomed to fail with the second. When {{it comes to the}} 'Catalogue of all catalogues that don't list themselves', {{the librarian}} cannot include it in its own listing, because then it would include itself, and so belongs to the other catalogue, that of catalogues that do include themselves. However, if the librarian leaves it out, the catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves.|$|E
25|$|Progressive {{revelation is}} a core {{teaching}} in the Bahá'í Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time {{through a series of}} divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance. Thus, the Bahá'í teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the most recent (though not the last—that there will <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.|$|E

25|$|Later in Tasmania, Close {{was ordered}} to play despite doctor's advice to rest, and {{as he tried to}} nurse his injury he {{acquired}} a reputation for malingering and insubordination. He was made to play in six of the next seven games. When England won a Test match in Australia {{for the first time in}} 13years in the final Test, Close was not present. Nowadays, someone in Close's position would be carefully man-managed, and looked after by captain and team manager. But times were different then, and the Yorkshire stalwarts were proved right: he had been picked too early, and would <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> regular Test player.|$|E
25|$|Dredd {{visits the}} chief judge's {{underground}} bunker, where Chief Judge Volt is still brooding {{over his own}} perceived shortcomings as a leader, blaming himself for failing to prevent the outbreak {{of war in the}} first place, and contemplating resignation or suicide. On his way to the chief judge's office, Dredd meets DeMarco in the bunker's medical wing, where he invites her to apply to rejoin Justice Department, as there will <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better time. However she refuses, as she does not agree with the Department's mandatory code of celibacy. Dredd again tells her that there is no prospect of any romantic relationship between them, and with this further rejection of her, DeMarco's love for him finally dies.|$|E
25|$|Most {{recreational}} and professional diver training organisations would consider relying on buddy breathing {{from a single}} regulator as an unacceptable risk, {{as the use of}} a secondary demand valve (octopus) or second regulator, either from an alternative scuba cylinder, or from the primary scuba set, is a far more reliable and safe method of supplying emergency air to a diver who is part of a planned team or buddy dive, and a solo diver should carry his/her own emergency gas supply. There should <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> situation on a well planned and executed dive where two divers need to share a single demand valve, but the technique is still considered useful by some diving schools as it teaches control and hones skills under difficult circumstances.|$|E
