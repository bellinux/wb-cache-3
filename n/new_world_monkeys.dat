5|$|HIV-1 {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIV(cpz) endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire). <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.|$|E
5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of {{locomotor}} behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although {{they may have been}} quadrupedal runners like small <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E

5|$|Like <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys,</b> strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.|$|E
5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E
5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines, more closely {{resembling}} <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> in appearance, {{although it was}} larger—possibly {{the size of a}} gibbon. Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its sagittal crest (ridge of bone running lengthwise down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen was a male. These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines. Propliopithecoids, the oldest stem group of catarrhines, which date back 35 to 30mya, lacked a fully developed ectotympanic.|$|E

5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys,</b> particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} still much debate about the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting founder effect and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that whereas claws are useful on large-diameter branches, wide fingertips with nails and epidermal ridges were required for habitual locomotion on small-diameter branches.

25|$|Apes, in turn, {{belong to}} the primate order (>400 species), along with the Old World monkeys, the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys,</b> and others. Data from both {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) indicate that primates {{belong to the}} group of Euarchontoglires, together with Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Dermoptera, and Scandentia. This is further supported by Alu-like short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) which have been found only in members of the Euarchontoglires.|$|E
25|$|Didelphimorphs have a {{plantigrade}} stance (feet {{flat on the}} ground) and the hind feet have an opposable digit with no claw. Like some <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys,</b> opossums have prehensile tails. Like all marsupials, the fur {{consists of}} awn hair only, and the females have a pouch.

25|$|In most Catarrhini (Old World {{monkeys and}} apes—primates {{closely related to}} humans) there are three types of color receptors (known as cone cells), {{resulting}} in trichromatic color vision. These primates, like humans, are known as trichromats. Many other primates (including <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys)</b> and other mammals are dichromats, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals may {{have little or no}} color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.|$|E

25|$|However, {{even among}} primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, {{including}} monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{may or may}} not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats. Visual sensitivity differences between males and females in a single species is due to the gene for yellow-green sensitive opsin protein (which confers ability to differentiate red from green) residing on the X sex chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} suggests that polyandry is the dominant social structure in the Callitrichidae subfamily of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The Callitrichidae family includes marmosets and tamarins, two groups of small <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> found in South America. Wild groups usually consist of three to ten individuals, with one reproductively active female, one or more reproductive males, and several nonreproductive helpers that can be either male or female. Interestingly, cooperative polyandry {{is not the only}} mating system found in these primates. Polyandrous, monogamous, and polygynous groups can be found within the same population, and a group can even change mating systems, making it the most flexible mating system of any non-human primate. Unlike most primates who typically give birth to single young, twins are the average litter size for tamarins and marmosets. The entire group participates in raising the offspring, sharing the responsibilities of infant carrying, feeding, and grooming. The presence of nonreproductive helpers appears {{to be the most important}} factor in determining which mating system is used, as ecological and environmental variability have not been found to have a significant impact. Goldizen (1987) proposed the hypothesis that monogamy in Callitrichidae should develop only in groups with nonreproductive helpers to help raise the young, and in the absence of these helpers, both polyandrous males and females would have higher reproductive success than those in lone monogamous pairs. Indeed, in studies of Saguinus fuscicollis, common name saddle-back tamarin, no monogamous lone pairs have ever been seen to attempt a breeding cycle.|$|E
25|$|Larger mammals include {{carnivores}} pumas, jaguars, ocelots, rare bush dogs, and foxes, and herbivores peccaries, tapirs, anteaters, sloths, opossums, and armadillos. Deer {{are plentiful}} in the south, and {{many species of}} <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{are found in the}} northern rain forests. Concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues. Brazil's Amazon Basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species, including the red-bellied piranha. Despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger. Biodiversity can contribute to agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chickens, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.|$|E
