5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, {{especially since he}} is not financially well off. Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for her marriage to Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>country.</b> Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, {{who had come to}} see her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a gounder custom). Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter for choosing Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.|$|E

Bintang Plaza and Boulevard Shopping Mall are the two major shopping destinations for Brunei people.

5|$|Stephen's father, King Thomas, {{had great}} ambitions for him. An attempt {{to expand into}} Croatia proper by marrying Stephen to a wealthy widow failed, and {{negotiations}} for a marital alliance with the Sforzas of Milan were abandoned when a more prestigious opportunity presented itself: marriage to the heiress Maria of Serbia in April 1459 made Stephen the ruler of {{the remnants of the}} <b>neighbouring</b> <b>country.</b> The intent was to unite the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Serbian Despotate under Stephen to combat the expanding Ottoman Empire. Stephen's Catholicism made him unpopular in Orthodox Serbia. After ruling it for merely two months, however, Stephen surrendered it to the encroaching Ottoman forces and fled back to his father's court, which earned him the contempt of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus and other Christian rulers in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Singapore {{once had}} a burgeoning pork industry, which used to yield S$300,000,000 annually. By 1985, {{there were at least}} 520 pig farms {{situated}} within the island-state, {{to keep up with the}} citizens' demand for fresh pork. Most of the consumers were of Chinese ethnicity. However, Singapore's status as a land-scarce nation could not allow for the sheer number of pig farms and thus in mid-1984 the government began closing down or relocating these farms. Stricter sanitation guidelines were also imposed on the farm owners. By 1990, the number of pig farms in Singapore had already been reduced to 22, with <b>neighbouring</b> <b>country</b> Indonesia supplying the majority of the country's fresh pork. To minimise reliance on overseas imports of fresh pork, the government decided to promote an alternative – frozen pork.|$|E
25|$|Saudi Arabia is {{bounded by}} seven {{countries}} and three bodies of water. To the west, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea form a coastal border of almost 1,800 kilometres that {{extends to the}} southern part of Yemen and follows a mountain ridge for approximately 320 kilometres to the vicinity of Najran. This section of the border with Yemen was demarcated in 1934 {{and is one of the}} few clearly defined borders with a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>country.</b> The Saudi border running southeast from Najran, however, is still undetermined. The undemarcated border became an issue in the early 1990s, when oil was discovered in the area and Saudi Arabia objected to the commercial exploration by foreign companies on behalf of Yemen. In the summer whats up of 1992, representatives of Saudi Arabia and Yemen met in Geneva to discuss settlement of the border issue.|$|E
25|$|Candidates {{apply to}} the Khalifa bin Zayed Air College, which {{is located at the}} Al Ain International Airport in Al Ain. They first go through a {{rigorous}} schedule of academics (Basic Level: Military Sciences), fitness and officer training. Those who are selected as cadets then start the second phase of academics: Flight Sciences (Aeronautical Science). Cadets who pass the assessment period of the second phase are designated aviation cadets and start flight training. The first aircraft cadets get to fly is the Grob G115 TA. Those who qualify then go on to fly the Pilatus PC-7. On this aircraft, they learn the basics of flying, take-off and landing techniques and procedures followed by a bit of aerobatics. Following the Primary Flying Course is the Basic Flight Course, piloting the Hawk 63. Graduates are graded and assigned accordingly to one of three options: the Advanced Strike course at Minhad on the Hawk 102 aircraft, transport aircraft, and helicopters. At Minhad, the new pilots learn Basic Fighters Manoeuvres, drop bombs and learn to fly cross-country to a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>country,</b> commonly Bahrain or Kuwait. Upon completion of the Advanced Strike course, officers are selected either for the F-16 (Block 60) or the Dassault Mirage 2000-9, both at Al Dhafra AB. A few pilots are selected to learn to fly the F-16 with the United States Air Force's 162d Fighter Wing in Tucson, Arizona.|$|E

The English landed at Calais in May 1383 and proceeded to attack Gravelines, which was {{in the hands of the}} French. Gravelines, Dunkirk and the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>country</b> (including the towns of Bourbourg, Bergues, Poperinghe, and Nieuport) soon fell. On 25 May the crusaders put to flight a Franco-Flemish army, under the command of the Count of Flanders, in a pitched battle fought near Dunkirk. Despenser was then persuaded by his followers to attempt to besiege Ypres, which was to prove to be the turning point of the crusade. He was unwilling to attack the city but his Gantois allies and some of his officers insisted that Ypres should be taken.|$|E
500|$|Ponnar and Shankar, {{believed}} to be Chera chieftains, were rulers of the Ponni valanadu (now in the Tiruchirappalli area), in medieval Tamil Nadu. They {{were said to be}} in good terms with the Madurai ruler, Vijaya Renga Chokkanathar (1706 - 1732 A. D), who was their contemporary. The legendary folk tale of these brothers, also known as Annamar Swamigal, has been passed down through many generations by means of village songs (known as Gramiya Padalgal) and traditional street theatre, known as Therukkoothu. Absence of reliable written historical records makes it difficult to ascertain the credibility of any of the above claims, along with the widely held legend which was popularised by a late 1980s M Karunanidhi's novel on the subject. According to the legend, the brothers were born to Periyakaralanaka Mannudaiyak Kounden and Thamaraiyal of Manamadurai, belonging to the Kongu Vellalar community. They had attained the kingdom with help from the then king of Urayur, which was the capital of early Cholas. Thalaiyur Kali, a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>country</b> king belonging to the rival Vettuva Gounder caste, hatched a conspiracy against the brothers which led to a war and the subsequent death of Shankar who was tricked into proving his innocence by falling over a sword. Grieving the loss of his brother, Ponnar entered the battlefield, killing Kali Mannan, before proceeding to kill himself [...] The brothers were then brought to life by their sister Arukaani with help from the Goddess Periyakandiamman. The brothers, however, were told by the Gods that their earthly duties were over which led to their leaving the mortal world. Arukaani followed suit by throwing herself along with her royal ornaments into a well in Valanadu, a village in Trichy.|$|E
