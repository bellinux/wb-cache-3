5|$|In December, Hitler {{ordered his}} final, desperate {{attack in the}} west - through the snow-covered forests of the Ardennes. Poor weather kept the promised air support grounded, but early {{on the morning of}} New Year's Day, long after it was tactically useful or relevant, the Luftwaffe {{launched}} Operation Bodenplatte ('Baseplate') - <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> devastating strategic bombers, but on the frontline fighter airbases.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's next {{fight was}} <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> new UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, Rashad Evans, as the pre-fight reports suggested. UFC President Dana White {{indicated}} that the original plan was for Jackson to receive an immediate title shot, but Evans requested time off to recover from injuries he sustained from his fight against Forrest Griffin. Instead, Jackson faced Keith Jardine at UFC 96, and was victorious by unanimous decision. He was then scheduled to face Rashad Evans at UFC 98, but it was later revealed on March 11, 2009 that Jackson needed surgery to repair torn ligaments in his jaw, effectively cancelling the bout against Evans.|$|E
5|$|The League soon sent envoys to its neighbors, Stefan I Crnojević and Đurađ Branković. Branković, a lord of Serbian Despotate, who {{was also}} in dispute with Venice over the Principality of Zeta, {{expressed}} his willingness to help Skanderbeg against the Republic but <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire. The Venetians sent an ambassador to Skanderbeg offering him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims to Dagnum in return that the Albanians would protect the country and keep the roads free from violence. Skanderbeg, however, {{refused to accept the}} offer and hostilities continued. Alongside the Spani family, the Dushmani family was against the war with Venice and did not participate in it.|$|E

5|$|In 194950, {{none of the}} Harveys played {{together}} at first-class level; Merv had retired, Mick had moved to Queensland looking for more opportunities, while Neil was in South Africa with the Australian team. Ray and Mick played in one match each for the season, but <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> other. In 1950-51, Ray was selected in two matches for Victoria, both when Neil and the other Test players were competing against England. Both of these were against Tasmania, so he did not meet Mick. However, there were no international fixtures coinciding with Victoria’s two matches with Queensland, and Neil met Mick {{in both of these}} matches. In 1951-52, Ray was able to gain selection more regularly for Victoria. All of these came when Neil and the other Test players were playing for Australia; when they available for Victoria, Ray was not selected. Ray played in both of Victoria's matches against Queensland, for whom Mick played in the first match.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Byrne's early life beyond {{the fact that he}} was born in Ireland in 1806. His first fight, in 1825, was a loss to Mike Larking; it lasted 138 rounds spread over two and a half hours—despite the fact that at this time a round could vary in length, and usually only ended when a man was knocked down. His second fight was a draw against Jack Manning in 1826, earning Byrne £100. Next was Byrne's first match against the Scottish boxer Alexander McKay, which Byrne won easily in five rounds, earning him a further £100. This match was McKay's first ever prize-fight. This victory was soon {{followed}} by a win against Bob Avery, earning a further £50, then another win over Phil Samson in 1829, earning him £200. By the standards of the day these latter sums were enormous; it is therefore surprising that he was then offered £200 for a rematch, regardless of whether he won or <b>not,</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> less experienced McKay, whom he had beaten so easily on the first occasion. As of 2008 that would be the equivalent of about £13,600.|$|E

25|$|White took {{a middle}} {{course on the}} issue of the death penalty: he was one of five justices who voted in Furman v.

The Furman decision ended capital punishment in the U.S. until 1977, when Gary Gilmore, who decided not to appeal his death sentence, was executed by firing squad. White, however, was <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> death penalty in all forms: he voted to uphold the death penalty statutes at issue in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), even the mandatory death penalty schemes struck down by the Court.|$|E

25|$|Attlee {{opposed the}} 1926 General Strike, believing that strike action {{should not be}} used as a {{political}} weapon. However, when it happened, he did not attempt to undermine it. At the time of the strike, he was chairman of the Stepney Borough Electricity Committee. He negotiated a deal with the Electrical Trade Union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. One firm, Scammell and Nephew Ltd, took a civil action against Attlee and the other Labour members of the committee (although <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Conservative members who had also supported this). The court found against Attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay £300 damages. The decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced Attlee out of politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{preparations}} {{were left}} {{in the hands of}} Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas. While he delegated specific tasks, the grand plan was kept secret even from the First Seimas or Ministry of Foreign Affairs and thus very few Lithuanians understood the full role of the government in the revolt. Thus the main credit for organization of the revolt is sometimes given to Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius, Chairman of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, which provided the manpower. Galvanauskas planned to present the revolt as a genuine uprising of the local population against its German Directorate and <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> French or Allied administration. Such plan was designed to direct Allied protests away from the Lithuanian government and to exploit anti-German sentiment in Europe. Galvanauskas was careful to hide any links between the rebels and the Lithuanian government so that if the revolt failed he could blame the Riflemen and the rebels absolving the government of any responsibility. Galvanauskas warned that all those involved could be subject to criminal persecutions if it was necessary for Lithuania's prestige.|$|E
25|$|On the 14 and 16 July the Soviet Fleets landed more {{forces behind}} Dietl. LG 1's Ju 87s were shifted back {{to support the}} Mountain Corps. On 20 July the Soviet {{destroyer}} Stremitelnyy was sunk along with the patrol ship SKR-20/Shtil in the Kola Bay by LG 1. Just days later it was moved back to support the offensive at Salla. The unit was treated like a fire-brigade, rushing from one hot spot to another. IV(St)./LG 1's Ju 87s suffered {{more than any other}} Stuka unit in 1941, lsoing 25 of its 36 aircraft. Badly depleted, it could not support a breakthrough to isolate the Kola Peninsula, nor could it support the capture of Murmansk by Dietl. The advance halted 64 kilometres short of the Kirov railway, and three years of positional warfare set in. It did succeed in relieving pressure on the Mountain troops in the far north, when it was able to appear in strength. The greatest success of the Axis in the north came <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Soviets, but the British Royal Air Force (RAF).|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{achievement of}} Marie Antoinette {{in that period}} was {{the establishment of an}} alliance with Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, the most important lawmaker in the assembly. Like La Fayette, Mirabeau was a liberal aristocrat. He had joined the Third Estate and was <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> monarchy, but wanted to reconcile it with the Revolution. He also wanted to be a minister and was not immune to corruption. On the advice of Mercy, Marie Antoinette opened secret negotiations with him and both agreed to meet privately at the château of Saint-Cloud on 3 July 1790, where the royal family was allowed to spend the summer, free of the radical elements who watched their every move in Paris. At the meeting, Mirabeau was much impressed by the queen, and remarked in a letter to Auguste Marie Raymond d'Arenberg, comte de La Marck, that she was the only man the king had by him: La reine est le seul homme que le roi ait auprès de lui. An agreement was reached turning Mirabeau into one of her political allies: Marie Antoinette promised to pay him 6000 livres per month and one million if he succeeded in his mission to restore the king's authority.|$|E
25|$|The CHP and MHP both {{initially}} {{refused to}} join a coalition with the AKP, but later indicated interest in entering negotiations. An AKP-CHP coalition was seen {{as one of the}} most likely scenarios and was supported by the financial sector. An AKP-MHP coalition was also seen as likely due to ideological similarities, though the two parties differ strongly on the issue of the Solution process. The MHP set out its red lines for any coalition deal to be the end of any discussion of a presidential system, the end of the solution process, the safeguarding of Turkish identity in any new constitutional settlement and the re-opening of suppressed corruption cases. The party's leader Devlet Bahçeli also demanded that Erdoğan should either resign or strictly keep to the constitutional limits of his position as President. In contrast, the AKP initially put forward three non-compromisable conditions on any coalition, which include the continuation of the solution process, the continuation of the government's efforts to purge the political power of the Gülen Movement and the refusal to compromise on Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's conduct as President. On 11 June, the AKP appeared to backtrack on their support for an executive presidency, with leader Ahmet Davutoğlu stating that he was <b>not</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> current parliamentary system. Davutoğlu also claimed that the AKP did not have any non-negotiable conditions for a coalition despite earlier contradictory reports.|$|E
