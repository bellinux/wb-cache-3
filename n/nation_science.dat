National Science Week welcomes {{an audience of}} over a million and hosts more than 1000 events across the <b>nation.</b> <b>Science</b> Week {{provides an opportunity for}} all Australians to participate in events and activities that showcase science and encourages younger people to consider continuing studies in science. Past participants have included polar explorer and environmental scientist Tim Jarvis, NASA Astronaut Katherine Megan McArthur; environmentalist Tanya Ha; theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss; and palaeontologist Scott Sampson. Another key activity during National Science Week is the National Project, which is run in conjunction with ABC Australia. Past project have included Weather Detective in 2014 and the Aussie Star Hunt in 2009. Also in 2009 Cosmos Magazine launched a website called HELLO FROM EARTH which collected over 28,000 messages which were beamed to the first Earth like planet candidate, Gliese 581d. In 2016 it included Wikibomb2016, a project to create missing Wikipedia pages on Australian women scientists.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} the École Polytechnique dates back over 200 years, {{to the time of}} the French Revolution. In 1794, the École {{centrale}} des travaux publics was founded by Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge {{at the time of the}} National Convention. It was renamed [...] "École polytechnique" [...] one year later. In 1805, Emperor Napoléon Bonaparte settled the École on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, in the Quartier Latin, in central Paris (...) , as a military academy and gave its motto Pour la Patrie, les Sciences et la Gloire (For the <b>Nation,</b> <b>science</b> and glory). In 1814, students took part in the Battle of Paris against the Sixth Coalition. In 1830, fifty students participated in the July Revolution. In 1848, Polytechnique students were the leaders of the French Revolution of 1848. They were an important part of the post-revolutionary process, with one student (Charles de Freycinet) becoming part of the post-revolution government. They were given the right to wear a sword as a recognition of their role. During the First World War, students were mobilized and the school building was transformed into a hospital. More than two hundred students were killed fighting for France during the war. During the Second World War, Polytechnique was moved away to Lyon in the free zone. More than four hundred Polytechnicians were killed during the war, as part of Free French and French Resistance operations, or in Nazi camps. In 1970, the École becomes a state-supported civilian institution, under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence. In 1972, women were admitted for the first time. In 1976, the École moved from Paris to Palaiseau (approx 25 km from Paris) In 1985, the École started awarding PhD degrees. In 1994, celebration of the bicentennial was chaired by President François Mitterrand. In 2000, a new cursus was set in place, passing to four years and reforming the polytechnicien curriculum. In 2005, the École started awarding master's degrees. In 2007, it became a founding member of UniverSud Paris and ParisTech. In December 2014, it became a founding member of Université Paris-Saclay.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} matrix {{approach}} to the computation of Battle-Lemari'e's wavelets. Since the Fourier transform of the scaling function {{is the product of}} the inverse F (x) of a square root of a positive trigonometric polynomial and the Fourier transform of a b-spline of order m. The polynomial is the symbol of an bi-infinite matrix B associated with b-spline of order 2 m. We approximate B 2 m by its finite section AN, a square matrix of finite order. We use AN to compute an approximation xN of F (x). We show that xN converges to x pointwise exponentially fast. This gives a feasible method to compute the scaling function for any given tolerance. Similarly, this method can be used to compute the wavelets. AMS(MOS) Subject Classification: Primary 41 A 15, 41 A 30, 42 C 15, 47 B 35.

40|$|<b>Nation</b> <b>Science</b> Foundation 41071110 	Valley {{economy is}} a type of economy that {{comprehensively}} utilizes the natural economic and social resources of the region based on environmental protection. This economy utilizes the basic role of the market in disposing resources and achieving regional development and social progress. In this paper we studied the town of Yanqi, a valley resort that has developed tourism-based valley economy for several years in the mountainous area of Beijing. This research identifies the spatial differentiation of tourism-related economic, socio-cultural, and environmental impact and level of support for tourism according to the perception and attitude of residents of Yanqi. The research area was divided into three zones (i. e., core, transition, and peripheral) according to the standard proposed by Jaakson. The residents in all three zones showed a positive attitude toward the tourism industry, and the residents in the core zone had a stronger perception toward the impact of tourism. However, several items indicated the converse. Correlation analysis and analysis of variance were used to explore the correlative factors associated with the attitudes of residents toward the tourism industry. Results indicated major differences among the three zones. Multiple factors, including natural conditions, policies, scenic spots, dependence on the tourism industry, and external investment in the three zones resulted in the spatial differentiation of the perception and attitude of residents toward the impact of tourism. </p...|$|E

40|$|Educación, Ciencia y blancura en Stella y Mecha Iturbe de César Duayen El presente trabajo estudia el lugar que ocupan la educación y la ciencia en el proceso de imaginar la nación deseada en las dos primeras novelas de César Duayen, a saber Stella (1905) y Mecha Iturbe (1906). A estos fines se analizan las relaciones que se establecen en las novelas entre Educación, Ciencia y Nación así como los modos en los que las ficciones se auto-atribuyen agencia para imaginar y concretizar lo imaginado en el mundo diegético. Dentro de este entramado, la tensión entre lo local y lo global –o lo nacional y lo cosmopolita– jugará un papel clave, papel que también se discute a lo largo del trabajo. Asimismo, se argumenta que el color blanco y los cuerpos blancos serán elementos centrales en la representación de los conflictos con los que se enfrenta la nación deseada y de los ideales que la guían. Palabras clave: {{literatura}} hispanoamericana, literatura argentina, cosmopolitismo, nación, ciencia, blancura   Education, Science and Whiteness in Stella and Mecha Iturbe by César Duayen The present article {{studies the}} role of education and science {{in the process of}} imagining the desired nation in the first two novels by César Duayen, namely, Stella (1905) and Mecha Iturbe (1906). To this end, the analysis focuses on the relations established between Education, Science and Nation {{as well as on the}} ways through which the narratives attribute themselves the authority to imagine the nation and realize this imagination in the diegetic world. Within this framework, the tension between the local and the global – or the national and the cosmopolitan – will play a central role, which is also discussed along the essay. Furthermore, it is argued that white as a colour as well as white bodies will be central elements for the conveyance of both the conflicts that the desired nation faces and the ideals that guide it.

Students interact with KinEd using body gestures and postures to perform their experiments. We developed an API for gestures and postures then used it to develop KinEd. The current version of KinEd includes mini-games for chemistry, biology, physics and Mathematics.
