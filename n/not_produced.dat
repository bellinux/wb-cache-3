5|$|Donkey Kong Country is {{the first}} Donkey Kong game that was <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> or {{directed}} by Shigeru Miyamoto, the character's original creator. It was directed by Tim Stamper instead, although Miyamoto was still involved with the project. Following an intense marketing campaign, Donkey Kong Country received critical acclaim and more than nine million copies were sold worldwide, making it the third-best-selling SNES game.|$|E

The Su-25T and the Su-25TM (also {{known as the}} Su-39) were further developments, <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> in significant numbers. The Su-25, and the Su-34, were the only armoured, fixed-wing aircraft in production in 2007. Su-25s are in service with Russia, other CIS states, and export customers.|$|E
5|$|Fallout from {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear testing}} prior to 1980 contributed {{a small amount}} of californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> in large quantities.|$|E

5|$|Myst IV: Revelation is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Myst video game series, developed and published by Ubisoft. Revelation was the first game in the series released on a DVD-ROM format; a multiple CD-ROM version was <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> {{as it would have}} taken twelve compact discs to fit the data. Like , Revelation combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D effects for added realism.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{the cloud}} {{collapsed}} as the gases expanded and lost their capability {{to support their}} solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Peléan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii. Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> by fallout.|$|E

50|$|The {{plant is}} parasitic, feeding off of other plants' root systems, {{often on the}} {{flowering}} plant genus Sedum which are also known as stonecrops. It does <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> chlorophyll, rather gaining its nutrients, such as carbohydrates, from other plant species. Due to <b>not</b> <b>producing</b> chlorophyll, the plant does <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> any green portions. It is not agreed upon by botanists whether the plant's flowers are pollinated by insects or if they are pollinated by the plant itself. The life expectancy of the species is unknown.|$|R

5|$|The Z-8 Geier was <b>not</b> <b>produced.</b> It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery. An increase in armour would have meant a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The early {{attempts}} to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued {{the practice of}} conducting so-called high-altitude precision bombing, aimed at key industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> acceptable results. These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of poxviruses is {{complicated}} by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell {{rather than in the}} nucleus. In order to replicate, poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> by other DNA viruses, the most important of which is a viral-associated DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.|$|E

5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de Chimie et Physique. In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to brôme on the proposal of M. Anglada. Brôme (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as a by-product of potash.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{casualty}} {{figures for}} the battle as a whole were <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> but can be inferred by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured. The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E
5|$|Almost There is {{the first}} major-label studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe. Produced by Pete Kipley, the album was {{released}} on August 14, 2001 by INO Records. After releasing six independent records, the band decided to pursue a record contract due {{to the difficulty of}} selling, booking, and managing for themselves. The band signed with the newly formed INO Records, and were assigned to work with Kipley, who had <b>not</b> <b>produced</b> a major project before. Four of the songs on the album had previously appeared on the band's independent records; the rest were newly recorded songs. The album is a worship and pop rock album, and adopts a more radio-friendly sound than the band's independent albums.|$|E

Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest. Woods still wanted the right to make script changes, but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence.
