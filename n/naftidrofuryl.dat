40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>naftidrofuryl</b> in treating cerebrovascular diseases is analyzed {{on the basis}} of a review of the Russian and foreign literature. <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> is a seroton 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist and acts on brain energy metabolism mainly during hypoxia or ischemia. The results of preclinical studies proving the antispasmodic and neuroprotective properties of the drug and its capacity to normalize microcirculation in hypoxia are briefly considered. Experimental findings served as a basis for further studies of the {{efficacy of}} <b>naftidrofuryl</b> in patients with stroke, chronic cerebral ischemia, or vascular dementia. The use of <b>naftidrofuryl</b> (dusopharm) was demonstrated to statistically significantly enhance the efficiency of rehabilitation in post-stroke patients and to be followed by significant psychoemotional improvement.

40|$|Background. We {{report in}} this paper the {{findings}} of a pooled analysis of 3 previously published studies undertaken in Germany, France and Belgium to assess the effects of <b>naftidrofuryl</b> on {{the quality of life of}} patients with intermittent claudication. Methods, A total of 754 patients were randomised in the 3 studies, 709 of whom (358 <b>naftidrofuryl,</b> 351 placebo) were available for the primary intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome variable was the change in the disease-related limitation of the quality of life as measured by the CLAU-S questionnaire. This instrument which has been validated in an international study, comprises 47 questions covering 5 dimensions: ''daily living'', ing'', ''pain'', ''social life'', ''disease specific anxiety''and ''mood''. Results. A multivariate analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values, study effect and first order study treatment interaction, demonstrated the global superiority of <b>naftidrofuryl</b> over placebo (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Serotonin {{plays an}} {{important}} role in maintaining homeostasis due to a broad spectrum of receptors localized in nearly every part of the body, i. e., central nervous system, vegetative ganglia, cardiac and lung reflexogenic zone, smooth muscles, internal organs and microcirculatory bloodstream, ocular tissues and optic tract. Serotonin levels can be altered by serotonin receptor blockade. Dusopharm (<b>naftidrofuryl),</b> a drug with complex mechanism of action, inhibits 5 -HT 2 receptors. Selective inhibiting of 5 -HT 2 receptors of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells decreases vasoconstrictor effects of serotonin that releases from atherosclerosisand hypoxia-damaged vascular endothelium and prevents thrombocyte aggregation. In addition, <b>naftidrofuryl</b> is the antagonist of vasoconstrictor action of endothelin- 1 expressed by vascular endothelium. Experiments with isolated rabbit smooth myocytes demonstrate that <b>naftidrofuryl</b> prevents endothelin- 1 binding with endothelial serotonin receptors and smooth myocyte contraction. <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> improves blood flow owing to its effect on blood rheological properties (increases erythrocyte deformability and decreases their aggregation). This paper reviews the studies of Dusopharm in patients with intermittent claudication, post-insult conditions, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and central retinal vein and its branches occlusion. These data allow to include Dusopharm in the complex therapy of central retinal vein and its branches occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, peripheral retinal degeneration, and retinal detachment to improve and stabilize visual functions and microcirculation.

40|$|Background : Lifestyle {{changes and}} {{cardiovascular}} prevention measures are a primary treatment for intermittent claudication (IC). Symptomatic treatment with vasoactive agents (Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) for medicines from the World Health Organisation class CO 4 A) is controversial. Objectives : To evaluate {{evidence on the}} efficacy and safety of oral <b>naftidrofuryl</b> (ATC CO 4 21) versus placebo on the pain-free walking distance (PFWD) of people with IC by using a meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD). Search strategy : The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Trials Register (last searched December 2007) and CENTRAL (last searched 2007, Issue 4). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, the Science Citation Index and contacted the authors and checked the reference lists of retrieved articles. We asked the manufacturing company for IPD. Selection criteria : We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with low or moderate risk of bias for which the IPD were available. Data collection and analysis : We collected data from the electronic data file or from the case report form and checked the data by a statistical quality control procedure. All randomized patients were analyzed following the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The geometric mean of the relative improvement in PFWD was calculated for both treatment groups in all identified studies. The effect of the drug was assessed compared with placebo on final walking distance (WDf) using multilevel and random-effect models and adjusting for baseline walking distance (WD 0). For the responder analysis, therapeutic success was defined as an improvement of walking distance of at least 50 %. Main results : We included seven studies in the IPD (n = 1266 patients). One of these studies (n = 183) was only used in the sensitivity analysis so that the main analysis included 1083 patients. The ratio of the relative improvement in PFWD (<b>naftidrofuryl</b> compared with placebo) was 1. 37 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 32 to 1. 51, P < 0. 001). The absolute difference in responder rate, or proportion successfully treated, was 22. 3 % (95 % CI 17. 1 % to 27. 6 %). The calculated number needed to treat was 4. 5 (95 % CI 3. 6 to 5. 8). Authors' conclusions : <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> has a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect of improving walking distance {{in the six months}} after initiation of therapy for people with intermittent claudication. Access by researchers to data from RCTs that is suitable for IPD analysis should be possible through repositories of data from pharmacological trials. Regular formal appraisal of the balance of risk and benefit is needed for older pharmaceutical products. <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> for intermittent claudication : Patients with narrowed arteries of the lower limbs may be hampered by pain in their calves after relatively short walks. This limits the distance they can walk, and hence their quality of life. This is a sure sign of atherosclerosis. These patients are at greater risk of cardiovascular death and should take preventive measures. The symptoms of the disease can be alleviated by smoking cessation and exercise. The question is whether specific drugs such as <b>naftidrofuryl</b> also reduce symptoms, more than placebo. To answer the question, we collected all published reports of randomized trials where the drug was compared with placebo. In addition, {{we went back to the}} original data of individual patients and made one big database with all data from all patients from all trials. We included seven studies with a total of 1266 patients.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Piracetam, <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> and methamphetamine on several {{parameters}} of cerebral energy metabolism have been studied. At variance with some {{reports in the}} literature neither Piracetam nor <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> affected the cerebral contents of adenine nucleotides and, accordingly, both substances were without effect on the adenylate energy charge. This disagreement is explained by methodological differences. Methamphetamine also {{had no effect on}} cerebral adenine nucleotides. Piracetam increased the activity of adenylate kinase (EC 2. 7. 4. 3) in isotonically diluted rat brain homogenates without altering the K(M) of the enzyme for ADP as substrate. It is concluded that although Piracetam has no effect on the cerebral energy metabolism under normal conditions, it may have a beneficial effect under marginal conditions like those met during hypoxia, by virtue of its adenylate kinase stimulating action. It is suggested that this action is responsible for the protective effect of Piracetam against cerebral hypoxia.

40|$|Several oral "vasoactive" drugs {{claim to}} {{increase}} walking capacity {{in patients with}} intermittent claudication (IC). <b>Naftidrofuryl,</b> cilostazol, buflomedil, and pentoxifylline are the most studied molecules. Although spanning several decades, several studies underlying these claims were not properly designed, underpowered or showed clinically doubtful outcomes. The evidence for these "vasoactive" drugs has always been received with scepticism, creating the need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This brief review discusses the benefit-risk assessment of vasoactive drugs, by applying a systematic review to evaluate randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Oral <b>naftidrofuryl</b> and cilostazol have an acceptable safety profile as well as sustained evidence (documented by Cochrane analyses) of increased walking capacity. Subsequently, these drugs entered recommendations for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In contrast, buflomedil and pentoxifylline have limited and/or doubtful evidence to increase walking capacity. Moreover, there were safety concerns about the narrow therapeutic range of buflomedil. Most other "vasoactive" drugs were either inappropriately or insufficiently tested or showed no significant if not negative effects on IC. "Vasoactive" drugs are no substitutes for lifestyle or exercise therapy but are adjuvant treatment to the well-appreciated triad of cardiovascular prevention (antiplatelet agents, statins and ACE-inhibitors), of which statins {{in their own right}} have documented claims to significantly increase walking capacity. "Vasoactive" drugs may have a place in the pharmacological management of symptomatic PAD in addition to the basic cardiovascular pharmacotherapy, when revascularization is not indicated, when exercise therapy is not feasible or when there is still insufficient benefit...|$|E

The results show that all these drugs protected human endothelial cells against the hypoxia-induced decrease in ATP content. In addition, they all induced a concentration-dependent increase in respiratory control ratio (RCR) of liver mitochondria pre-incubated with the drugs for 60 [*]min. The drugs were divided into two groups according to their effects. The first group (A), comprising aescine, Ginkor Fort, <b>naftidrofuryl</b> and naphthoquinone, increased RCR by decreasing state 4 respiration rate. The second group of drugs (B), comprising hydroxyethylrutosides, procyanidolic oligomers and Cyclo 3, increased RCR by increasing state 3 respiration rate. The drugs of group A were able to prevent the inhibition of complexes I and III respectively by amytal and antimycin A while the first two drugs of group B increased adenine nucleotide translocase activity. Cyclo 3 inhibited the carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (mCCP) -induced uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration. None of these seven drugs could protect complexes IV and V, respectively, from inhibition by cyanide and oligomycin. When tested on endothelial cells the drugs of group A, in contrast to group B, prevented the decrease in ATP content induced by amytal or antimycin A.

The membrane selective electrodes include construction of water insoluble ion-association complexes. These are NFL-tetraphenyl borate (NFL-TPB), NFL-reinikate (NFL-R). These complexes are used as electroactive materials, in poly-vinyl chloride (PVC) matrix membrane sensors, for the determination of NFL. The performance characteristics of these sensors, evaluated according to IUPAC recommendations, reveal fast, stable and linear response for NFL. The sensors are used for determination of NFL in plasma. The suggested method was used to determine NFL in synthetic mixtures and in commercial tablets. The obtained results were statistically compared with official HPLC method, showing no significant difference with respect to accuracy and precision...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} â€“ reveal {{clinical}} efficacy of <b>naftidrofuryl</b> in the aspect of correcting structural and functional changes of microcirculation (MC) {{in relation to the}} influence of the endothelial dysfunction (ED) parameters in comorbid patients suffered stroke event. Materials and methods. The study included 95 patients suffered ischemic type of stroke in the carotid bassin. An average age of patients was 69. 0 Â± 5. 3 years, stroke duration was 73. 5 Â± 8. 4 days. Patients were randomized in 2 groups by using blind method of envelopes. The mentioned groups matched on the main clinical and demographic characteristics. Patients from the 1 st group (primary group, n = 47) were treated with <b>naftidrofuryl</b> (Duzofarm) at the daily dose of 300 mg, 2 patients (comparison group, n = 48) received basic therapy only. 50 people without an acute cerebrovascular accident in history were allocated as a control group (group 3). The following blood biochemical parameters were assessed: glucose, creatinine, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein; triglycerides; markers of endothelial dysfunction: von Willebrand factor (VWF), tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI 1), antithrombin III (AT III) and plasminogen. MC was studied by the method of laser doppler flowmetry. The duration of the observation period was 6 months, and 4 visits were performed during this period. Results. Initial task of group formation within the study protocol has been solved by us in a full range. Patients from Group 1 that received <b>naftidrofuryl</b> noted statistically significant differences after 3 and 6 months of follow-up observation. These differences reflected improvement in perfusion index, coefficient of variation, as well as endothelial, neurogenic and myogenic regulation of microvasculature, increase in perfusion oxygen saturation index in the microcirculation. We have found that an index of relative perfusion oxygen saturation in microvascular blood (Sm) being the main indicator that reflects oxygen saturation of microcirculation has significantly correlated with ejection fraction, PAI 1, AT III, and plasminogen levels in group 1 patients in 3 and 6 months. We have also found significant correlation with ED when comparing parameters that express endothelial, neurogenic and myogenic regulation of microvessels. These data clearly demonstrated an association between improving of MC parameters and ED parameters in Group 1 patients. Conclusion. Possibility of correction of MC alterations leading to the worsening of ischemia and ED progression {{is one of the most}} promising directions in the treatment of stroke patients. Aim of the drug therapy is to prevent ED progression, reduced vascular tone and restore an adequate level of tissue hemoperfusion. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of drug efficacy in geriatric psychopharmacology is presented. Sixty patients with mild senile organic brain syndrome were evaluated by a battery of neuropsychological tests. Subsequently these patients {{were randomly assigned to}} either drug or placebo treatment for 90 days. One group received 300 mg per day of <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> (Praxilene) while the other received identical placebo. Upon retest, the data indicated that <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> produced significant improvements in reaction time, short-term memory, and iconic memory. Ten neuropsychological test scores as well as two POMS mood factors were incorporated into an Impairment Index. This index was drug sensitive and proved to be symptom independent. SENILE organic brain syndrome (SOBS) has long been thought of as a diffuse dysfunction of CNS. However, recent evi-dence obtained by Tomlinson (1972) on neuro-fibrillary degeneration and Hagberg and Ingvar (1976) on cerebral blood flow would suggest that observed symptomatology is related to the location and density of focal neuropathology. And as a corollary, the condition commonly called "senile dementia " is merely a progres-sion of these focal sites to a generalized neurological dysfunction. In order to assess the extent and type of CNS dysfunction in SOBS, the evidence would seem to imply that neuropsychological pro-cedures which are sensitive to focal CNS pathology should be employed. The difficulty with this approach in drug efficacy testing is that a randomly selected group of patients with mild to moderate SOBS will be characterized by highly heterogeneous neuropsychological symptoms. This heterogeneity will contribute significantly to confounding and diluting the ability to assess a pharmacologic agent's efficacy in ameliorating symptoms of SOBS. While some effort has been made by Reitan (1955) to assess neurological dysfunctio...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} various drugs and {{agonists}} on human platelet shape change (PSC) was assessed. PSC was expressed as {{the increase in}} median platelet volume (MPV). We developed a new sensitive and reproducible method to measure MPV using a high-resolution (0. 07 fl) channelyzer coupled to a platelet counter. Scanning electron micrographs showed that the changes in platelet morphology were mirrored by the MPV. We also used human platelets to assess the serotonergic action of two appetite suppressants, fenfluramine (d, l-F) and dexfenfluramine (d-F), {{as well as the}} main metabolite of d-F, d-norfenfluramine (d-norF). There was an increase in MPV in response to d-norF. This action was probably mediated via the serotonin (5 HT) (receptor-subtype 2), because a specific antagonist blocked it. This is the first demonstration, using human tissue, of the serotonergic action associated with a metabolite of d-F. This serotonergic activity may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and heart valve pathology reported in patients on d,l-F and d-F. We assessed two antihypertensive drugs, losartan and doxazosin. Doxazosin, a long acting [alpha][sub] 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited SHT-induced PSC. This effect may have potential clinical importance, because patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) or diabetes mellitus can have elevated circulating levels of SHT. This bioamine exerts harmful effects like stimulating vascular smooth muscle proliferation and inducing vasoconstriction. Losartan an angiotensin type I receptor blocker inhibited PSC induced by angiotensin II and a thromboxane A[sub] 2 mimetic (U 46619). Therefore, losartan in addition to lowering blood pressure has antiplatelet activity. Endothelin-l (ET-l) is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor. <b>Naftidrofuryl</b> inhibited platelet activation induced by ET-I alone or in combination with ADP or SHT. These actions may contribute to the beneficial effects of <b>naftidrofuryl</b> in patients with intermittent claudication. These findings confirm the usefulness of the PSC technique in investigating the effect of agonists and drugs on human platelets...|$|E
