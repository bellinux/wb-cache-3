5|$|The lost Yorktown TBD aircrew reached Guadalcanal after {{drifting}} {{in the ocean}} for three days. A Roman Catholic missionary took them to Martin Clemens who arranged for a boat {{to take them to}} San Cristobal. From San Cristobal, another boat took them to the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> and from there they eventually rejoined U.S. forces.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the offensive, in May 1942, U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift was ordered to move his 1st Marine Division from the U.S. to New Zealand. Other Allied land, naval, and air force units were sent to establish bases in Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. Espiritu Santo in the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> {{was selected as the}} headquarters and main base for the impending offensive—codenamed Operation Watchtower—with the commencement date set for 7 August 1942. At first, the Allied offensive was planned just for Tulagi and the Santa Cruz Islands, omitting Guadalcanal. However, after Allied reconnaissance discovered the Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal, capture of that airfield was added to the plan and the Santa Cruz operation was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is {{native to}} the coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region. Its westernmost distribution is India, including Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu (Gulf of Mannar, Tuticorin, Rameswaram) and the Andamans. It occurs in Sri Lanka (Eastern province, Trincomalee), Thailand, Borneo (Brunei, Sabah), Indonesia (Moluccas, Saparua) and the Philippines (Cebu Island, Polillo Islands, Palawan). It is also found further east in Melanesia, including Yos Sudarso Bay in New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, Malaita and Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Kioa Island in Fiji, and <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides.</b> The species is known to occur in Queensland, Australia and north to Vietnam, Taiwan and southern Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{spent the}} next several months in training at locations about the central North Island before embarking for New Caledonia in December. Arriving at Nouméa on 31 December 1942, the battalion was earmarked to be the basis for a new brigade, the 15th. However this proved to be only a short-term measure and by March 1943, it was back with 14th Brigade. While on New Caledonia, the battalion underwent jungle training and performed security duties before departing for Guadalcanal in mid-August 1943. After stopping briefly at the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides,</b> it arrived at Guadalcanal on 27 August and spent a month here, establishing camps and conducting patrols to monitor for any surprise landings by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|After refit {{work was}} {{completed}} on 31 March 1942, Colorado carried out extensive training maneuvers along the West Coast, {{before returning to}} Pearl Harbor to complete her final preparations for action. She operated {{in the vicinity of}} the Fiji Islands and <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> from 8 November 1942 to 17 September 1943 to prevent any further Japanese expansion in the Pacific. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 21 October 1943 to provide pre-invasion shelling and fire support for the invasion of Tarawa, returning to port on 7 December 1943. After another overhaul on the West Coast, Colorado returned to Lahaina Roads, in the Hawaiian Islands, on 21 January 1944 and sortied the next day for the Marshall Islands. She provided the pre-invasion bombardment and fire support for the invasions of Kwajalein and Eniwetok until 23 February, when she headed for the Puget Sound Navy Yard for another overhaul.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{emphasis}} placed on cooperation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region after 1940. Measures were taken to improve Australia's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941, but these proved inadequate. The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941, while plans were made for a Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island. An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul, and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon. Meanwhile, in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain {{in order to protect}} the airfield, while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland, Vila in the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides,</b> Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka Passage in Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the rest}} of the 3rd Division had been {{progressively}} sent to New Caledonia where it underwent further combat training. The 34th Battalion, its duties on Tongatapu at an end, joined the division in March 1943. In July 1943, Barrowclough informed the New Zealand Government that it was ready for combat duties, so in early September 1943, it moved to Guadalcanal for a combat role as part of the Solomon Islands campaign. However along the way, the troops stopped briefly at Port Vila in the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> to carry practice amphibious operations with landing craft before continuing onto Guadalcanal. Arriving off their destination on 14 September, the battalion was landed the same day. Jungle training remained the focus of the battalion although they also took the opportunity to work with Valentine tanks.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May, coastwatcher Jack Read on Bougainville {{reported}} that a large force of Japanese ships, believed {{to be part of}} the Japanese Tulagi invasion force, had departed from the Buka area. Later that day, coastwatcher D. G. Kennedy on New Georgia island sighted and reported a large Japanese force of ships heading towards the southern Solomons. Soon after, Goode and Peagam—anticipating that the Japanese would attack with overwhelming numbers—ordered the execution of a pre-planned evacuation operation and began the destruction and demolition of their equipment and facilities on Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. The RAAF personnel and commandos embarked on two small ships early in the morning on 3 May to begin the trip to Vila, <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides,</b> just as Shima's ships entered Savo sound to begin their landings on Tulagi. The ship with the RAAF personnel spent the day with coastwatcher and protectorate district officer Martin Clemens at Aola on Guadalcanal and departed that night.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{began her}} service in 1936. Following shakedown, the new {{destroyer}} {{was assigned to}} the United States Battle Fleet in San Diego, California, operating along the West Coast and in the Hawaiian Islands. She participated in naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea, and was then reassigned to duty between the West Coast and Hawaii. After a goodwill tour to New Zealand, the ship returned to Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941, Tucker was berthed at the East Loch in Pearl Harbor undergoing overhaul but sustained no damage. Afterward, Tucker escorted convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. She then did escort work to American Samoa, the Fiji Islands, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo, <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Docked at Suva, Tucker {{received}} {{orders to}} escort the cargo ship SS Nira Luckenbach to Espiritu Santo, <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides.</b> On 1 August 1942, the ships left Suva by a route north of Efate Island {{and west of}} Malekula Island. Making {{their way through the}} Bruat Channel, both ships set courses to enter the Segond Channel on the final leg of their voyage. On 4 August, Tucker was leading the cargo ship into the harbor at Espirtu Santo. As the destroyer headed into the western entrance, she struck a mine. The mine exploded, nearly tearing her hull in two at the No.1 stack, killing all three crew members on watch in the forward fireroom. The rest of the ship's company survived. USS Tucker slowly settled in the water. Nira Luckenbach and other vessels quickly rescued the destroyermen from their sinking ship. The stern of the Tucker sank the following morning and a diving party scuttled and sank the bow. Tucker had steamed into the Segundo Channel unaware that the minelayers Gamble, Breese, and Tracy had laid a field of mines at its western entrance. An investigation revealed that Tucker had been given no information regarding the existence of the minefield. She was struck from the Navy list on 2 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Fully repaired, Mahan left Pearl Harbor on 9 January 1943 for the South Pacific. In {{subsequent}} {{months she}} escorted convoys between the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> and the Fiji Islands, performed patrol assignments off New Caledonia, {{and engaged in}} operations in Australian waters. By August her base of operations was Milne Bay, New Guinea, which along with Buna, Papua New Guinea, {{was used as a}} staging area for an advance to gain possession of the Japanese-held northeast coast of New Guinea. The operation began in August 1943, with plans to strike Lae, New Guinea. Two weeks earlier, Mahan, under Lieutenant Commander James T. Smith, and three other US destroyers had cleared the Lae approaches and the waters between Salamaua and Finschhafen, bombarding Japanese installations at Finschhafen. In early September the Lae Task Force, under Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, left Milne Bay for Lae with 8,000 Australian troops. By the evening of 4September, the troop landing was completed. On 11 September Salamaua was under Allied control, and Lae was taken by 16 September. Mahan and other US destroyers had provided cover for the amphibious landings.|$|E
5|$|His initial posting to the Pacific Theater {{was delayed}} by a month, {{during which he}} {{completed}} further training on the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat. By virtue of this additional training, and because Roddenberry's height made it unlikely {{that he would be}} suitable for a combat fighter pilot, he was assigned to bombers. He received orders to report to Bellows Field, Oahu, to join the 394th Bomb Squadron, 5th Bombardment Group, of the Thirteenth Air Force. The squadron flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, which had previously been used by the 19th Bomb Group, and were en route to a maintenance overhaul when they had to flee due to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Roddenberry was assigned as Captain William Ripley's co-pilot for the flight that the squadron took to Christmas Island, and the following day to Canton Island. An additional flight on November 17 took the squadron to Nadi, Fiji, where they were expected to go on to the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides.</b> Instead they were ordered to remain in Nadi to fly reconnaissance missions.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March, Idaho {{arrived in}} the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides,</b> before {{continuing}} on to Australia for a brief stay. She returned to Kwajalein on 8 June, where she joined a group of escort carriers for {{the invasion of the}} Mariana Islands. Idaho began the preparatory bombardment of Saipan on 14 June, with the assault taking place the following day. Idaho then shifted to Guam, where she shelled Japanese positions. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 1920 June, Idaho remained with the invasion fleet and protected the troop transports and supply ships. She steamed to Eniwetok in the Marshalls to replenish her stocks of ammunition from 28 June to 9 July, before returning to Guam on 12 July. She bombarded the island for eight days before ground troops went ashore on 21 July. The ship continued to support American forces ashore until 2 August, when she returned to Eniwetok for further supplies. From there, she steamed to Espiritu Santo, where on 15 August she entered a floating dry dock for repairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{obvious choice}} for a supreme {{commander}} in the Pacific was General Douglas MacArthur. He had been ordered to leave the Philippines for Australia to take command of a reconstituted ABDA area on 22 February 1942, and had therefore been promised the command even before there were discussions on what it should be. MacArthur had solid support from the President, the Army and the American people, but not the Navy. The Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King, saw the Pacific lines of communication primarily as a naval responsibility and would not yield command to an Army officer and proposed a division placing all of the Solomons within the Australian area, but excluding the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides,</b> New Caledonia, and New Zealand. While the Army planners, led by Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower, were willing to compromise on a divided command, they objected to placing Australia and New Zealand in separate theatres. The Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed the matter between 9 and 16 March, the result {{of which was a}} decision to adopt the Navy's plan, with only minor amendments.|$|E
25|$|The {{currency}} {{was initially}} issued in three distinct forms for French Polynesia, New Caledonia and the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides.</b> (See French Polynesian franc, New Caledonian franc and <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> franc.) Wallis and Futuna used the New Caledonian franc. Although the banknotes of the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> bore {{the name of}} the territory, the notes of French Polynesia and New Caledonia could only be distinguished by {{the name of the}} capitals (Papeete and Nouméa, respectively) on the reverse of the notes.|$|E

25|$|Since 1879 {{the colony}} of Fiji had {{imported}} indentured workers (as cheap labour) from India {{to work in}} the European-owned plantations, which produced (according to demand) sea island cotton from the late 1860s to the early 1870s, then copra, then sugarcane from around 1880. This Indian immigration (which ended in 1916) came about because the Pacific Islands (particularly the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> and the Solomon Islands) couldn't provide enough labour. These islands provided labour from 1864 to 1911, when the European planters in the Solomon Islands and the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> brought about legislation to prevent emigration from those islands.|$|E
25|$|Friedrich Ratzel in The History of Mankind {{reported}} in 1896 {{that in the}} <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> {{there was a kind}} of convention in cases of widowhood, that two widowers shall live with one widow.|$|E

25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1940, the French colonies of Cameroon, French India and French Equatorial Africa joined the Free French side. French colonies in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon and the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> joined later.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 1889 whilst the Colonist {{was lying}} at anchor in Havannah Harbour in the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> Group the {{shipmaster}} William Greenless {{was shot and killed}} by the supercargo of the vessel Henry Ernest Weaver.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> (now Vanuatu), then a French-British condominium, Resident Commissioner Henri Sautot quickly led the French {{community}} {{to join the}} Free French side.

25|$|On 23 September, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, , , and , and Destroyer Squadron 12 (DesRon 12) became TF 64, {{a surface}} {{screening}} and attack force {{under the command}} of Admiral Scott in San Francisco. The next day, the force headed to the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides.</b>|$|E
25|$|Washington {{remained}} at Efate {{for less than}} two weeks. Underway on Christmas Day, flying Rear Admiral Lee's flag, the battleship steamed out in company with her sister ship North Carolina and a screen of four destroyers to conduct gunnery practice, returning to the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> on 7 January 1944.|$|E
25|$|In mid-September, Rail {{returned}} to Nouméa and assumed towing duties in the New Caledonia area. Assigned a tow to the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> in early January 1944, {{she spent the}} latter half of the month en route to and from New Zealand and in February resumed towing operations out of Espiritu Santo.|$|E
25|$|Schroeder {{was back}} with her division, on 1 February 1944, when it {{screened}} transports and provided fire support for the assault on Kwajalein Island. She remained in the Marshalls for several weeks and, from 20 to 24 February, bombarded Maloelap and Wotje Atolls. On 1 March, she sailed to the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> Islands where she participated in more training exercises.|$|E
25|$|Foreign missionaries, or more recently, {{international}} partners, {{share the}} church's witness around the world. Before 1875, Atlantic Canada sent John Geddie and the Gordon Brothers (George N. and James D., both martyred) from Prince Edward Island to the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides,</b> now called Vanuatu in the South Pacific; John Morton to Trinidad; and later, partners into neighbouring Demerara, part of present-day Guyana.|$|E
25|$|In 1864, nickel was {{discovered}} {{on the banks}} of the Diahot River and with the establishment of the Société Le Nickel in 1876, mining began in earnest. The French imported labourers to work in the mines from neighbouring islands and the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides,</b> and later from Japan, the Dutch East Indies, and French Indochina. The French government also attempted to encourage European immigration, without much success.|$|E
25|$|President Johnson {{continued}} transporting {{troops for}} the next 2 years {{in support of the}} amphibious operations which had penetrated by July 1945 to the Japanese home islands. With stops at Eniwetok and Guam, Marshalls; Ulithi, Carolines; Peleliu, Palaus; and Espiritu Santo, <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides,</b> long behind her, President Johnson returned to San Francisco 14 January 1946 to end her World War II service as a troop transport.|$|E
25|$|The IEOM began issuing {{banknotes}} in <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> in 1965, and in New Caledonia and French Polynesia in 1969. On 1 October 1986, a new banknote, the 10,000 francs, {{was introduced}} {{which did not}} bear any distinguishing mark and was common to both French Polynesia and New Caledonia. These were followed, between 1992 and 1995, by 500, 1000 and 5000 franc notes {{for all of the}} French Pacific Territories.|$|E
25|$|France {{also had}} an empire in Asia and the Pacific, and these far-flung colonies would {{experience}} similar problems of divided loyalties. French India and the French South Pacific colonies of New Caledonia, French Polynesia and the <b>New</b> <b>Hebrides</b> joined the Free France in the summer 1940, drawing official American interest. These South Pacific colonies would later provide vital Allied bases in the Pacific Ocean during the war with Japan.|$|E
