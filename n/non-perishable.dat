5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and <b>non-perishable</b> materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E
5|$|When Hurricane Daniel was {{forecast}} to {{pass through}} the Hawaiian islands as a tropical storm, state and Hawaii County officials recommended residents prepare hurricane kits. They also suggested purchasing <b>non-perishable</b> foods and batteries. Initially, the storm was several days away from potentially affecting the state, and as a result few residents rushed to prepare. The Honolulu National Weather Service issued a high surf advisory for east facing beaches in Hawaii, and warned beachgoers to remain out of the water. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch and wind advisory in association with the remnants of Daniel.|$|E
5|$|Knowles {{teamed with}} America's Second Harvest and Pastor Rudy Rasmus of St. John United Methodist Church for a pre-concert food {{donation}} drive which {{was part of}} The Beyoncé Experience at every stop. Food was collected for people who fought with famine. Knowles' organization The Survivor Foundation was also involved in the campaign. The first 1,000 fans who would drop off a minimum of three <b>non-perishable</b> food items would receive an autographed photo of Knowles and a raffle ticket for a chance to have an upgraded seat. For the food drive in Ethiopia, India and Turkey, Houston Chronicle collaborated with Knowles, creating a Virtual Aid Drive and asking people to send money to them. The funds were donated to the Global FoodBanking Network.|$|E

Residents throughout the country stocked up on emergency supplies and <b>non-perishable</b> food, noted {{by an increase in}} sales at shops. In Saint James Parish, emergency officials activated all necessary agencies by August11. Late on August11, emergency officials quickly opened 50 shelters in the parish. In Saint Elizabeth Parish, 100 residents sought refuge in the six shelters opened throughout the parish. A total of $1.5million (JMD; US$17,000) was allocated by the Ministry of Local Government for repairs after the storm. The Jamaica Red Cross alerted local branches to be prepared as Charley approached.|$|E
5|$|The Bermuda Electric Light Company Limited {{recommended}} Bermuda {{residents to}} buy hurricane supplies such as candles, batteries, and <b>non-perishable</b> foods, to fill bathtubs and extra containers with water, and fill gasoline tanks for automobiles. In preparation, residents formed long lines at gas stations, banks, and supermarkets. All government offices and many businesses {{closed on the}} day prior to the hurricane hitting. All schools were closed, while all flights {{in and out of}} the island were canceled. Officials opened emergency shelters, and recommended 2,000 low-lying residents to evacuate; a hotel on the south shore of the island was evacuated as well. Several cruise ships expected to remain on the island departed early to avoid the hurricane. Local insurance companies on Bermuda experienced a great increase in business, as residents renewed lapsed policies or signed up for new policies for homes or businesses, though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck. The arrival of Fabian forced the cancellation or delay of several sports events, including a cricket match, a football game, and a dinghy race.|$|E
5|$|Volunteers {{from the}} Mexican Red Cross quickly went to {{disaster}} areas with {{search and rescue}} teams, including using specially trained dogs to search for hurricane victims trapped under muddy areas of Acapulco. By {{four days after the}} storm each team was finding one or two corpses per day, with officials stating the search could take weeks. In Guerrero, the teams rescued a total of 35people from hazard. Hours after the hurricane passed through the area, relief works traveled by boat through flooded areas to assist the worst-hit areas. The Red Cross provided food, water, clothing, blankets, water purification supplies, milk powder and other <b>non-perishable</b> foods, and medical supplies to those staying in government shelters in Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chiapas. The Mexican Red Cross also set up shelters to house and feed hundreds of displaced people, and by four days after the storm, the Red Cross distributed 100 tonnes of relief supplies to hurricane victims. Medical workers were also deployed to the area to aid the injured.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of inventories of perishable products {{with a short}} maximal shelf life takes a good issuing policy next to a good ordering policy. Ordering policies of <b>non-perishables</b> are well studied in literature and implemented in Automated Store Ordering (ASO) systems and Computer Assisted Ordering (CAO) systems. These ordering policies are stock-level dependent and do not take the product ages into account. As a consequence when applied to perishable products they do not anticipate expected future outdating of products and thus result in unnecessary outdating and shortages. Improved ordering policies are proposed in the literature but hardly implemented in ASO and CAO systems as these are designed for the {{management of}} <b>non-perishables.</b> Without changing the order policies of such systems one may reduce outdating and shortages by issuing the products in a sophisticated way. We present therefore a stochastic model that is solved by stochastic dynamic programming...|$|R

5|$|The {{estimated}} cost {{to clean up}} debris from the two killer tornadoes was estimated at $500,000. The governor of Wilson County requested that the areas struck by the EF3 tornado and the EF2 prior as disaster areas to allow federal assistance. In Kenly, hospital staff raised about $300 to help a family whose home was completely destroyed. Up to 125 personnel were deployed to check on residents who were still at home and to assist those in need. Several volunteers helped remove trees and debris off roads {{to make way for}} aid. Two Red Cross teams set up a shelter at the Kenly Free Will Baptist Church. During church ceremonies, volunteers organized outside the church to feed residents who lost their homes. A Methodist church group from Virginia arrived in Johnston and Wilson counties the day after the tornadoes to assist with cleanup efforts. A fund was set up for the 11-year-old boy, Joshua Wiggens, who was killed by the Elm City tornado. By November17, the Red Cross funds were depleted funds needed to keep the organization out of debt were $38million below what was required. About $20,000 was spent in the charity effort in Kenly and the governor of Wilson County urged residents who were no affected by the storm to send donations to the Red Cross. The lack of funding for the Red Cross prompted the governor to allow up to $28,000 in the state's emergency funds to be used for assistance by the Red Cross. On November21, low-interest loans were approved for residents in the affected counties. Homeowners in Johnston, Franklin, Harnett, Nash, Sampson, Wake, Wayne and Wilson counties were able to apply for loans up to $200,000 to repair storm damage and businesses were allowed to apply for loans up to $2million. On November24, an unknown member of the 82nd Airborne Division donated 50 cases of <b>non-perishable</b> food and water to assist victims of the tornado. The relief goods were dropped off at the J.S.

40|$|To {{the editor}} : The article by Haug and colleagues on {{household}} food stockpiling {{is a useful}} contribution to a neglected aspect of disaster planning. However, rather than providing a guide to what foods should be stockpiled, {{it may be more}} valuable to encourage families to increase the amount and rotation of the <b>non-perishables</b> they currently purchase. The authors seek to promote a balanced nutritional diet, but encouraging a family to continue their usual purchasing patterns when stockpiling for a pandemic or other disaster is a simpler, more sustainable, and possibly more effective way to promote household food stockpiling. We must assume that the family currently survives, for better or worse, on their current food purchase pattern...|$|R

Supporting U.S. forces in Vietnam was the most severe, extensive test of the supply system in the young agency’s history. The agency launched an accelerated procurement program to meet the extra demand created by the military buildup in Southeast Asia. The agency’s supply centers responded in record time to orders for everything from boots and lightweight tropical uniforms to food, sandbags, construction materials, and petroleum products. Between 1965 and 1969 over 22 million short tons of dry cargo and over 14 million short tons of bulk petroleum were transported to Vietnam. As a result of support to the operations in Vietnam, DSA’s total procurement soared to $4 billion in fiscal year 1966 and $6.2 billion in fiscal year 1967.

5000|$|Markets {{have existed}} {{for as long}} as humans have engaged in trade. The {{earliest}} bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, and spread {{to the rest of the}} Middle East and Europe from there. Documentary sources suggesting that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of a city from around 3,000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar. Middle Eastern bazaars were typically long strips with stalls on either side and a covered roof designed to protect traders and purchasers from the fierce sun. In Europe, informal, unregulated markets gradually made way for a system of formal, chartered markets from the 12th century. Throughout the Medieval period, increased regulation of market place practices, especially weights and measures, gave consumers confidence in the quality of market goods and the fairness of prices. Around the globe, markets have evolved in different ways depending on local ambient conditions, especially weather, tradition and culture. In the Middle East, markets tend to be covered, to protect traders and shoppers from the sun. In milder climates, markets are often open air. In Asia, a system of morning markets trading in fresh produce and night markets trading in <b>non-perishables</b> is a frequently occuring model.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the last}} decade large {{supermarket}} chains have started developing and implementing automated store ordering (ASO) systems {{in order to improve}} both the quality and efficiency of the inventory replenishment decisions in their stores. These ASO systems have been developed mainly for <b>non-perishables.</b> The aims of this paper are 1. to better understand the product, sales and supply characteristics of perishables in supermarkets, 2. to define and operationalise relevant concepts in controlling the inventories of perishables, 3. to investigate how the intelligence in ASO systems in supermarkets can be further improved, 4. to give academics empirically based insight in the relevance of the inventory models that are currently available in the literature, insight in relevant parameter settings and insight in which models are needed. The research is carried out in cooperation with two Dutch supermarket chains and focusses on perishable items. To further improve the intelligence in the ASO systems, we will classify the items in a supermarket, based on the notion that different items need different inventory control rules. For every class of items, we describe the main logistic characteristics; moreover, for the perishable items we describe the inventory control rules which are currently being applied and we discuss the desired inventory control strategy for these items.

Maya politics was dominated by a closed system of patronage, although the exact political make-up of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state. By the Late Classic, the aristocracy had greatly increased, resulting in the corresponding reduction in the exclusive power of the divine king.
