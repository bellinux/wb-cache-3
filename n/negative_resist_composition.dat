40|$|Electron-beam direct write is a {{promising}} technique for deep submicron lithography. One {{of the common}} methods to define a bright field pattern for the gate electrode masking uses <b>negative</b> <b>resist.</b> However, the resolution of many popular <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> is low {{compared to that of}} positive resists. A technique is demonstrated that takes advantage of positive resist, such as polymethylmethacrylate and converts it to a bright field masking step. The technique involves (1) using a <b>negative</b> <b>resist</b> coating on a positive resist pattern, (2) plasma etching the <b>negative</b> <b>resist</b> down {{to the top of the}} positive resist, (3) exposing large area with electrons or deep ultraviolet photons, and (4) developing the result with a ratio of methyl isobutyl ketone and isopropanol. The resulting bright field masking provides high-resolution dense line patterns, which are difficult to achieve using the common <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> alone.

50|$|Photoresists are coatings, or oligomers, {{that are}} {{deposited}} on a surface and {{are designed to}} change properties upon irradiation of light. These changes either polymerize the liquid oligomers into insoluble cross-linked network polymers or decompose the already solid polymers into liquid products. Polymers that form networks during photopolymerization {{are referred to as}} <b>negative</b> <b>resist.</b> Conversely, polymers that decompose during photopolymerization are referred to as positive resists. Both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> have found many applications including the design and production of micro fabicated chips. The ability to pattern the resist using a focused light source has driven the field of photolithography.|$|R
50|$|As mentioned, <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> are photopolymers {{that become}} {{insoluble}} upon exposure to radiation. They {{have found a}} variety of commercial applications.

A characteristic found in most <b>negative</b> tone <b>resists</b> is the presence of multifunctional branches on the polymers used. Radiation of the polymers in the presence of an intiator results in the formation of chemically resistant network polymer. A common functional group used in <b>negative</b> <b>resist</b> is epoxy functional groups. An example of a widely used polymer of this class is SU-8.

For the contact hole level a positive tone resist is required. Good performance, including batch uniformity is obtained for 0. 5 mum holes.

5000|$|The primary {{mechanisms}} for producing structures in resist materials is, in general, bond scissioning in positive resists such as PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), or cross-linking in <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> such as SU-8. In positive resists the regions damaged by protons are removed by chemical development to produce structures, whereas in <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> the development procedures remove the undamaged resist leaving the cross-linked structures behind. In e-beam writing, {{the primary and}} secondary electrons create the scissioning or cross-linking, whereas in p-beam writing the damage is caused by short range proton-induced secondary electrons. The proton fluence required for exposure varies from 30-150 nCmm−2 depending on the resist material, and is around 80-100 times less than that required by e-beam writing. Remark: The unit of the fluence in proton beam writing is usually given in [...] "charge/area". It can be converted into [...] "particles/area" [...] by dividing [...] "charge/area" [...] by the charge of a proton, Q = 1,602·10−19C.|$|R
5000|$|The {{processing}} of SU-8 {{is similar to}} other <b>negative</b> <b>resists</b> with particular attention on {{the control of the}} temperature in the baking steps. The baking times depend on the SU-8 layer thickness; the thicker the layer, the longer the baking time. The temperature is controlled during the baking in order to reduce stress formation in the thick layer (leading to cracks) as the solvent evaporates.|$|R
3000|$|However, {{for some}} applications, {{such as the}} {{fabrication}} of hole arrays in a metal film (the structure for extraordinary optical transmission [5]) by using liftoff, <b>negative</b> <b>resist</b> would offer substantially shorter exposure time, except when using a more complicated [...] "resist tone reversal" [...] process [6]. Unfortunately, there is no <b>negative</b> <b>resist</b> that gains similar popularity as PMMA and ZEP 520. Bilenberg et al. have selected four <b>negative</b> EBL <b>resists</b> and compared their performance: calixarene (Tokuyama Corp.), ma-N 2401 (Microresist Technology), SU- 8 (Microchem Corp.), and mr-L 6000 (Microresist Technology) [7]. As chemically amplified resists, SU- 8 and mr-L 6000 offer superior sensitivity, but with low contrast and resolution (more strictly speaking, half-pitch for dense periodic line array patterns), which {{is limited by the}} diffusion of the photoacid generator during postbaking. Ma-N 2401 has sensitivity comparable to that of ZEP 520 resist, but with far inferior resolution. Among the four resists, calixarene offers the highest resolution. Calixarene has been studied as a candidate resist for fabricating using EBL bit-patterned recording media that have achieved areal density of 1.4 and 1.6 Tbits/in 2 (corresponding to a dot array of 20 -nm period) [8, 9] using very thin (sub- 20 nm) film. However, it has low sensitivity despite being a chemically amplified resist, and the acid generated in the exposed area may diffuse into the unexposed area, blurring the latent image.|$|R
