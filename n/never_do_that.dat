5|$|At {{a luncheon}} later that day, however, Miranda announces {{that it is}} Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she {{was grateful for the}} warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, a {{representative}} for Kodak said Cosby had become [...] "synonymous with quality products and quality services". Ebony agreed, saying Cosby {{has the advantage}} of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, [...] "if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. Obviously, I could <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's what I think I do better than anybody".|$|E
500|$|Odyssey Number Five was Powderfinger's {{shortest}} album when recorded, {{running for}} approximately 45 minutes. The {{focus of the}} album was on restraint, with more simplistic lyrics than previously, and with a plain and simple message intended. Fanning said of his songwriting ethic: [...] "You try and make it something that’s got some substance, but also, you can <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{at the cost of}} it having relevance to what you’re singing." [...] Powderfinger manager Paul Piticco commented that [...] "their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability".|$|E

500|$|... "For me, it's {{really easy}} to write {{depressive}} songs and that's why I <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I {{try to do}} songs that are a bit happier and a bit more complicated. I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and I find it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E
500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records myself, and I suppose that must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] And I always promised myself I'd <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{presents}} Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated {{centuries before}} by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles {{the issue of}} Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers {{a glimpse of a}} suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration. When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar [...] "I'm not a girl". An actress plays Eli's character, but her voice was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress Elif Ceylan. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut. In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation. When Alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for the first time, he [...] "started to cry because it was so damn beautiful". He subsequently described the film as a [...] "masterpiece". [...] "It doesn't really matter that [...] didn't want to do it the way I wanted it in every respect. He could obviously <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> The film is his creative process", he said.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} not storyboarded and was made without a shot list. The camp fire scene was {{originally}} a short, three-page scene that Phoenix re-wrote into an eight-page scene where Mike professes {{his love for}} Scott {{so that it was}} more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous. Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, [...] "I'm not against gays or anything, but I won't have sex with guys. I would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> on film. We did a little of it in Idaho and, believe me, it was hard work. Never again".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1930s, General Motors divisions, Buick and Chevrolet, {{paid for}} the band to travel to away games. [...] In a show of appreciation, Revelli had the band line up in a “Buck – I” {{formation}} at the 1938 Ohio State game. [...] Then, while playing Buick’s theme song, the letter [...] "I" [...] moved between the [...] "u" [...] and the [...] "c" [...] in [...] "Buck" [...] spelling out [...] "Buick". [...] The next morning, athletic director Fielding H. Yost reportedly called Revelli at his home at 2:00a.m. and said: [...] "Young man, [...] <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again!” [...] Yost did not approve of the injection of commercial advertising onto the college football field.|$|E

2500|$|Rollins told Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald {{that this}} reunion with Haskett, Gibbs and Cain would not become {{long-term}} unless the group {{decided to write}} new songs: [...] "Let's put it this way. I don't {{want to go out}} and hit America again without a new record, or at least a new album's worth of material. Otherwise the thing will lack legitimacy ... Miles Davis would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> And I'm not into a greatest-hits thing. I think a band, if you're going to be around, you should be moving forward and putting in the time and working for it, getting after the art. Otherwise you're just playing retreads. ... Imagine a tree that grows canned peaches. It's nothing I want to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Naughty Dog {{has said}} future titles {{will have to}} live up to a [...] "really high" [...] quality standard. Speaking to IGN, lead effects artist Keith Guerrette said success has made the studio [...] "a little bit reluctant, actually, if we do sit back and decide to {{continue}} with the Uncharted world, because we don't want to [...] "ruin" [...] the series." [...] According to Naughty Dog, {{it was a mistake to}} reveal Uncharted 3s release date a year out with the challenges involved with completing a game by its due date. [...] "We will <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again, not a year out", sighed co-president Christophe Balestra during an interview with Eurogamer. [...] "The minute we saw the date on screen we were like, 'Oh God, I really regret that'", Evan Wells agreed.|$|E
2500|$|On June 1, 1915, Panzram burgled a {{house in}} Astoria, Oregon, but was arrested soon after while {{attempting}} to sell some of the stolen items. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, to be served at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, where he arrived on June 24. Warden Harry Minto believed in harsh treatment of inmates, including beatings and isolation, among other disciplinary measures. Later, Panzram stated that he swore he [...] "would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> seven years and I defied the warden and all his officers to make me." [...] Later that year, Panzram helped fellow inmate Otto Hooker escape from the prison. While attempting to evade recapture, Hooker killed Minto, marking Panzram's first known involvement in a murder, as an accessory before the fact.|$|E

2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Rick Berman {{said that}} when creating , he had to obey the rules as set out by franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, and compared the normal Starfleet officers to that of Boy Scouts. Berman suggested that [...] "In the Pale Moonlight" [...] was the exception. Taylor said that the episode [...] "pushes the boundaries in a realistic way". In an interview in 2011, when talking about [...] "In the Pale Moonlight", Robinson compared Starfleet to Americans in general. He said [...] "we're not really {{willing to take the}} consequences of our actions, and sometimes we have to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn't exist, that Americans would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> We dealt with issues like that and I don't think... you know... the other shows really went as far as we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allen {{campaign}} officials referred {{reporters to}} Dan Cragg, a former acquaintance of Webb's. Cragg said that Webb told him in 1963 that Webb {{and members of}} his ROTC unit at the University of Southern California would [...] "hop into their cars, and would go down to Watts", taking fake rifles, and yell out epithets, [...] "point the rifles at them , pull the triggers and then drive off laughing." [...] Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: [...] "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and {{do that kind of}} thing. You'd get killed. So of course I didn't do it. I would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I would never want to do that." [...] Webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to Watts as claimed.|$|E
