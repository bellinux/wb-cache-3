5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of <b>napping</b> or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of <b>napping,</b> for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of <b>napping,</b> in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E

40|$|The {{usage of}} zerovalent iron (ZVI) {{activated}} persulfate to induce sulfate radical (SO(4) (-center dot)) oxidation of both aqueous and solid phase naphthalene (<b>Nap)</b> was investigated. It {{was determined that}} the removal of <b>Nap</b> particles occurred through an indirect route. Specifically, <b>Nap</b> released through dissolution from the pure <b>Nap</b> particles was subsequently oxidized in the aqueous phase by SO(4) (-center dot). Rapid destruction of dissolved <b>Nap</b> created a greater concentration gradient between the solid and aqueous phases. This caused more <b>Nap</b> particles to be dissolved which were then available for the subsequent oxidative destruction of dissolved <b>Nap.</b> The rate constant (k(obs,Nap)) of ZVI activated persulfate degradation of dissolved <b>Nap</b> {{was determined to be}} 3. 74 min(- 1). The overall dissolution mass transfer coefficients (k(L) a) for the <b>Nap</b> particles were determined, 3. 0 x 10 (- 2) min(- 1) with initial 10 mg <b>Nap</b> in 40 mL water, and found to be proportional to the quantities of the <b>Nap</b> particles present. The results indicate that the k(obs,Nap) is much greater than the k(L) a. The net result of the dissolution of <b>Nap</b> particles and the destruction of dissolved <b>Nap</b> by oxidation was the removal of <b>Nap</b> particles. Sequential additions of ZVI at a lower concentration to slow down the formation of SO(4) (-center dot) can preventthe scavenging of SO(4) (-center dot) by ZVI and enhance the removal of <b>Nap</b> particles. The results of the mass balance analysis during the oxidized, aqueous and solid phases of <b>Nap</b> were consistent with experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|NAPVSIPQ (<b>NAP),</b> {{an active}} {{fragment}} of the glial-derived activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, is protective at femtomolar concentrations against {{a wide array}} of neural insults and prevents ethanol-induced fetal wastage and growth retardation in mice. <b>NAP</b> also antagonizes ethanol inhibition of L 1 -mediated cell adhesion (ethanol antagonism). We performed an Ala scanning substitution of <b>NAP</b> to determine the role of ethanol antagonism and neuroprotection in <b>NAP</b> prevention of ethanol embryotoxicity. The Ser-Ile-Pro region of <b>NAP</b> was crucial for both ethanol antagonism and protection of cortical neurons from tetrodotoxin toxicity (neuroprotection). Ala replacement of either Ser- 5 or Pro- 7 (P 7 A-NAP) abolished <b>NAP</b> neuroprotection but minimally changed the efficacy of <b>NAP</b> ethanol antagonism. In contrast, Ala replacement of Ile- 6 (I 6 A-NAP) caused a decrease in potency (> 2 logarithmic orders) with only a small reduction (< 10 %) in the efficacy of <b>NAP</b> neuroprotection but markedly reduced the efficacy (50 %) and the potency (5 logarithmic orders) of <b>NAP</b> ethanol antagonism. Ethanol significantly reduced the number of paired somites in mouse whole-embryo culture; this effect was prevented significantly by 100 pM <b>NAP</b> or by 100 pM P 7 A-NAP, but not by 100 pM I 6 A-NAP. The structure–activity relation for <b>NAP</b> prevention of ethanol embryotoxicity was similar to that for <b>NAP</b> ethanol antagonism and different from that for <b>NAP</b> neuroprotection. These findings support the hypothesis that <b>NAP</b> antagonism of ethanol inhibition of L 1 adhesion plays a central role in <b>NAP</b> prevention of ethanol embryotoxicity and highlight the potential importance of ethanol effects on L 1 in the pathophysiology of fetal alcohol syndrome...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective to know the performance of floral and yield characteristics of pollen and CMS parent. Significant variation was observed for flowering and yield contributing characteristics among two CMS lines (Z 1 and Z 2) and 21 pollen parents. The pollen parent <b>Nap</b> 2019 was found as early flowering whereas the parent <b>Nap</b> 2013 was the late for first flowering. The highest length of anther was found in <b>Nap</b> 9907 and short anther in <b>Nap</b> 9905. Slender anther was produced by the genotype <b>Nap</b> 2037 and bold anther was produced by the genotype <b>Nap</b> 9907. Length of filament was the highest in <b>Nap</b> 2012 and the lowest in <b>Nap</b> 0130. For yield contributing characteristics, the genotype <b>Nap</b> 9906 matured earlier than all other genotypes while the maximum duration took by <b>Nap</b> 2013. The longest inflorescence was found in the genotype <b>Nap</b> 2001 and the smallest in <b>Nap</b> 9906. The highest number of siliqua per plant was counted in <b>Nap</b> 2066 and it was the lowest in <b>Nap</b> 9906. Wide variability in respect of number of seeds per siliqua was exhibited among the genotypes and it was the lowest in <b>Nap</b> 9901 and the highest in <b>Nap</b> 94006. In case of 1000 -seed weight, the genotype <b>Nap</b> 2022 produced larger seeds and the genotype <b>Nap</b> 9907 produced smaller seeds. The highest seed yield per plant was recorded in the genotype <b>Nap</b> 2066 and the lowest in <b>Nap</b> 9905. In case of CMSZ 1 and CMSZ 2, 50 % plants were flowered within 45 days after sowing. The CMS plant produced small, slender anther with shorter filament compare to pollen parents. The out crossing rate of CMSZ 1 and CMSZ 2 was 40. 31 % and 47. 96 %, respectively. Time required for days to 80 % maturity of CMSZ 1 and CMSZ 2 were about 106 days. The number of siliqua per plant was found the highest in CMSZ 1 and the lowest in CMSZ 2. The average number of seeds per siliqua and seed yield per plant was recorded the highest in CMSZ 1 and the lowest in CMSZ 2.

40|$|We have {{identified}} and characterized a novel proangiogenic glycoprotein (<b>NAP)</b> with mol. wt. of 67 kDa from synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Proteomic anal. of the protein revealed 29 % sequence coverage with max. identity for human retinoblastoma binding protein 2.

The proangiogenic potential of <b>NAP</b> was identified using shell less CAM, rat cornea and tumor on CAM assays. <b>NAP</b> induces expression of VEGF and Flt- 1 gene as verified by promoter reporter gene anal. Further <b>NAP</b> induces proliferation of endothelial cells and formation of tube like structures. <b>NAP</b> is also involved in migration and invasion of tumor cells. Clin. data revealed the presence of <b>NAP</b> in breast cancer biopsies. We have developed monoclonal antibody (mAb), and specific ELISA, which confirmed the presence of <b>NAP</b> in the cytosol of tumor cells. The mAb effect was evaluated with established angiogenic assays. Further, we investigated the detailed mechanism by which <b>NAP</b> induces angiogenesis. <b>NAP</b> is phosphorylated by VEGF induced activation of MAPK and JNK pathways through VEGFR 2 phosphorylation. <b>NAP</b> involves JNK pathway predominantly with further activation of NFÎºB in downstream processing of VEGF activation. Together these findings establish that <b>NAP</b> displays angiogenic properties and promotes efficient neovascularization both in vitro and in vivo models.
