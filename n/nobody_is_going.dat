500|$|Matt Pryor {{continued}} {{as part of}} The New Amsterdams, an acoustic alt-country group he had formed in 2000, expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving-door lineup. In 2007 he formed The Terrible Twos, a children's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records. Regarding the decision to make a children's album directly after the split, Pryor said [...] "I {{wanted to do it}} anyway because I have kids and I want to write songs for them, but <b>nobody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be like 'this isn't as good as the old stuff.' It's immune to punk criticism." [...] In July 2008, he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of Confidence Man, an alt-country release similar in sound to The New Amsterdams. After his second album, May Day, Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding The New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career, concluding the band's tenure with the release of Outroduction, a B-sides recording.|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, <b>nobody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the bombing campaign, Harris said, quoting the Old Testament: [...] "The Nazis entered this war under the rather childish {{delusion}} that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to bomb everyone else, and <b>nobody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to bomb them.

And it's not like everyone says, that he ruined the book. That's horseshit. <b>Nobody</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do the book. He made the book live again." ...|$|R
2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and <b>nobody</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E
