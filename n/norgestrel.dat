In contrast, the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives <b>norgestrel,</b> norethisterone, noretynodrel, and etynodiol diacetate were not found to produce such nodules.

40|$|Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is {{the name}} given {{to a group of}} {{hereditary}} diseases causing progressive and degenerative blindness. RP affects over 1 in 4000 individuals, making it the most prevalent inherited retinal disease worldwide, yet currently there is no cure. In 2011, our group released a paper detailing the protective effects of the synthetic progestin ‘Norgestrel’. A common component of the female oral contraceptive pill, <b>Norgestrel</b> was shown to protect against retinal cell death in two distinct mouse models of retinal degeneration: in the Balb/c light damage model and the Pde 6 brd 10 (rd 10) model. Little was known of the molecular workings of this compound however and thus this study aimed to elucidate the protective manner in which <b>Norgestrel</b> worked. To this aim, the 661 W cone photoreceptor-like cell line and ex vivo retinal explanting was utilised. We found that <b>Norgestrel</b> induces a increase in neuroprotective basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) with subsequent downstream actions on the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 β. Progesterone receptor expression was subsequently characterised in the C 57 and rd 10 retinas and in the 661 W cell line. <b>Norgestrel</b> caused nuclear trafficking of progesterone receptor membrane complex one (PGRMC 1) in 661 W cells and thus <b>Norgestrel</b> was hypothesised to work primarily through the actions of PGRMC 1. This trafficking was shown to be responsible for the critical upregulation of bFGF and PGRMC 1 - <b>Norgestrel</b> binding was proven to cause a neuroprotective bFGF-mediated increase in intracellular calcium. The protective properties of <b>Norgestrel</b> were further studied in the rd 10 mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa. Using non-invasive diet supplementation (80 mg/kg), we showed that <b>Norgestrel</b> gave significant retinal protection out to postnatal day 40 (P 40). Overactive microglia have previously been shown to potentiate photoreceptor cell loss in the degenerating rd 10 retina and thus we focussed on Norgestrel-mediated changes in photoreceptor-microglial crosstalk. <b>Norgestrel</b> acted to dampen pro-inflammatory microglial cell reactivity, decreasing chemokine (MCP 1, MCP 3, MIP- 1 α, MIP- 1 β) and subsequent damaging cytokine (TNFα, Il- 1 β) production. Critically, <b>Norgestrel</b> up-regulated photoreceptor-microglial, fractalkine-CX 3 CR 1 signalling 1000 -fold in the P 20 rd 10 mouse. Known to prevent microglial activation, we hypothesise that <b>Norgestrel</b> acts as a vital anti-inflammatory in the diseased retina, driving fractalkine-CX 3 CR 1 signalling to delay retinal degeneration. This study stands to highlight some of the neuroprotective mechanisms utilised by <b>Norgestrel</b> in the prevention of photoreceptor cell death. We identify for the first time, not only a pro-survival pathway activated directly in photoreceptor cells, but also a Norgestreldriven mediation of an otherwise damaging microglial cell response. All taken, these results form the beginning of a case to bring <b>Norgestrel</b> to clinical trials, as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of RP...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of <b>norgestrel</b> on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes in zebrafish eleutheroembryos. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different concentrations of <b>norgestrel</b> (0 ngL(- 1), 5 ngL(- 1), 50 ngL(- 1), and 100 ngL(- 1)) for 144 h post fertilization (hpf), and the transcriptional profiles of the HPG and HPA axes were examined every day. <b>Norgestrel</b> modulated the expression of Pgr and Vtg 1 messenger (m) RNAs mainly at 96 hpf for all treatment groups. In addition, <b>norgestrel</b> strongly altered the expression of Cyp 11 a 1 mRNA above 5 ngL(- 1) (significant upregulation from 48 hpf to 120 hpf and significant downregulation for 144 hpf). <b>Norgestrel</b> treatment could significantly induce expression of Cyp 19 a 1 a, Cyp 11 b, Gnrh 2, Gnrh 3, and Lhb mRNAs but inhibit transcripts of Hsd 11 b 2 and Crh genes above 5 ngL(- 1) at different time points. The transcriptional expression levels of Esr 1, Ar, Star, Hsd 17 b 3, Fshb, and Pomc were also mediated by 5 ngL(- 1) <b>norgestrel</b> or higher during different exposure periods. Taken together, the overall results imply that the transcriptional changes in zebrafish eleutheroembryos may pose a potential effect on embryonic development, in particular in the brain and gonadogenesis.

40|$|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a {{group of}} {{hereditary}} retinal diseases, characterised by photoreceptor cell loss. Despite a substantial understanding of the mechanisms leading to cell death, an effective therapeutic strategy is sought. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated the neuroprotective properties of <b>Norgestrel,</b> a progesterone analogue, in the degenerating retina, mediated in part by the neurotrophic factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). In other retinal studies, we have also presented a pro-survival role for reactive oxygen species (ROS), downstream of bFGF. Thus, we hypothesized that <b>Norgestrel</b> utilises bFGF-driven ROS production to promote photoreceptor survival. Using the 661 W photoreceptor-like cell line, we now show that <b>Norgestrel,</b> working through progesterone receptor membrane complex 1 (PGRMC 1); generates an early burst of pro-survival bFGF-induced ROS. Using the rd 10 mouse model of RP, we confirm that <b>Norgestrel</b> induces a similar early pro-survival increase in retinal ROS. Norgestrel-driven protection in the rd 10 retina was attenuated in the presence of antioxidants.
