40|$|The {{synthesis}} of ruthenium nanoparticles, RuNPs from the organometallic complex (4 - 1, 5 -cyclooctadiene) (6 - 1, 3, 5 -cyclooctatriene) ruthenium(0), Ru(COD) (COT) in various imidazolium derived ionic liquids, ILs: [RMIm][NTf 2] (R = CnH 2 n + 1 with n = 2; 4; 6; 8; 10), and [R 2 Im][NTf 2] (RBu) and [BMMIm][NTf 2] has been performed, under 0. 4 MPa of H 2, at 25 °C or at 0 °C {{with or without}} stirring. A relationship between the size of IL non-polar domains calculated by molecular dynamics simulation and the RuNP size measured by TEM has been found, suggesting that the phenomenon of crystal growth is probably controlled by the local concentration of Ru(COD) (COT) and consequently {{is limited to the}} size of the non-polar domains. Moreover, the rigid 3 D organization based on C 2 –Hanion bonding and chosen experimental conditions, could explain the <b>non-aggregation</b> <b>of</b> RuNPs...|$|R
40|$|A paper-based laboratory-on-a-chip assay for {{the rapid}} {{detection}} {{of a highly}} pathogenic strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) was developed for the first time. The single-unit chip was simply fabricated using Whatman filter paper and plastic lamination. The chip measured 2. 5 3. 0 cm 2 and was divided into two parts, one for nucleic acid amplification {{and the other for}} signal detection. The HP-PRRSV assay was performed by specific ORF I Nsp 2 gene amplification via an isothermal reverse transcription loop-mediated DNA amplification platform, whereas the cDNA signal detection was performed by visual observation of colorimetric changes in blue silver nanoplates (AgNPls). Positive results caused <b>non-aggregation</b> <b>of</b> the blue AgNPls on the detection pad, whereas negative results induced colorimetric changes in the AgNPls from blue to colourless on the pad. The assay had a limit of detection of 100 copies of the target Nsp 2 gene and high specificity for other types of infectious viruses. The assay required only one hour to complete. This work demonstrates a simple and rapid assay for viruses using a simple, low-cost, paper-based chip...|$|R

Can a tiny gain to sufficiently many well-off justify imposing a much larger sacrifice on the worst-off? We show that if one answers negatively to such a question and endorses replication invariance, one is forced to accept the maximin principle and give full priority to the worst-off even when a tiny gain to the worst-off imposes a substantial sacrifice on arbitrarily many well-off.

Income protection effects, derived from the empirical analysis of household income and expenditures surveys, pertain to the coverage, the average size <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> in household income, and the targeting <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> Efficiency effects, obtained from a literature review, {{are related to the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> on the duration of unemployment spell, restructuring, and overall unemployment and employment rates.
