5|$|On August 10, 2005, ABC aired {{a two-hour}} special, Peter Jennings: Reporter, with archival clips of his reports and {{interviews}} with colleagues and friends. The special drew more than nine million viewers, and was the most watched television program of the night. For the week of his death, World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> placed {{number one in the}} ratings race {{for the first time since}} June 2004.|$|E
5|$|Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings, CM (July 29, 1938August 7, 2005) was a Canadian-American {{journalist}} {{who served as}} the sole anchor of ABC World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> for 22 years from 1983 until his death from lung cancer in 2005. Despite dropping out of high school, he transformed himself into one of American television's most prominent journalists.|$|E
5|$|The early 1990s {{also served}} up {{a series of}} {{difficult}} experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in Newsday. The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton {{was having an affair with}} Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen. In January 1994, he locked horns with his executive producer on World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight,</b> Emily Rooney. The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings on the defensive.|$|E

5|$|With another presidential {{election}} {{taking place in}} 2000, Jennings had some more political reporting duties that year. On January 5, Jennings moderated the Democratic primary debate, held at the University of New Hampshire. He hosted the primetime news special The Dark Horizon: India, Pakistan, and the Bomb, which ABC broadcast on March 22, as then-President Clinton began his trip to the region. Jennings was the only American news anchor to travel to India for Clinton's trip. Paul A. Slavin became the new executive producer for World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> in April.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers local {{coverage}} area includes Philadelphia, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey. In Pennsylvania, The Inquirer maintains bureaus in Conshohocken; Doylestown; Media; West Chester; and Norristown, while in New Jersey it has bureaus in Cherry Hill and Margate. In September 1994 The Inquirer and WPHL-TV co-produced a 10:00p.m. newscast called Inquirer <b>News</b> <b>Tonight.</b> The show lasted {{a year before}} WPHL-TV took complete control over the program and was renamed WB17 News at Ten. In 2004, The Inquirer formed a partnership with Philadelphia's NBC station, WCAU, giving the paper access to WCAU's weather forecasts while also contributing to news segments throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight,</b> however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E

5|$|None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake {{the nightly}} ratings crown, but World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> still offered stiff {{competition}} at second place. As the millennium approached, Jennings {{and the network}} started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century. The anchor teamed with former Life magazine journalist Todd Brewster to pen The Century, a 606-page book on 20th-century America. Designed as a companion book for ABC's upcoming documentary series of the same name, the book topped The New York Times Best Seller list in December 1998, a month after it debuted. On March 29, 1999, Jennings anchored the first installment of ABC's 12-hour miniseries, The Century; production on the monumental project started in 1990, {{and by the time}} it aired, it had cost the network $25 million. Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, , on the History Channel in April 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} September 11 added {{new meaning to}} In Search of America, the project Jennings and Brewster started after {{the success of their}} {{previous}} collaboration. The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many of the people they had interviewed to see how the events had affected them. To promote the book, the anchor and World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, 50 States/One Nation/One Year. Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, In Search of America failed to generate much interest or sales.|$|E
25|$|Schieffer led the CBS Evening News {{to become}} the #2 evening news broadcast, ahead of ABC's World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight.</b> The death of anchor Peter Jennings in 2005 coupled with the {{adoption}} of a dual-anchor format on World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> and life-threatening injuries suffered by Bob Woodruff when an Iraqi military convoy he rode in hit a road-side bomb, leaving Elizabeth Vargas as sole anchor, in January 2006 put the ABC News division in flux. When Charles Gibson was appointed as anchor of World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight,</b> ABC regained stability and momentum to regain the #2 spot. Bob Schieffer's final broadcast of the CBS Evening News occurred on August 31, 2006. Russ Mitchell filled in for the following two nights (September 1 and 4), after which he was succeeded on September 5 by Katie Couric.|$|E

25|$|While Rather had {{inherited}} Cronkite's ratings lead, {{the success of}} the Evening News with Rather at the helm fluctuated wildly. After a dip to second place, Rather regained the top spot in 1985 until 1989 when he ceded the ratings peak to rival Peter Jennings at ABC's World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight.</b> By 1992, however, the Evening News had fallen to third place where it remained until Bob Schieffer who acted as the interim anchor between Rather and Katie Couric saw the Evening News rise to #2 ahead of ABC World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> {{in the wake of the}} death of Peter Jennings but remaining behind NBC Nightly News. Rather has been a frequent collaborator with CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky, who was producer of the news while he was a reporter and anchor.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that the program's executive producer Rome Hartman was being replaced by television news veteran Rick Kaplan.

25|$|Under Rather's {{predecessor}} Walter Cronkite, CBS Evening News was {{a strong}} #1 in the ratings, and Rather maintained a small ratings lead {{for a few years}} among the networks' news broadcasts through the early 1980s. However, Tom Brokaw and his NBC Nightly News, and Peter Jennings of ABC News' World <b>News</b> <b>Tonight</b> both became more popular than Rather's broadcast.|$|E
