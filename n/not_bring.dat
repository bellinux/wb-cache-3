5|$|Although {{the death}} of Apokaukos did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> about the {{immediate}} collapse of the regency, it removed the main instigator {{of the civil war}} and one of its chief protagonists, and resulted in dissension and defections in the regency's camp. It therefore {{marked the beginning of the}} war's end, which would come with Kantakouzenos's entry into Constantinople on 3 February 1347.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were not}} to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad was old, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements. Although Arsenal were {{competitive}} during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club {{spent most of the}} 1950s and 1960s in midleague mediocrity. Even former England captain Billy Wright could <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.|$|E

5|$|Louis XVIII chose many centrist cabinets, as {{he wanted}} to appease the populace, much {{to the dismay of}} his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the day he would die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would abandon the centrist {{government}} for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> favourable results.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{argue that}} no matter how much Greece and Portugal drive down their wages, they could never compete with {{low-cost}} developing countries such as China or India. Instead weak European countries must shift their economies to higher quality products and services, though this is a long-term process and may <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> immediate relief.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Platine War did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> a halt to {{conflict}} in the region. Peace remained out of reach in Uruguay, which remained unstable and {{in a state of}} constant crisis due to continuing internecine strife between the Blancos and Colorados. Border disputes, power struggles among diverse regional factions, and attempts to establish regional and internal influence would eventually spark the Uruguayan War as well as the later Paraguayan War.|$|E

5|$|Weakening as {{it crossed}} the peninsula, Dean emerged into the Bay of Campeche and re-strengthened {{before making a}} second {{landfall}} in Veracruz. Although the second landfall did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> winds as intense as the first, it brought more rainfall and caused devastating landslides in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Between the two landfalls, Dean caused MXN$2billion (US$184million; 2007dollars) of damage and killed 13people.|$|E
5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt that she did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role {{is that of a}} surrogate audience.|$|E
5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the railway in only seven years, its opening did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> the financial success {{that had been}} expected. In the Piccadilly Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 26million passengers, {{less than half of}} the 60million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR – in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E

5|$|Due to an archaic law in Erie County, {{the town}} of Tonawanda and {{the town of}} Amherst, who {{completed}} the road in 1925, were requested in 1935 to take over $2million (1935USD) in debts bonded for its construction. The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new road a financial burden for the county. To make things worse, the new road did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake {{on the part of the}} county and towns.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged {{by their}} fairly {{successful}} basketball program and facilities, Owumi began attending the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) {{for his next}} year. He joined the team, which competed in the NJCAA, as a co-captain under coach Dave Chevalier with hopes of returning to NCAA Division I in the future. Owumi brought CCRI to its first NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship appearance in four years by defeating Lackawanna College on March 13, 2005. However, the team did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> one of its best defenders, and they were eventually beaten. Owumi earned second-team NJCAA All-American honors, becoming the sixth in school history to do so.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 {{received}} a mixed response; some critics {{felt that the}} film was formulaic and did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> anything new to the franchise while others praised it for being enjoyable and offering its audience what it wishes to see. Attention was given especially to death scenes involving a tanning bed and a nail gun respectively; these were favorably received, as was Winstead's performance. The film was a financial success and, {{at the time of}} its release, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise. The film was followed by two sequels—The Final Destination and Final Destination 5—released in 2009 and 2011, respectively.|$|E

When they told the cook they had seen nothing but the rosebush and the rose, she scolded them for <b>not</b> <b>bringing</b> back the rose. They went again, and Fundevogel became a church, and Lenchen a chandelier in it. They returned and told the cook what they had seen, and she scolded them for <b>not</b> <b>bringing</b> back the chandelier.|$|R

5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Additionally, human rights analysts found that between 5,000 and 8,000 underage girls were married to UNITA militants. Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> back enough to satisfy their commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women, who were often then sexually abused. The Angolan government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the Angolan army, and had relocated 70 of them by November 2002, but the government continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Mrs. Jill Winkler Rath, {{widow of}} {{publicist}} Otto Winkler, filed a $100,000 {{lawsuit against the}} $2,000,000 estate of Clark Gable in connection with Winkler's death in the plane crash with Carole Lombard. The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mrs. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> suit against the airline involved. Mrs. Rath stated she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so {{because he did not}} want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.|$|E
5|$|In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces {{won their}} first major victory at Taierzhuang {{but then the}} city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by {{flooding}} the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the city was taken by October. Japanese military victories did <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.|$|E
