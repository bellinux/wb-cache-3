5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored.</b> One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored.</b> In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{were well}} aware that their victory was still fragile, and {{that as soon as}} the Parthian king had dealt with the Hyrcanian rebellion, he would turn his {{attention}} to Armenia. Despite Vologases' reluctance to risk an all-out conflict with Rome, in the end, he was forced to act when Tigranes raided the Parthian province of Adiabene in 61. The enraged protests of its governor Monobazus, and his pleas for protection, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> by Vologases, whose prestige and royal authority were at stake. Vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with the Hyrcanians so as to be free to campaign against Rome, and called an assembly of the grandees of his realm. There he publicly reaffirmed Tiridates' position as king of Armenia by crowning him with a diadem. In order to reinstall his brother on the Armenian throne, the Parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under Monaeses, complemented by infantry from Adiabene.|$|E

5|$|At 3pm, the Cabildo {{began its}} routine work, but was {{interrupted}} by 600armed men named the Infernal Legion, who occupied the Plaza de la Victoria and loudly demanded the convening of an open cabildo and the resignation of Viceroy Cisneros. They carried a portrait of FerdinandVII and the lapels of their jackets bore a white ribbon that symbolized criollo–Spanish unity. Domingo French, the mail carrier of the city, and Antonio Beruti, {{an employee of the}} treasury, led the rioters. It was rumored that Cisneros had been killed, and that Saavedra would take control of the government. Saavedra was at the barracks at that moment, concerned about the demonstration. He thought the violence should be stopped and that radical measures such as the assassination of Cisneros should be prevented, but he also thought that the troops would mutiny if the demonstrations were suppressed. The people in the Plaza did not believe that Cisneros would allow the open cabildo the next day. Leiva left the Cabildo, and Belgrano, who was representing the crowd, requested a definitive commitment. Leiva explained that everything would go ahead as planned, but the Cabildo needed time to prepare. He asked Belgrano to help the Cabildo with the work, as his intervention would be seen by the crowd as a guarantee that their demands would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored.</b> The crowd left the main hall but stayed in the Plaza. Belgrano protested about the guest list, which consisted of the wealthiest citizens, and thought that if the poor people were left outside there would be further unrest. The members of the Cabildo tried to convince him to give his support, but he left.|$|E

25|$|By 480 BC, Gelo, {{the tyrant}} leader of Greek Syracuse, backed {{in part by}} support from other Greek city-states, was {{attempting}} to unite the island under his rule.

25|$|The Spanish empire {{had still}} not {{returned}} to first-rate power status, {{but it had}} recovered and even extended its territories considerably from the dark days {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century when it was, and particularly in continental matters, at the mercy of other powers' political deals. The relatively more peaceful century under the new monarchy had allowed it to rebuild and start the long process of modernizing its institutions and economy.

25|$|The {{importance}} of tobacco to soldiers was early on recognized {{as something that}} could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> by commanders. By the 17th century allowances of tobacco were a standard part of the naval rations of many nations and by World War I cigarette manufacturers and governments collaborated in securing tobacco and cigarette allowances to soldiers in the field. It was asserted that regular use of tobacco while under duress would not only calm the soldiers but allow them to withstand greater hardship. Until the mid-20th century, {{the majority of the}} adult population in many Western nations were smokers and the claims of anti-smoking activists were met with much skepticism, if not outright contempt. Today the movement has considerably more weight and evidence of its claims, but a considerable proportion of the population remains steadfast smokers.|$|E
25|$|Other scholars, {{propose a}} period between 7th and 6th century, for example, c. 650–600 BCE or 559–522 BCE. The latest {{possible}} date is the mid 6th century, {{at the time}} of Achaemenid Empire's Darius I, or his predecessor Cyrus the Great. This date gains credence mainly on the thesis that certain figures must be based on historical facts, thus some have related the mythical Vishtaspa with Darius I's father Vishtaspa (or Hystaspes in Greek) with the account on Zoroasters life. However, in the Avesta it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> that Vishtaspa's son became the ruler of the Persian Empire, Darius I would not ignore to include his patron-father in the Behistun Inscription. A different proposed conclusion is that Darius I's father was named in honor of the Zoroastrian patron, indicating possible Zoroastrian faith by Arsames.|$|E

25|$|The Army of the Rhine {{was formed}} on 5 July 1799 by Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, {{who was the}} Minister of War. The army was {{responsible}} for an area along the Rhine River from Neuf-Brisach on the south to Düsseldorf on the north, including the fortresses of Breisach, Kehl, Strasbourg, Landau, Mannheim, Mainz, Ehrenbreitstein and Luxembourg. The French reported {{the strength of the}} army as 40,000 to 60,000 men, but this was a ruse to trick the Austrians. In fact, much of the army's strength was tied up in garrisons and {{it is unlikely that the}} number of troops available for field operations exceeded 18,000. The purpose of the Army of the Rhine was to lure the Austrian army away from Masséna. This could be achieved by menacing Archduke Charles' supply line, which ran northeast from Switzerland to Ulm on the Danube River. The army was too weak to fight the Austrians in a pitched battle, but it was enough of a threat that it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored.</b>|$|E
25|$|General Erich von Falkenhayn {{replaced}} Colonel-General Helmuth von Moltke the Younger as Chief of the German General Staff on 14 September, {{when the}} German front in France was being consolidated in Lorraine {{and on the}} Aisne. The open western flank beyond the 1st Army and the danger of attacks from the National redoubt of Belgium, where the Siege of Antwerp had begun on 20 August, created a dilemma in which the German positions had to be maintained, when only offensive operations could lead to decisive victory. Appeals for the reinforcement of the Eastern Front could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored</b> and Falkenhayn cancelled {{a plan for the}} 6th Army to break through near Verdun and ordered that it move across France to {{the right wing of the}} German armies. The flank of 1st Army was at Compiègne, beyond which there were no German forces until Antwerp. Falkenhayn could reinforce the 1st Army with the 6th Army, send it to Antwerp or divide the army by reinforcing the 1st Army and the Antwerp siege with part of the army, while the rest operated in the area between.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} the USAF issued a General Operating Requirement for a {{supersonic}} trainer, planning to retire its 1940s-era Lockheed T-33s. Northrop officials decided {{to adapt the}} N-156 to this competition. The only other candidate was the two-seat version of the North American F-100 Super Sabre. Although the F-100 was not considered the ideal candidate for a training aircraft (it is not capable of recovering from a spin), NAA was still considered the favorite in the competition due to that company's favored-contractor status with the Air Force. However, Northrop officials convincingly presented life-cycle cost comparisons which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ignored,</b> and they were awarded the contract, receiving an order for three prototypes. The first (designated YT-38) flew on 10 March 1959. The type was quickly adopted and the first production examples were delivered in 1961, officially entering service on 17 March that year, complementing the T-37 primary jet trainer. When production ended in 1972, 1,187 T-38s had been built (plus two N-156T prototypes). Since its introduction, {{it is estimated that}} some 50,000 military pilots have trained on this aircraft. The USAF remains one of the few armed flying forces using dedicated supersonic final trainers, as most, such as the US Navy, use high subsonic trainers.|$|E
