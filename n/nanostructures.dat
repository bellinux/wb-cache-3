25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} <b>nanostructures,</b> because each adsorbate molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold. The terminal group is then modified to attract a specific material like a particular nanoparticle, wire, ribbon, or other nanostructure. In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be <b>nanostructures</b> attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align single wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. Dip pen nanolithography was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was passivated with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The polar solvent that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces. The nanotubes thus line up with the MHA-ODT boundary. Using this technique Chad Mirkin, Schatz and their co-workers were able to make complex two-dimensional shapes, a representation of a shape created is shown to the right.|$|E

25|$|A new {{aspect of}} the polaron concept has been {{investigated}} for semiconductor nanostructures: the exciton-phonon states are not factorizable into an adiabatic product Ansatz, so that a non-adiabatic treatment is needed. The non-adiabaticity of the exciton-phonon systems leads to a strong enhancement of the phonon-assisted transition probabilities (as compared to those treated adiabatically) and to multiphonon optical spectra that are considerably different from the Franck-Condon progression even for small values of the electron-phonon coupling constant {{as is the case}} for typical semiconductor <b>nanostructures.</b>|$|E
25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented near-field enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic <b>nanostructures.</b> The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating light propagation, absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic <b>nanostructures.</b> Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general design rule, tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The design rule suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to hole mobility ratio. In other words, the transport time of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) should be the same. The general design rule can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of space charge limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E

Therefore, to improve its characteristics, {{the aim of the}} present work was the formulation of <b>nanostructured</b> lipid carriers as drug delivery systems for topical administration of sesamol. Two different <b>nanostructured</b> lipid carrier systems have been produced based on the same solid lipid (Compritol® 888 ATO) but in a mixture with two different kinds of oil phase such as Miglyol® 812 (<b>nanostructured</b> lipid carrier-M) and sesame oil (<b>nanostructured</b> lipid carrier-PLUS). Morphology and dimensional distribution of <b>nanostructured</b> lipid carriers have been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and photon correlation spectroscopy, respectively.

The deposition solution was carried out under voltammetric control with a solution made from iridium tetrachloride, hydrogen peroxide, oxalic acid and potassium carbonate based on a recipe reported by Yamanaka (Anodically Electrodeposited Iridium Oxide-Films (AEIROF) from Alkaline-Solutions for Electrochromic Display Devices, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. Part 1 - Regul. Pap. Short Notes Rev. Pap. 1989, 28, 632). Both non structured and <b>nanostructured</b> IrOx films were grown with the deposition solution. During the voltammetry, the growth of the film was followed by monitoring the cathodic peaks and anodic peaks which reflect redox reactions Ir(?) / Ir(IV) and Ir(IV) / Ir(V) within the IrOx oxide film. During the deposition, the peak currents increase almost linearly with the number of voltammetric cycles thus allowing a fine control of the deposition process. Several attempts were made to estimate the film thickness and establish a relationship between film thickness and deposition cycles. The thickness of the <b>nanostructured</b> films is particularly difficult to measure accurately. Following deposition, the electrochemistry of the <b>nanostructured</b> IrOx films was characterised with cyclic voltammetry in both acid and base solutions. Optical properties of the <b>nanostructured</b> IrOx films were investigated. The transmittance of a <b>nanostructured</b> IrOx films was measured with transparent ITO substrates.
