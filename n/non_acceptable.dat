40|$|International audienceMulti-Path OLSR is an {{extension}} of the single path routing protocol OLSR. The QoS has been demonstrated in simulation and testbed. In this paper, we attempt to confirm those results at the application layer specially for critical applications as video services over wireless networks. The standard H 264 /SVC is chosen for its enormous potential in video delivery in lossy networks. Still vulnerable to packet losses, we combine the scalable source coding to an Unequal Error Protection (UEP) scheme in order to improve a simple Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements i. e PSNR. In a new simulation framework called SVCEval, the combination of path diversity and scalable protection insures a significant 2 dB gain in QoE for sensitive contents and mobile scenarios in comparison with just MP-OLSR. Within the same context, single path strategy delivers <b>non</b> <b>acceptable</b> video services as soon as nodes are mobile...|$|E
30|$|This process, which spans from {{acquiring}} {{information to}} check for relevant changes, to actually enacting adaptations, {{is known as the}} control or feedback loop model in the literature associated to control theory, autonomic computing, robotics or artificial intelligence (Gat 1998; Nilsson 1980). Its implementation involves four components responsible for monitoring, analysing, planning and executing changes, as defined in the MAPE(-K) reference model (IBM Corp 2004; Kephart and Chess 2003). In self-adaptive software this model is realised by monitoring the environment and probing the system’s attributes; analysing the data collected to infer situations in need for adaptation; deciding the adaptation strategy; and finally, enacting reconfigurations to enforce the system’s adaptation into <b>acceptable</b> (<b>non</b> disruptive) configurations (Brun et al. 2009; Dobson et al. 2006; Villegas Machado et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} verifying {{the effect of}} the chronic {{ingestion}} of caffeine on body weight and adiposity of Wistar rats. Sixteen male Wistar rats weighting on average 240 g were divided into two groups, one control and the other caffeine-treated (5 mg kg- 1, orally) for five weeks. At the end, the groups were evaluated for their differences in body weight; weight of the periepididymal, retroperitoneal, subcutaneous and mesenteric fat pads; size of the retroperitoneal adipocytes; liver and heart weight; glycemia and plasma lipids. Statistically significant differences were observed in adipocyte size and total serum cholesterol, while the results for the other parameters were not statistically different. Therefore, this study showed that, using an oral dose of caffeine within <b>acceptable</b> (<b>non</b> toxic) limits, it is possible {{to reduce the size of}} adipocytes of non-obese Wistar rats, as well as to reduce the serum cholesterol levels, even in the absence of physical activity or other active compounds...|$|R

40|$|A {{new model}} for human control skills is {{proposed}} and evaluated. The new model has {{two levels of}} decision {{and is based on}} the conjecture that humans use an "incremental correction" strategy to do real-time control. Level one of the model decides whether the situation is acceptable or not. An acceptable situation requires no change in the control values. A <b>non</b> <b>acceptable</b> situation initiates a sequence of control variable corrections until the situation is back to an acceptable status. Whenever a change in a control variable is made a delay is introduced to account for the time the human waits for the effects of the control variable correction to be perceivable. The results show a substantial increase in robustness of the controllers (Definition A. 4) when compared with controllers using the previously proposed Goals Model. A decrease in the complexity of the model codification structure is also achieved. The simulation-time results are very close to the human performance measurements on [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{and describes}} an innovative modelling approach which utilises models that are synthesised through approximate calculations of user actions and extensive representation {{of knowledge about}} how to perform these actions. The Intention modelling approach is based on theories of cognitive and task modelling {{as well as on}} theories of intention, rational action and plan recognition. Intention Models (IMs) have been used in the detection of malicious attacks which usually do not consist of illegal actions, but of a set of actions individually acceptable to the system which at a higher level may form <b>non</b> <b>acceptable</b> task(s). A first effort at implementing these models for a real application was for the creation of the UII system, a research prototype for the detection of anomalous behaviour of network users obtained by reasoning about the characterisation of their intentions.

40|$|In {{medieval times}} it was common prac­tise to reuse old books by erasing the writing and {{preparing}} the parchment to be written upon again. In these cases the previously written text was often erased chemically by means of bleach or other reagents, thus just removing the organic compound of the ink, but leaving the metallic part at its place. Since Late Antiquity, scribes used iron gall ink when writing on parchment since such ink was fairly easy to manufacture and produced durable writing on this material. The historic vitriols used for iron gall ink always contained several metallic impurities, varying in kind and amount on the vitriols origin. The metallic fingerprint of the respective vitriol incorporated in the ink can nowadays be used to correlate texts from one author to different times or help when trying to recover script in iron gall ink hidden or erased. In many cases, the removed writing was, is or could be {{of great interest to}} modern textual scholar­ship. In order to re-access this writing <b>non</b> destructively <b>acceptable</b> standard modern techniques include photographic imaging, in particular with multi-spectral and ul­tra­violet light. The use of X-rays, in particular X-ray fluorescence (XRF), allows an element specific probing of the writing, even if this is covered, hidden or erased. By using a small X-ray spot and scanning the writing, one can measure the elemental distribution on the parchment and after deconvolution of the different writings (making use of their different metallic fingerprints), allows to access the hidden or erased text or texts. On the Archimedes Palimpsest, the technique of hard X-ray fluorescence element mapping was first used in 2006 to make the hidden iron gall ink script visible. In this successful recovery of a hid­den script, it was also shown that scanning with high flux X-ray light to measure the local X-ray fluor­escence one minimizes possible damage or wear on the parchment to acceptable levels...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In medicine, ergonomics, the clothing Industry and many other {{areas such as the}} design of 'g' suits for military aeroplane pilots and protective clothing for chemical warfare, there is a requirement for the accurate 3 -D measurement of {{the size and shape of}} the human form. To meet this need a novel whole body scanner has been designed which is capable of measuring both the size and shape of people in a <b>non</b> invasive socially <b>acceptable</b> manner. The scanner uses structured light and an array of television cameras to view free standing subjects while they are being rotated on an electrically driven turntable. The accuracy and repeatability of the scanner is as good as trained anthropometrists using traditional manual methods. A computer program has been written which uses a cubic spline interpolation method to edit and interrogate the data from the scanner and arrange it in a shape matrix form. This is a new way of arranging the data which allows for the 3 -D average of several bodies to be obtained and also for the comparison of one body with another. A technique which is essential if 3 -D survey work is to be undertaken. Using master files which contain information from a data base of previously scanned people and eight circumferential measurements it is possible to re-create body forms of any size but which correspond to the average shape for that size. The re-creation of body shapes from eight circumferences is accurate enough for the manufacture of all but the most close fitting garments but may be more useful in the future as a replacement for somatotyping (physique classification). It is perfectly possible to manipulate the eight circumferences to create body torsos of almost any shape. Conversely a torso of almost any shape could be defined by eight two digit numbers...|$|R

Study objectives were, to determine current overall level of customer satisfaction towards services offered, to establish overall level of customer satisfaction with various dimensions of quality service delivery, and to determine level of satisfaction with methods of interaction used by MNC. A cross sectional survey research design was used to conduct the study. Responses on dimensions of service quality based on SERVQUAL/RATER model were obtained. Actual visits to MCN showed highest usage rate however, only 18 % of respondents were very satisfied with the method.

The research is to identify both the positive and negative effects caused by the various means of gender advertising. The use of gender advertising can either make or break a brand image. The recognition of these effects will in turn contribute to positive usage of gender advertising that does not go beyond the purpose of selling brands to consumer. The method employed is the in-depth interview aided with visual representations to 30 respondents of both genders selectively chosen with criteria either they have involved with the product categories chosen or has had prior brand relationships.

40|$|Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a {{powerful}} cryptographic tool that allows fine-grained access control over data. Due to its features, ABE has been adopted in several applications, such as encrypted storage or access control systems. Recently, researchers argued about the <b>non</b> <b>acceptable</b> performance of ABE when implemented on mobile devices. Indeed, the non feasibility of ABE on mobile devices would hinder the deployment of novel protocols and services [...] that could instead exploit the full potential of such devices. However, we believe the conclusion of non usability was driven by a not-very efficient implementation. In this paper, we want to shine a light on this concern by studying the feasibility of applying ABE on smartphone devices. In particular, we implemented AndrABEn, an ABE library for Android operating system. Our library is written in the C language and implements two main ABE schemes: Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, and Key- Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. We also run a thorough set of experimental evaluation for AndrABEn, and compare it with the current state-of-the-art (considering the same experimental setting). The results confirm the possibility to effectively use ABE on smartphone devices, requiring an acceptable amount of resources in terms of computations and energy consumption. Since the current state-of-the-art claims the non feasibility of ABE on mobile devices, we believe that our study (together with the AndrABEn library that we made available online) is a key result that will {{pave the way for}} researchers and developers to design and implement novel protocols and applications for mobile devices.

40|$|Introduction: Subjective {{estimation}} of neuromuscular block (NMB), focused on clinical signs such as visual and tactile estimation, {{can be very}} difficult and conducted only on awake patients. Hence, it seems that usage of NMB's objective monitoring should become a component of anaestesiological equipment. Objective: The objective was to establish whether application of acceleromyography using the post-tetanic number method (PTC) for NMB's monitoring creates better conditions for surgical work in comparison to subjective, clinical monitoring of NMB. Materials and methods: This randomized clinical study included 40 patients, operated in the General surgery clinic of Clinical center in Nis. Patients were divided into 2 groups consisting of 20 patients each (n= 20). Subjective, clinical monitoring of NMB was used on patients in the first group (ESMkon) in all phases of anaesthesiological flow, while PTC mode (TOF Watch® S) based acceleromyographical monitoring in different phases of NMB was used on the patients in the second group (ESMptc). The conditions were qualitatively graded as acceptable and <b>non</b> <b>acceptable,</b> as well as exceptional, satisfying and difficult, and they were mutually compared between examined groups. Statistical significance is estimated with Fisher's exact test and taken as p< 0. 05. Results: Surgical conditions were marked as clinically unacceptable {{in the moment of}} adding relaxant in 8 (20 %) out of total number of examinees, unlike ESMptc group which did not have unacceptable conditions (p< 0. 01). The number of bad marked surgical conditions in ESMkon takes 8 out of 20, unlike ESMptc group which did not have bad marked conditions, {{but on the other hand}} it had 17 out of 20 marked as exceptional (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The degree of surgical relaxation is better secured by NMB monitoring by using PTC mode based acceleromyograph in comparison with anaesthesiologist's and surgeon's subjective estimation based monitoring. The greatest number of exceptional surgical conditions was available in ESMptc group, unlike bad surgical conditions which were based in ESMkon group exclusively...|$|E
40|$|This Master thesis {{consists}} of a literature review on surface integrity after milling with ceramic tools in nickel‐based super alloys. Examples of turning and milling with carbide tools have also been included, due to little literature on the above. The effect of cutting fluids in ceramic milling operations, {{and the effect of}} high pressure cooling in turning operations have been reviewed. Last the possibilities of using a Finite Element Analysis (FEM) program, to study the effect of high pressure cooling in turning operations have been reviewed. There have been done machining tests with two different milling cutters on NTNU (32 and 63 mmcutters). One of the tests was not successful (32 mm cutter), while the other (63 mm) showed a large improvement potential for Volvo Aero Norway (VAN). In a comparative analysis of tool life, VAN’s existing tool supplier showed better results than two other tool supplier companies. Regrinded tools,gave an equivalent or marginally worse tool life. The effect of cutting fluids in ceramic milling operations was studied. The use of flood cooling gave a <b>non</b> <b>acceptable</b> tool life, while use of Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL), (application of pure cutting fluid with a flow rate of 20 – 90 ml/h) gave a marginally worse tool life. Surface integrity after ceramic milling was studied in a separate experiment. The work piece was cut up in pieces, and polished so the thickness of the deformed layer could be studied in a microscope(30 – 60 μm). This experiment was repeated with a lower radial cut and the use of MQL, this resulted in a thinner deformed layer (9 – 13 μm), unfortunately this was not within VAN’s 5 μm requirement. The improvement potential in today’s ceramic milling operations was calculated during two machining tests at VAN. When the cutting speed and feed was increased (from Vc(nom) = 1100 to 1283 m/min, and from fz = 0. 08 to 0. 10 mm/tooth), the productivity increased by 46 %. Since the tool life was the same, a cost saving of 23 and 25 % can be achieved for the 80 and 63 mm cutter respectively. If the machining centre had coped with the increased spindle load, the recommended parameters from the NTNU tests could have been used (Vc(nom) = 1283 m/min, fz = 0. 16 mm/tooth). This would have increased the total productivity with 133 % and a cost saving of 50 and 58 %. An economic analysis show that VAN can reduce costs if they regrind used ceramic inserts in USA, but that they must incorporate a insert size in between of their two current sized, to get an acceptable cost saving. The large cost saving potential found in the fall project (Barstad, 2009), has disappeared due to VAN’s exceptionally negotiation of the purchase price of ceramic inserts (47 ‐ 64 % reduction). The literature review reveal that no realistic FEM models of the effect of high pressure cooling in turning operations exists. Therefore it was only performed a simple FEM analysis of turning with ceramic tools in a nickel‐based super alloy. A low cutting speed (10 m/min) had to be used, since the program did not accept high cutting speeds (300 m/min) in this alloy. In connection with the project presentation at VAN, a movie regarding milling with ceramic tools, and a Power Point Presentation was made. </p...|$|E
