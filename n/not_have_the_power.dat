5|$|The Parliament {{is based}} in three {{different}} cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is the only assembly {{in the world with}} more than one meeting place {{and one of the few}} that does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to decide its own location.|$|E
5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline inspection system mirrors that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches of party discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches of party discipline. Since the CCDI does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to prosecute, {{it is supposed to}} transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes no transfer) of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|E

50|$|In 1965, SATS Security Services {{originally}} {{started as}} the Malayan Airways Security Department. Its existence back then {{was to meet}} the security and aviation needs of its aircraft and to a certain extent, the Paya Lebar Airport.

5|$|On 31 December 2014, Modi {{announced}} that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission was {{a legacy of the}} Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike the planning commission, it does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to allocate funds. The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.|$|E
5|$|That night, Castelli and Saavedra {{informed}} Cisneros {{of their}} resignation from {{the newly formed}} Junta. They explained that the population {{was on the verge}} of violent revolution and would remove Cisneros by force if he did not resign as well. They warned that they did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to stop that: neither Castelli to stop his friends, nor Saavedra to prevent the Regiment of Patricians from mutiny. Cisneros wanted to wait for the following day, but they said that there was no time for further delays, so he finally agreed to resign. He sent a resignation letter to the Cabildo for consideration on the following day. Chiclana felt encouraged when Saavedra resigned, and started to request signatures for a manifesto about the will of the people. Moreno refused any further involvement, but Castelli and Peña trusted that he would eventually join them if events unfolded as they expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{families}} of those executed continued to seek the overturning of the sentences and compensation, based on the irregularity of the processes used to convict their relatives. In 2004, they appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain, which rejected their application {{on the grounds that}} it did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to deal with cases prior to December 1978, when the Constitution came into effect. In September 2005, the European Court of Human Rights rejected their petition on similar grounds: that Spain had not been a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights in 1975. In November 2012, a Basque Government commission found that the processes used to convict Txiki and Otaegui had violated their right to a fair trial and awarded €135,000 in compensation to their families. Flor Baena, the sister of José Humberto Baena, continued to campaign for her brother, stating that she wanted to clear his name, not financial compensation.|$|E
50|$|The canal company {{decided that}} it did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> to {{delegate}} construction of the arm to the consortium, and so completed {{the construction of the}} original route using money borrowed from the businessmen. It was opened on 6 July 1808. The Act of Parliament needed to authorise the extension was not applied for until 1809, and the extra quarter mile (0.4 km) of canal was opened in 1811, featuring a narrow triangular basin at its terminus, rather than the rectangular one shown on the plans.|$|R

5|$|Every five years, two censors {{were elected}} for an eighteen-month term. Since the {{censorship}} {{was the most}} prestigious of all offices, usually only former consuls were elected to it. Censors were elected by the assembly of Roman Soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly, usually after the new consuls and praetors for the year began their term. After the censors had been elected, the Centuriate Assembly granted the new censors censorial power. Censors did not have imperium powers, {{and they were not}} accompanied by any lictors. In addition, they did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to convene the Roman Senate or Roman assemblies. Technically they outranked all other ordinary magistrates (including consuls and praetors). This ranking, however, was solely a result of their prestige, rather than any real power they had. Since the office could be easily abused (as a result of its power over every ordinary citizen), only former consuls (usually patrician consuls) were elected to the office. This is what gave the office its prestige. Their actions could not be vetoed by any magistrate other than a plebeian tribune, or a fellow censor. No other ordinary magistrate could veto a censor because no ordinary magistrate technically outranked a censor. Tribunes, by virtue of their sacrosanctity as the representatives of the people, could veto anything or anyone. Censors usually did not have to act in unison, but if a censor wanted to reduce the status of a citizen in a census, he had to act in unison with his colleague.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the aliens}} finish their {{evaluation}} and decide that Earth is not worthy, revealing that they view greedy and evil acts as strong and thoughtful acts as weak. They therefore decide {{to destroy the}} planet, but just before they can, Dennis asks {{that the source of}} <b>the</b> <b>power</b> be destroyed, causing a laser beam shooting towards Earth to bounce back to the alien's ship, killing them all and destroying <b>the</b> galactic <b>power.</b> Full of confidence and excitement for <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> any more, Neil asks Catherine out, which she agrees to.|$|R
50|$|As most people's {{contact with}} bailiffs {{is when a}} bailiff comes to take {{property}} to enforce debt, public perception does not usually distinguish between bailiffs and debt collectors. Indeed, many mere debt collectors often publicly refer to themselves as bailiffs. However, it is illegal for a debt collector to call themselves a bailiff, {{if they are not}} - that is, if they are not a certified officer acting on a court order, they may not call themselves a bailiff. Mere debt collectors do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> or authority of a bailiff.|$|R

25|$|During this period, the ANFC made {{a further}} {{efficiency}} improvement {{with the establishment}} of a standing committee in 1947.

25|$|In {{the case}} of Cooper v. Aaron, the Supreme Court {{unanimously}} rejected Arkansas' effort to use nullification and interposition.

The Court specifically rejected the contention that Arkansas' legislature and governor {{had the power to}} nullify the Brown decision.|$|E

5000|$|John Locke {{discusses}} {{slavery in}} his Second Treatise of Government.

However, he goes on to argue that enslavement of those who are guilty of capital offences is permissible. He also defends the enslavement of those captured in war: [...] "This is the perfect condition of slavery, which is nothing else, but the state of war continued, between a lawful conqueror and a captive" [...] (emphasis in original).|$|R
