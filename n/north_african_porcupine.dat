50|$|<b>North</b> <b>Africans</b> in the U.S. {{can be of}} Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Libyan, Egyptians, Sahrawi, Mauritanian and {{northern}} Sudanese origin. Sometimes Canarians are also included in this group, because of the geographical location of the Canary Islands in North Africa, and the partly <b>North</b> <b>African</b> ancestry of their population (the Canarians are a mixture of <b>North</b> <b>African</b> of Berber origin and Europeans) are also considered <b>North</b> <b>Africans</b> (although politically are Europeans, and linguistically, being Spanish, Hispanics). Although according to the 2000 census there were 3,217 <b>North</b> <b>Africans</b> in the country, {{the number of people}} who indicated some <b>North</b> <b>African</b> specific origin exceeded with many this figure (the Marocco American, per example were more of 37.000 people in the same census). As of 2008, there were over 800,000 <b>North</b> <b>Africans</b> in the United States hailing from North Africa's the various native ethnics groups.|$|R
40|$|The {{share of}} <b>North</b> <b>African</b> {{immigrants}} in Europe is growing continuously. In this review, we aimed to systematically analyse {{and describe the}} literature on weight status and physical activity in <b>North</b> <b>African</b> adults, both in their home country and after immigration to Europe. Existing data on <b>North</b> <b>African</b> residents and on <b>North</b> <b>African</b> immigrants in Europe were analysed by a systematic search on PUBMED. There is a wide variation among countries in the prevalence of overweight/obesity, with immigrants showing higher values. The overall results revealed a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity in females than in males in <b>North</b> <b>African</b> residents. Females also show higher levels of obesity among immigrants. In particular, literature reports indicate that 1. 3 - 47. 8 % of <b>North</b> <b>African</b> residents and 3. 6 - 49. 4 % of <b>North</b> <b>African</b> immigrants in adult age are overweight or obese. Physical inactivity is higher than 20 % in males and 40 % in females in <b>North</b> <b>African</b> residents. The highest frequency of physically inactive or lightly active people among immigrants was observed in first-generation Sudanese and Moroccans in Amsterdam (males: 57. 1 %; females: 74. 2 %), with increasing rates in second-generation females. The results underline a higher health risk in <b>North</b> <b>African</b> immigrants than in residents. Specific public health strategies should be adopted in various populations of <b>North</b> <b>African</b> origin to control the obesity epidemic...|$|R

30|$|To {{indicate}} {{the origin of}} applicants we give them typical French and <b>North</b> <b>African</b> sounding first and last names. For our French applicants, we arbitrarily select the three first names most frequently given during their year of birth. Then, we randomly select three last names among the ten most common last names during {{the year of the}} experiment and randomly match them with the selected first names. For our <b>North</b> <b>African</b> applicants, we randomly select three <b>North</b> <b>African</b> sounding first names among the ten most frequently given during their year of birth. Then we randomly choose <b>North</b> <b>African</b> sounding last names inspired by the names of small <b>North</b> <b>African</b> cities, and randomly match them with the first names. To ensure that these matches do not allow misidentification, we observe the number of results and their content when googling applicants’ names 6. We may note that by using of typical <b>North</b> <b>African</b> sounding names we send no signal about different social or cultural backgrounds of the kind sent by Catholic and Muslim Senegalese first names: <b>North</b> <b>Africans</b> first names are equally distributed among different social classes.|$|R
50|$|Vegetative cliff {{habitats}} {{are abundant}} in the Waterberg due to the extensive historic riverine erosion. The <b>African</b> <b>porcupine</b> uses the protection of these cliffside caves. Some trees cling to the cliff areas, including the paperbark false-thorn, that have flaking bark hanging from their thick trunks. Another tree in this habitat is the fever tree, thought by Bushmen to have special power to allow communication with the dead. It is found on cliffs above the Palala River including one site used for prehistoric ceremonies, {{which is also a}} location of some intact rock paintings.|$|R

5000|$|<b>North</b> <b>African</b> climate cycles have {{a unique}} history that {{can be traced back}} {{millions}} of years.

When the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> Monsoon is at its strongest annual precipitation and subsequent vegetation in the Sahara region increase, resulting in conditions commonly referred to as the [...] "green Sahara". For a relatively weak <b>North</b> <b>African</b> Monsoon, the opposite is true, with decreased annual precipitation and less vegetation resulting in a phase of the Sahara climate cycle known as the [...] "desert Sahara".|$|R
