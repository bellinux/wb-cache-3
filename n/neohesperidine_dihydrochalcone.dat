40|$|An {{analytical}} approach for the simultaneous determination of nine intense sweeteners in various foodstuffs is presented. By performing a single analysis using high performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection acesulfame-K, alitame, aspartame, cyclamic acid, dulcin, neotame, <b>neohesperidine</b> <b>dihydrochalcone,</b> saccharin and sucralose can be determined. The elaborated approach was collaboratively tested, thus proving its validity {{to be used}} as an important measure to assess compliance with labelling provisions. JRC.

40|$|An {{interlaboratory trial}} was {{conducted}} to validate an analytical method based on high performance liquid chromatography analysis with evaporative light scattering detection for the simultaneous determination of nine intense sweeteners, i. e., acesulfame-K, alitame, aspartame, cyclamic acid, dulcin, neotame, <b>neohesperidine</b> <b>dihydrochalcone,</b> saccharin and sucralose in carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks and canned or bottled fruits. Seven laboratories participated in the validation study. High comparability of results obtained by individual testing laboratories was ensured by RSDR values < 10 % {{for the majority of}} results. Moreover, HorRAT values of less than 1. 1 suggested for all sweeteners and matrices tested good performance of the method. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|E

The procedure involves an extraction of the nine sweeteners with a buffer solution, sample clean-up using solid-phase extraction cartridges followed by an HPLC-ELSD analysis. Trueness, {{expressed in terms of}} recovery rates, was demonstrated in most cases by values ranging from 90 to 108 %.

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method with evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous determination of multiple sweeteners, i. e., acesulfame-K, alitame, aspartame, cyclamic acid, dulcin, neotame, <b>neohesperidine</b> <b>dihydrochalcone,</b> saccharin and sucralose in carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks, canned or bottled fruits and yoghurt. The procedure involves an extraction of the nine sweeteners with a buffer solution, sample clean-up using solid-phase extraction cartridges followed by an HPLC-ELSD analysis. The trueness of the method was satisfactory with recoveries ranging from 93 to 109 % for concentration levels around the maximum usable dosages for authorised sweeteners and from 100 to 112 % for unauthorised compounds at concentration levels close to the limit of quantification (LOQs). Precision measures showed mean repeatability values of < 4 % (expressed as relative standard deviation) for highly concentrated samples and < 5 % at concentration levels close to the LOQs. Intermediate precision was in most cases < 8 %. The limits of detection (LODs) were below 15 µg g- 1 and the LOQs below 30 µg g- 1 in all three matrices. Only dulcin showed slightly higher values, i. e., LODs around 30 µg g- 1 and LOQs around 50 µg g- 1. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|E
40|$|The {{perception}} of sweetness varies among individuals but {{the sources of}} this variation are not fully un-derstood. Here, {{in a sample of}} 1, 901 adolescent and young adults (53. 8 % female; 243 MZ and 452 DZ twin pairs, 511 unpaired individuals; mean age 16. 2 ± 2. 8, range 12 – 26 years), we studied the variation in the {{perception of}} sweetness intensity of two monosaccharides and two high-potency sweeteners: glucose, fructose, <b>neohesperidine</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> (NHDC), and aspartame. Perceived intensity for all sweeteners decreased with age (2 – 5 % per year) and increased with the history of otitis media (6 – 9 %). Males rated aspartame slightly stronger than females (7 %). We found similar heritabilities for sugars (glucose: h 2 = 0. 31, fructose: h 2 = 0. 34) and high-potency sweeteners (NHDC: h 2 = 0. 31, aspartame: h 2 = 0. 30); all were in the modest range. Multivariate modeling showed that a common genetic factor accounted for> 75 % of the genetic variance in the four sweeteners, suggesting that individual differences in perceived sweet intensity, which are partly due to genetic factors, may be attributed to a single set of genes. This study provided evidence of the shared genetic pathways between the perception of sugars and high-potency sweeteners.

40|$|Sucrose can be {{substituted}} by intense sweeteners to lower the calorie content of soft drinks. Although the sweetness is kept {{at the same level}} as much as possible, the flavour of the product often changes. This change could be due to both the mechanism of sensory perception and interactive effects of the aroma compounds. Several types of interaction and some techniques for measuring interactive effects are reviewed. An example of psychological interaction is the influence of colour on flavour. Interactions of flavour molecules with the receptor can be affected by changes in their micro-environment. Molecular interactions {{play a role in the}} release of volatile compounds from aqueous solutions; release is increased by sugars and salts, and decreased by lipids and proteins. Intense sweeteners, such as aspartame and <b>neohesperidine</b> <b>dihydrochalcone,</b> interact with volatile compounds and modify the intensities of flavour attributes. The use of combinations of intense sweeteners can solve the flavour problems encountered with single sweetener applications. A quaternary model of Beidler's mixture equation was used to describe the sweetness of a light blackcurrant soft drink, containing the intense sweeteners saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame and acesulfam-K. The perceived sweetness of the light soft drink was lower than the sweetness of the original sucrose-sweetened soft drink. A proportional enhancement of the concentrations of the intense sweeteners was utilized to meet the sweetness of this classic soft drink. Consequently, the aroma attribute strawberry increased, while the currant and sour related attributes decreased...|$|E
