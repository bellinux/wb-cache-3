For example, the labor market is sex-segregated, and women are usually paid lower wages. [...] "Unskilled personnel in the <b>non-production</b> <b>sector</b> are comprised virtually entirely of women.‚Äù Women also cannot be used for night time or overtime work. As of 2003 there was no known law against sexual harassment.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the asymmetry of adjustment costs for labour. Using monthly data on Japanese industries, we estimate {{a model of}} dynamic labour demand that incorporates adjustment costs for hiring and firing workers, and for changing working hours. Our estimates suggest the following. (1) It is more costly to fire workers than to hire them in all industries. (2) This asymmetry between hiring and firing costs is more important for production <b>sectors</b> than for <b>non-production</b> <b>sectors.</b> (3) It is much less costly to adjust working hours than to adjust the number of workers.

The {{humanoid}} robot {{is a combination}} of biped, intelligent and mimetic robot to serve human beings in <b>non-production</b> <b>sectors.</b> Since it is a very complicate automatic walking and working machinery, and it works interactively with people in daily life, its correctness and reliability in terms of its functions and performances need to be checked intensively after final assemble and before it is shipped. A novel developed computer integrated testing system (CITS) to inspect every ex-work robot before shipping with the appearance, motion, walking, sensing and recognition, intelligence as well as possessed service expert knowledge is developed in this paper. The use of this fully automated CITS will simplify the human intervenient inspection and testing of the {{humanoid robot}}, shorten the testing time and cost, and avoid human errors while in manufacturing, software loading and ex-work inspection...|$|R
