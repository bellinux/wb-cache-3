5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in <b>new</b> <b>revenue</b> without the need to raise taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably {{similar to the one}} used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery would generate. Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.|$|E
5|$|In 406 BC Alcibiades set {{out from}} Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take Andros {{and then he went}} on to Samos. Later he moved to Notium, closer to the enemy at Ephesus. In the {{meanwhile}} Tissaphernes had been replaced by Cyrus the Younger (son of Darius II of Persia) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This <b>new</b> <b>revenue</b> started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with Lysander, a very capable admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet {{at the expense of the}} Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to watch them under the command of his personal helmsman Antiochus, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed this single order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was radically different from that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been well informed about their fleet by deserters. Antiochus's ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.|$|E

Although sources diverge on her future history, Bibbs engines were salvaged for a <b>new</b> <b>revenue</b> cutter, , which was built at the Boston Navy Yard in 1853.

25|$|In {{a measure}} that {{garnered}} substantial popular support for his New Deal, Roosevelt moved to put to rest {{one of the most}} divisive cultural issues of the 1920s. He signed the bill to legalize the manufacture and sale of alcohol, an interim measure pending the repeal of Prohibition, for which a constitutional amendment of repeal (the 21st) was already in process. The repeal amendment was ratified later in 1933. States and cities gained additional <b>new</b> <b>revenue,</b> and Roosevelt secured his popularity especially in the cities and ethnic areas by helping the beer start flowing.|$|E

Democratic legislators and independent analysts called that estimate vastly overdrawn. The Massachusetts Taxpayer Foundation, a nonpartisan, business-funded organization that monitors state finances, suggested the figure might have been closer to $100 million, and Romney himself was eventually forced to concede that the $2 billion figure {{could not be reached}} without <b>new</b> <b>revenue.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Revenue Act {{was passed}} in {{conjunction}} with the Indemnity Act of 1767, which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea. The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the <b>new</b> <b>Revenue</b> Act taxes on tea in the colonies. The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.|$|E

25|$|In November 2015, the Riders Alliance, an {{advocacy}} group for transit riders, issued a report suggesting that the Q70 be rebranded as the LaGuardia Subway Shuttle with no fares. The report mentioned that 85% of passengers using the Q70 already transferred {{to and from the}} subway, meaning that the bus brings no <b>new</b> <b>revenue</b> to the MTA. The group advocated for the rebranding of the route in conjunction with improved signage advertising for the route. Additional critiques made by the group are that the signage at LaGuardia for the Q70 is flawed and misleading, and that the bus stop locations on Roosevelt Avenue are not well marked. Increased service, bus running every 10 minutes during all times, countdown clocks and on-board announcements were all suggested by the group.|$|E
25|$|From 1997 until 2002 Granada and Carlton {{invested}} {{and lost}} over £1 billion with {{a joint venture}} into ONdigital, a pay-TV, digital terrestrial broadcaster. ONdigital was rebranded ITV Digital in summer 2001, but opposed by SMG plc, UTV, and Channel Television, who felt it would damage the ITV brand. ONdigital was expected to create a <b>new</b> <b>revenue</b> stream and be floated as a separate company but by March 1999 the service only had 110,000 subscribers, well below the 2 million Granada aimed for. Granada and Carlton persevered by rebranding the service ITV Digital but this too was not successful. Competition from Sky Digital launched in 1998 was too great and ITV Digital ceased broadcasting on 1 May 2002. This led to sweeping cuts in the organisation, including cutting budgets for flagship drama serials and productions and loss of jobs at the Manchester headquarters.|$|E
25|$|The key {{features}} of the 2011 CBA included changes related to health and safety, including {{a reduction in the}} number of off-season practices, a prohibition against training camp “two-a days", and a limit on contact practices in both the preseason and regular season.

Also, the agreement promised an increase up to $1.5 million in salary guarantees for injured players and a <b>new</b> <b>revenue</b> split, offering players between 47 percent and 48.5 percent of all revenue. Changes were also made in contract-related benefits, with an increase in minimum player salaries and salary cap minimums, including the guarantee of a 99% -95% league wide spend and a requirement that each club would have to spend an average of 89% of the salary cap over four-year periods.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, Carr {{retired from}} the museum and Grace Golden became the new director. Golden sought to further expand the museum and {{successfully}} solicited grants from the Indianapolis Foundation, the Lilly Endowment, {{and members of the}} Lilly family. She also secured several important corporate sponsorships. The <b>new</b> <b>revenue</b> allowed the museum to purchase its own building, a former mansion on North Meridian Street. Golden also began a diversification of the museum's exhibits, rather than relying on local donations. She successfully created partnerships with other museums who loaned exhibits of Native American artifacts in 1947, a gallery of dinosaur skeletons in 1949, the mummy Wenuhotep was given on permanent loan from the University of Chicago in 1959, a nineteenth-century log cabin was donated in 1961, and the Hall of Man was added in 1962. Several new permanent exhibits were created during her tenure, focusing on pioneer life, natural science, and ethnography. Golden also established a Junior Docent program, created two weekly television shows for local broadcast, and began a program of interpretive activities.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to spending cuts, Romney and the legislature {{relied heavily on}} fee increases to help balance the budgets throughout Romney's term, more aggressively pursuing a revenue source that the legislature {{had already begun to}} draw upon to close a deep deficit during the year prior to Romney’s election. The state of Massachusetts raised $500 million in <b>new</b> <b>revenue</b> during Romney’s first year in office from fees, more than any other state surveyed. Romney proposed 33 new fees along with increases in 57 existing fees, resulting in higher costs for birth certificates, new car purchases, driver’s learning permits, firearms permits, professional licenses, and billboards advertising, as well as for many state services. He also increased a state gasoline fee originally intended for cleanup of contamination around underground fuel storage tanks. The two cents per gallon increase made for a total effective state gasoline tax of 23.5 cents per gallon, generating about $60million per year in additional revenue (surpluses of $40 million over the costs of the cleanup program). Opponents said many of the fees posed a hardship on those who could least afford them, such as fees for the state to provide certification of blindness and a photo identification card for the blind. The proposal also called for a $50 fee for tuberculosis tests and a $400 fee for those who tested positive (the tuberculosis fees were rejected by the legislature).|$|E
