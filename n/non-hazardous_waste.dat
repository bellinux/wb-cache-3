25|$|Energy {{recovery}} from waste is {{the conversion of}} non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel {{through a variety of}} processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy {{recovery from}} waste is part of the <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.|$|E

40|$|The {{replacement}} {{of fossil fuels}} by renewable fuels can contribute to improve the environmental performance of the power production and to move forward in the sustainability way. The experience {{has shown that the}} availability of alternative fuels can be an obstacle for its extensive use for energy production, since biomass is not always available. The use of <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> may be a good alternative to biomass, mainly if they are economically unattractive for recycling or if they present a high cost for land-filling. The co-firing of <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> with coal is, therefore, a subject of great interest for the sustainability of energy production and the reduction of the emissions of fossil greenhouse gases. The use of these wastes for energy is promising if they combine well with other fuels during the conversion process for energy production and have no negative effect on the combustion system, on the ash quality and on the gaseous emissions...|$|R
