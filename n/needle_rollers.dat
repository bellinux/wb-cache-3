5000|$|The {{most common}} {{anti-friction}} element employed {{is a full}} complement of <b>needle</b> <b>rollers.</b> This design can withstand high radial loads but no [...] A similar design is the caged needle roller design, which also uses <b>needle</b> <b>rollers,</b> but uses a cage to keep them separated. This design allows for higher speeds but decreases the load capacity. The cage also increases internal space so it can hold more lubrication, which increases the time between relubrications. Depending on the exact design sometimes two rollers are put in each pocket of the cage, using a cage design originated by RBC Bearings in 1971.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the layout}} of the gearbox, the {{layshaft}} is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The layshaft gear cluster is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications <b>needle</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1967 two Venom Thruxton motorcycles, ridden by Neil Kelly and Keith Heckles gained {{first and}} second places in the Production TT, a {{category}} for road-based machines with limited controlled-modifications first staged at the Isle of Man in that year; Kelly also recorded the fastest lap at 91 mph. Prepared by Reg Orpin, workshop manager at London Velocette dealer L.Stevens, the winning motorcycle was far from standard, for {{as well as being}} in Thruxton trim, the valve gear included titanium tips to the pushrods and valve caps. A Norton Manx piston had been specially engineered at Velocette's Hall Green Workshops, and it had cam followers on <b>needle</b> <b>rollers</b> as well as light alloy timing wheels. It was nearly all for nothing, however, as Kelly failed to start {{and the rest of the}} field left him struggling to kick start the Venom. Orpin managed to start it just in time, and despite his poor start, Neil Kelly caught up with the other riders within three miles and went on to win the 500 cc class, recording 121 mph as he passed the Highlander speed trap.|$|E

The frame of numerical method for the crown drop evaluation considered these two effects is presented, which makes it possible to profile the <b>needle</b> <b>rollers</b> axially until the longitudinal pressure distribution is neither any “edge effects ” nor high-pressure concentration at the center part of contacts. And the crown drop designed by this method is larger than that by Lundberg’s theory. The comparison results of accelerated rolling contact fatigue experiment show that the width of grinding undercut and radius of the chamfer must be considered in determining the crown drop of the <b>needle</b> <b>rollers...</b>|$|E

40|$|A <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearing is {{a bearing}} which uses small {{cylindrical}} rollers. Bearings {{are used to}} reduce friction of any rotating surface. Needle bearings have a large surface {{in contact with the}} bearing outer surfaces as compared to ball bearings. There is less added clearance(Diameter of the shaft and the diameter of the bearing are different) so they are much compact. The structure consists of a needle cage which contains the needle rollersthemselves and an outer race (The housing itself). Radial bearings are cylindrical and they use rollers parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial pattern of needle are being used by thrust needles. Complement bearings have solid inner as well as outer rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. The bearings have the largest number of rolling elements and also have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for compact designs. <b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings have relatively small diameter cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger than their diameter. As compared to other types of rolling bearings, <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings possess a small cross-sectional height and significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to their volume. Also, because the inertial force acting on them is limited, needle bearings are an ideal choice for applications with oscillating motion. These bearings also work well in compact and lightweight machine designs and they serve as a ready replacement for sliding bearings. Needle bearings features are great rigidity, smaller cross-section, higher loadcarrying capacity, and has lower inertia forces that facilitate to size and weight reductions in machinery. Needle bearings are designed to stand in oscillation, performwell under any conditions, and interchange with the sliding of bearings...|$|R
50|$|The {{front brake}} caliper was resited {{to the rear}} of the fork leg and the front master {{cylinder}} reservoir shape was changed. A hazard switch was added. <b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings were fitted to the swingarm instead of the earlier plain bushings. Tuning modifications were made to the carbs to improve low speed operation. The manual operation fuel tap was replaced with an automatic diaphragm unit. A rear disc brake replaced the earlier drum.|$|R

50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} use {{very long}} and thin cylinders. Often {{the ends of the}} rollers taper to points, and these are used to keep the rollers captive, or they may be hemispherical and not captive but held by the shaft itself or a similar arrangement. Since the rollers are thin, the outside diameter of the bearing is only slightly larger than the hole in the middle. However, the small-diameter rollers must bend sharply where they contact the races, and thus the bearing fatigues relatively quickly.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of cars were {{fitted with a}} Borg-Warner 3-speed automatic transmission. The other choice was a derivative of the ancient Triumph TR2 gearbox which had been modified and improved over the years {{for use in the}} TR4/A/IRS/TR5/250/6. The first gear ratio was raised and <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings were used in place of the bronze bushings on the layshaft. Early 4-speed manual transmission models could be ordered with an A-type Laycock overdrive unit and later ones frequently came with a J-type Laycock unit. The overdrive option is highly desirable as the engine RPM drops significantly with this option in 3rd and 4th (top) gears.|$|R
50|$|Universal joints let {{the shaft}} keep {{rotating}} while allowing for changes due to suspension movement, such as shaft length and horizontal angle, and shaft angle as the steering turns. Constant-velocity universal joints are normally used to transfer power smoothly between the components. The inner universal {{can be a}} plunge or tripod type joint. The tripod is splined to the intermediate shaft and held by a circlip. A ball, supported on <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, is fitted to each post of the tripod, and these slide in a trunion inside the yoke. This caters for changes in shaft length and horizontal angle. The drive is transferred through the trunion and balls to rotate the shaft.|$|R

The trucks had plastic wheels designed either to ride along the cylindrical track or along a flat surface. The wheels had <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearings. The Boxer obtained traction by means of its rubber track bearing upon the sleepers, but at the rear it had two wheels riding upon the track, the height {{of which could be}} adjusted hydraulically.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} certain phenomena {{that take place}} in the <b>needle</b> <b>roller</b> bearing. The friction that generates the anti-torque of a friction pair is the major factor that influences the needle bearing’s wear. In the needle bearing there occur two predominant types of friction: the rolling friction and the sliding friction, and both are subject to examination. The study presents recordings and analysis of the movements of all needle bearing’s rolling elements. The examination was carried out on a special examination stand that precisely emulates the real conditions of the needle bearing’s work. Carefully prepared examination methods enable recording and analyzing frictions in the bearing, estimating a sphere within which the load is shifted, and calculating the coefficient of friction...|$|R
