D.). FAB/MS and MS/MS studies identified several oxidation products of abietic acid as the principal resin components, indicating that one or more species of coniferous trees were used by the Egyptians as a source of the resin. GC/MS studies also identified severaln-alkanes with carbon numbers from C 19 to C 33 in the sample. The relative amounts of thesen-alkanes, along with characteristic trace metals, indicate that bitumen, an <b>asphalt</b> <b>native</b> to the region, was added to the resin. The presence of this ancient source of carbon in this sample explains the inconsistent data assigned to the mummy by carbon- 14 analysis...|$|R
40|$|Human {{soft tissue}} {{specimens}} obtained by dissection of Greco-Roman Period mummies {{buried in the}} Dakhleh Oasis in Egypt's Western Desert had radiocarbon analytical results {{many of which were}} substantially older than accompanying artifacts suggested. Mass spectrometry suggested the presence of hydrocarbons. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) confirmed that the “resin ” applied to these bodies was a mixture of materials containing not only the expected plant sterols of ancient Egyptian embalming resins, but also insoluble carbonized plant material, beeswax and fossil asphalt (bitumen) in four analyzed “resin ” samples. Two of these bore a geochemical signature characteristic of Dead Sea <b>asphalt</b> <b>native</b> samples. Efforts to recover the “true ” radiocarbon dates by subjecting the tissue samples to extractions by light organic solvents were not reliably successful, probably due to the presence of “radiocarbon-dead ” insoluble compounds. Historical evidence indicates that Palestine's Dead Sea bitumen was an item traded to Egypt for embalming purposes especially during the Ptolemaic and later Periods. When using mummified human tissues for radiocarbon dating of mummies from the later periods of ancient Egypt’s pharaonic period, possible contamination with such bitumen in amounts sufficient to alter radiocarbon dating tests should be kept in mind. Simple pre-analytical extraction with commonly available light organic solvents may not remove the offending compounds...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there is}} not a direct {{relationship}} between the classification systems in Figures 1 and 2, one kind of pyrobitumen is a subset of the post-oil solid bitumen formed by thermal degradation of kerogen and oil. Of the 27 samples investigated by Curiale, the three impsonite samples had the low solubility (<3%) and low H/C ratio (<0.9) characteristic of highly mature organic matter. These samples also had lowest asphaltene, highest aromatic, and highest volatile content in the soluble fraction. Carbon deposits associated with uranium nodules also had low solubilities and H/C ratios less than 1.0 and correspond to pyrobitumens with inorganic origins. For comparison, coal tar pitch has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.8.In the petroleum geochemistry community, pyrobitumen is the remains of thermally altered oil that was previously generated during kerogen maturation—much of that oil migrated to and accumulated in an oil reservoir. Petrographic studies of residues of hydrous pyrolysis, which {{is considered to be a}} good laboratory simulation of natural petroleum formation, show the formation of a continuous bituminous network during the early stages of kerogen transformation, some of which is converted to pyrobitumen at high thermal exposure. This definition is consistent with that given for pyrobitumen in the Society of Petroleum Engineers Glossary: “a hard, <b>native</b> <b>asphalt</b> within the rock pores. Does not ordinarily move or enter into reaction.” [...] Hunt uses this definition of thermally mature residue to calculate material balances for the fate of oil at very high maturities, both that retained in the source rock and that from reservoirs. Pyrobitumen in thermally mature oil reservoirs has been characterized by Hwang. [...] More recently, the pyrobitumen retained in the source rock is considered to play an important role in the storage and production of shale gas. [...] In oil shale retorting, pyrobitumen residue has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.5 and is often called coke, which has its analog in the production of petroleum and coal cokes by destructive distillation.|$|E

The purpose was to support archaeological investigations reconstructing their thermal history and composition. The first sample (from a Roman quarry in central Italy) proved to have 37 % impurities, no sign of oxidation or degradation and to have never been heated to above 100 °C. The second sample (from a Roman ship sunk south of France) was pure, but partially oxidised, with a saturated fraction in its structure. Analyses of the latter sample, obtained from {{the eye of a}} Thracian bronze head, revealed that the asphalt had been heated to over 100 °C and thenmixed with natural wax...|$|E
