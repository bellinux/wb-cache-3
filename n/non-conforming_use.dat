40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{urbanization}} of Hong Kong {{over the last}} few decades, until the late 1960 s a serene countryside, contrasting with the bustling city close at hand, was left by default. Whereas many of the extra-urban hills have been designated as country parks, which guards them against development, the farmland and villages in the lowland have been intruded upon increasingly by <b>non-conforming</b> <b>uses.</b> The new-town programme initiated in the 1970 s accelerated the rural degradation. Agricultural decline and urban-generated forces such as city expansion, land-value appreciation, port development, suburbanization and China trade provided the impetus. Urban-oriented activities, in particular open storage and port back-up, informal factories and village houses, began to encroach indiscriminately. A landmark court judgement in 1983 allowing such uses of farmland initiated a rampant spread and rural blight. The small rural realm has telescoped and accentuated the degradation. The policy of minimum interference in indigenous villagers' affairs accounted partly for the slow response. Belated statutory measures, introduced in 1991, ushered modern planning into the rural areas for the first time. The long-term policy aims at containing the proliferation, discontinuing uses at sensitive locations and opening sites and facilities for orderly accommodation of an inevitable urban overspill. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{restructuring}} of Hong Kong's {{economy as a}} result of China's economic reform and open door policy since the late 70 s, has led to major shifts in the demand and supply of industrial buildings. These shifts resulted in misallocation of land resources due to various institutional constraints. The land use policies in Hong Kong have been changing since the late 80 s in response to such misallocation. This study investigates the impact of these policies on prices and rental yields of industrial properties in Hong Kong. In addition, the impact of economic restructuring on the determinants of industry propel 1 y prices is also examined. The open door policy has attracted many industrialists to move their production base across the border {{to take advantage of the}} low land and labour costs leaving their industrial buildings in Hong Kong underutilized. Due to statutory zoning and restrictions in the land leases, redeveloping these industrial buildings for other uses is difficult and costly due to multiple ownership and high modification premium. However lease enforcement actions on industrial buildings are difficult and ineffective. The owners of industrial buildings will weigh the costs against the benefits of <b>non-conforming</b> <b>use</b> and decide whether they will leave their industry properties underutilized, use them for non-conforming uses, apply for change of use and pay associated fees / premiums or proceed with a combination of all these. The empirical results in this study suggest that the benefits outweigh the costs of non-conforming uses of industrial buildings, in particular for office uses. This is evidenced by the fact that industrial property prices were affected not only by the demand for spaces for industrial production but also by other demand drivers not related to the industrial productions in Hong Kong. These demand drivers included volume of re-export and service sector employment. These are demand drivers given the term Non-Industrial-Production Demand Drivers (NIPDD) in this study. Service sector employment is an office demand driver and that office use in industrial buildings is usually the highest valued <b>non-conforming</b> <b>use,</b> therefore the correlation between service sector and industrial property prices is an indicator of the intensity of non-conforming uses. Since the late 80 ’s, various changes in government policies toward industrial land use have been implemented with the aim to rectify land resource misallocation. These policy changes can be classified into (1) Planning Control Relaxation: changes that involve relaxation of planning control on redevelopment or conversion of existing industrial properties to other uses, which may involve rezoning of some industrial areas and (2) Use Restriction Change: changes that permit more types of uses in existing industrial properties with or without paying a premium or fee. The empirical results in this study suggest that, other things being equal, Planning Control Relaxation has a positive impact on industrial property prices while Use Restriction Change have strengthened or weakened the impact of service sector employment on industrial property prices depending on the nature of the policy change. In addition, empirical analysis also showed that only the Planning Control Relaxation could reduce the rental yield of industrial property by reducing the risk premium. The effect of Use Restriction Change on risk premium and therefore rental yield was not significant. Last year (2010), the government introduced the Revitalization of Industrial Buildings Policy, which further removed restrictions on the use of industrial buildings for production purposes. It will take time to accumulate sufficient data to show the impact of this major policy on industrial property prices and rental yields. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

The focus of the research has been to investigate the role of apartment housing in the social geography of two Canadian cities - Toronto and Winnipeg - in the period 1900 - 1939, {{in the context of}} debates about 'spaces of modernity' in nineteenth- and twentieth-century cities. The project aimed to reconstruct just who, in practice, occupied apartment buildings in each city. Were apartment tenants in any way distinctive, with respect to gender, socio-economic status, household structure, or ethnicity, and in their residential mobility, and day-to-day journey-to-work? Were there differences among the apartment-house population, especially when categorised according to the type of building in which they lived? From the outset, a principle aim has been to provide a readily accessible computerised dataset for use by secondary analysts interested in twentieth-century urban society. For example it can be used for a social-historical analysis for heritage planners and architectural historians contemplating the listing or conservation of selected apartment buildings; and by comparing patterns of occupancy in dwellings adjacent to apartment blocks, {{it can be used to}} provide historical evidence of the social impact of apartments as <b>non-conforming</b> <b>uses</b> in areas of single-family housing. More broadly, the project aimed to explore the social construction of property relations, especially with respect to the role of rental housing in an increasingly owner-occupied housing market, and apartment housing in a society where the single-family detached dwelling was generally regarded as the most desirable form of dwelling. Main Topics : The data collection consists of two databases, one for Toronto and one for Winnipeg, which contain information on: a) apartment residents in a sample of buildings of varying size, age and location; b) the ownership of this sample of buildings; c) a small sample of residents of houses situated close to major concentrations of apartment buildings. Data were collected for three sample years: 1909, when only 9 of the selected buildings in Toronto, and 8 in Winnipeg, had been erected; 1914, by which date 29 of the selected Toronto buildings, and 32 in Winnipeg, had been completed; and 1930, when the full sample of 72 buildings in Toronto and 60 in Winnipeg were occupied. The databases each include a table of 'building information' recording ownership and other information pertaining to the sample buildings over the whole period, 1900 - 1939; a photo album of illustrations of sample buildings; three tables listing the occupiers of all apartment suites in the sample buildings in 1909, 1914 and 1930; and a table listing occupants of 'nearby houses' over the whole period...|$|R

The refinement technique uses one fixed reference mesh, and to impose continuity across <b>non-conforming</b> regions, constraints <b>using</b> Lagrangian multipliers are used. The size of elements locally in the high shear rate regions is reduced to increase accuracy. FDM is shown to have limitations; therefore, XFEM is applied to decouple the fluid from the internal moving rigid bodies. In XFEM, the discontinuous field variables are captured by using virtual degrees of freedom that serve as enrichment and by applying special integration over the intersected elements. The accuracy of the two methods is demonstrated by direct comparison with results of a boundary-fitted mesh applied to a two-dimensional cross section of a twin-screw extruder.

The trans community, and gender diversity in general, have been an afterthought in research claiming to study gender and sexuality. Research on sexual minorities has been assumed to capture the experiences of this population, despite its quite distinct needs and experiences, as well as alarmingly high rates of violence and suicide. This project is a qualitative analysis of the processes and strategies trans and gender <b>non-conforming</b> individuals <b>use</b> to communicate their identity to others, and how they address barriers they face in their everyday lives. Participation was open to all trans or gender non-conforming individuals. Five individuals who identified as trans or genderqueer volunteered to participate in individual semi-structured interviews about their experiences in communicating their gender identity to others. All participants were White university students at a local mid-sized university in a rural Midwestern setting. Interviews were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), using the process outlined by Smith and Osborn (2008).

These results emphasized the complexity and irreducibility of trans individuals’ daily lives, demonstrating simultaneously the tremendous harm of transphobic discrimination and the strength and insight of these individuals into their own experiences. Findings supported the use of the Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 1995) in the trans population and further underscored the need for continued research on all trans individuals’ experiences, especially those who identify as non-binary, trans people of color, and trans women...|$|R

Replacing Si-F with Nc-FA is a viable alternative that increases the mechanical strength, the workability and durability properties and decreases the shrinkage. The use of FRMA and Nc-FA improved the mechanical strength of mortars, and it slightly increased the shrinkage. The replacement of Si-F with R-MF on mortars made with FRMA is not a good alternative, because it has a negative impact on all of the properties tested.

40|$|AbstractFor the {{iterative}} {{solution of}} linear systems of equations arising from finite element discretization of elliptic problems there exist well-established techniques to construct numerically efficient and computationally optimal preconditioners. Among those, most often preferred choices are Multigrid methods (geometric or algebraic), Algebraic MultiLevel Iteration (AMLI) methods, Domain Decomposition techniques. In this work, the method in focus is AMLI. We extend its construction {{and the underlying}} theory over to systems arising from discretizations of parabolic problems, <b>using</b> <b>non-conforming</b> finite element methods (FEM). The AMLI method {{is based on an}} approximated block two-by-two factorization of the original system matrix. A key ingredient for the efficiency of the AMLI preconditioners is the quality of the utilized block two-by-two splitting, quantified by the so-called Cauchy–Bunyakowski–Schwarz (CBS) constant, which measures the abstract angle between the two subspaces, associated with the two-by-two block splitting of the matrix. The particular choice of space discretization for the parabolic equations, used in this paper, is Crouzeix–Raviart non-conforming elements on triangular meshes. We describe a suitable splitting of the so-arising matrices and derive estimates for the associated CBS constant. The estimates are uniform with respect to discretization parameters in space and time as well as with respect to coefficient and mesh anisotropy, thus providing robustness of the method...|$|R
40|$|Homogenised {{constitutive}} {{laws are}} largely {{used to predict}} the behaviour of composite structures. Assessing the validity of such homogenised models {{can be done by}} making use of the concept of ``modelling error''. First, a microscopic ``faithful'' -and potentially intractable- model of the structure is defined. Then, one tries to quantify the effect of the homogenisation procedure on a result that would be obtained by directly using the ``faithful'' model. Such an approach requires (a) the ``faithful'' model to be more representative of the physical phenomena of interest than the homogenised model and (b) a reliable approximation of the result obtained using the "faithful" and intractable model to be available at cheap costs. We focus here on point (b), and more precisely on the extension of the techniques developed in [3][2] to estimate the error due to the homogenisation of linear, spatially random composite materials. Particularly, we will approximate the unknown probability density function by bounding its first moment. In this paper, we will present this idea in more detail, displaying the numerical efficiencies and computational costs related to the error estimation. The fact that the probability density function is uniform is exploited to greatly reduce the computational cost.

40|$|International audienceHigh-order {{numerical}} {{methods for}} solving time-dependent acoustic–elastic coupled problems are introduced. These methods, based on Finite Element techniques, {{allow for a}} flexible coupling between the fluid and the solid domain by <b>using</b> <b>non-conforming</b> meshes and curved elements. Since characteristic waves travel at different speeds through different media, specific levels of granularity for the mesh discretization are required on each domain, making impractical a possible conforming coupling in between. Advantageously, physical domains may be independently discretized in our framework due to the non-conforming feature. Consequently, an important increase in computational efficiency may be achieved compared to other implementations based on conforming techniques, namely by reducing {{the total number of}} degrees of freedom. Differently from other non-conforming approaches proposed so far, our technique is relatively simpler and requires only a geometrical adjustment at the coupling interface at a preprocessing stage, so that no extra computations are necessary during the time evolution of the simulation. On the other hand, as an advantage of using curvilinear elements, the geometry of the coupling interface between the two media of interest is faithfully represented up to the order of the scheme used. In other words, higher order schemes are in consonance with higher order approximations of the geometry. Concerning the time discretization, we analyze both explicit and implicit schemes. These schemes are energy conserving and, for the explicit case, the stability is guaranteed by a CFL condition. In order to illustrate the accuracy and convergence of these methods, a set of representative numerical tests are presented...|$|R
