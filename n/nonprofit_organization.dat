40|$|The {{study of}} {{organizations}} {{goes to the}} roots of social science. Abundant theory provides the basis for explanations of diverse aspects of organizational structure and process. As a subset of <b>organizations,</b> <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> can be studied with many of the same theoretical approaches used for studying other <b>organizations.</b> Still, <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> have some special characteristics, such as a multiplicity of stakeholders and the use of volunteers; some theories of organizations can therefore be expected to be especially useful for studying <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> and some other theories not to be very useful. In general, our approach is to apply relevant organizational theory to <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations.</b> As such, this essay is not a typical review of literature about <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations.</b> Instead, the purpose is to equip the reader with conceptual and theoretical tools for understanding <b>nonprofits</b> as <b>organizations.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Organizational {{communication}} {{scholars have}} touted {{the importance of}} studying <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> and the communication phenomena that create, shape, maintain, and complicate nonprofit forms of organizing. This study explores emergent discourses embedded within the ways <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> are presented in the burgeoning research on not-for-profit forms of organizing. Data for this study consists of fifteen leading academic articles {{on the topic of}} <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> authored by organizational communication scholars in the past eleven years. I conducted a reflexive meta-analysis of the discursive constitution of <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> across this organizational communication scholarship and analyzed how the articles revealed meanings of <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> comprised of three distinct yet interrelated discourses: (1) nonprofits as unique, (2) nonprofits as essential, and (3) nonprofits as problematic. This analysis provides an understanding of how <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> have been presented in scholarship. I argue that scholars should question the way their own research establishes nonprofits as unique, essential, and problematic in order to perpetuate new and unique scholarship that is helpful to nonprofit practitioners. Based on the findings of this study, I challenge scholars to embrace the principles of the communicative constitution of organization and hermeneutic empiricism to reexamine <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> in practice, within and among nonprofit practitioners, with hopes of complicating and creating tensions about the meaning of nonprofit organizing...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access restricted, at author's request, from March 26, 2017 - March 26, 2018 <b>Nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> {{are feeling}} {{increased}} pressure {{to demonstrate their}} serviceâ€™s impacts to their investors. Social return on investment is a tool that measures the social efficiency, or social return, of services by calculating a social return ratio. While social return on investment has seen increasing use by <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations,</b> a lack of standards in the social return ratio calculation leads to resource intensive analyses and results that cannot be effectively compared. In practice, this limits social return on investment analysis to <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> with high available resources and limits its usefulness as a benchmark for service impacts. The objective {{of this research was}} to create a tool that calculates a social return ratio for services supporting anti-poverty welfare programs for Oregon <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> receiving government funding. This research categorized <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> by service impacts using Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs as a framework. A standardized social return on investment reporting tool was created which calculates a social return ratio for <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> within service categories that support anti-poverty welfare programs. Findings from this research support the hypothesis that the social return on investment reporting tool reduces resource requirements for <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations.</b> The findings also indicate the social return on investment reporting tool supports future benchmarking efforts by providing a consistent calculation and comparison framework for nonprofit service impacts. However, <b>nonprofit</b> <b>organizations</b> will likely need to develop a system for collecting client outcome data before this tool can be used for full benchmarking...|$|R
