5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E
5000|$|Assumed to be {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of the White King, Lara is described as being [...] "not easily quantifiable" [...] regarding beauty, grace, or art. She's tall, with glossy, curly hair [...] "so dark that its highlights were nearly blue...with eyes of dark gray with hints of violet twilight at their centers." [...] Lara {{is perhaps the most}} dangerous of the White Court, a master manipulator, conspirator and seductress. Above all else her word is always honest; being given safe passage by Lara always ensures she will go to extreme lengths to preserve her word. Since secretly taking over from her father she has ended all threats to his position of power, removing the leaders of the other two houses and beefing up security. While ruthless and practical from her father's lessons (and punishments) she does have a few desires {{to do the right thing}} such as helping her younger sister find true love away from the family as opposed to their father's desire to awaken her vampire side and become another pawn of his. Whether this is due to her true feelings, 'rebellion' against her father, fear/respect of Dresden, something else or any combination of the above is open to debate. She tried to push a peace effort between the Red Court and White Council for unknown reasons, but dueto the White Court's nature to be self-serving, backstabbing schemers and traitors, this is unlikely to be for the benefit of either the Council or the Red Court. Any influence, rewards, etc. she was hoping from the Red Court was essentially <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>voided</b> after Harry <b>and</b> Susan turned an uber spell the Red Court was casting against them.|$|R

50|$|By {{means of}} legal {{challenges}} under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, numerous {{sections of the}} Criminal Code have been struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada as infringing on a constitutional right as defined in this 1982 constitutional document. The offending sections are usually removed altogether, or heavily qualified, when new laws are passed. In other instances, such as Section 287 regarding qualified abortions, the Canadian Parliament does not repeal (i.e. erase) the infringing section from {{the text of the}} Criminal Code and so the remaining text is simply <b>null,</b> <b>void</b> <b>and</b> unenforceable by the police and the criminal justice system.|$|R

5|$|The Punch-up in Piestany was {{a notable}} {{instance}} of fighting in international play. A 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships game between Canada and the Soviet Union {{was the scene}} of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.|$|E
5|$|Epstein accused Seltaeb of not {{accounting}} properly, and cancelled {{its power}} to grant licences, which started a counter-lawsuit by Byrne against Epstein's New York accountant, Walter Hofer, asking for $5,168,000 in damages. Epstein then instructed NEMS employees to deal directly with American companies, so Byrne instigated court proceedings, which took three years to settle, as it entailed 39 individual claims against NEMS. Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and legal bills himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Due to the legal battle, Woolworth's, J. C. Penney, and other companies refused to finalise any merchandising agreements, cancelling orders worth $78 million. The court case and its effect was estimated to have lost NEMS and The Beatles approximately $100,000,000.|$|E

40|$|In {{all known}} legal systems, {{jurisdiction}} {{is the basis}} on which {{the power of the}} court is premised. It is a threshold issue in the process of judicial adjudication.

Due to the importance of jurisdiction, every court undertaking judicial exercise must ensure that it has jurisdiction to entertain the matter brought before it to avoid embarking on futile exercise. This paper critically examines the jurisdictions of the National Industrial Court in Nigeria. The paper recommends further amendment to the provisions of two important statutory provisions which conferred jurisdiction on the National Industrial Court: the National Industrial Court Act, 2006 and the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria (Third Alteration) Amendment Act, 2010. The aim of this is to bring the operation of the Nigeria National Industrial Court in conformity with its peers the world over...|$|R
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Dover, Henry and Anne married in a secret ceremony on November 14, 1532. She soon became pregnant and, to legalise the first wedding considered to be unlawful at the time, {{there was a second}} wedding service, also private in accordance with The Royal Book, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. Events now began to move at a quick pace. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer (who had been hastened, with the Pope's assent, into the position of Archbishop of Canterbury recently vacated by the death of Warham) sat in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. He thereupon declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid.|$|E
5|$|The peasants laid siege on Bern and Lucerne, whereupon {{the cities}} {{negotiated}} {{a peace agreement}} with the peasant leader Niklaus Leuenberger, the so-called peace on the Murifeld. The peasant armies retreated. The Tagsatzung, the federal council of the Old Swiss Confederacy, then sent an army from Zürich to definitely end the rebellion, and after the Battle of Wohlenschwil, the Huttwil League was forcibly annulled in the peace of Mellingen. The last resistance in the Entlebuch valley was broken {{by the end of}} June. After their victory, the city authorities took drastic punitive measures. The Huttwil League and the peace of the Murifeld were declared <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> by the city council of Bern. Many exponents of the insurrection were captured, tortured, and finally received heavy sentences. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered in Bern on September 6, 1653.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, he met Nicaraguan-born Bianca De Macias. They {{married on}} 12 May 1971 in a Catholic {{ceremony}} in Saint-Tropez, France, and had one child, Jade. They separated in 1977, and in May 1978 she {{filed for divorce}} {{on the grounds of}} his adultery. During his marriage to De Macias, Jagger had an affair with then-Playboy model Bebe Buell from 1974 to 1976. In late 1977, Jagger began dating American model Jerry Hall; they moved in together and had a total of four children. They attended an unofficial private marriage ceremony in Bali, Indonesia, on 21 November 1990, and lived at Downe House in Richmond, London. During his marriage to Hall, Jagger had an affair with Italian singer/model Carla Bruni, from 1991 to 1994. She {{went on to become the}} First Lady of France when she married then-President of France Nicolas Sarkozy. The marriage to Hall and the marriage ceremony were declared invalid, unlawful, and <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> by the High Court of England and Wales in London in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|The Church's {{commitment}} to {{the ordination of women}} led, in 2002, to the much-commented excommunication of seven Roman Catholic women by (then) Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Braschi ordained the seven women, Christine Mayr-Lumetzberger, Adelinde Theresia Roitinger, Gisela Forster, Iris Muller, Ida Raming, Pia Brunner and Angela White, priests in 2002 aboard a boat on the River Danube in Austria. The women are sometimes referred to as the Danube Seven. The women, among their number some noted and acclaimed theologians, defended their position, and were soon excommunicated. The ordinations, or [...] "simulations" [...] of ordinations, according to the Vatican excommunication, are considered <b>null,</b> <b>void,</b> <b>and</b> invalid, not on account of their holding Braschi to be a [...] "schismatic", but because, as explained in Pope John Paul II in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, [...] "the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women" [...] (n.4). In the Roman Catholic Church the attempted ordination of a woman is invalid.|$|R

5|$|On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, {{the king}} began to reflect {{again on the}} biblical {{prohibitions}} that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to {{take an interest in}} Jane Seymour. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer {{wrote a letter to the}} king expressing his doubts about the queen's guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the marriage <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.|$|E
5|$|This Act made <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> (with certain {{specific}} exceptions) the Marian act of 1554 {{that had}} repealed all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied {{the authority of}} the See of Rome and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever saying she was. This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who felt that a woman could not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory way toward English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one (Anthony Kitchin) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} infamous {{incidents}} in tournament history occurred in 1987 in Piestany, Czechoslovakia, where a massive brawl involving all players on both teams occurred between Canada and the Soviet Union. It began when Pavel Kostichkin took a two-handed slash at Theoren Fleury and the Soviet Union's Evgeny Davydov came off the bench, eventually leading {{to most of the}} players from both teams joining the brawl. The officials, unable to break up the fight, walked off the ice and eventually tried shutting off the arena lights, but the brawl lasted for 20 minutes before the game was declared <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> An emergency IIHF meeting resulted in the delegates voting 7–1 to disqualify both teams from the tournament. While the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal, and were leading 4–2 {{at the time of the}} brawl. The gold medal ultimately went to Finland, hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden, who had been eliminated from medal contention, was awarded the bronze. The IIHF voted to suspend all players involved from competing in international events for 18 months, and all coaches for three years. Player suspensions were later cut to six months, which allowed eligible players such as Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament. The brawl helped raise the profile of the tournament in Canada, where the tournament now ranks as one {{of the most}} important hockey events.|$|E
