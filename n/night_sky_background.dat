The counting {{time for the}} 200 to 300  km layer was (2 / 3) ms. We recorded 9, 000 laser impulses per 15  min and 20 (2 / 3) 9 [*]=[*] 120 impulses of the dark current. The <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> was negligible {{in comparison with the}} dark current when the moon was absent and the optical filter had a passband width at the half maximum of 1  nm. The strong <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> was not considered. The average lidar signal without precipitation was about 100 impulses. The dispersion was equal to the average for the Poisson process. Therefore, the relative uncertainties in the measurements, i.e., the total standard deviation of dark current and lidar signal per average lidar signal, were (120 [*]+[*] 100)^ 0.5 / 100 [*]=[*] 0.15. The ratios of signal per noise were about 2 and 1 with and without precipitation, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Abridged) This thesis {{presents}} work {{towards the}} design of a new array of Image Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) to detect multi-TeV gamma-ray sources. The array consists of 5 telescopes in a square layout with one central telescope, known as the Pevatron eXplorer or PeX. PeX is a PeV (10 ^{ 15 } eV) cosmic ray explorer that aims to study and discover gamma-ray sources in the 1 to 500 TeV range. The initial PeX design has been influenced by the HEGRA CT-System and H. E. S. S. configurations. One important feature of multi-TeV air showers is their ability to trigger telescopes at large core distance (> 400 m). PeX will utilise large core distance events to improve the performance and illustrate the viability of a sparse array for multi-TeV gamma-ray astronomy. One important aspect of the thesis (Chapter 6) was the investigation of a new time-based image cleaning method. The arrival time between photons in two adjacent pixels in the camera is used to apply an extra cut which helps mitigate <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>background.</b> To illustrate the robustness of the time cleaning cut, various level of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> have been considered. These levels include: off-Galactic plane, on-Galactic plane and towards the Galactic centre. The most important result is that PeX performance with a time cleaning cut improves results when a high level of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> is present. For a Galactic centre level of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> there is a factor of 1. 5 improvement in angular resolution, effective area and quality factor when a time cleaning cut is applied compared to using no time cleaning cut.

40|$|In this work, the {{prototype}} of a Durham all-sky camera (DAC) was designed and constructed {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> of Durham. The DAC consisted of a Fujinon fish-eye lens coupled to a monochrome 640 -by- 480 -pixel CCD camera (DMK- 21 BF 04 model from the ImagingSource) housed in an 8 -inch Perspex dome. After construction, the images were taken of the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> {{in order to determine the}} properties of DAC. The field of view of the DAC was 185 ˚ at average scale of 0. 2 ˚ per pixel. The astrometric characteristics of the camera were investigated by measuring the relationship between star positions on the 3 -D celestial hemisphere and their projected 2 -D pixel positions on the DAC CCD images. The derived relationship (the mapping) of the stars onto the CCD images achieved an average uncertainty of 1 pixel. For the reverse process, the uncertainties were 0. 2 ˚ in elevation and 0. 7 ˚ in azimuth. The relationship was tested for the robustness and was found to be stable at the level of 1 pixel. The photometric characteristics of the camera were studied by investigating how well the magnitude of a star could be measured by DAC. The results showed that, under the <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> condition in Durham, the camera was able to determine a 6 th magnitude star at zenith within 1 magnitude uncertainty, but a 4 th magnitude star within the similar uncertainty when the stars were at an elevation of 30 ˚. The brightness of the <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> of Durham was determined to be 18 magnitudes per square arcsecond. Subsequently, the comparison was drawn between the <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> in Durham and in Hawaii, thereby estimating that the accuracy of measuring a 6 th magnitude star would be about 7 times better if the camera was deployed under the darker <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> of Hawaii. ...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{subtraction}} of {{the bright}} <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> emission lines in the near-infrared is crucial, given that the object being observed is often several magnitudes fainter than the <b>sky</b> <b>background.</b> Most integral field spectrographs (IFS) have a modest field of view (FoV), and it is often not possible to achieve good sky subtraction by nodding the object within the FoV, as is common practice for long slit spectrographs. In principle, {{it should be possible}} to use <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> information from one part of the FoV (typically the periphery) to subtract the sky from all other parts of the IFS FoV. However, this has never been achieved in practice. We show that the reason on-IFU sky subtraction does not work is that the spectrograph spectral response function (line spread function, or LSF) varies strongly with wavelength, position within the field of view, and telescope pointing (flexure). By micro-stepping the grating of the SINFONI IFS at the ESO-VLT, we have been able to hyper-sample the spectral PSF and reconstruct detailed LSF profiles for all wavelengths and all field points for SINFONI H band data. Using this information, we can conclusively demonstrate improvements in observing efficiency by over a factor of two. Our technique not only removes the need for separate sky exposures, but can also improve the noise of the <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> measurement itself, providing further potential gain over pairwise frame subtraction.
