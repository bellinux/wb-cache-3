5|$|Although Taylor {{recorded}} nine {{sacks and}} made the All-Pro team {{for the third consecutive}} season in 1983, the Giants struggled. The team went 3–12–1, and Parcells received heavy criticism from fans and the media. Taylor was forced to play inside linebacker for part of the season, a position which allowed him less pass rushing opportunities, when Carson was injured. Frustrated by the losing, Taylor began acting out by arriving late for meetings, and <b>not</b> <b>participating</b> in conditioning drills in practice. After the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Taylor was given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor regretted the decision, and less than a month later attempted to renege. His agent was able to negotiate by meeting with Trump personally and then the Giants which resulted in allowing Taylor to go with the Giants. Taylor got a 6-year $6.55-million package that also included a $1 million interest-free loan. The main results of these negotiations were threefold: 1) Taylor returned the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants paid Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E
5|$|Australias ship's {{company had}} {{consistently}} suffered from low morale since the battlecruiser entered service, {{and the proportion}} of Australias sailors who were placed on disciplinary charges during World War I was {{among the highest in the}} RAN. Many of the Australian sailors were chafing under the severity of naval discipline and what they saw as excessive punishment for minor breaches; one example was of a sailor who was charged with desertion, imprisoned for three months, and lost all pay for staying out too late on Armistice Day. Factors which contributed to low morale and poor discipline included frustration at <b>not</b> <b>participating</b> in the Battle of Jutland, high rates of illness, limited opportunities for leave, delays or complete lack of deferred pay, and poor-quality food. The continuation of strict wartime routines and discipline after the armistice frustrated the ship's crew. There was also the perception that Australias British personnel were being promoted faster than their Australian counterparts and were dominating leadership positions. The battlecruiser's arrival in Fremantle on 28 May was met with extensive hospitality, which was reciprocated where possible by the sailors with invitations and tours of their vessel. There were opportunities for shore leave, but these were limited as Australia was only in port for three days, and had to sail early on 1 June for Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Born in Northampton, Northamptonshire, Mills {{played for}} a local village team before being spotted by a Nottingham Forest scout {{at the age of}} 11. Aged 14 he broke into Forest's reserve team, which played in the Central League. Mills also played for Long Buckby's youth team, and was part of the team that won a {{national}} under-16 competition. He started his senior career at Forest under the management of Brian Clough, making his first-team debut in a 2–1 victory at home to Arsenal in the First Division on 9 September 1978, and in doing so became Forest's youngest league player at the age of 16 years and 203 days. Mills signed a professional contract with Forest on 13 November 1978, two days after his 17th birthday, after serving his apprenticeship. He scored his first goal for Forest with the opening goal of a 2–1 win away to Leeds United on 15 May 1979. Despite <b>not</b> <b>participating</b> in the 1979 European Cup Final at the Olympiastadion, in which Forest beat Malmö FF 1–0, Mills became the youngest player to win the European Cup at the age of 17 years and 201 days on the virtue of having made one appearance in the competition that season. He finished the 1978–79 season, in which Forest were First Division runners-up, with six appearances and one goal.|$|E

5|$|Starbreeze then {{partnered with}} Electronic Arts for two {{different}} games, one {{was known as}} Project Redlime, while the other was an action-adventure video game set within the Bourne universe. The Bourne game was cancelled {{as a direct result}} of Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass <b>not</b> <b>participating</b> in the fourth Bourne film. Project Redlime had a larger scale than the Bourne game. It was said to be a reinvention of one of Electronic Arts' franchises. The company shifted from a technology-orientated company to focus more on the core gameplay mechanics of their new project. Syndicate was announced in September 2011. The game suffered from a troubled development, with Starbreeze completely reworking the game one year after its initial development. There were also many creative differences between the developer and the publisher, and the two companies suffered from an inharmonious relationship. During the game's development, seven senior members of the company, including Högdahl, left to form their own smaller studio. Some of them formed MachineGames to work on their own original games. With a budget that was less than other typical AAA video games, Syndicate received average reviews and was a commercial failure. Grefberg left the company after the game's completion, and 25 employees were laid off.|$|E
5|$|Pius II {{continued}} to support Skanderbeg, {{but did not}} provide him as much financial aid as Calixtus had since he believed that Skanderbeg's military skill and his soldiers' aptitude for battle were enough {{to hold back the}} Turkish armies. However, the pope still considered Skanderbeg's assistance essential for his plans for an anti-Ottoman crusade. In 1459, after Mehmed II completed his conquest of Serbia, Ottoman envoys appealed for a three-year armistice between Skanderbeg's Albania and the Ottoman Empire. The sultan's purpose was to distance Skanderbeg from the pope's crusade as he believed the crusade's only hope for success was Skanderbeg. In order to give Albania a break from fifteen years of continuous Ottoman invasion, Skanderbeg considered accepting the proposal but he had to get the pope's approval. Pius did not allow such an agreement and began to doubt Skanderbeg's loyalty. As the Ottomans were operating in the Western Balkans, Pius feared that the Ottoman soldiers would break the truce and pour into Albania. In order to regain the pope's trust, Skanderbeg did not agree to the peace. Skanderbeg, nevertheless, was disappointed by Rome's response and he responded by <b>not</b> <b>participating</b> in the Council of Mantua which was held to plan the future crusade. The Council ended in failure, signifying that Skanderbeg would receive no help from the West. He thus sent ambassadors to the pope saying that he would only be willing to land in Italy if a ceasefire with the Turks were arranged, something which Rome soon allowed.|$|E
5|$|The 1985–86 {{season was}} one of Al-Talaba and Saeed's best season in their history where Al-Talaba {{achieved}} their third league title after beating their rivals at the time, Al-Rasheed, in front of 50,000 spectators, with Saeed's only goal from a penalty, finishing in 1st with 25 points from 15 matches. Saeed finished the season as the top goalscorer of the league along with Al-Zawra'a's Ahmed Radhi and Al-Jaish's Rahim Hameed where, for the first time, {{every one of them}} scored 9 goals in the league. As of that season, Saeed was also made the club's vice president. In the 1986 Saddam International Tournament, Saeed played for Baghdad XI, rather than Al-Talaba, because Baghdad XI was essentially the Iraq national team under a different name. Baghdad XI won all of their group matches including a victory over Saeed's club Al-Talaba to qualify for the semi-finals where they thrashed Al-Zawra'a to reach the final. However, Baghdad XI lost the final 2–1 to Al-Rasheed; Saeed scored Baghdad XI's only goal in the final in the 78th minute with a penalty. Saeed returned to Al-Talaba for the 1986 Al-Muthabara Cup between Al-Talaba and Al-Rasheed; Al-Rasheed won the match 2–1. In the 1986–87 season, Al-Talaba finished mid-table in 6th place at 49 points. The {{second half of the season}} witnessed the retirement of the team captain, Jamal Ali, in 1987, when Saeed was named the new captain of the team, although he only participated in the first stage of the league due to an association punishment against him. The 1987–88 season was the only season where Saeed hasn't scored any goals due to him <b>not</b> <b>participating</b> in many matches because of national duty. They finished, for the first time since 1977–78, in 8th place at 30 points. Saeed wasted Al-Talaba's hope in achieving the league title in 1988–89 when he missed his penalty in the final of the league against their rivals, Al-Rasheed, after a 1–1 draw. The score was 4–3 to Al-Talaba but with Saeed's miss they got the equalizer and with his teammate missing the fifth penalty, Al-Rasheed won 5–4. Saeed returned to the top three goalscorers of the league table in 3rd with 12 goals along with Al-Zawra'a's Saad Abdul-Raheem.|$|E
