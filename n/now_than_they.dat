25|$|Calderón’s forces {{concentrate}} on taking down cartel members {{that have a}} high-ranking in the cartel {{in an attempt to}} take down the whole organization. The resulting struggle to fill the recently vacated position is one that threatens the existence of many lives in the cartel. Typically, many junior-level cartel members then fight amongst one another, creating more and more chaos. The drug cartels are more aggressive and forceful <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> were in the past and at this point, the cartels hold much of the power in Mexico. Calderón relies heavily on the military to defend and fight against cartel activity. Calderón’s military forces have yet to yield significant results in dealing with the violent cartels {{due in part to the}} fact that many of the law enforcement officials working for the Mexican government are suspected of being corrupt. There is suspicion that cartels have corrupted and infiltrated the military at a high level, influencing many high-ranking generals and officers. Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission has received nearly 5,800 complaints regarding military abuse since the beginning of the drug war in 2006. Additionally, the National Human Rights Commission has completed nearly 90 in-depth reports since 2007, addressing the many human rights violations towards civilians that have occurred while the military officers were actively participating in law enforcement activities.|$|E

That year, a stereo version became available when the track was remixed for inclusion on the album Yellow Submarine Songtrack, which accompanied the re-release of the animated film. Harrison said that the 1999 reissue was timely, given that the Blue Meanies [...] "have got a bigger stranglehold on the planet right <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> ever had back in 1967!", adding that [...] "even the music industry has turned grey and is dominated by Blue Meanies." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the already}} tense {{relations}} between ZANU–PF and ZAPU disintegrated amid Mugabe's wish {{to adopt a}} one-party system in Zimbabwe, Mugabe expelled Nkomo from the government in February 1982, accusing him and ZAPU of plotting a coup. About a year later, Mugabe deployed the North Korean-trained 5Brigade to Matabeleland, ZAPU's heartland, where it massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting [...] "dissidents" [...] in what became called Gukurahundi. Meredith asserts that this far exceeded anything that had occurred during the Bush War, an opinion shared by Geoff Hill. Some white farmers were also killed. Estimates {{for the number of}} deaths during the five-year Gukurahundi campaign range from 10,000 to 30,000. Mugabe concurrently took steps to marginalise the other main black nationalist leaders from the Chimurenga. Nkomo fled to the UK in March 1983, fearing for his life; Sithole similarly exiled himself in the United States. Muzorewa stayed in Zimbabwe and was detained in late 1983 for alleged [...] "subversive links" [...] with South Africa. On arriving in England, Nkomo accused Mugabe of genocide and asserted that [...] "Things are worse <b>now</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> ever were under Ian Smith". Mugabe denied that anything improper was happening and put reports to the contrary down to [...] "reactionary foreign journalists".|$|E

In December 2007, Clooney and fellow actor Don Cheadle received the Summit Peace Award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in Rome.

He believed Marcus was [...] "beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence". Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: [...] "Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of Cleanthes and Zeno, yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape." [...] The early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: his pupil was beloved {{by the people of}} Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished. Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at Cyzicus. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: [...] "not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech". Fronto was hugely pleased.|$|E

[...] "It's also wrong that their pay is now {{lower than in}} 1997 or during SARS," [...] HIT general manager Gerry Yim Lui-fai told the South China Morning Post. Several long-serving stevedores working for Lem Wing Transportation and Everbest dismissed the strikers' claims as exaggeration. A 7-year veteran crane driver said [...] "It's not that we can't go to the toilet or don't {{have time for a}} meal...

Two Everbest employees said that, by working as a pair and managing their time during a 24-hour shift, they can alternate and work six or twelve hours. They said they took home HK$1,315 and HK$1,441, (between US$170 and $185) per shift, averaging HK$20,000 ($2,560) per month. They also said that some of their colleagues wanted to return to work, but were worried they would be chastised as spineless.|$|E
