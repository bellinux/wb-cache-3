5|$|StarCraft II {{does not}} offer the ability to play {{directly}} over a local area network (LAN), as is possible with StarCraft; all network games are routed through the Internet via Blizzard's gaming servers. The latency delay between commands issued and game response when played online is greatly reduced when playing over a LAN and this allows for much finer control over in-game units; there were concerns that a professional scene would not develop as a result. Over 250,000 fans signed a petition asking Blizzard to add LAN play to StarCraft II, before the game's release. Currently, Blizzard {{has no plans to}} support LAN play. Although it does not change the routing of the game through Blizzard's servers, a Players <b>Near</b> <b>You</b> feature was added in StarCraft II patch 2.0.4, to help with organizing games with other players on the same local network.|$|E

500|$|In the song's lyrics, Morrissey {{referenced}} {{works by}} playwright Shelagh Delaney, whom he would reference in several later songs. The song's line [...] "I'll probably never see you again" [...] appears in Delaney's kitchen sink realism play A Taste of Honey and The Lion in Love. Morrissey paraphrased the line [...] "Everything depends upon how <b>near</b> <b>you</b> {{stand next to}} me" [...] from the 1974 Leonard Cohen song [...] "Take This Longing". Goddard conjectures that the song's title {{was inspired by the}} 1947 detective novel Hand in Glove by Ngaio Marsh.|$|E

[...] Warren, who regrets {{the decision to}} publicise the film in such a graphic manner, comments, [...] "The problem with mail-drops {{is that you have}} no way of knowing who lives in the house, or who will see it first. It could be a pregnant woman, and old lady, or even worse, a young child. So it was not such a good idea." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{attracted}} 236,189 viewers at the French box office. Time Out gave a favourable review, {{calling the}} film a [...] "welcome {{addition to the}} post-holocaust barbarism [...] boom." [...] Steve Macfarlane from Not Coming to a Theater <b>Near</b> <b>You</b> gave a moderately positive review, stating [...] "While the film’s heart is syrupy-sentimental (who’s shocked?), its surfaces are clean, incremental, reverently silent—appropriate, given that ... humankind has lost its ability to speak." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called it [...] "a bravura first film, using the simplest means, yet managing to incorporate humor, pathos, suspense and even a well-articulated definition of basic human needs." [...] Dave Kehr from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review, stating: [...] "The absence of dialogue ... is a cleverly executed stunt, {{but it is also}} an effective alibi for a technically proficient filmmaker who really has nothing to say. Another John Carpenter is born, which {{is by no means a}} bad thing." ...|$|E

500|$|War for Cybertron was {{announced}} December 16, 2009, {{and was released}} in North America on June 22, 2010 with the PAL region release following on June 25, 2010. It is powered by Unreal Engine 3. [...] Physics for the game are handled using the Havok physics library. A demo was released on June 10, 2010 which allowed for players to play various multiplayer matches using two of the game's character classes. [...] Developer High Moon Studios designed the friendly AI so that as a player progresses through the story any accompanying characters will help the player, but still require the player to advance through the game. [...] "The buddies don't advance the story for you. [...] They {{get to the point}} to kinda show you where to go, but then they'll take up defensive positions and wait for you to progress the story" [...] said Game Director Matt Tieger. [...] "They're not finishing objectives for you, but they like to stay <b>near</b> <b>you,</b> they'll heal you if you get too wounded, they're pretty smart." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith soon {{tired of}} Sloan's off-track antics, which {{included}} lavish parties and often arrogant statements that questioned Smith's {{judgment on the}} track. A case in point was Sloan's behavior prior to the running of 1897 Brooklyn Handicap which occurred over a sloppy, mud-laden track that year. Sloan had won several races on Belmar, a gray 5-year old by Belvidere, and felt confident that the horse would win the Brooklyn Handicap, openly criticizing Smith's choice of Howard Mann {{in front of his}} other employees. However, Smith knew that Belmar was not a fast runner in the mud and that Sloan would not push the horse to win because he disliked being splattered with mud. Smith instead put Skeets Martin, who was better at racing on sloppy tracks, on the 4-year old Howard Mann. He advised Martin to, [...] "Use your own judgment with this horse, and don't bother about Belmar. Tod probably won't be anywhere <b>near</b> <b>you</b> after the first hundred yards." [...] Howard Mann won easily, winning $50,000 for Smith, while Belmar finished in 8th place. When James R. Keene asked Smith in late 1897 for permission to take Sloan to England to race in the Cambridgeshire Handicap, Smith accepted the offer. Sloan achieved great success while racing in England, but he lost his racing license permanently in 1900. Sloan and Smith remained friends after dissolving their partnership, the later loaning Sloan $5,000 without interest after his license was revoked. After Sloan's departure, Smith used Skeets Martin as his principal jockey, but in 1899 Martin also left the US for better racing prospects in England. Willie Shaw was ultimately hired to replace Sloan and raced for Smith from 1899 until 1903.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Thornography has been generally favourable. Metal Hammer called it [...] "undoubtedly their heaviest and most guitar-dominated record in many years", though commenting that the band's cover of Heaven 17's [...] "Temptation" [...] is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "best avoided". Terrorizer called the album [...] "sharp, slick, elegant, focused, catchy, accessible heavy gothic metal, {{with the dark}} romantic schtick still present, but reined in and more explicitly parodic". AllMusic commented on the album's comparatively more mainstream style: [...] "...by the sound of Thornography, CoF are aiming at playing an arena <b>near</b> <b>you</b> sometime in the near future." [...] PopMatters wrote: [...] "Thornography, all things taken into consideration, is one of most solid additions in Cradle of Filth's history".|$|E
2500|$|MacDonald took a {{break from}} Hollywood in 1931 {{to embark on a}} European concert tour. She {{returned}} to Paramount the following year for two films with [...] Chevalier. One Hour with You (1932) was directed by both George Cukor and Ernst Lubitsch and simultaneously filmed in French with the same stars, but a French supporting cast. Currently, no surviving print of Une Heure près de toi (One Hour <b>Near</b> <b>You)</b> is known. Rouben Mamoulian directed Love Me Tonight (1932), considered by many film critics and writers to be the perfect film musical. Starring Chevalier as a humble tailor in love with a princess played by MacDonald, much of the story is told in sung dialogue. Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart wrote the original score, which included the standards [...] "Mimi", [...] "Lover", and [...] "Isn't It Romantic?".|$|E

2500|$|The game's {{sound was}} praised. Arnold Katayev, {{reviewer}} of PSX Extreme, stated that [...] "Gran Turismo 5 actually sounds fantastic. Having sampled {{a number of}} cars in the game that I either own, drive frequently, or have driven numerous times before, I've verified how they all sound. My 350Z sounded pitch perfect as you start it up upon selecting it. Same goes for my 370Z, it sounds spot on. Even a bunch of the standard cars sounded good, and sound even better with a few exhaust mods", while TweakTown said that [...] "some cars just sounding flat when you feel they shouldn’t, and others just sending a shiver up your spine as you hit redline". Gamingreality awarded the sound 9/10, stating that [...] "The sounds are clear, crisp, and distinct. The engine sounds are great and {{make you feel like}} the car is actually <b>near</b> <b>you.</b> The engine sounds on premium cars change when you make adjustments to it just like in real life".|$|E
