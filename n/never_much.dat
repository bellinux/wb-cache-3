5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was <b>never</b> <b>much</b> more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{continued}} to play for Warwickshire into his late forties, and when he retired from playing {{at the age of}} 48 in 1988, he had taken 2,068 first-class wickets. The reduction in the amount of first-class cricket played means that he is likely to remain the last man to have broken the 2,000 mark. <b>Never</b> <b>much</b> of a batsman, he made only three half-centuries in more than 800 innings, his 7,000 runs coming at an average of just 13. After retirement, Gifford went into coaching and became coach of first Sussex, and then Durham.|$|E
25|$|At {{his best}} {{a master of}} flight and variety, Mitchell was capable of many more balls than the typical leg-break and googly bowler. Often he would vary his leg-breaks with off-breaks made by turning the wrist in the {{opposite}} direction to that of a conventional leg-break or googly, and his top-spinner also brought him many wickets. However, Mitchell, unlike such bowlers as Tich Freeman, was erratic and, especially in his later years, he could have days where he was heaven for batsmen wishing for quick runs. He was <b>never</b> <b>much</b> of a batsman, but was a capable field at cover-point.|$|E

25|$|The NBC Radio Network also pioneered {{personal}} advice call-in national {{talk radio}} with a satellite-distributed evening talk show, TalkNet; the program featured Bruce Williams (providing personal financial advice), Bernard Meltzer (personal and financial advice) and Sally Jessy Raphael (personal and romantic advice). While <b>never</b> <b>much</b> of a ratings success, TalkNet nonetheless helped further the national talk radio format. For affiliates, {{many of them}} struggling AM stations, TalkNet helped fill evening time slots with free programming, allowing the stations to sell local advertising in a dynamic format without the cost associated with producing local programming. Some in the industry feared this trend would lead to increasing control of radio content by networks and syndicators.|$|E
25|$|Fit again, Corrall {{returned}} to the Leicestershire side in 1934 and was then the regular wicketkeeper again until he was once more injured in 1937. <b>Never</b> <b>much</b> more than a tail-ender as a batsman, he made his only career score of more than 50 when acting as nightwatchman in the match against Sussex at Hove in 1934, with an innings of 64. In exactly the same fixture in 1936, he set a first-class record for a Leicestershire wicketkeeper that still stands, as of 2013, in making 10 dismissals, with seven caught and three stumped. In 1937, Corrall was injured twice and Leicestershire turned to George Dawkes, not yet 17 in his first matches, as replacement wicketkeeper, and in 1938 and 1939 Dawkes took over as the first choice, and Corrall did not play at all.|$|E
500|$|In March 1891, Sunday {{requested}} and {{was granted}} a release from his contract with the Philadelphia ball club. Over his career, Sunday was <b>never</b> <b>much</b> of a hitter: his batting average was [...]248 over 499 games, about the median for the 1880s. In his best season, in 1887, Sunday hit [...]291, ranking 17th in the league. He was an exciting but inconsistent fielder. In the days before outfielders wore gloves, Sunday was noted for thrilling catches featuring long sprints and athletic dives, but he also committed a great many errors. Sunday was best known as an exciting base-runner, regarded by his peers {{as one of the}} fastest in the game, even though he never placed better than third in the National League in stolen bases.|$|E

[...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves.

As a result, I think everybody really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in", she remarked. <b>Never</b> <b>much</b> enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|E
500|$|Miller and Hordern's {{collaboration}} {{continued into}} 1969 with King Lear at the Nottingham Playhouse. Hordern immediately accepted {{the title role}} but later {{said that it was}} a character he <b>never</b> <b>much</b> cared to play. Writing about Miller in his autobiography, Hordern stated: [...] "It {{was one of the most}} exhilarating and funny experiences I have had in the theatre." [...] Miller recruited Frank Middlemass to play the fool, but contrary to tradition, Miller made the character an intimate of Lear's as opposed to a servant, something which Shakespearean purists found difficult to accept. Miller decided to further defy convention by concentrating on the relationships between the characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume; he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for the fear of detracting from the characterisations and the sentimentality of the storyline. As such, the sets were bleak and the costumes more so; it was a style that was also used when the play was televised by the BBC later that decade.|$|E
500|$|Some {{settlements}} did not survive. [...] The river town of Baltimore thrived {{and was a}} major {{center of}} trade until the river was overshadowed by the railroad for purposes of trade and transportation; a single house, built long after the town's heyday, is all that remains. [...] Warrenton had a promising start as the first county seat, but it began to wane after the seat moved, and today no trace is left. [...] Chesapeake was the first settlement in Steuben Township, but it faded away so early that even an 1883 county history has little {{to say on the}} subject. [...] Brisco was never large, though it did have a school house from the 1850s through the 1920s. It likewise disappeared {{by the end of the}} 20thcentury. Chatterton had a school, a store and a post office, but it has disappeared even though the name continues to appear on maps. [...] Other communities were planned but did not develop. [...] Dresser was <b>never</b> <b>much</b> more than a collection of houses, though it did have a post office for a few years around the turn of the 20thcentury. [...] The settlements of Kickapoo, Locust Grove, Sloan and Walnut Grove were similar in this respect. [...] Point Pleasant never developed much beyond the founder's residence and a liquor store, and was later described as a [...] "paper town".|$|E

The PlayStation 3 version scored similarly, with a 63.55% at GameRankings and 63 out of 100 at Metacritic. The PC version scored slightly lower at 56% and 58 out of 100, respectively.

[...] GamePro was more forgiving, giving the game four stars out of five and stating [...] "If you like Transformers, buy this game. Even if you don't (or you just hate Michael Bay), you should still give Optimus Prime a try." [...] Eurogamer gave the Xbox 360 version 4 out of 10, stating [...] "It's <b>never</b> <b>much</b> fun, but nor is it wonky enough to be terrible. It's simply there, a forgettable distraction." [...] The PC port was cited as having a number of technical issues, causing lower scores than its console counterparts. GameSpot scored the PC version 6 out of 10, whereas the 360 and PS3 versions received 7.5 out of 10. [...] GameSpy gave the X360 version three-and-a-half stars out of five, praising the professional voice work and [...] "strong multiplayer gameplay".

500|$|British {{interest}} in the maritime fur trade peaked between 1785 and 1794, then declined as the French Revolutionary Wars diminished Britain's available manpower and investment capital. The country also concentrated its foreign trade activities in India. British maritime fur traders were hindered by the East India Company (EIC) and South Sea Company (SSC). Although the SSC was moribund by the late 18th century, it had been granted the exclusive right to British trade on the entire western coast of the Americas from Cape Horn to Bering Strait and for 300 leagues (around [...] ) out into the Pacific Ocean. This, coupled with the EIC monopoly on British trade in China, meant sea otter skins were procurable only in the preserve of one monopoly and disposable only in that of the other. To operate legally, British maritime fur traders had to obtain licenses from both companies, which was difficult and expensive. Some traders obtained a license from the EIC only, figuring the SSC was unable to enforce its monopoly. Others obtained only the SSC license and took their furs to England, where they were trans-shipped to China. Some traders tried to evade the licenses by sailing their ships under foreign flags. The EIC's primary focus in China was the tea trade, with <b>never</b> <b>much</b> interest within the company for the maritime fur trade. The EIC usually allowed British vessels to import furs into Canton, but required the furs to be sold via EIC agents, and the company took {{a percentage of the}} returns. Worse, the EIC did not allow the British fur traders to export Chinese goods to Great Britain. Thus, the last and most profitable leg of the maritime fur trade system—carrying Chinese goods to Europe and America—was denied to British traders.|$|E

The county also granted him a benefit in 1912, though he did not play again, and he died a day short of his 36th birthday in April 1913.|$|E

[...] Though the series proved initially very popular, with its first issue selling 500,000 copies, Byrne has said the title [...] "was <b>never</b> <b>much</b> fun" [...] and that he considered the characters two-dimensional. One of Alpha Flight's characters, Northstar, eventually became Marvel's first openly gay superhero. Though Byrne from the beginning intended the character to be gay, Northstar's homosexuality was only hinted at during Byrne's tenure on the series.|$|E

Quiet Giant was officially retired from racing and was bred to Candy Ride in 2012, resulting in the birth of Gun Runner at WinStar Farm on March 8, 2013. [...] "He was bright and inquisitive as a young horse, <b>never</b> <b>much</b> trouble and never sick or injured," [...] according to Chris Baker, who was then the general manager of WinStar Farm.

2500|$|Heilmann {{was known}} as a line drive hitter who clubbed the ball harder than any batter of his era with the {{exception}} of Babe Ruth. His one major handicap as a player was a lack of speed that led to his being known by the nickname [...] "Slug". He was long known as [...] "one of the slowest men in baseball." [...] Hall of Fame sports writer Tommy Holmes noted: [...] "Heilmann was <b>never</b> <b>much</b> faster than an ice wagon on the base paths. Without doubt, he is the slowest moving great hitter who ever lived." [...] According to Holmes, Ty Cobb's speed added 50 hits a year to his output, while Heilmann's lack of speed robbed him of infield hits. Sportswriter Harry Grayson later wrote that Heilmann's inability to beat out infield hits was the one thing that kept Heilmann from matching Rogers Hornsby as the greatest right-handed batter in baseball history.|$|E

In the same year she married Rupert Hart-Davis, then an aspiring actor, later a well-known publisher. He later described the marriage as [...] "a sad failure: we were much too young to know what we wanted... after much agony we parted and were duly divorced.
