5|$|The next day, Homer {{goes home}} to {{apologize}} to Marge. To his surprise, he learns that what upset her most was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, but that Bart saw it and will one day misconstrue {{it as a sign}} that it is okay to treat women like sex objects. She insists that he take Bart to meet Princess Kashmir so that Bart can see for himself that she {{is more than just a}} stripper. Left with no alternative, Homer and Bart scour the strip clubs of Springfield to find Princess Kashmir. Eventually, they track her down at the Sapphire Lounge.|$|E
5|$|Unluckily for Galland, his {{excellence}} at evaluation {{earned him}} a place at Tutow training facility where {{he was asked to}} test fly prototype reconnaissance and strike aircraft. This was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted, and he hoped to be returned to a fighter unit to fly the Bf 109. During his time there, he gave positive evaluations on types such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 189 and Henschel Hs 129. During his test piloting career at Tutow, Galland received unwelcome news; he was to become Gruppenkommandeur of II.(Schlacht)/Lehrgeschwader 2 (II.(S)/LG 2—2nd battle group of the 2nd Demonstration Wing). It was not a fighter unit, but a special mixed Geschwader of ground attack aircraft.|$|E

Keen notes a stamp on the man’s hand and deduces the attack {{will take place at}} a zoo. Reddington briefly escapes custody to meet with Zamani, revealing that unbeknownst to the FBI, he masterminded the ploy, as well as the attack on Tom. Reddington removes the tracking device and places it with Zamani, which helps the FBI track down and kill the latter. Keen finds the daughter and a bomb in her backpack. Reddington calls in a clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb, who then escapes with it. Reddington tells Elizabeth that her husband, with whom she is trying to adopt a baby, is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> appears to be.|$|E
25|$|Raffaele Cutolo {{decided to}} expand the Camorra to Apulia. The final outcome was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had planned. At first local criminals were {{managing}} the illegal trades while the Camorra lent financial resources and support demanding 40% of all profits derived from illegal activities. This arrangement {{proved to be an}} unstable one: soon the local criminals tried to free themselves from the masters. In 1981, one of them, Giuseppe Rogoli, founded the Sacra Corona Unita, a new Mafia invoking the regional Pugliese identity against the intrusion of the foreign Neapolitans.|$|E
25|$|Babbage {{then joined}} the 30-student Holmwood academy, in Baker Street, Enfield, Middlesex, under the Reverend Stephen Freeman. The academy had a library that {{prompted}} Babbage's love of mathematics. He studied {{with two more}} private tutors after leaving the academy. The first was a clergyman near Cambridge; through him Babbage encountered Charles Simeon and his evangelical followers, but the tuition was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> needed. He was brought home, to study at the Totnes school: this was at age 16 or 17. The second was an Oxford tutor, under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient {{to be accepted by}} Cambridge.|$|E

25|$|However, {{it was to}} be Yeats' earlier Celtic {{mode that}} was to be most influential. Amongst the most {{prominent}} followers of the early Yeats were Padraic Colum (18811972), F. R. Higgins (18961941), and Austin Clarke (18961974). In the 1950s, Clarke, returning to poetry after a long absence, turned to a much more personal style and wrote many satires on Irish society and religious practices. Irish poetic Modernism took its lead not from Yeats but from Joyce. The 1930s saw the emergence of a generation of writers who engaged in experimental writing as a matter of course. The best known of these is Samuel Beckett (19061989), who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. Beckett's poetry, while not inconsiderable, is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is best known for. The most significant of the second generation Modernist Irish poets who first published in the 1920s and 1930s include Brian Coffey (19051995), Denis Devlin (19081959), Thomas MacGreevy (18931967), Blanaid Salkeld (18801959), and Mary Devenport O'Neill (18791967). Coffey's two late long poems Advent (1975) and Death of Hektor (1982) are perhaps his most important works; the latter deals with the theme of nuclear apocalypse through motifs from Greek mythology. Of this group, Devlin is the least experimental; his friendship with Allen Tate while working at the Irish embassy in Washington is one index of the traditional tendencies of his verse. Long poems such as 'Lough Derg' (1946) and 'The Heavenly Foreigner' (written in the late 1940s and early '50s) explore ideas of Catholicism and Europe in a densely imagistic and occasionally obscure style.|$|E

One copy came into the hands of Blease, who was angry that Tillman was being lauded, and stated that the late senator was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had seemed. He wrote in front of the volume, [...] "Don't believe me, but look up his life & see." ...|$|E

On a more superficial level, this is Sony milking his legacy. Any true MJ fan will already own 90% of the songs that make up this two-disc set. It is, however, that 10% which justifies this album’s existence." ...|$|E
500|$|The deaths led to {{a crisis}} for the {{government}} of Northern Ireland with calls for increased security measures. Ian Paisley demanded the Stormont Government's resignation, saying [...] "We can no longer tolerate your weakness. You must go before the whole land is deluged {{with the blood of}} innocent men and women." [...] On 12 March, 4,000 shipyard workers took to the streets of Belfast to demand internment. The Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Chichester-Clark flew to London to request more troops, and when the numbers were <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted, he resigned. On 23 March 1971, Brian Faulkner was elected Ulster Unionist Party leader and was appointed Prime Minister the same day.|$|E

Styer accepted the offer, but when he returned in May 1945 to assume the post, he found it was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had accepted. Instead, he became the commanding general of Army Forces, Western Pacific, a command co-equal with Lieutenant General Robert C. Richardson, Jr.'s Army Forces, Middle Pacific, which included logistical units, but also combat forces, while the planning responsibilities remained with MacArthur's General Headquarters.|$|E

500|$|Despite the self-imposed {{restrictions}} of secrecy {{placed on the}} small circle inside Gruner + Jahr, Heidemann could not resist showing one of the volumes to Mohnke, as the entry referred to the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, Mohnke's former regiment. Heidemann read out three entries from the diaries—from 15, 17 and 18 March—which concerned visits made by Hitler to the regiment while in the Lichterfelde and Friesenstraße barracks. Mohnke informed him that the entries were inaccurate, saying that the Lichterfelde barracks were not occupied by the troops on that date, that the regimental name used in the diary was introduced much later, and that so {{far as he knew}} Hitler never visited the Friesenstraße barracks. Heidemann was unmoved by his friend's revelations, and posited that Hitler had probably written what he was planning to do, <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done. Harris suggests that this showed that the journalist [...] "had long ceased operating on a rational wavelength about the diaries".|$|E
500|$|The score {{features}} eight original songs: seven by the Sherman Brothers {{and one by}} Terry Gilkyson. Longtime Disney collaborator Gilkyson was {{the first}} songwriter to bring several complete songs which followed the book closely but Walt Disney felt that his efforts were too dark. The only piece of Gilkyson's work which survived to the final film was his upbeat tune [...] "The Bare Necessities", which was liked {{by the rest of}} the film crew. The Sherman Brothers were then brought in to do a complete rewrite. Disney asked the siblings if they had read Kipling's book and they replied that they had done so [...] "a long, long time ago" [...] and that they had also seen the 1942 version by Alexander Korda. Disney said the [...] "nice, mysterious, heavy stuff" [...] from both works was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> aimed for, instead going for a [...] "lightness, a Disney touch". Disney frequently brought the composers to the storyline sessions.|$|E

500|$|Many of Iowa's leading statesmen, {{including}} Weaver's former adversaries, praised him at {{his funeral}} and in the years thereafter. Fusion with the Democrats had brought Populist policy into the mainstream, {{and several of the}} policies for which Weaver fought became law after his death, including the direct election of Senators, a graduated income tax, and a monetary policy not based on the gold standard; others, such as public ownership of the railroads and telephone companies, were never enacted. In a 2008 biography, RobertB. Mitchell wrote that [...] "Weaver's legacy cannot be assessed using conventional measures" [...] as much of what he fought for did not come to pass until after his death. Even so, Mitchell credits Weaver for beginning the political effort that led to those changes: [...] "Weaver's most important legacy in national politics is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> advocated, or how subsequent reforms worked, but his effect on America's continuing political conversation." ...|$|E
500|$|Alcohol was {{not allowed}} in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later {{reported}} to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi {{had sex with a}} young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: [...] "Well, it must be true, because if George [...] is doubting him, there must be something in it". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some [...] "black magic" [...] on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.|$|E
500|$|According to Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy, [...] "Disturbia" [...] is [...] "yin to the yang of Chris Brown's 'Wall to Wall' which {{features}} creepy crawly chicks climbing {{the walls in}} latex." [...] He later, listed the video at number five on the [...] "Buzzworthy's Top 5 Most Paranoid Music Videos" [...] stating: [...] "In Rihanna's 'Disturbia' video, obsession manifests itself in freaky-deaky tarantulas, wigs, wolves, and a creepy dude in an eye patch. And S corsets. Paranoia never looked so supernaturally sexy!". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly also reviewed the video commenting: [...] "It looks like she accidentally wandered into Nine Inch Nails 'Closer' video, or else some sort of freaky Victorian mental hospital". He later continued saying that the video is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> expected from a dance-pop song, but it's also cool that Rihanna is trying something new. Jillian Mapes of Billboard wrote that in the video, Rihanna created [...] "a memorable and edgy image akin more to Marilyn Manson than her Top 40 colleagues." [...] The video was voted the sixth best music video of the 2000s in a Billboard poll.|$|E
