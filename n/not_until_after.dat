5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available {{for the first time}} when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Among Sophocles' {{earliest}} innovations was {{the addition}} of a third actor, which further reduced the role of the chorus and created greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters. Aeschylus, who dominated Athenian playwriting during Sophocles' early career, followed suit and adopted the third character into his own work towards the end of his life. Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of skenographia, or scenery-painting. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the pre-eminent playwright in Athens.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 Congress {{passed a}} law that gave several states {{wetlands}} within their state boundaries. The Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act ensured that the state {{would be responsible for}} funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands. Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts, though attention and funds were diverted owing to the Civil War and Reconstruction. <b>Not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> 1877 did attention return to the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> 1832 and the {{introduction}} of the Scottish Reform Act 1832 that control of Scottish politics was taken from the hands of landowners and a small number of merchants. The Friends of the People Society in the 1790s was opposed by those landed gentry politicians. After the Act came into effect, the constituencies were changed, and this raised the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,000.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> 9,500 BC {{that the}} eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax. These eight crops occur {{more or less}} simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E

5|$|Jesuit {{settlers}} from England {{founded the}} Province of Maryland in 1634. However, the 1646 {{defeat of the}} Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including missionary Andrew White, {{and the destruction of}} their school at Calverton Manor. During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the end of the American Revolution that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.|$|E
5|$|Monte Testaccio {{also had}} a {{religious}} significance; it was formerly used on Good Friday to represent the hill of Golgotha in Jerusalem, when the Pope would lead a procession to the summit and placed crosses to represent those of Jesus and the two thieves crucified alongside him. Monte Testaccio is still crowned with a cross in commemoration of the event. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> World War II that {{the area around the}} hill was redeveloped as a working class neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterwards, Artabanes {{was indeed}} {{recalled}} to Constantinople, replaced in Africa by John Troglita. He received numerous honours from Justinian, {{and was named}} magister militum praesentalis, comes foederatorum and honorary consul. Despite these and his great popularity however, {{he was unable to}} achieve his ambition of marrying Praejecta: his wife came to the imperial capital and presented her case to the Empress Theodora. The Empress compelled Artabanes to retain his wife, and <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> Theodora's death in 548 was the Armenian general able to divorce himself. By then, however, Praejecta had already been remarried.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, {{it is understandable that}} the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{creation}} of the French Limousin Herd-Book in 1886, Limousins were exported to Brazil (1886), New Caledonia (1902), Uruguay (1910), Madagascar (1922), Argentina (1924), and Portugal (1929). However, the only herd that became established outside France during this period was in New Caledonia, which continued to import Limousins. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the reform of Limousin breeding in France in 1962 that significant numbers were exported around the world. Limousins were reintroduced in Argentina (1966) and Brazil (1978), and imported to other European countries such as Spain (1965), Italy (1968), the Netherlands (1969), Denmark (1970), and the United Kingdom (1971). Their introduction to the United Kingdom provided opportunities for Australia and New Zealand to import semen in 1972. Soon after, New Zealand allowed the importation of Limousins from both Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the first Full French cattle were imported to Australia from New Zealand in 1975.|$|E
5|$|On a {{cold day}} the fictional 304th New York Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Eighteen-year-old Private Henry Fleming, remembering his romantic reasons for enlisting {{as well as}} his mother's {{resulting}} protests, wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear, or turn and run. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment's first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henry deserts his regiment. It is <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union's victory.|$|E

5|$|Second, it {{was then}} that Japan {{underwent}} a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The ideological {{war between}} the Protestant and Catholic camps at first enriched the {{intellectual}} life of the Commonwealth. The Catholic Church responded to the challenges with internal reform, following the directions of the Council of Trent, officially accepted by the Polish Church in 1577, but implemented <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> 1589 and throughout the 17th century. There were earlier efforts of reform, originating from the lower clergy, and from about 1551 by Bishop Stanislaus Hosius (Stanisław Hozjusz) of Warmia, a lone at that time among the Church hierarchy, but ardent reformer. At {{the turn of the}} 17th century, a number of Rome educated bishops took over the Church administration at the diocese level, clergy discipline was implemented and rapid intensification of Counter-Reformation activities took place.|$|E
5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, {{on the part}} of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were exceptions to this (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E
