Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, <b>no</b> <b>case</b> of a viable double fusion has ever been documented.|$|E
5|$|Slater & Gordon {{investigated}} Gillard's {{conduct and}} concluded that Gillard had <b>no</b> <b>case</b> to answer. Gillard has denied any wrongdoing. A subsequent Royal Commission into union corruption found that Gillard had not committed or known of any criminal activity, but had displayed a lapse in professional judgement.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{homosexual}} {{activities from}} time to time {{came to the attention of}} the authorities, and were investigated by the police; information was added to his MI5 file, but in <b>no</b> <b>case</b> was action taken against him. In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} the present study show that OI femoral tunnel {{drilling}} achieved sufficient femoral tunnel length, with <b>no</b> <b>cases</b> of posterior wall blowout and <b>no</b> <b>cases</b> of tunnel length less than 25  mm. These results are in agreement with those previously reported, particularly by Lubowitz et al., who found, in a cadaveric model, mean OI tunnel length of 34.1  mm, with <b>no</b> <b>cases</b> of tunnel less than 25  mm long, when compared with TP technique [42].|$|R

5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, <b>no</b> <b>case</b> has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was <b>no</b> <b>case</b> law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|Paulus van der Sloot {{was arrested}} on 22 June 2005, for {{questioning}} in Holloway's disappearance. He was ordered released on 26 June {{after three days of}} questioning. According to Aruba's chief prosecutor, one of the Kalpoe brothers told investigators that Paulus, who at the time was training to be a judge, advised that without a body, the police would have <b>no</b> <b>case.</b> Beth Holloway pursued Van der Sloot's parents in the ensuing media circus on Aruba. She said that Paulus acknowledged that they could not control their son and had sent him to a psychiatrist.|$|E
