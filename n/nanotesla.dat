5|$|The typical average equipartition {{strength}} for spiral galaxies is about 10 μG (microGauss) or 1 nT (<b>nanoTesla).</b> For comparison, the Earth's magnetic field has an average strength of about 0.3 G (Gauss or 30 μT (microTesla). Radio-faint galaxies like M 31 and M 33, our Milky Way's neighbors, have weaker fields (about 5 μG), while gas-rich galaxies with high star-formation rates, like M 51, M 83 and NGC 6946, have 15 μG on average. In prominent spiral arms the field strength can {{be up to}} 25 μG, in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated. The strongest total equipartition fields (50-100 μG) were found in starburst galaxies, for example in M 82 and the Antennae, and in nuclear starburst regions, for example in the centers of NGC 1097 and of other barred galaxies.|$|E
25|$|In zero field NMR all {{magnetic}} fields are shielded such that {{magnetic fields}} below 1nT (<b>nanotesla)</b> are achieved {{and the nuclear}} precession frequencies of all nuclei are close to zero and indistinguishable. Under those circumstances the observed spectra are no-longer dictated by chemical shifts but primarily by J-coupling interactions which are independent of the external magnetic field. Since inductive detection schemes are not sensitive at very low frequencies, {{on the order of}} the J-couplings (typically between 0 and 1000Hz), alternative detection schemes are used. Specifically, sensitive magnetometers turn out to be good detectors for zero field NMR. A zero magnetic field environment does not provide any polarization hence it is the combination of zero field NMR with hyperpolarization schemes that makes zero field NMR attractive.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectral}} shape {{and intensity of}} the optical signals from the N-V− centers are sensitive to external perturbation, such as temperature, strain, electric and magnetic field. However, the use of {{spectral shape}} for sensing those perturbation is impractical, as the diamond {{would have to be}} cooled to cryogenic temperatures to sharpen the N-V− signals. A more realistic approach is to use luminescence intensity (rather than lineshape), which exhibits a sharp resonance when a microwave frequency is applied to diamond that matches the splitting of the ground state levels. The resulting optically detected magnetic resonance signals are sharp even at room temperature, and can be used in miniature sensors. Such sensors can detect magnetic fields of a few <b>nanotesla</b> or electric fields of about 10 V/cm at kilohertz frequencies after 100 seconds of averaging. This sensitivity allows detecting a magnetic or electric field produced by a single electron located tens of nanometers away from an N-V− center.|$|E

At satellite altitude, the ring current is responsible of a southward magnetic field directed as the dipole and with a magnitude of a few tens of <b>nanoTeslas</b> during quiet geomagnetic conditions and up to several tens of <b>nanoTeslas</b> under disturbed conditions. Magnetopause currents contribute less to the measured magnetic field, the direction being {{as that of the}} ring current, but with an opposite orientation and with an estimated magnitude around 22  nT during quiet time and some tens of <b>nanoTeslas</b> during disturbed geomagnetic conditions (Maus and Lühr 2005). Consequently, the magnetopause current usually causes an enhancement of the geomagnetic field intensity.

Following the dropouts of radiation belt fluxes there were complex and rather remarkable recoveries of the electrons extending up to nearly 10 millielectronvolts in kinetic energy. The energized outer zone electrons showed a rich variety of pitch angle features including strong butterfly distributions with deep minima in flux at alpha equals 90 degrees. However, despite strong driving of outer zone earthward radial diffusion in these storms, the previously reported impenetrable barrier at L (L-shell magnetic field line value) approximately equal to 2. 8 was pushed inward, but not significantly breached, and no E (Energy) greater than or approximately equal to 2. 0 millielectronvolts electrons were seen to pass through the radiation belt slot region to reach the inner Van Allen zone.
