The research was done from February-July 2013, was aiming to describe information on reproductive aspects of belida fishes (Notopterus notopterus),i. e. sex ratio, gonado somatic stages, gonado somatic index, first size of maturity, fecundity, and spawning type. The fish Samples was taken by gill net which had many sizes such as 2, 2. 5, 3, and 4 cm. Each gill <b>net</b> has <b>length</b> 30 <b>m</b> and width 2 m. Belida fishes have caught during research amounted 497 ind, which consisted of: 237 male and 260 female. Sex ratio male and female fish were relatively balance. The maturity gonad of male fish is faster than female fish. Featherback do spawn every month for each observation during the research. The spawning type of Featherback is partial pattern (step by step). The first size of maturity gonad from male fish was in length 135 mm and female fish was in length 162 mm. Fecundity of Featherback was in range 1. 051 - 6. 057 eggs. Fecundity is not influenced by length or weight body.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new enumerative {{algorithm}} called RAF 3 is introduced that generates slicing placements optimal in both area and overall <b>net</b> <b>length.</b> It {{is designed to}} automate the task of placement for analog circuits given a set of modules with multiple realizations, a corresponding net list, and neighborhood relations. RAF 3 #reduces the overall <b>net</b> <b>length</b> to nearly one fifth compared to a <b>net</b> <b>length</b> unaware enumeration algorithm while using only 1. 6 % more area and twice the CPU-time. # RAF 3 is based on enhanced shape functions {{that are capable of}} carrying <b>net</b> <b>length</b> information. RAF 3 can be used either as a fully automatic analog placement tool, or as an interactive tool for creating extremely dense placements from a loose placement provided by the designer to establish neighborhood relations. In the first case, another tool, e. g. HD 3574 G# is used to compute neighborhood relations.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a design flow from Verilog/VHDL to layout that mitigates the timing closure problem, while requiring no timing driven placement or routing tools. Timing issues are confined to the cell sizer, allowing the placement algorithm to focus solely on <b>net</b> <b>lengths,</b> resulting in superior layout densities and much lower power. The primary enablers to this new technology are: 1) gridded transistor sizing, 2) variable die routing that allows each net to be routed in the shortest possible length, 3) simultaneous cell placement, routing, gate sizing, and clock tree insertion, and 4) an effective incremental (ECO) placement that preserves <b>net</b> <b>lengths</b> from one iteration to the next. The variable die router is the key enabler. Superior placement and routing densities result from this new variable die approach. In addition, each net is routed at or near minimum length, and thus minor placement changes or cell size changes do not materially impact <b>net</b> <b>lengths...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT — Typically, {{placement}} algorithms {{attempt to}} minimize the total <b>net</b> <b>length</b> of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB). However, an MCM’s increased throughput and dense circuitry can easily result in failure if the board contains “hot spots”. Therefore, an accurate thermal model of an M-CM was needed {{in the development of a}} new placement algorithm designed to consider both total <b>net</b> <b>length</b> and thermal constraints. This algorithm uses a combination of simulated evolution and simulated annealing in an iterative approach. Each chip has a maximum thermal tolerance that it can withstand before it is known to fail. The fitness method evaluates the maximum temperature for each chip, considering every chip’s thermal dissipation at the chip’s hottest point. Results are presented that compare the effects of various parameters. I...|$|R

40|$|Passive nets are {{currently}} {{among the most}} important fishing gears largely used along the Mediterranean coasts by the small scale fisheries sector. The fishing effort exerted by this sector is strongly correlated with net dimensions. Therefore, the use of passive nets is worldwide managed by defining <b>net</b> <b>length</b> and <b>net</b> drop. The EC Reg. 1967 / 2006 reports that the length of bottom-set and drifting nets may be also defined considering their weight or volume; however, no practical suggestions for fisheries inspectors are yet available. Consequently,  even if such technical measures are reasonable from a theoretical viewpoint, they are hardly suitable as a management tool, due to the difficulties in harbour control. The overall objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a quick methodological approach for the gross estimation of passive <b>net</b> <b>length</b> (by <b>net</b> type) on the basis of net volume. The final goal is to support fisheries managers with suitable advice for enforcement and control purposes. The results obtained are important for the management of the fishing effort exerted by small scale fisheries.
