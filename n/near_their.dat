5|$|The ground-dwelling kakapo, {{which is}} the world's only flightless parrot, has remiges which are shorter, rounder and more symmetrically vaned than those of parrots capable of flight; these flight {{feathers}} also contain fewer interlocking barbules <b>near</b> <b>their</b> tips.|$|E

5|$|Amateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, birders) {{number in}} the millions. Many homeowners erect bird feeders <b>near</b> <b>their</b> homes to attract various species. Bird feeding {{has grown into a}} multimillion-dollar industry; for example, an {{estimated}} 75% of households in Britain provide food for birds {{at some point during the}} winter.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{persuaded the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war {{planes in the}} nation. This was an {{important}} element {{of the success of the}} Gulf War, as well as a lightning-rod for Islamists, such as Osama bin Laden, who opposed having non-Muslim armies <b>near</b> <b>their</b> holy sites.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in the San Juan {{watershed}} caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks <b>near</b> <b>their</b> confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap.|$|E

5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots <b>near</b> <b>their</b> tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Men with {{wives and}} dependents found it {{difficult}} to support their families. Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an allowance. To be closer to their husbands, women sought employment <b>near</b> <b>their</b> husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{enduring}} {{symbols of the}} landing of the Pilgrims is Plymouth Rock, a large granodiorite boulder that was <b>near</b> <b>their</b> landing site at Plymouth. However, none of the contemporary accounts of the actual landing makes any mention that the Rock was the specific place of landing. The Pilgrims chose the site for their landing, not for the rock, but for a small brook nearby that {{was a source of}} fresh water and fish.|$|E

5|$|Several storms {{throughout}} the season affected land. Hurricane Estelle passed south of Hawaii, resulting in $2million in damage and two deaths. Hurricanes Newton, Paine and Roslyn each struck Northwestern Mexico. While damage was minimal from these three systems <b>near</b> <b>their</b> location of landfall, Paine brought considerable flooding to the Great Plains. The overall flooding event resulted in $350million in damage, with the worst effects being recorded in Oklahoma. Hurricane Roslyn was the strongest storm of the season, attaining peak winds of 145mph (230km/h).|$|E
5|$|Sounds and {{gestures}} help {{keep track of}} other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six air sacs <b>near</b> <b>their</b> blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle).|$|E
5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or <b>near</b> <b>their</b> current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the Solar System looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} the {{soldiers}} at Stillman's Run were originally buried in a common grave, but who buried them remains an open question. A memorial, erected in 1901, stands <b>near</b> <b>their</b> marked graves. The monument and battle site are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. They are near Illinois Route 72 a block west of present-day Stillman Creek.|$|E
5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas <b>near</b> <b>their</b> centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E
5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found <b>near</b> <b>their</b> young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps Sir Patrick relaxed {{a little}} of his vigilance, since the good {{behaviour}} of his troop had won his confidence, and they {{were less likely to}} be regarded as invaders than by the inhabitants of the district <b>nearer</b> <b>their</b> own frontier.|$|R
5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females <b>near</b> <b>their</b> armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands <b>near</b> <b>their</b> eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Civilian Public Service men {{lived in}} barracks-style camps, such as former Civilian Conservation Corps facilities. The camps {{served as a}} base of operations, from which the COs {{departed}} to their daily assignments. Sites were located typically in rural areas near the agricultural, soil conservation and forestry projects where the work took place. A large camp such as number 57 near Hill City, South Dakota, had five dormitories and housed as many as 172 men building the Deerfield Dam. Later, with projects located in urban areas, the men lived in smaller units, communal housing <b>near</b> <b>their</b> assignments. CPS men typically worked nine hours, six days per week.|$|E
