For instance, the detection/estimation of a polarized signal in compact sources immersed in a background is relevant in some fields like astrophysics. We develop two different techniques, one based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma, the Neyman-Pearson filter (NPF), and another based on prefilteringbefore-fusion, the filtered fusion (FF), {{to deal with the problem}} of detection of the source and estimation of the polarization given two or three images corresponding to the different components of polarization (two for linear polarization, three including circular polarization). For the case of linear polarization, we have performed numerical simulations on two-dimensional patches to test these filters following two different approaches (a blind and a non-blind detection), considering extragalactic point sources immersed in cosmic microwave background (CMB) and non-stationary noise with the conditions of the 70 GHz Planck channel. The FF outperforms the NPF, especially for low fluxes.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of a hearing conservation programme in a heavy industry with high noise levels is described. Action was taken on several points, including noise measurements, noise reduction, education on hearing protector use, and audiometric monitoring. It {{was found that the}} noise at the plant has been greatly reduced during a period of 25 years. The reduction in noise was made possible by identifying predominant sources of noise, changing the structure of the buildings and by changing production methods. The results are presented in the form of <b>noise</b> <b>zone</b> maps. By means of noise dosimetry, one case of automation was studied on a production line for large sheet metal punchpresses. It was found that the introduction of automation reduced the noise immission to the workers {{in spite of the fact}} that new sources of noise had been introduced. Also, the number of workers exposed to noise was reduced. The use of hearing protectors was studied through a questionnaire. A device was constructed which measured the use of earmuffs during the working day. It was found that 30 % of the workers reported problems due to heat, sweat, itching and other local problems. Few complaints regarding communic-ation difficulties and accident hazards were reported. The workers who had problems due to sweat were also found to have a higher production of sweat than other workers, under the same conditions. The audiograms in each age group were studied by means of a retrospective investigation covering 25 years. During the studied period, the median hearing thresholds in each age group improved by 17 - 20 dB HL. These improvements will have a major influence on the number of workers entitled to economic compensation as a consequence of noise-induced hearing loss. In a longitudinal investigation covering up to 15 years, an analysis was made of the audiograms of workers who had been employed at the plant for many years.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of the}} Quiet earplug noise protectors worn by a group of South African industrial workers exposed to excessive noise in the workplace. This was achieved by investigating the prevalence and amplitudes of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), as they {{have been found to be}} sensitive to the effects of noise on the cochlea (Vinck, Van Cauwenberge, Leroy,&Corthals, 1999, p. 52). DPOAEs were recorded before and after noise exposure and were compared in order to determine whether the earplugs are providing sufficient protection against cochlear damage. DPOAEs were recorded using a test protocol where the primaries are fixed at L 1 = 60 dB SPL and L 2 = 35 dB SPL (L 1 - L 2 = 25 dB) with an f 2 /f 1 ratio of 1. 18. The f 2 frequencies were selected to correspond closely to the audiometric test frequencies of 2000 Hz, 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz. The study found the prevalence of DPOAEs to be statistically stable and repeatable. This was true for DPOAEs measured successively during the same test sitting, as well as comparing prevalence determined before and after exposure to eight hours of noise. DPOAE prevalence alone was therefore not found to be a good indication of the temporary threshold shift (TTS) associated with the effects of noise on the cochlea. However, a significant finding of the study was that normal DPOAEs were recorded in only six right ears (24 %) and seven left ears (28 %) before noise exposure, even though all the subjects presented with hearing thresholds better than 25 dB SPL. This may mean that cochlear pathology is already evident in some of the subjects tested. Further results of the study showed DPOAE amplitudes to be sensitive to the negative effects of excessive noise, as there was a significant difference between DPOAE amplitudes measured before and after the noise exposure. DPOAE amplitudes, specifically in the frequencies that are known to be affected by noise such as 4000 Hz and 6000 Hz, measured after the work-shift were significantly smaller than those measured before exposure to noise. Although correct usage of the earplugs could not be controlled for the duration of the noise exposure, each subject was instructed on the correct usage of the hearing protection before entering the <b>noise</b> <b>zone.</b> Bearing this limitation of the study in mind, because DPOAE amplitudes were reduced the implication is that the Quiet earplugs are not providing sufficient protection against the harmful effects of noise.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Omgewingsgesondheid)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Occupational related {{diseases}} (ORD) which {{result in}} permanent disability are compensable in South Africa. During the 2005 / 6 – 2007 / 8 financial years compensation for ORD’s totalled approximately R 200 million per annum of which this study indicated, R 92 milllion on average possibly related to hearing loss. This expense must surely result in negative financial consequences {{for both the}} South African government and employers. The manner in which compensation for hearing loss relating to the work place, is to be determined, was changed by Instruction 171 published in the Government Gazette dated 16 November 2001. A baseline audiogram is required for every employee who enters a <b>noise</b> <b>zone</b> {{during the course of}} employ and Instruction 171 specified that the percentage hearing loss has to be used to determine this baseline audiogram. A baseline audiogram, which is valid for the total working career of an employee, is used to monitor the hearing status of employees for purposes of possible future compensation. It consequently serves as a reference point from which hearing threshold shifts (HTS) are determined. The significance of the accuracy of this test is thus evident. Prior to the implementation of Instruction 171, various audiometric measuring tools were, in accordance with South African Standards, used in industry for purposes of hearing conservation. These measuring tools referred to above were used for various purposes which included, the determination of; compensable HL, the need for diagnostic procedures, when HL had to be reported to the Department of Labour as “an incident” and the efficiency of a hearing conservation program. With implementation of Instruction 171, these various measuring tools were reduced to a single tool namely the PLH. Naturally the accuracy of PLH determination is also important to employees as it may affect possible compensation of an individual’s hearing loss. Considering the significance of baseline audiograms for purposes of compensation, the following questions arose in this study; (i) does PLH, in its current format, measure the hearing threshold (HT) sufficiently accurately to (a) establish the baseline audiogram, (b) monitor HL for purposes of compensation, and (ii) is the PLH, as currently determined, suitable to identify further diagnostic procedures for purposes of hearing conservation?A more accurate PHL calculation procedure would be to the advantage of all parties concerned. A database which included baseline audiograms of 1101 respondents was studied to determine if the PLH, in its current format, was suitable to comply with the needs pertaining to industrial audiometry. The respondents were employees working in noise zones at various industries, located in the Western Cape and were all tested in accordance with South African audiometry standards. The current PLH determination procedure was studied and current audiometry baseline test results were reconstructed in a manner to calculate an alternative PLH. This reconstructed PLH was consequently used to determine a new B-baseline audiogram. StatSoft Statistica, software was used to statistically compare the current baseline audiogram with the B-baseline audiogram. The study revealed that the B-baseline audiogram succeeded to on average produce a 17 % improvement (more accurate) in the determination of the PLH. The PLH of the B-baseline audiogram can thus be regarded as more representative of the true HT of employees. Based on {{the results of this study}} it is recommended that the current determination of the PLH used to establish the baseline, be amended. The proposed amendment (B-baseline audiogram) still uses the HT of the two tests done in accordance with Instruction 171 and no amendment of the test procedure is thus required. As the PLH of the baseline and the diagnostic baseline audiogram is currently used for compensation purposes, it is recommended that the B-baseline method be used for both the baseline and diagnostic baseline audiograms...|$|E

Žilvinas Padaiga Kaunas University of Medicine, Faculty of Public Health, Department of Social Medicine. Kaunas, 2005. - 100 p. Aim {{of the study}} – to investigate the process of managing transport-generated noise impact on human health {{and quality of life}} in Lithuania. Objectives: 1) to generalize investigations of managing motorway transport-generated noise identification, impact on human health and quality of life, 2) {{to assess the impact of}} the motorway AI Vilnius- Kaunas on the health of local residents and the effects on quality of life, 3) to give recommendations for the management and control of motorway-generated noise. Expected results: Justification of the management of transport-generated noise impact on human health. Methods of investigation. In order to assess motorway transport-generated noise impact on human health and quality of life the motorway AI (IX B) Vilnius – Kaunas was selected and the neighboring residential farmsteads. In each noise level zone at the interval of 5 dBA the residential farmsteads were identified: 1) respondents, living within the zone of the increased traffic noise ≥ 55 dBA (in a day time), and 2) respondents, living within the zone of permissible traffic noise < 55 dBA (control group). The questionnaire inquiry was carried out, the total number of respondents N= 130. The respondents were questioned in a random order by asking them to fill in the individual questionnaire and to give a subjective opinion on the environment, the quality of life and health. The questionnaire was prepared based on WHO questionnaire for a subjective assessment of the quality of life, ISO/TS 15666 : 2003 standard, which harmonizes assessment of annoyance. The main variables are: annoyance due to motorway-generated noise, private assessment of noise level in the living environment and at home, annoyance due to day-time noise, disturbance of sleep at night. For these variables the range measuring scale was used. Negative impacts and effects on health were indicated in the questionnaire by each of the respondents. Statistical data analysis was carried out by using the SPSS data storage and analysis software package. Results. 73 % of investigated respondents think that their environment is noisy. The statistically reliable relations were determined: 97 % of residents, living in a noisy environment, complain of transport-generated noise (c 2 = 59, l. l. = 1, p< 0, 001), of which 53 % are very much concerned with noise and feel a strong noise impact (c 2 = 83, l. l. = 4, p< 0, 001, r=- 0. 77, p< 0, 001); 95 % of respondents, thinking that the level of noise in their houses is high and very high, are exposed to the increased noise 60 - 70 dBA (c 2 = 77, l. l. = 6, p < 0, 001); 78, 8 % of respondents, thinking that the level of noise in their houses is high and very high, are not pleased with the local living conditions (r=- 0, 7, p< 0, 001). The degree of annoyance was also determined of the respondents, living in a different noise level. In a day time 63 % of respondents, living within the zone of increased traffic noise 60 - 70 dBA, feel the average and strong annoyance, 38 % - feel strong annoyance (c 2 = 43, l. l. = 15, p< 0, 001). The relationship between those strongly annoyed residents and noise levels was identified (R 2 = 0, 54); the relationship between the part of residents, feeling an average and strong disturbance of sleep, and noise levels was determined (R 2 = 0, 76), 44 % of respondents, living within the zone of the increased noise 50 - 60 dBA at night, feel strong disturbance of their sleep. The statistically reliable relation (p< 0, 001) was determined between the negative feelings, effects on health due to noise impact and noise levels. Conclusions. 1. Assessment of health impact is the basis of in acoustic planning and implementation of noise management measures. 2. Assessment of health impact shall be carried out when modeling road transport-generated noise levels, using GIS and data base of inhabitants, applying dose-response relationships, assessing the risk of public health. 3. When assessing the impact of noise on public health the noise maps shall be created and noise levels shall be indicated, based on the harmonized noise indicators Lden and Lnight, also duration of impact and the number of exposed people. 4. Consequences of noise impact on public health shall be assessed by the dose-response ratio: the relationship between noise-initiated disturbance and noise indicator Lden, the relationship of noise-initiated disturbance of sleep and noise indicator Lnight. 5. Based transport-generated noise maps and knowing the ratio between Lden and annoyance, it is possible to measure a quantitative annoyance. 6. When modeling the noise levels on the motorway AI Vilnius–Kaunas the following ratio of dose-response was determined: 38 % of residents, living within the zone of increased noise 60 - 70 dBA in a day time (50 - 60 dBA at night) to the nearest proximity to the road, feel a large annoyance (p< 0, 001), 44 % feel a strong disturbance of sleep (p< 0, 001). 7. 70 % of respondents, living within the zone of increased noise ≥ 55 dBA in a day time (≥ 45 dBA at night) have claimed various complaints due to noise impact: for 31 % of respondents noise causes stress, 28 %-cannot concentrate themselves, 35 % -feel tired, 44, 4 %- it takes them longer to get asleep at night, 40 % -in the morning feel sleepy and tired (p< 0, 001). What concerns the control zone (< 55 dBA) 80 % of respondents had no complaints. 8. Investigation of noise impact of the motorway AI Vilnius-Kaunas on public health and quality of life justifies the planning of noise management measures. For the residents, living within the <b>noise</b> <b>zone</b> of ≥ 65 dBA, the noise mitigation measures shall be implemented...|$|E

The AzB uses a segmentation technique similar to that described in the 3 rd edition of ECAC Doc. 29. However the model was developed to calculate <b>noise</b> <b>zones</b> based on forecasted air traffic scenarios – a use for bygone scenarios was not intended.

40|$|Thesis (DPhil (Geography and Environmental Studies)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The use {{of average}} energy {{aircraft}} noise contours {{as the sole}} means for guiding aircraft noise-based planning around airports is being questioned increasingly. A growing proportion of residents who live in neighbourhoods adjacent to airports are dissatisfied with the averaging procedure that is employed. In their experience of exposure to aircraft noise, particularly {{in the evening and}} at night when they are at home, the average energy aircraft noise descriptors are misleading. In order to effectively analyse the socio-spatial interaction of annoyance at and interference by aircraft noise, an alternative approach has been suggested – a supplemental noise perspective. Conventional approaches to aircraft noise land use planning based on average energy noise descriptors run the risk of being ineffectual, or even counterproductive, because they do not consider the central aspects of disturbance, namely the loudness of an event and the number of times events are heard. Consequently, an alternative measure to ameliorate the limitations of average energy noise contours is needed by which airport neighbours, the aviation industry and town planners can better understand the nature of the problem. Although supplemental noise analysis is not new, this study applies it to a South African international airport (OR Tambo) for the first time. The airport’s operations are typical of many busy airports close to large urban areas, serving domestic, regional and international routes. Reportedly, there have been few complaints about noise emanating from the airport, but when they are made they are usually about evening and night-time aircraft noise events. In the context of South Africa as a developing society in transition, where growth of urban settlements continues apace, average energy aircraft noise information must be enhanced by providing supplemental noise information. This study investigated the broad issue of land use planning around airports by employing two aircraft noise prediction models, namely the Integrated Noise Model and the Transparent Noise Information Package, to establish the various potential effects and consequences of night-time aircraft <b>noise</b> in <b>noise</b> <b>zones</b> demarcated according to supplemental aircraft noise information. The effects and consequences examined include annoyance, disturbance of sleep, telephone conversations, watching television and work or study, and the likelihood that people will move away to escape night-time aircraft noise. The perceptions of residents living in neighbourhoods around the airport were surveyed and the responses analysed according to <b>noise</b> <b>zones</b> classified as supplemental noise information. The results show that the airport’s neighbours are annoyed by aircraft noise and that aircraft noise interferes with normal household activities. This annoyance and interference decreases with increasing distance from the airport. Furthermore, reported annoyance and interference is greater in those areas where higher numbers of noise events are encountered, even at relatively low noise levels of 60 LAmax – something not evident from average energy noise contours. This finding strengthens the argument that it is insufficient to provide only average energy aircraft noise information when studying the impact of aircraft noise. To understand the situation more fully, supplemental noise information is essential. The study concludes with a framework constructed to apply supplemental aircraft noise information to the abatement and mitigation measures normally used to deal with aircraft noise...|$|R

40|$|Reduction {{of noise}} from road- and railway traffic will {{generate}} major social benefits {{in urban areas}} in the Netherlands. This will improve the environmental quality of residential areas and areas for new housing estate. This followed from an investigation {{carried out by the}} RIVM for the Dutch Ministry of Housing Spatial Planning and the Environment. In the investigation benefits from noise measures, such as silent tires, quiet pavements and noise barriers were evaluated. The method of Hedonic Pricing was used to value the effect of noise on the market value of dwellings. Also the influence of reducing noise on the market value of building lands was investigated. In general measures at the source, such as silent tires, quiet pavements or tracks, appear to be highly cost-effective. Noise barriers seem less cost effective. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the total benefits from cost-effective noise measures amounts to 7 billion euros. The bulk of these benefits is be obtained alongside urban roads and railways. In addition to the social benefits from noise measures in dense built-up urban areas, benefits may also be attained by improving noise quality in nature areas and <b>noise</b> abatement <b>zones</b> in rural parts of the Netherlands. An indication based on the 'willingness to pay' of visitors for enjoying undisturbed nature amounts to over 60 million euros for all nature areas and <b>noise</b> abatement <b>zones.</b> In general, these benefits cannot be achieved cost-effectively. However, it is possible to find some areas with relatively large numbers of visitors where noise measures could prove cost-effective. One example in the Netherlands is the 'Dwingelderveld' National Park...|$|R

In these <b>zones,</b> <b>noise</b> can induce or suppress spike generation. We explain {{this in terms of}} bifurcation phenomena in the underlying deterministic model. We also show how coupled bursters can interact to provide in-phase and out-of-phase synchronous regimes with varying noise intensity. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a fault-tolerant attitude controller for next-generation nanosatellites. The proposed fault-tolerant attitude control algorithms {{in this study}} are based on first-order and high-order sliding-mode control theories as well as fuzzy logic systems to achieve low cost and real-time autonomy. A locally asymptotically stable adaptive fuzzy first-order sliding-mode controller is chosen as the best solution to the local attitude control tracking problem. This novel fault-tolerant controller is validated by simulation results with reaction wheel Coulomb friction, saturation, <b>noise,</b> dead <b>zones,</b> bias faults, and external disturbances. Simulation and testing results presented in the paper demonstrate that the attitude control system can provide successful pointing and tracking in the presence of system uncertainties for a specified class of reaction wheel failures...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{iron and}} steel {{industry}} in South Africa has been identified as one of the highest risk industries in terms of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). The National Institute for Occupational Health was commissioned by the Department of Labour to audit the current noise exposure levels and hearing conservation practices in eight major producers of {{iron and steel}}, and to make recommendations regarding prevention strategies. METHODS: The audit was conducted in two parts: the noise exposure levels and hearing conservation practices were assessed by the occupational hygiene department. The occupational medicine department assessed the hearing conservation policies and procedures, reviewed employees’ medical records to ascertain the number of NIHL cases, and conducted verification of audiograms on a sample of employees working in <b>noise</b> <b>zones.</b> RESULTS: Area <b>noise</b> levels exceeding 105 dB(A) were measured in four of the eight workplaces. The estimated average annual incidence of NIHL varied from 0. 7 - 8. 3 / 1000 /year. All companies did baseline, periodic and exit audiometric testing, but there were notable discrepancies between companies and verification audiograms and differences of more than 20 dB(A) were found. Although information and training on noise was reportedly done in all worksites, a high proportion of workers could not demonstrate correct fitting of hearing protection devices or recall when last they were trained. CONCLUSION: A detailed standard operating procedure should be implemented for medical surveillance for NIHL with action timelines that initiate remedial processes prior to employee developing compensable disease. Aggregated audiometric testing results should be communicated to managers and health and safety teams to provide guidance to prioritise areas for control measures. A quality assurance programme for audiometric testing must be implemented. An evaluation tool to measure the effectiveness of the noise and hearing conservation training provided to employees, including contracted employees, should be adopted. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The article {{outlines}} the spatio-temporal dimensions of air traffic noise {{and its relation}} to urban planning and the presumed conditions of public health. Placed in the setting of Cold War Berlin, the measuring and the localization of noise pollution becomes, step by step, a social and political issue. Emerging environmental awareness started challenging the well-established top-down planning procedures concerning inner-city territories. In this essay, the implementation of <b>noise</b> pollution <b>zones</b> at West Berlin airports is linked to modes of policing an urban soundscape, in particular {{when it comes to the}} spatial and temporal annoyance induced by noise. When combating air traffic noise, new social movements and environmental experts face different sets of hegemonic rules that organize airspace. This struggle requires a different logic of gaining and 'doing territory' than on the city's street level. " (author's abstract...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the relationship between airport noise exposure and insufficient sleep in the United States by using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). MethodsData on the number of days without enough rest or sleep for approximately 750, 000 respondents to the 2008 and 2009 BRFSS were linked with data on noise exposure modeled using the US Federal Aviation Administration 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (FAA 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) Integrated Noise Model for 95 major US airports for corresponding years. Noise exposure data were stratified into 3 groups depending on noise levels. People living outside airport <b>noise</b> exposure <b>zones</b> were included as a reference category.

40|$|Abstract. Natural images {{consist of}} texture, {{structure}} and smooth regions and {{this makes the}} task of filtering challenging mainly when it aims at edge and texture preservation. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive filtering technique based on a partition of the image to ”noisy smooth zones ” and ”texture or edge + <b>noise</b> ” <b>zones.</b> To this end, an analysis of local features is used to recover a statistical model that associates to each pixel a probability measure corresponding to a membership degree for each class. This probability function is then encoded in a new denoising process based on a MPM (Marginal Posterior Mode) estimation technique. The posterior density is computed through a non parametric density estimation method with variable kernel bandwidth that aims to adapt the denoising process to image structure. In our algorithm {{the selection of the}} bandwidth relies on a non linear function of the membership probabilities. Encouraging, experimental results demonstrate the potential of our approach. ...|$|R

The paper discusses the observations, results and their interpretation based on the study. Noise recordings from site, collected from April 2006 to March 2006, were used for statistical analysis and generation of various noise indices. Noise maps were also created for impact analysis and formulation of <b>Noise</b> Risk <b>Zones.</b> Mean Ldn value ranged between 55. 1 and 87. 3 dB (A). Day time Leq level ranged between 51. 2 and 89. 0 dB (A), where it ranged between 43. 5 and 81. 9 dB (A) during night. The study reveals that present noise level in all the locations exceeds the limit prescribed by CPCB.
