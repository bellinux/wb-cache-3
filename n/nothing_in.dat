5|$|Although Hazlitt had {{reviewed}} {{a performance}} of Measure for Measure for The Examiner on 11 February 1816, and incorporated a few passages, with modifications, into this chapter, including some of his general philosophical reflections and a mention of some of Schlegel's opinions, yet he says <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> Characters of Shakespear's Plays about any stage performances of this play.|$|E
5|$|In {{a hearing}} on November 1, 2001– {{the day before the}} film's {{scheduled}} release on 5,800 screens in 3,200 theaters across the country– the judge refused to issue the injunction. On June 26, 2002, he ruled that the film had <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common with the poem.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E

5|$|On March 4, {{the autopsy}} {{indicated}} Barker had <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> her system since some chocolate milk {{the morning of}} her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play; no signs of violence or sexual molestation. It was found she must {{have lived in the}} closet for three days without food or drink. An inspection of the closet showed marks from her attempt to escape.|$|E
5|$|On October 16 {{the miners}} held {{a meeting and}} {{unanimously}} voted to return to work. They did so beginning the next day, having won <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> concessions. On October 19, the Governor advised President Rutherford B. Hayes that the federal troops could be withdrawn. The Thirteenth Infantry departed the city on October 31, and Colonel Hartley's temporary forces departed in November 1877.|$|E
5|$|The {{club and}} a next-door {{restaurant}} and bar were destroyed in an electrical fire in June 1973, resulting in $1.5 {{million worth of}} damage. Subsequent plans to rebuild the club or reopen {{it in one of}} the megaresort hotels in Atlantic City amounted to <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the years leading up to D'Amato's death in 1984.|$|E

5|$|The estate at Wierzchownia was isolated. Hańska {{was bored}} by {{visits to the}} court at St. Petersburg, and even more bored by noble guests in her own home. She found <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common with the ladies of high society, and longed for the {{stimulating}} discussions she had enjoyed with her brother Henryk. She spent her time reading the books her husband imported from faraway lands.|$|E
5|$|Although Mex and Violeta Urtizberea are {{father and}} daughter, Violeta {{accepted}} {{a role in}} the series without knowing that her father was also part of the cast and asked him to respect her space. Although they played characters of similar ages, they rarely have joint scenes. Julieta Ortega said that she has <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common with her character in the series. Juan Gil Navarro, who appeared in the television drama La Dueña at the same time, said that although he does not normally appear in comedies he followed his wife's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft {{that got the}} film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production was to begin {{at the start of}} 2009, but was delayed while the script was {{completely}} re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise to make it more of an action film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{continued}} playing small roles {{throughout the}} early 1990s. After appearing in Joey Breaker and the critically panned teen zombie picture My Boyfriend's Back, {{he had a}} more notable role playing John Cusack's wealthy friend in the crime comedy Money for <b>Nothing.</b> <b>In</b> 1994, he portrayed an inexperienced mobster in the crime thriller The Getaway, starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, and appeared with Andy García and Meg Ryan in the romantic drama When a Man Loves a Woman. He then played an uptight police deputy who gets punched by Paul Newman– one of Hoffman's acting idols– in the drama Nobody's Fool.|$|E
5|$|In December 1983, Raúl Alfonsin {{was elected}} President of Argentina, {{bringing}} {{to an end}} to the military dictatorship. Under Alfonsin, negotiations started on a new programme with the IMF, but they led to <b>nothing.</b> <b>In</b> March 1984, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela lent Argentina $300 million for three months, followed by a similar amount by the United State. That provided some breathing space as it was not before late September 1984 that an agreement was reached between the IMF and Argentina.|$|E

5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as aspects of his own identity and rule.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet {{served with}} {{distinction}} in the Mexican–American War with the 8th U.S. Infantry. He fought under Zachary Taylor as a lieutenant in May 1846 in the battles of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma, while saying <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> his memoirs {{about his personal}} role in the battles. He fought again with Taylor's army at the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846. He received brevet promotions to captain for Contreras and Churubusco and to major for Molino del Rey. In the Battle of Chapultepec on September 12, 1847, he {{was wounded in the}} thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors; falling, he handed the flag to his friend, Lt. George E. Pickett, who was able to reach the summit.|$|E

Animosity by Protestants waned as Catholics demonstrated their patriotism in war, their commitment to charity, and their dedication to democratic values.|$|R
5|$|On 5 March 2012, {{prior to}} release, Kolkata Metro {{authorities}} objected to {{a scene in}} which Vidya is pushed by a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it would remind people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image. The filmmakers screened the scene for the authorities and explained that <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the film would affect the image of the Metro or prompt people to commit suicide. Convinced, the officials withdrew their objections, and the scene was retained, although it was removed from trailers.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{communities}} {{can set up}} charitable institutions of their own. However, activities in such institutions that are not religious are performed according to the laws laid down by the government.

Also, <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any further law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity that may be associated with religious practice, or providing for social welfare and reform.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> any way remarkable.
