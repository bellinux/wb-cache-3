50|$|Women {{and girls}} are often {{referred}} to using the <b>neuter</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> es, with the pronunciation being something like Ähs. Ähs hat mirs gesaat (it told me so, instead of she told me so; vs. High German: Sie hat es mir gesagt). This stems from the word Mädchen (girl) being neuter in German (es is correct in German when referring to words like Mädchen but would not be used by itself in reference to a woman).|$|E
5000|$|Names of persons, and denominators {{of roles}} and social {{positions}} {{are almost always}} preceded by grammatical articles. References to females, and especially to young females, may decline with the <b>neuter</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> (which {{is not at all}} pejorative). Using articles with personal names is wrong in Standard German, but is normal not only in Rhinelandic but also in most dialects and colloquial varieties of German in central and southern Germany, as well as in Austria and Switzerland.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of a noun {{does not}} always {{coincide}} with its natural gender. An {{example of this is}} the German word Mädchen ("girl"); this is derived from Maid [...] "maiden", umlauted to [...] "Mäd-" [...] with the diminutive suffix -chen, and this suffix always makes the noun grammatically <b>neuter.</b> Hence the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of Mädchen is neuter, although its natural gender is feminine (because it refers to a female person).|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "Maß" [...] can be {{of either}} <b>neuter</b> or female <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> In its <b>neuter</b> form, das Maß, it is the German word for [...] "measure".

It is spelt [...] "Maß" [...] or [...] "Mass" [...] (both spellings are allowed) in Germany and Austria, [...] "Mass" [...] in Switzerland. [...] The plural is also [...]|$|R
40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the interference between <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and false memory in German. In Experiment 1 (N= 42), the feminine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> category served as the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of the targets and lures, while the masculine occurred only in the lure words. The occurrence of feminine gender in both the targets and lures resulted in lower proportions of correct rejections than when targets were feminine and lures were masculine. This indicates that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> was processed as a cue to reject the lures with two-gender condition in the recognition tasks. In Experiment 2 (N= 90), a three-gender manipulation was introduced, in which {{two of the three}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> in German served as the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of the targets and lures, while the other one was used only as lures. Neither the combination of feminine and neuter, nor of feminine and masculine, resulted in higher proportions of correct rejections on the gender-unrelated lures in comparison with gender-related lures. By contrast, the combination of masculine and neuter caused more correct rejections on the feminine lures than both against the masculine and against the neuter lures. It is claimed that the similarity of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> between masculine and neuter did not facilitate identifying the masculine and the neuter items. This might be because of the likelihood that the masculine and the neuter words use the same indefinite articles (i. e. ein) or definite articles in, for example, dative (i. e. dem). Thus, Experiment 3 and 4 extended the design of Experiment 2 with determiners. In Experiment 3 (N= 45), nouns were displayed with definite articles; by contrast, in Experiment 4 (N= 45), pseudo articles, which had the same gender-marked endings as the indefinite articles used by different genders, were presented with nouns. It showed that the advantages of gender unrelated lures found in Experiment 2 disappeared in Experiment 3, but were found again in Experiment 4. The definite articles used in Experiment 3 resulted in a more difficult task; therefore, the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> effect was inhibited. However, the pseudo articles facilitated distinguishing the feminine noun phrases from both the masculine and <b>neuter</b> noun phrases. <b>Grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> were considered {{to be used as a}} memory cue, connected with appropriate articles that can be activated during recognition tasks. Using bare nouns and nouns with pseudo-article noun phrases, false memory caused by gender cues occurred in two conditions: (1) the targets and lures are of the same grammatical gender; (2) the masculine and the neuter words are used as the materials, when one of those acted as targets and the other as lures. In addition, Eye-tracking was used in Experiment 5 (N= 30) and showed that feminine targets caused fewer hits than either masculine or neuter words in the recognition task in a forced choice paradigm. Longer fixation times were found for both feminine targets and lures, than for either masculine or neuter items. By contrast, hits of masculine targets were as frequent as those for neuter targets. Because of this it is assumed that feminine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is more easily processed as a gender cue in the recognition task. In the cases of stimuli that included either masculine or <b>neuter</b> words, <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> information was not as easy as a cue. Recognition tasks were influenced mainly by semantic category effect, so that lures, which were only grammatically gender related but semantically unrelated to the target, were more easily rejected. Targets were fixated for a shorter period of time and received more hits. In the case of stimuli that included feminine words, gender cue is more easily used during the recognition tasks. Lures were influenced by <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> effect and therefore became difficult to be rejected. Targets were fixated on longer and were more frequently confused with lures. The proportion of hits became low for feminine targets. In other words, recent results indicated that feminine gender was more easily used as a memory cue when compared with masculine and neuter...|$|R
50|$|Vulgar Latin is {{believed}} to have already had most of the features shared by all Romance languages, which distinguish them from Classical Latin, such as the almost complete loss of the Latin grammatical case system and its replacement by prepositions; the loss of the <b>neuter</b> <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and comparative inflections; replacement of some verb paradigms by innovations (e.g. the synthetic future gave way to an originally analytic strategy now typically formed by infinitive + evolved present indicative forms of 'have'); the use of articles; and the initial stages of the palatalization of the plosives /k/, /g/, and /t/.|$|E
5000|$|This can be {{referred}} to as one of the three genders in German as well as many other Proto-Indo-European languages {{that can be used to}} describe people and inanimate objects. Understanding neuter is very much similar to learning masculine and feminine as it a requirement for proficiency in the German language. By creating <b>neuter</b> this allowed <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> to be linked to familiar or ideal concepts of sex. Typically, neuter will be in contrast with feminine and masculine, and while the nouns may be the same across all three genders, the endings will change. For the word [...] "the" [...] this will be [...] "Das" [...] in the German neuter language while it will become [...] "Der" [...] in masculine and [...] "Die" [...] in feminine. While feminine and masculine describe female- and male-gendered words, neuter often describes an inanimate or non-living item or object like a table or a couch. The purpose of learning neuter is very much similar to learning masculine and feminine as this affects the other elements of the language.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that speakers of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> languages consider <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrary, but this assumption {{has never been}} tested. Research shows that the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of nouns can affect perceptions of the masculinity or femininity of the noun's referent in speakers of languages with masculine and feminine noun classes. However, bilingualism facilitates the development of lexical arbitrariness awareness, and could therefore affect awareness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrariness. This study then compared three groups of young adult speakers of a <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language: monolinguals, early bilinguals, and instructed second language learners. Participants evaluated the gender assignments of 25 nouns of entities (animals, abstract concepts, natural kinds, and artefacts), and answered open and closed questions about <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Participants considered <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> as semantically motivated and mostly related gender assignments to perceived masculine or feminine connotations of referents. Knowledge of an additional <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language was linked to increased awareness of the arbitrariness of first language gender assignments in both early bilinguals and later instructed learners. It is argued that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> awareness deserves further investigation. Knowing more than one <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language can increase awareness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrariness. Implications are discussed for language teaching and language reform...|$|R
50|$|In the Russian language, {{the system}} of {{grammatical}} declension is elaborate and complex. Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, demonstratives, most numerals and other particles are declined for two grammatical numbers (singular and plural), three <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> (masculine, feminine and <b>neuter)</b> and six <b>grammatical</b> cases (see below). This gives dozens of spelling combinations {{for most of the}} words, which is needed for grammatical agreement within and (often) outside the proposition. Also, there are several paradigms for each declension with numerous irregular forms.|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in bare noun production is a controversial topic. In two experiments with the pictureword interference paradigm we confirmed a reliable effect of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> congruency in bare noun production in Italian and we replicated this effect in Spanish, another Romance language with a gender system {{analogous to the}} Italian one. In both Experiments, naming times were slower for pictureword pairs sharing <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> The {{results of the present}} study support the notion that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is an intrinsic lexical property and not a pure syntactic feature selected only in noun phrase production. We assume that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> selection is crucial in languages with a complex morphological structure, like Italian and Spanish, in which the ending vowel is itself marked for <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French {{language}} {{is one of}} the biggest guessing games for a native English speaker. Why a table is feminine and a book is masculine is a question that plagues those learning French as a second language. In French, all nouns have gender, masculine and feminine. The complication: only a small percentage of the nouns are assigned gender semantically leaving the remaining which are assigned gender seemingly arbitrarily. For English native speakers, the distinction of these basic parts in a foreign {{language is}} not a natural skill. The simple fact that nouns are either feminine or masculine is troubling to students of the French language. This struggle of the English native speaker with French <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> presents a valuable opportunity to study how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is acquired. This project is a study of French <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> acquisition of English native speakers. First, it examines the existing methods by which <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is acquired. The research then contrasts the acquisition of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in second language learning to the acquisition for native French speakers. This paper then factors in the different variables that affect how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is learned as a second language. These variables include age, level of French, motivation, type and amount of explicit review, and positive and negative feedback. I created a survey of students from high school French levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 asking them to identify the gender of a series of French nouns, some of which can be determined by gender by general rules, some exceptions, and nouns that are typically used within various contexts. This project summarizes the results as well as compares them to the students’ responses to the following: How did you learn to decide between masculine and feminine nouns? How do you feel about how well you can distinguish M/F? and What do you know about masculine and feminine nouns in French? This research summarizes the pedagogy surrounding <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and its effectiveness. Processing this study thus acts as a chance to improve personal acuity with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Furthermore, it provides a guide for how to communicate <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French to students. Along with the research, I provide general curricula of how to communicate <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in the French foreign language classroom. This is accompanied by complete lesson plans highlighting <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> as either a focus completely on masculine vs feminine nouns, a review or frontloading activity. This paper and curricula represent the attempt to understand the many facets in the acquisition of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in order to apply a knowledgeable approach to the instruction of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French...|$|R

40|$|This work, <b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> - a Czech-Hungarian {{experimental}} comparison {{deals with}} {{the existence of the}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in language and its influence on the conceptualization of the inanimate objects of its speakers. Its goal is, through carrying out an experiment on Czech language (that means on a language with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender)</b> and on Hungarian language (that means on a language without <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender)</b> to verify the assumption, that the Czech native speakers would focus on the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> while responding, unlike the Hungarian native speakers, whose language does not have <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> For this purpose, two methods are used.

40|$|Aims and objectives/purpose/{{research}} questions: This article reviews {{recent research}} on how speaking a language that marks gender grammatically might affect thinking, and {{on the relationship between}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> knowledge of more than one language, and thinking, in both early and emergent bilinguals. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a comprehensive review of previous research, as well as an introduction to, and an evaluation of, the articles in this special issue. Findings/conclusions: Several themes emerge in the research on <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and thinking in bilinguals. First, knowledge of more than one language could reduce the effects of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> on thinking. Second, these effects may depend on the combination of languages being acquired. Third, researchers are starting to identify other variables that might affect when and how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> influences thinking, including proficiency and the choice of tasks. Originality: This manuscript synthesises the previously scattered research on <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and thinking in bilinguals.

For the most part, only some very general tendencies governing <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> assignment {{have been suggested}} {{in the face of}} the prevalent anomalist approaches to gender theory. However, these anomalist views of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> assignment offer no explanation for very basic questions about this aspect of language. First, how do native speaking children of languages with <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> learn a system with little or no trouble that via pure memorization would take years of concerted study to master? Second, how can native speakers almost unanimously agree on gender assignment for new loan words coming into the language?The answer to these questions is that there must be some underlying system by which <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is assigned to nouns in a given language. The present paper uses two principles, gender eclipsis and gender tally, to postulate rules for the assignment of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in Modern Swedish. The purpose of the research is to display the systematicity found in the gender system of Swedish and to argue further against the anomalist theory of gender assignment in all languages. 1. 0 An overview of grammatical sender theory and researchGrammatical gender has long been a topic of great speculation in most fields of linguistic studies.

To this end, I try to give some reasons for the non-arbitrariness of some words, {{as well as for}} the non-arbitrariness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> in Romance languages, especially Romanian and French. I focus on several specific linguistic structures and uses of particular words in these two languages. I particularly deal with the construction of a third <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> the <b>neuter,</b> in Romanian, in comparison to the two <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> existing in French, trying to see how the application of Irigaray&iacute;s theory on the gender of nouns functions for Romanian language. There is no third <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French, and therefore Irigaray&iacute;s argument is proved to be invalid for Romanian. The questions that lead my analysis are: What corporeality does the third <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> the <b>neuter</b> in Romanian, point to? How are we to consider neuter words? Is the neuter a necessary and sufficient proof for considering Romanian a less sexist lan- guage? Is the neuter the guarantor of impartiality and equilibrium in a grammatically gendered language...|$|R

For epicenes, pronoun resolution was driven by the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> marked in the epicene’s representation. For bi-genders, pronoun resolution was driven by the gender assigned by context. The results are discussed in the light of current models of anaphor resolution...|$|R
