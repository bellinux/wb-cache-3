He also held a racing licence issued by the <b>National</b> <b>Sporting</b> <b>Authority</b> of the Republic of Ireland (drivers are not compelled to obtain their licence from their home country). The FIA's International Sporting Regulations state that drivers competing in FIA World Championships shall compete under the nationality of their passport, rather {{than that of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Sporting</b> <b>Authority</b> that issued their racing licence, {{as is the case in}} other racing series. Relating to Irvine's nationality, the FIA repeatedly mistakenly issued official entry lists that claimed Irvine was competing under the Irish nationality (e.g. entry list for the 1995 and 1996 season).|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{drivers who}} are {{required}} {{to compete in the}} FIA Formula One World Championship under the nationality of their passport, the FIA's International Sporting Code states that teams competing in the FIA Formula One World Championship shall compete under the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their FIA racing licence. On the basis of this regulation, despite the fact that most current teams are based in the UK, this country is officially represented in Formula One only by teams holding a racing licence issued by the British <b>National</b> <b>Sporting</b> <b>Authority.</b> Teams take the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their licence for the period of validity of that licence and the change of the nationality is allowed. Several teams changed their nationality during their competition in Formula One (e.g. Shadow in 1976 from American to British, Benetton in 1996 from British to Italian, Renault in 2011 from French to British). Benetton is the only team to have achieved victories while racing under two different nationalities.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{differences}} in home advantage experienced {{in different types}} of events and sports contested in the Commonwealth Games. Alternative definitions of performance are employed to examine host nations' performances at home relative to proximate away editions immediately before and after hosting the competition. Depending on which performance indicator is used, {{it could be argued}} that host nations perform better at home more consistently in 'men only' events or in 'men only' and 'women only' events. By contrast, the analysis illustrates that home advantage is least likely to occur in 'mixed/open' events across all indicators examined. The sport specific analysis supports the view that home advantage is more prevalent in certain types of sports, particularly those which are held at the discretion of the host nation; in single competition sports; and, in sports involving more subjective input by officials. Assuming that achieving better performance is one, even if only minor, objective for nations hosting the competition, relevant <b>national</b> <b>sports</b> <b>authorities</b> should be conscious of which types of events and sports are likely to yield greater home advantage, so that they can determine the appropriate composition of their home sports programmes to complement their traditional strengths...|$|R
