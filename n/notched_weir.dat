40|$|Snow-driven {{mountain}} {{systems in}} the American West may be particularly sensitive sentinels of regional climate change as manifested by altered snowcover and hydrologic characteristics, changes in plant communities and biogeochemical fluxes, and seasonal shifts in energy budgets. Integrated monitoring could reveal to resource managers early evidence of emerging trends, and nearer-term disturbances, in local and regional mountain processes and the ecosystem services they provide. Modelers benefit from field verification of their forecasts, and mountain system process researchers can also utilize monitoring infrastructure. The Senator Beck Basin Study Area has been developed in the western San Juan Mountains near Silverton, Colorado by the Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies. The San Juan Mountains are a significant contributor to the Colorado River Basin and are the primary headwater of the Rio Grande River. SBBSA is a 290 ha catchment spanning elevations from 3353 to 4118 m and contains alpine tundra at the highest elevations, sub-alpine forest at the lowest, and a krumholz ecotone between. Arrays of instrumentation located above and below tree line monitor weather, snowpack, energy budget, and soil condition parameters. A nearby micro-met station monitors ‘free air’ wind, air temperature and humidity. A broad-crested, <b>notched</b> <b>weir</b> at the basin pour-point monitors discharge and water properties, and two additional inter-basin sites monitor stream stage. A comprehensive inventory of the basin 2 ̆ 7 s plant communities was performed in 2004 and will be repeated in 2009. Research teams currently utilizing the basin are exploring the effects of desert dust depositions on alpine snowpack, hydrologic, biogeochemical, and climatic processes. Regional water stakeholders are supporting the development of streamflow forecasting tools that incorporate the effects of desert dust on snowmelt timing and intensit...|$|E

Hydraulic structures can increase dissolved oxygen levels by creat-ing turbulent conditions, where small air bubbles are carried into the bulk of the flow.

This paper seeks triangular <b>notch</b> <b>weirs</b> having different weir angle (α) and how they affect the aeration performance.

40|$|Thin plate weirs {{have been}} widely used for {{measuring}} discharge rate in open channel flow accurately. The flow characteristic over a thin plate weir is completely different between a single V <b>notch</b> <b>weir</b> and double VV <b>notch</b> <b>weir.</b> The continuity of the flow and accuracy of this type of weirs is reported to be poor. As an improvement, a compound weir composed of two triangle parts with a different notch angle and height has been designed. Mathematical method also been proposed to measure the discharge flow rate over the double VV <b>notch</b> compound <b>weir.</b> Height and width of weir plate are the two parameters characterizing discharge rate over the <b>notch</b> <b>weirs.</b> Mathematical calculation and simulation are conducted by measuring the discharge and the height over the weir for variable weir height and width...|$|R
25|$|A <b>notch</b> <b>weir</b> is any weir {{where the}} {{physical}} barrier is {{significantly higher than}} the water level except for a specific notch (often V-shaped) cut into the panel. At times of normal flow all the water must pass through the notch, simplfiying flow volume calculations, and at times of flood the water level can rise and submerge the weir without any alterations made to the structure.|$|R
40|$|The most {{classic example}} of a {{hydraulic}} structure where gas transfer occurs is a weir. Transfer of gases between the atmosphere and river water can occur in a free overfall jet from a weir. A free overfall jet from a weir plunging into down-stream water causes entrainment of air bubbles if the free overfall jet velocity exceeds the critical value where aeration occurs. This paper investigates the free overfall jets from Venturi and rectangular <b>notch</b> <b>weirs</b> and their effect on air entrainment rate. A Venturi weir was placed at the upstream channel end {{in order to increase}} the flow velocity of the free overfall jet and, in turn, to increase air entrainment. It was demonstrated that the air entrainment rate of the Venturi weir is significantly better than the rectangular <b>notch</b> <b>weir,</b> and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the throat width of the Venturi weir is decreased. These results demonstrated that Venturi weirs can be used as highly effective aerators in streams, rivers, constructed channels, fish hatcheries, water treatment plants, etc. Moreover, a regression equation was obtained for the Venturi weirs, relating air entrainment rate to unit discharge, weir crest width, drop height and throat width of Venturi weir. There was good agreement between the measured air entrainment rates and the values computed from the predictive equation. Key words: air entrainment rate, aeration, jet expansion, Venturi, wei...|$|R

This paper informs about the hydrodynamic aspects of a recent development of a fluidic controller keeping the metal gravity flow constant. The controller uses a narrow <b>notch</b> <b>weir</b> for generating the control signal and a fluidic vortex valve as the actuator. An unusual feature is the signal transfer between the two components performed also by a molten metal flow.

40|$|The {{design of}} a fish ladder that would operate with {{downstream}} tide fluctuations of 14 ft and upstream river fluctuations of 1 ft were developed in two hydraulic models. The hydraulic design of the ladder was developed in a 1 : 8 -scale model. Hydraulic characteristics of a false weir at the upstream end of the ladder were studied in a 1 : 4 -scale model. The ladder was intended to pass primarily shad and alewives. The initial fish ladder was of the vertical-slot type with 29 pools and a false weir above high tide level to lead fish into a steep chute to the river 6. 5 ft below. The design was hydraulically satisfactory. The design was modified to include a direct swim-through exit to the river for use during low and intermediate tides. The low tide ladder section consisted of five pools with <b>notched</b> <b>weirs</b> and a weir gate exit. The false weir exit was designed to operate with all tide levels, but fish were to be blocked from that section by a barrier rack during {{the use of the}} low tide exit. In a further modification, the <b>notched</b> <b>weirs</b> of the low tide section were replaced with a submerged screen barrier that would force fish toward the surface for better public viewing. With that plan, the false weir exit operated only when the low tide exit was closed. All the plans were satisfactory. The plan with a false weir exit and a low tide exit with submerged barrier screen was selected for construction...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Replacement spillways are {{frequently}} required to pass revised and larger design storm events. Generally matching the outflow hydrograph {{of the existing}} spillway is also a common design requirement. Labyrinth spillways can increase spillway discharge capacity. Staged and notched sections of crest {{have been used in}} design to satisfy discharge hydrograph requirements. However, inadequate hydraulic design information is available specific to staged and <b>notched</b> labyrinth <b>weirs.</b> In this study, the flow characteristics of multiple staged and <b>notched</b> labyrinth <b>weir</b> configurations (laboratory-scale) were tested. Head-discharge relationships were evaluated experimentally and compared with computed results using superposition (predicting the discharge over the upper and lower stages separately and summing). The results of this comparison show that, for all configurations tested, the superposition technique estimated actual discharges by approximately ± 10 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) {{in the waters}} of rivers and streams is very important to the quality and existence of aquatic life. Hydraulic structures {{have an impact on the}} amount of dissolved oxygen in a river system, even though the water is in contact with the structure for only a short time. The same quantity of oxygen transfer that normally would occur over several kilometers in a river can occur at a single hydraulic structure. The primary reason for this accelerated oxygen transfer is that air is entrained into the flow, which produces a large number of bubbles. These air bubbles greatly increase the surface area available for mass transfer. Plunging overfall jets from weirs are a particular instance of this, and the aeration properties of such structures have been studied widely in the laboratory and eld over a number of years. This study investigates weirs having dierent cross-sectional geometry and how they aect the aeration performance. It is demonstrated that the aeration eciency of the triangular <b>notch</b> <b>weir</b> is generally better than the other weirs...|$|R

Ground based scans {{were used to}} model the ground elevation {{in the area of}} a stream gauge weir over an area of 240 m 2 at a resolution of 0. 05 m. The terrain model was used to assess the possibility of flow bypassing the weir and to calculate stream flow during filling of the weir pool, prior to flow through the <b>weir</b> <b>notch.</b> The mapped surface shows a subtle low-lying area {{at the south end of}} the structure where flow could bypass the weir. The flow calculations quantify low-flows that do not reach the <b>weir</b> <b>notch</b> during small rain events and flow at the beginning of larger events in the ephemeral stream...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} the design of the quadratic <b>weir</b> <b>notch,</b> which finds application in the proportionate method of flow measurement in a by-pass, such that the discharge through it is proportional to the square root of the head measured above a certain datum. The <b>weir</b> <b>notch</b> consists of a bottom {{in the form of a}} rectangular weir of width 2 W and depth a over which a designed curve is fitted. A theorem concerning the flow through compound weirs called the “slope discharge continuity theorem” is discussed and proved. Using this, the problem is reduced to the determination of an exact solution to Volterra's integral equation in Abel's form. It is shown that in the case of a quadratic <b>weir</b> <b>notch,</b> the discharge is proportional to the square root of the head measured above a datum Image a above the crest of the weir. Further, it is observed that the function defining the shape of the weir is rapidly convergent and its value almost approximates to zero at distances of 3 a and above from the crest of the weir. This interesting and significant behaviour of the function incidentally provides a very good approximate solution to a particular Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, transforming the notch into a device called a “proportional-orifice”. A new concept of a “notch-orifice” capable of passing a discharge proportional to the square root of the head (above a particular datum) while acting both as a notch, and as an orifice, is given. A typical experiment with one such notch-orifice, having A = 4 in., and W = 6 in., shows a remarkable agreement with the theory and is found to have a constant coefficient of discharge of 0. 61 in the ranges of both notch and orifice...|$|R

40|$|A {{theory and}} {{generalized}} synthesis procedure is advocated {{for the design}} of <b>weir</b> <b>notches</b> and orifice-notches having a base in any given shape, to a depth a, such that the discharge through it is proportional to any singular monotonically-increasing function of the depth of flow measured above a certain datum. The problem is reduced to finding an exact solution of a Volterra integral equation in Abel form. The maximization of the depth of the datum below the crest of the notch is investigated. Proof is given that for a <b>weir</b> <b>notch</b> made out of one continuous curve, and for a flow proportional to the mth power of the head, it is impossible to bring the datum lower than (2 m − 1) a below the crest of the notch. A new concept of an orifice-notch, having discontinuity in the curve and a division of flow into two distinct portions, is presented. The division of flow is shown to have a beneficial effect in reducing the datum below (2 m − 1) a from the crest of the weir and still maintaining the proportionality of the flow. Experimental proof with one such orifice-notch is found to have a constant coefficient of discharge of 0. 625. The importance of this analysis in the design of grit chambers is emphasized...|$|R

From {{executive}} summary: Little Falls Dam, {{also referred}} to as the Brookmont Dam, is located on the Potomac River in Montgomery County, Maryland, approximately 1 mile upstream from the border between Maryland and the District of Columbia and approximately 75 feet upstream of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Dam. The Little Falls Dam provides a water supply storage pool on the Potomac River for the Washington Aqueduct for distribution to the Washington, D. C., metropolitan area.

40|$|V-shaped weirs {{with small}} angles are {{efficient}} in accurately measuring extremely small discharge rates. The concept of slit weirs to measure discharge rates {{has been studied}} in recent investigations. Rectangular multi-slit <b>notches</b> or <b>weirs</b> {{have been shown to}} extend the range of flow measurement to include both very low and high discharge rates. It is a well-known fact that V-notches whose sections are narrower at lower heads are preferred to rectangular notches to measure small discharge rates in laboratories. To increase the range of discharges measured, the concept of multi-slit weirs using rectangular weirs has been introduced recently. For rectangular multi-slit weirs, experimental data showed that the discharge coefficient C d for multi-slit weirs or a single weir was a function of the Reynolds number R e when R e is based on the width of rectangular weirs. V-notches are generally used for laboratory flow measurements, as they can very precisely measure discharge rates. Hence, the multi-slit weirs formed by V-notches are expected to measure discharges in a very wide range of discharge rates. To represent a common discharge coefficient C d for multi-slit weirs formed of either rectangular or triangular shaped individual weirs, a new Reynolds number R eR is proposed to unify representation of discharge coefficient data for both rectangular shaped and V-shaped multi-slit weir units. C d data for both rectangular and V-shaped multi-slit weirs fall on a single curve and appear to be the function of R eR. At large Reynolds number, R eR, the discharge coefficient C d approaches a constant value of 0. 61. This constant also denotes the contraction coefficient for the narrow two-dimensional slit flow. Present test data show that C d for multi-slit V-shaped weirs is generally a function of R eR for b/B < 0. 3. Here, R eR is based on the hydraulic radius R and b is the value of top flow width of the water passing the multi-slit weirs. A very limited number of numerical simulations are also performed to determine discharge coefficient (C d) and the water surface profiles for the multi-slit V-shaped weirs. The predictions related to the surface profile based on the numerical model are validated by experimental data. The three-dimensional (3 D) two-equation standard k- [varepsilon] turbulence model together with the volume of fluid VOF tracking technique is effectively used to obtain a few simulation results that are limited in scop...|$|R
