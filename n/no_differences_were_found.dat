25|$|In a Survation poll on adults aged 40–70, 92.5% {{identified}} as heterosexual, 3.5% as gay, 2.4% as bisexual, 0.5% as Other and 1% refused {{to disclose their}} sexual orientation. Those under 60 {{were less likely to}} identify as heterosexual than those aged 60–70. A gay identity was more common among men (6.1%) than women (1%), though <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in the share identifying as bisexual (2.4% versus 2.5%). London had a higher share of middle aged or older people identifying as gay (8%) or bisexual (6%) than other parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{psychological}} studies recruit college students to participate for reasons of convenience, and the studies on the social sharing of emotion were no exception. For this reason, the question was raised of whether the level of education {{plays a role in}} these sharing behaviors. A 1998 study addressed this question by analyzing data from a cross-sectional study of girls in elementary school, middle school, high school, girls pursuing an undergraduate education in college, and girls pursuing a master's degree. Despite possible reasons to believe that education might increase the capacity to and likelihood of sharing behaviors, <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found.</b>|$|E
25|$|Obsidian {{can be used}} to make {{extremely}} sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type {{of glass}} knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, as with any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at seven days, in a group of rats, although <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> after 21 days. Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes, and has written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may currently be purchased for surgical use on research animals.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effect of oral versus submucosal {{meperidine}} on the behavior of pediatric dental patients. Twenty charts (10 in each group) were retrospectively reviewed. The groups were matched for age and weight.

25|$|One small 2009 {{double-blind}} study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between the HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures. A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E

50|$|In another study, {{researchers}} {{compared the}} effects of overlearning and distributed practice on mathematics knowledge. Distributed practice refers to practice that is spaced over time. In Experiment 1, participants completed 10 math problems either all at once or distributed across two sessions. Participants in the distributed practice condition performed no differently from participants in the single-session condition one week later, but distributed practice participants did perform better than single-session participants four weeks later. In Experiment 2, participants completed either three or nine practice problems in one sitting. When participants were retested one or four weeks later, <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between three-problem and nine-problem participants.

50|$|Four {{members of}} the Daucus genus were {{examined}} to determine differences in isoenzyme patterns, and plastid DNA. The four were: Daucus carota subspecies sativus cultivar Danvers, D. carota subsp. gummifer, D. capillifolius, and D. pusillus. Although only one form of HSDH (homoserine dehydrogenase) was present in each Daucus line, the rate of migration of HSDH from cv. Danvers was {{different from that of}} the others. Multiple isoenzymic forms of ADH were present in each Daucus cultivar. Comparison of endonuclease restriction fragment patterns from plastid DNAs digested by BamHI revealed only small differences between plastid DNAs of cv. Danvers and subsp. gummifer, whereas large differences were observed between cv. Danvers and D. pusillus plastid DNA patterns. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between cv. Danvers and D. capillifolius plastid DNA patterns when examined using eight different restriction enzymes. The data indicate that specific isoenzyme and organeile DNA restriction fragment patterns will be useful markers for precise identification of genomes of different Daucus species.|$|E
50|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex {{is the human}} cerebrum's outer layer and is composed of neural tissue. An MRI study compared cortical thickness in various brain regions of homosexual men, heterosexual men and heterosexual women. It found that homosexual men had thinner cortices compared to heterosexual men in the right hemisphere's lateral orbitofrontal region, {{as well as in}} regions located in the visual cortex (lingual, pericalcarine and cuneus). The same regions also showed thinner cortex in heterosexual women than in heterosexual men, whereas <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between heterosexual women and homosexual men. Homosexual and heterosexual men did not differ in total brain volumes and it was determined that the reported differences in cortical thickness were not affected by the subjects' years of education or brain volume. As the aforementioned regions exhibit sexual dimorphism, the authors speculated that biological processes frequently proposed to underlay sexual dimorphism, such as gene-dependent and sex hormone-dependent mechanisms during prenatal and postnatal development, may interact with the cortical architecture in visual areas resulting in different cortical thickness in homosexual versus heterosexual men.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{the first}} {{official}} scale by Nancy Bayley, research was conducted to determine which important variables {{should be included in}} a cumulative developmental test for infants. In 1965, Nancy Bayley conducted an experiment examining mental and motor test scores for infants aged 1 to 15 months, comparing sex, birth order, race, geographical location, and parental education. No differences in scores were found for either scale between boys and girls, first-born and later-born, education of either father or mother, or geographic residence. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between African Americans and Caucasians on the Mental Scale, but the African American babies tended consistently to score above the Caucasians on the Motor Scale. These findings emphasised the need to study in careful detail the development of mental processes in the second year of life. Within this period evidently will be found the explanation of the socioeconomic and ethnic differences in mental functioning that are repeatedly found for children of 4 years and older. Following the need for further investigation, Nancy Bayley conducted a related experiment in which the reliability of her revised scale of mental and motor development {{during the first year of}} life was tested, which yielded the following results: (1) Mental Scale items with high tester-observer and high test-retest reliabilities deal with object-oriented behavior; (2) Mental Scale items with low test-retest reliabilities require social interaction; (3) Motor Scale items with high tester-observer and high test-retest reliabilities deal with independent control of head, trunk, and extremities; (4) Motor Scale items with low test-retest reliability require assistance by an adult. These findings implicated early diagnosis of neural malfunctioning. Likewise, Nancy Bayley also conducted a test on infant vocalizations and their relationships to mature intelligence was conducted it 1967, in which participants were monitored over longitudinal studies, followed infants use of vocalizing displeasures and satisfaction, and correlating them with language skills of the same individual over childhood and adolescence, into early adulthood. The results indicate that vocalizations did significantly correlate with girls’ later intelligence, increasingly so with age, and more highly with verbal then performance scores.|$|E
