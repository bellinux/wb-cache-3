He hoped that, as people slowly got into it, the world and language would excite readers on a deeper level. According to Munroe, nothing like [...] "Time" [...] had been done before because it is difficult to reach people once every hour without a tool such as the Internet.|$|E
500|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Messi {{is known}} for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and precise passing, and is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker, though his ability on penalties has somewhat deteriorated in recent seasons. His pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or {{the right side of the}} pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, [...] "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> with Messi's ball control." [...] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast in Glee, Colfer had no {{professional}} acting experience. He originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Artie Abrams, performing [...] "Mr. Cellophane" [...] from the musical Chicago. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show. Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from The Sound of Music, a role that Colfer once played as a child. The Hummel surname comes from the popular German Hummel figurines; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion. Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, [...] "I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual. I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> who looks like him or acts like him or sounds like him. You'd think he’d been at Juilliard for six years but he hasn't."

Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement {{when it comes to making}} pop records. I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, it was the perfect union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio.

Up until hearing {{the sound of music}} he has hardly ventured out and not {{travelled}} far at that. Although he has offered to be the fiddler’s eyes he becomes annoyed when continually asked to describe how things are and when he tells him that it’s “day” he feels the need to add an “if you like” casting a shadow of doubt on even this simple answer. Later on when he imagines things they might come across in their travels he only mentions the gutter and a muckheap.

500|$|Rivera {{achieved}} {{a reputation as}} an all-time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers. Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him [...] "the best ever, no doubt", while Trevor Hoffman said he [...] "will go down as the best reliever in the game in history". Torre said, [...] "He's the best I've ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, but the calm he puts over the clubhouse." [...] Writer Tom Verducci said, [...] "Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position {{in the history of}} baseball. There is Rivera, a gulf, and then every other closer." [...] He compared Rivera's reputation for being the best at his position to that of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said, [...] "Clearly unequivocally, he's the greatest relief pitcher of all time, and did {{it in a way that}} was remarkable." [...] Speaking about Rivera's looming presence at the end of games, Alex Rodriguez said, [...] "He's the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning, because they knew he was out there. I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> who could affect a game like that." [...] Gossage said that Rivera [...] "might be the greatest closer of all-time" [...] but suggested that the modern closer's job has become too specialized and easy compared to multiple-inning [...] "firemen" [...] from Gossage's era; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage logged 53. Although the Baseball Writers' Association of America has historically been reluctant to elect relievers into the Baseball Hall of Fame, sportswriters anticipate that Rivera will be elected in his first year of eligibility. In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its list of the greatest MLB players.|$|E

On March22, the band appeared live on the late night talk show Lopez Tonight as a musical guest where they performed the single [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] to promote the album. The band reportedly almost drank the entire bar behind the Turner Broadcasting System set, with George Lopez saying to J-Dog, [...] "Drink all of it. Go ahead, I don’t care.

[...] "Been to Hell" [...] was previously released as a promotional single with a lyric video on February 6, but was then released as a single with a music video, leading to it chart on Billboards Heatseeker and Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts. Because [...] "Coming Back Down" [...] was released {{on the same day}} as [...] "Been to Hell", the track did not get a music video. [...] "Coming Back Down" [...] previously surfaced due to a leak on February 18 and was later confirmed to be on the album and was produced by Kevin Rudolf. Brian Voerding noted that the song showed the band's strength in both singing and rapping while comparing the sound to Linkin Park. The album's fourth single, [...] "Comin' in Hot", was released on April 9 with a music video to celebrate the album's release. Similar to [...] "Been to Hell", [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] was originally a free promotional single released on January 21, but was later released as an album single following the release of American Tragedy. The track was reviewed by Evigshed along with [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] after it was released as a promotional single, who gave both [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] and [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] a perfect ten out of ten score, noting that [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] was much more upbeat and was extremely catchy. On July 8, it was announced the fifth single for the album would be [...] "My Town".
