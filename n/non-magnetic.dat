5|$|The <b>non-magnetic</b> {{character}} of zinc and {{its lack of}} color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{is not as}} hard as some {{grades of}} {{heat-treated}} steel; it is <b>non-magnetic</b> and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is <b>non-magnetic.</b> Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a silvery-white metal with {{a slight}} golden tinge that takes a high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk nickel is <b>non-magnetic</b> above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two <b>non-magnetic</b> insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a <b>non-magnetic,</b> non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|One of SSI's first grants {{funded the}} {{development}} of the mass driver, a device first proposed by O'Neill in 1974. Mass drivers are based on the coilgun design, adapted to accelerate a <b>non-magnetic</b> object. One application O'Neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball-sized chunks of ore mined {{from the surface of the}} Moon into space. Once in space, the ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites. He took a sabbatical from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace during the 1976–77 academic year. At MIT, he, Henry H. Kolm, and a group of student volunteers built their first mass driver prototype. The eight-foot (2.5m) long prototype could apply 33g (320m/s2) of acceleration to an object inserted into it. With financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800g (18,000m/s2), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160m) long could launch material off the surface of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a wheeled vehicle with differential gears that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a <b>non-magnetic</b> compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that the device was successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that the device was crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of gear teeth on each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these gear wheels were properly positioned.|$|E
25|$|Type E (chromel–constantan) has a {{high output}} (68µV/°C), which makes it well suited to {{cryogenic}} use. Additionally, it is <b>non-magnetic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The need {{to carry}} out such swings {{regularly}} caused delays in both the fieldwork and later office work. This experience convinced Bauer that a new ship built using <b>non-magnetic</b> materials was essential for carrying out further surveys and the Carnegie was designed and built in this way, replacing the Galilee after it had completed three voyages.|$|E
25|$|Superconducting magnets {{are some}} of the most {{powerful}} electromagnets known. They are used in MRI/NMR machines, mass spectrometers, the beam-steering magnets used in particle accelerators and plasma confining magnets in some tokamaks. They can also be used for magnetic separation, where weakly magnetic particles are extracted from a background of less or <b>non-magnetic</b> particles, as in the pigment industries.|$|E
25|$|Spoonbill {{was among}} the first in a group of <b>non-magnetic</b> minesweepers of wooden {{construction}} capable of sweeping any conventional type mine constructed at the time. On 4 July 1955, she was assigned to United States Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet, Charleston, South Carolina. After shakedown training off Key West, Florida, from 26 July to 24 August, and post-shakedown availability at Rawles Brothers' Shipyard, Jacksonville, Florida, Spoonbill returned to Charleston.|$|E
25|$|Type T (copper–constantan) {{thermocouples}} are {{suited for}} measurements in the −200 to 350°C range. Often {{used as a}} differential measurement, since only copper wire touches the probes. Since both conductors are <b>non-magnetic,</b> there is no Curie point and thus no abrupt change in characteristics. Type-T thermocouples have a sensitivity of about 43µV/°C. Note that copper has a much higher thermal conductivity than the alloys generally used in thermocouple constructions, {{and so it is}} necessary to exercise extra care with thermally anchoring type-T thermocouples.|$|E
25|$|Technology {{advanced}} significantly {{during this}} period. Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang invented the wooden ox, suggested {{to be an}} early form of the wheelbarrow, and improved on the repeating crossbow. Wei mechanical engineer Ma Jun {{is considered by many}} to be the equal of his predecessor Zhang Heng. He invented a hydraulic-powered, mechanical puppet theatre designed for Emperor Ming of Wei, square-pallet chain pumps for irrigation of gardens in Luoyang, and the ingenious design of the south-pointing chariot, a <b>non-magnetic</b> directional compass operated by differential gears.|$|E
25|$|Explorer had two 1,500-U.S.-gallon (1,249- Imperial-gallon; 5,678-liter) tanks for {{gasoline}} and diesel oil for the fleet of 16 boats she operated, consisting of four 30-foot (9.1-meter) heavy launches powered by 30-hp (22.4-Kw) diesel engines and outfitted for hydrographic surveying, two additional launches carried on heavy davits, two 24-foot (7.3-meter) whaleboats powered by gasoline engines, two <b>non-magnetic</b> whaleboats, and six 16- and 20-foot (4.9- and 6.1-meter) skiffs and dories. She {{also had a}} 5-ton magazine for the storage of explosives used in radio acoustic ranging operations.|$|E
25|$|They operate {{very well}} in {{oxidizing}} atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen {{with a small amount}} of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as green rot, due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is <b>non-magnetic).</b>|$|E
25|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} and experiment have both shown that periodically arrayed conducting elements (<b>non-magnetic</b> by nature) respond predominantly to the magnetic component of incident electromagnetic fields. The {{result is an}} effective medium and negative μeff over a band of frequencies. The permeability was verified to be {{the region of the}} forbidden band, where the gap in propagation occurred – from a finite section of material. This was combined with a negative permittivity material, εeff < 0, to form a “left-handed” medium, which formed a propagation band with negative group velocity where previously there was only attenuation. This validated predictions. In addition, a later work determined that this first metamaterial had a range of frequencies over which the refractive index was predicted to be negative for one direction of propagation (see ref #). Other predicted electrodynamic effects were to be investigated in other research.|$|E
25|$|Bell {{appeared}} to have spent little time in the Volta Laboratory. Tainter's unpublished manuscript and notes (later donated to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History) depict Bell {{as the person who}} suggested the basic lines of research, furnished the financial resources, and then allowed his associates to receive the credit for many of the inventions that resulted. The experimental machines built at the Volta Laboratory include both disc and cylinder types, with some of the disc type turntables rotating vertically about a horizontal axis, as well as a hand-powered, <b>non-magnetic</b> tape recorder. The records and tapes used with the machines were donated to the collections of the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History, and were believed to be the oldest reproducible bona fide sound recordings preserved anywhere in the world. While some were scratched and cracked, others were still in good condition when they were received.|$|E
25|$|In particular, FRP rods {{are useful}} for {{structures}} where the presence of steel would not be acceptable. For example, MRI machines have huge magnets, and accordingly require <b>non-magnetic</b> buildings. Again, toll booths that read radio tags need reinforced concrete that is transparent to radio waves. Also, where the design life of the concrete structure {{is more important than}} its initial costs, non-steel reinforcing often has its advantages where corrosion of reinforcing steel is a major cause of failure. In such situations corrosion-proof reinforcing can extend a structure's life substantially, for example in the intertidal zone. FRP rods may also be useful in situations where {{it is likely that the}} concrete structure may be compromised in future years, for example the edges of balconies when balustrades are replaced, and bathroom floors in multi-story construction where the service life of the floor structure is likely to be many times the service life of the waterproofing building membrane.|$|E
25|$|The LCA {{had a long}} central {{well section}} fitted with three benches, one centre, one each port and starboard, for seating troops. The side benches were covered by the top deck. The well was divided from the bow by a {{bulkhead}} fitted with two vertically hinged doors. This pair of forward-opening armour-plate doors led to the ramp, which was lowered and raised by a simple arrangement of pulleys and wire. Two rollers on the leading outboard edge providing some freedom of movement for the ramp when it was grounded. Over this ramp troops could come ashore {{in two to three}} minutes, or less if the soldiers and crews were well trained. Immediately behind the bulkhead were the steering shelter on the starboard, and the Lewis gun shelter on the port. The steering shelter was fitted with a telegraph and voice pipe for communication with the stoker, a featherspray control lever, and a fold-up seat. The shelter was protected on all four sides by <b>non-magnetic</b> bulletproof plate surmounted by a hinged double-door roof. Most LCAs were fitted with a compass.|$|E
500|$|The observatory, officially [...] "Her Majesty's Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory at Toronto", was {{completed}} the following year. It {{consisted of two}} log buildings, one for the magnetic instruments {{and the other a}} smaller semi-buried building nearby for [...] "experimental determinations". [...] The north end of the main building was connected to a small conical dome which contained a theodolite used to make astronomical measurements for the accurate determination of the local time. [...] The buildings were constructed with as little metal as possible; when metal was required, <b>non-magnetic</b> materials such as brass or copper were used. A small barracks was built nearby to house the crew.|$|E
500|$|The south-pointing chariot {{was another}} {{mechanical}} device credited to Zhang Heng. It was a <b>non-magnetic</b> compass [...] {{vehicle in the}} form of a two-wheeled chariot. Differential gears driven by the chariot's wheels allowed a wooden figurine (in the shape of a Chinese state minister) to constantly point to the south, hence its name. The Song Shu (c.AD 500) records that Zhang Heng re-invented it from a model used in the Zhou Dynasty era, but the violent collapse of the Han Dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved. Whether Zhang Heng invented it or not, Ma Jun (200–265) succeeded in creating the chariot in the following century.|$|E

500|$|The high {{melting point}} and {{oxidation}} resistance lead {{to the use of}} the metal in the production of vacuum furnace parts. Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts, such as thermowells, valve bodies, and tantalum fasteners. Due to its high density, shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum. Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and {{high melting point}}. [...] It is also occasionally used in precious watches e.g. from Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe, Hublot, Montblanc, Omega, and Panerai. Tantalum is also highly bioinert and is used as an orthopedic implant material. The high stiffness of tantalum makes it necessary to use it as highly porous foam or scaffold with lower stiffness for hip replacement implants to avoid stress shielding. Because tantalum is a non-ferrous, <b>non-magnetic</b> metal, these implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures. The oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses.|$|E

2500|$|Stainless {{steel is}} an iron alloy {{containing}} {{a minimum of}} 11.5% chromium. Blends containing 18% chromium with either 8% nickel, called 18/8, or with 10% nickel, called 18/10, are commonly used for kitchen cookware. Stainless steel's virtues are resistance to corrosion, non-reactivity with either alkaline or acidic foods, and resistance to scratching and denting. Stainless steel's drawbacks for cooking use {{is that it is}} a relatively poor heat conductor and its <b>non-magnetic</b> property, although recent developments have allowed the production of magnetic 18/10 alloys, and which thereby provides compatibility with induction cooktops, which require magnetic cookware. Since the material does not adequately spread the heat itself, stainless steel cookware is generally made as a cladding of stainless steel on both sides of an aluminum or copper core to conduct the heat across all sides, thereby reducing [...] "hot spots", or with a disk of copper or aluminum on just the base to conduct the heat across the base, with possible [...] "hot spots" [...] at the sides. In so-called [...] "tri-ply" [...] cookware, the central aluminum layer is obviously <b>non-magnetic,</b> and the interior 18/10 layer need not be magnetic, but the exterior 18/10 layer must be magnetic to be compatible with induction cooktops.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 Stuart Parkin {{discovered}} {{the phenomenon of}} oscillatory interlayer coupling in magnetic multilayers, by which magnetic layers are magnetically coupled via an intervening <b>non-magnetic</b> metallic spacer layer. [...] Parkin found that {{the sign of the}} exchange coupling oscillates from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic with an oscillation period of just a few atomic layers. Remarkably, Parkin discovered this phenomenon in thin film magnetic heterostructures that he prepared in a simple home-made sputtering system. Parkin, moreover, showed that this phenomenon is displayed by almost all metalllic transition elements. In what {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Parkin's Periodic Table", Parkin showed that the strength of this oscillatory interlayer exchange interaction varied systematically across the Periodic Table of the elements. [...] Parkin made numerous other fundamental discoveries which led to the development of the field of [...] "spintronics" [...] of which he is widely recognised as the foremost scientist. [...] Parkin invented the [...] "spin-valve" [...] sensor which is based on Parkin's fundamental discoveries including his discovery and unravelling of the origin of the so-called [...] "giant magnetoresistance effect". [...] Parkin showed, in contrast to the claims of Albert Fert, that this effect is derived from spin dependent scattering at the interfaces between magnetic and <b>non-magnetic</b> layers in magnetic heterostructures. [...] It is only because that the magnetoresistance is derived from interface scattering is it technologically important.|$|E
2500|$|In modern drives, {{the small}} size of the {{magnetic}} regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of thermal effects, thermally induced magnetic instability which is commonly known as the [...] "superparamagnetic limit". To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a 3-atom layer of the <b>non-magnetic</b> element ruthenium, and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other. Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is perpendicular recording, first shipped in 2005, and as of 2007 the technology was used in many HDDs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{induction meter}} operates by counting the revolutions of a <b>non-magnetic,</b> but electrically conductive, metal disc {{which is made}} to rotate at a speed proportional to the power passing through the meter. [...] The number of revolutions is thus proportional to the energy usage. The voltage coil consumes a small and relatively constant amount of power, typically around 2 watts which is not registered on the meter. [...] The current coil similarly consumes {{a small amount of}} power in proportion to the square of the current flowing through it, typically up to a couple of watts at full load, which is registered on the meter.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic {{coupling}} devices transmit torque through magnetically transparent barriers (that is, the barrier is <b>non-magnetic</b> or is magnetic {{but is not}} affected by an applied magnetic field), for instance between sealed containers or pressurised vessels. The optimal torque couplings consists {{of a pair of}} coaxially nested cylinders with opposite +k and [...] -k flux magnetization patterns, as this configuration is the only system for infinitely long cylinders that produce a torque. In the lowest energy state, the outer flux of the inner cylinder exactly matches the internal flux of the outer cylinder. Rotating one cylinder relative to the other from this state results in a restoring torque.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{ferromagnetism}} {{is responsible}} for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, all other materials are influenced to some extent by a magnetic field, by several other types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances such as aluminum and oxygen are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; [...] diamagnetic substances such as copper and carbon are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials such as chromium and spin glasses have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. [...] The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt, and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life these substances are often described as <b>non-magnetic.</b>|$|E
