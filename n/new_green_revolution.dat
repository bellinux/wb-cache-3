Africa, emblematic continent for the problematics of development and the recurrent problem of hunger in the world, seems to be the ground of this opposition. GMO promoters base themselves on the aforesaid problems to justify the development of vegetable biotechnologies ; their opponents denounce the claim regarding the ability of GMPs to regulate the problems of hunger and development in the developing countries. In this global competition, the establishment of networks and relays, under United States? instigation, to support national institutes of research and to plead and work for a ?<b>new</b> genetic <b>green</b> <b>revolution?,</b> in these countries, does really not seem to enable the mastery of these new biotechnologies by the developing countries.

5000|$|For many years, Stymne {{has been}} one of Sweden's most {{successful}} and dedicated debaters when it comes to Swedens and the European Union's attitude toward genetically modified crops and their role in future agriculture [...] As such, his position has been that genetic engineering is a natural part of the plant breeder's toolbox and that plant biotechnology represents a <b>new</b> <b>green</b> <b>revolution</b> and a prerequisite for adapting agriculture to future demands. [...] Despite his positive attitude towards technology application in plant breeding, Stymne warned early of the risks of letting a few large multinational companies have too much influence over specific crop traits introduced by genetic engineering and hence the future seed market. This, he meant, is worsened by Sweden and the rest of Europe's inability to handle the issue of genetically modified crops using a scientific and non-biased approach. Although Stymne has been critical of the centralization of influence over future agriculture to a few multinational companies, he has at the same time made clear that the debate about these must be fact-based and not subjected to the spread of false information.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEnsuring the salvage {{of future}} sources is a {{challenge}} for plant geneticists and breeders, as well as historians and archivists. Here, this suggestion is illustrated with {{an account of the}} emergence, in the mid- 20 th century, of seed banks. These repositories are intended to enable the conservation of the world's crop genetic diversity against the ‘genetic erosion’ of crops, an unintended consequence of the global uptake of <b>new</b> high-yielding <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> agricultural varieties. Plant breeders and scientists advocated a strategy of freezing and long-term storage of seed which enabled the salvage of genetic diversity for future users without requiring the continual cultivation of old varieties: seed banking could preserve valuable genetic material and enable agricultural modernisation to proceed. This account of crop genetic conservation therefore shows how breeders and geneticists sought to create their own seed archives from whence the evolutionary history of crops could be made accessible in ways that are useful for the future. This analysis suggests that conservation practices are informed by ideas about the future use of material, indicating that there is value in exploring concurrently the archival and historiographical issues relating to the biomolecular big biosciences...|$|R
40|$|From the {{literature}} review it is analyzed the tthe {{factors that affect}} agriculture development in Africa. The author argues {{that it is in}} the rural spaces where most of people live in Africa, and there is where poverty is much concentrated. Agriculture is the most important activity in rural spaces in Africa. That¿s why it has a great potential to lift a large number of individuals from poverty. Although that, this potential is affected by a number of factors such as the low agricultural productivity; the deterioration of trade terms and continue fall of price of traditional agricultural commodities in the international markets; and the lack of adequate investments for research and extension services, and in infrastructures (mainly for irrigation and roads). The <b>new</b> African <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> can induce growth and equity through agriculture productivity increase. However for its success, this strategy should be accompanied by policies that increase land access, ensuring land tenure to farmers, particularly the small-scale farmers, and prioritise adequate natural resource management. African governments should increase investments in infrastructures, public services, including extension services, Research & Development and human capital development. Pace, social justice and good governance are also important elements for African government to ensure that agriculture contributes effectively for poverty eradication and hunger elimination in Africa...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to analyze, by taking into {{consideration}} the small farmers' perspective, the possibilities and obstacles for an implementation of a <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> in southern Niassa, Northern Mozambique. We also highlighted the following question: In what sense are the findings in Asia, presented by Djurfeldt, relevant for the situation in southern Niassa? The analytical framework used {{is based on the}} scheme developed by Nitsch and Åkesson. This scheme has been used to understand the small farmer's relationship toward the technology linked to the <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution.</b> The <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> is a result of an initiative to resolve the food crisis by increasing crop yields and augmenting aggregate food supplies. By the 1970 s it become known as a 'package' consisting of improved seeds, farm technology, better irrigation, and chemical fertilizers. We have chosen to use Göran Djurfeldt's, a Swedish professor at the University of Lund, concept of the <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> in Asia. Through his findings, he concludes that the success of the <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> in this area is not only due to the technology but also that the strategy was a state-driven, small-farmer based, and market-mediated which arose due to particular domestic and geopolitical factors. By taking this in consideration we conclude that neither the state, market nor the geopolitical context are working in favor of a <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> in Mozambique, however the factors are vital if a <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> will succeed in Niassa. The small farmers have to deal with many obstacles if a <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> will be possible. To summarize the small farmer’s attitude toward the <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> we look at the individual circumstances, the direct surrounding and the society in general. We first concluded that the small farmer does not have much knowledge about the <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution.</b> This makes it hard for her or him to have an opinion neither about it nor about the techniques related to the <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution.</b> Secondly, the small farmer have several reason to why she or he do not want to implement the <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution,</b> due to risk taking, tradition, former bad experiences with new technique etc. Thirdly, there are also numerous obstacles that hinder the small farmer to implement the <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> technology.

40|$|Kenya is in {{many ways}} the ‘poster child’ for Africa's <b>new</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution,</b> with {{numerous}} public?private partnerships promoting agricultural innovation and rural entrepreneurship through a growing network of agro?dealers. Despite numerous claims that the agro?dealer model offers the best approach for delivering new seeds and other modern technologies to the country's small producers, this article highlights how reality on the ground has yet to match expectations. Drawing on surveys of agro?dealers in two contrasting agricultural districts and interviews with key informants, it shows how, despite considerable investment by a range of public and private actors, agro?dealers remain spread unevenly across the country and are inevitably concentrated in the higher potential agricultural areas. The changing structure of the Kenyan seed industry and the entry of large multinational and philanthropic players – who are focusing mainly on delivery of hybrid maize and fertilisers – are shifting this dynamic further. This approach is acting to narrow the choice of seeds and crop types to farmers in all areas...|$|E

Water requirements to produce adequate diets for humans are shown to be relatively generic irrespective of hydro-climate, amounting to a global average of 1, 300 m(3) cap(- 1) yr(- 1). Present food production requires an estimated 6, 800 km(3) yr(- 1) of consumptive green water (5, 000 km(3) yr(- 1) in rain-fed agriculture and 1, 800 km(3) yr(- 1) from irrigated crops).

40|$|What actors, expertise, {{and models}} of {{development}} are advanced by the ‘new Green Revolution in Africa’? This dissertation addresses this question through {{a blend of}} discourse analysis and ethnographic fieldwork {{during a period of}} agricultural transition in Northern Ghana. What struggles over authority, knowledge, identity, and property define this contemporary political economy of agricultural modernization in Ghana? I argue that legal, techno-scientific expertise and agribusiness work together to advance a model of agricultural development based on new forms of capital, governance structures, and technology. This model of agricultural development is mobilized and legitimated through discourses of emergency, salvation, entrepreneurship, and humanitarianism. In this <b>new</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Revolution</b> in Africa, regions like Northern Ghana are seen by development planners as ‘backwards,’ with growing ‘yield gaps’ that undermine food security. What is needed, from this perspective, is capital investment, entrepreneurship, and access to yield-enhancing technologies, such as ‘pro-poor biotechnology. ’ Deficiency frames, the combined use of hype and science, and donations become critical mechanisms to facilitate—or resist—the entry of contested agricultural technologies and models of agricultural development. At the center of these discursive strategies is the figure of the farmer, who is seen as an agent and object of salvation by proponents and opponents alike. I complement discourse analysis with ethnography to show that these grand plans to transform farming from a way of life to a business are constantly challenged by the existing complexity of Africans’ multiple, coexisting roles, risk reduction practices, and notions of entrepreneurship...|$|E
