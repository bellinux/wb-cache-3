Adams, as early as 1936, established that Poisson distribution {{could be applied to}} vehicle arrivals [29] and since then it has been extensively employed in many theories of traffic flow. Statistically, inter-arrival time i.e. headway between successive arrivals would follow <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distribution</b> in the event of Poisson arrivals. Therefore, <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distribution</b> is commonly used for headway modelling.

Regularization is done by augmenting the EM training method by a penalty term that favors simple and smooth HMM systems.

Griffiths and Hunt [15] opined that double displayed <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distribution</b> {{is appropriate to}} model the vehicular headways. Zhang et al.

The test result showed that the double displaced <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distribution</b> model provided the best fit to the urban freeway headway data and shifted lognormal distribution fits the general purpose lane headways very well.

Quite a few important models have been derived in accordance with this concept; they are Cowan M 1 –M 4 [17], the generalized queuing model [18], and the semi-poisson model.

40|$|A {{repairable}} {{system of}} two non-identical units- {{one is an}} original (called main unit) and other is a substandard (called duplicate unit) is investigated stochastically under different weather conditions – normal and abnormal. The system starts its operation with original unit keeping duplicate unit in cold standby. There is a direct failure of each unit from normal mode. Both units are capable in performing the system functions well. A single server is called immediately to do repair of the unit whenever needed. The operation and repair of the units are stopped in abnormal weather. And, in normal weather, priority is given for operation and repair to the original unit over duplicate unit.

40|$|Patients’ {{experiences}} {{of waiting for}} treatment have changed dramatically {{in recent years in}} the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. There has been a substantial reduction in the mean wait but the characteristics of the distributions have also changed significantly, implying a change in priorities and waiting list management. Simulations are often used to assess proposals for investment and reorganisation that might affect waiting time. However, a more realistic model incorporating waiting list management behaviour is needed since empirical distributions of waiting times indicate that a first-in-first-out model is not valid. This study develops a model of waiting list management that includes an explicit measure of priority associated with the patient’s wait compared to a specified target. The model can generate a range of behaviours, from the near <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distributions</b> associated with some historic examples of waiting list management, through to the well defined modes of a rigid first-in-first-out system.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} novel {{abstraction}} technique for fully probabilistic systems. The models {{of our study}} are classical discrete-time and continuous-time Markov chains (DTMCs and CTMCs, for short). A DTMC is a Kripke structure in which each transition {{is equipped with a}} discrete probability; in a CTMC, in addition, state residence times are governed by <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distributions.</b> Our abstraction technique fits within the realm of three-valued abstraction methods that have been used successfully for traditional model checking. The key ingredients of our technique are a partitioning of the state space combined with an abstraction of transition probabilities by intervals. It is shown that this provides a conservative abstraction for both negative and affirmative verification results for a three-valued semantics of PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic). In the continuous-time setting, the key idea is to apply abstraction on uniform CTMCs which are readily obtained from general CTMCs. In a similar way as for the discrete case, this is shown to yield a conservative abstraction for a three-valued semantics of CSL (Continuous Stochastic Logic). Abstract CTMCs can be verified by computing time-bounded reachability probabilities in continuous-time MDPs...|$|R

For each replication there were 6, 476 subjects in families from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), with their actual genotypes for Affymetrix 550 k single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and simulated phenotypes. Phenotypes are simulated at three visits, 10 years apart. There are up to 6 "major" genes influencing variation in high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, LDL), and triglycerides (TG), and 1, 000 "polygenes" simulated for each trait. Some polygenes have pleiotropic effects. The locus-specific heritabilities of the major genes range from 0. 1 to 1. 0 %, under additive, dominant, or overdominant modes of inheritance. The locus-specific effects of the polygenes ranged from 0. 002 to 0. 15 %, with effect sizes selected from <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distributions.</b> All polygenes act independently and have additive effects.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} an {{informal}} tutorial on stochastic process alge-bras, i. e., process calculi where action occurrences {{may be subject}} to a de-lay that is governed by a (mostly continuous) random variable. Whereas most stochastic process algebras consider delays determined by <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>distributions,</b> this tutorial is concerned with the integration of general, non-exponential distributions into a process algebraic setting. We discuss the issue of incorporating such distributions in an interleav-ing semantics, and present some existing solutions to this problem. In particular, we present a process algebra for the specification of stochas-tic discrete-event systems modeled as generalized semi-Markov chains (GSMCs). Using this language stochastic discrete-event systems can be described in an abstract and modular way. The operational semantics of this process algebra is given in terms of stochastic automata, a novel mixture of timed automata and GSMCs. We show that GSMCs are a proper subset of stochastic automata, discuss various notions of equiva-lence, present congruence results, treat equational reasoning, and argue how an expansion law in the process algebra can be obtained. As a case study, we specify the root contention phase within the standardized IEEE 1394 serial bus protocol and study the delay until root contention reso-lution. An overview of related work on general distributions in process algebra and a discussion of trends and future work complete this tutorial. ...|$|R
