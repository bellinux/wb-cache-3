5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, in Chicago's {{municipal}} elections, Vrdolyak, rather than seeking re-election as alderman, was the Solidarity Party's candidate challenging Washington for mayor. Washington won re-election, and Washington allies won twenty-five City Council seats. Burke led opposition in the City Council, but Washington supporter Alderman Timothy C. Evans replaced Burke as Chairman of the Committee on Finance. Ousted from the spacious Finance Committee staff offices, Burke <b>never</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> relatively modest office allocated to him in City Hall and instead worked out of his private law office two blocks away. In the days {{following the death of}} Mayor Washington in office, Burke supported the Council's selection of Alderman Eugene Sawyer over Evans to serve as mayor. Sawyer prevailed, but Burke was the alderman who least often voted in support of the legislative agenda of Mayor Sawyer, Chicago's second black mayor. After Richard M. Daley was elected mayor in {{the spring of}} 1989, Daley nominated Burke as Finance chairman, a position he has held ever since.|$|E
5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company <b>never</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, {{so when the}} environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
5|$|To get {{satisfactory}} {{conditions for}} the loan, the company was recommended by banks to increase the ownership equity to 10% of the loan. The share capital was insufficient, so the company started issuing preferred shares to individuals and the companies, and managed to secure NOK1.7 million. An exception to the rules was made, and the company was allowed to start detailed planning before the loans had been finalized. An estimate from 1966 showed that the bridge itself would cost NOK27 million, while the auxiliary roads would cost NOK4 million, excluding inflation and interest during construction. On 23 November 1966, the county council supported a proposal that {{one third of the}} construction costs be covered by national road funds. On 10 August 1967, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Norway gave permission that the company could borrow up to NOK25 million. The loan was a bond sold by Bergens Privatbank and Samvirke Forsikring, consisting of one series valued at NOK15 million issued in 1968, and one valued at NOK10 million issued in 1970, with an interest of 5.5% and 6.0%, respectively. There was a five years interest-only period, followed by ten years of repayment. The mortgage deed was secured in the right to collect tolls, supported by guarantees from the municipalities of Bergen, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, and the county municipality. In addition, the company was granted loans from Bergens Privatbank, Bergens Sparebank and Vestlandsbanken for NOK3 million, although these were <b>never</b> <b>used.</b> <b>The</b> state's part of the financing was through a loan from the Regional Development Fund.|$|E

Vetter was initially resistant to the suit, and although he later became more comfortable wearing it, he used it only seven times.
