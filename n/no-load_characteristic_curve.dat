40|$|Abstract Determination of the soil-water <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} things to solve geotechnical engineering problems. Expecially, convenient and reliable method to measure the soil-water <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> during drying and wetting cycles is required with lower labor input, more independence from operator experience, and shorter testing time than other available methods. Many measurement methods including the flow pump system have been developed to characterize the soil-water <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> for the several decades. This study measured the soil-water <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> during drying and wetting cycles using a suction control technique with the flow pump system.

In this paper, an establishing model method of the external <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> of engine based on F distribution testing is proposed. F test with variance analysis is implemented for obtaining the difference of square sum of return difference between the former equation and the latter equation. If the test doesn’t go through, it can rise one level automatically, until the difference about square sum of return difference of the before-after fitting equation is no significant can it stop. This method provides a theoretical criterion for establishing model of the external <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> of engine.

40|$|Forced {{convection}} boiling flow, {{often referred to}} as two-phase flow, is a common phenomenon which occurs in many industrial processes. The relationship between the total pressure drop in a channel containing two-phase flow and the mass flux of the flow is known as the pressure <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve.</b> If any part of pressure <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> contains a negative slope, flow instabilities might occur in the channel. Flow instabilities are unwanted because they can reduce the efficiency of the industrial process. In this study experimental work has been done to analyze the behavior of the pressure <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> in two-phase flow by applying a sensitivity analysis. The parameters which were analyzed in the sensitivity analysis were inlet pressure, subcooling temperature, total heating power and heating power distribution. Also, experimental results from this study were compared with the results from a numerical study of the <b>characteristic</b> pressure <b>curve</b> of two-phase flow [1]. The experimental study showed that all the analyzed parameters influence the behavior of the pressure <b>characteristics</b> <b>curve.</b> The comparison with the numerical study showed the same trends for behavior for the pressure <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> for all analyzed parameters except for the total heating power. From the analyzed parameters it was shown that the inlet pressure has the largest relative influence on the behavior of the pressure <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> compared to the other parameters. Lowering the inlet pressure leads to the largest change in the mass flux range where flow instabilities can occur.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between soil moisture and soil matric suction is called soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve,</b> which its measurement is time-consuming and expensive. One of the estimation methods of soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> {{is using the}} soil particle size distribution curve and bulk density which contains a scaling parameter (). In this study, 10 soil samples were selected from Marvdasht region in Fars province, and soil texture and soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> of each soil were measured. Then, the soil particle size distribution curve of each soil was estimated based on Fooladmand and Sepaskhah model (FS) and Fooladmand and Mansuri model (FM), and also eight methods were used for determining the scaling parameter including linear procedure with constant void ratio (N), logistic procedure with constant void ratio (G), linear procedure with local void ratio (LN), logistic procedure with local void ratio (LG), Alfa- 1 (A 1), Alfa- 2 (A 2), Alfa- 3 (A 3) and Alfa- 4 (A 4). Therefore, the soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> of each soil was estimated with 16 different methods, {{and all of them}} were compared with measured soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> data. For this purpose, Standard error (SE), geometric mean error ratio (GMER) and geometric standard deviation of the error ratio (GSDER) were used. The results sowed that the FM model for estimating the soil particle size distribution curve and then estimation the soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> was better than the FS model.

40|$|To obtain soil-moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> {{experimentally}} is {{time-consuming and}} usually subject to considerable errors. So, many investigators {{have tried to}} predict soil-moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> by different models. One of these models predicts soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> based on soil particle size distribution and bulk density. In this model, soil particle size distribution curve is divided {{into a number of}} segments, each with a specific particle radius and cumulative particle mass greater than that of the radius. Using these data, soil-moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> was estimated. In this model, a scale factor, α, is used which may be considered as a constant, or obtained by logistic or linear procedures. The average values of α for clay, silty clay, sandy loam, two loam soils, and two silty clay loam soils were 1. 159, 1. 229, 1. 494, 1. 391, 1. 393, 1. 253 and 1. 254, respectively. For most conditions, soil particle size distribution curve is not available, but only the percentages of clay, silt, and sand could be obtained using soil textural data, which is not enough to draw a precise soil particle size distribution curve. In this situation, a precise soil particle size distribution curve must be initially developed on the basis of which the soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> can be predicted. In this study, using soil textural data of seven different soils, soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> of each was estimated. In these estimations, logistic and linear methods were used to obtain the α value. Then, the results were compared with those of measured soil moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve.</b> For estimation of soil particle size distribution curve, two extreme values for soil particle radius, 125 and 999 m, were used. The results indicated that using particle radius of 999 µm is more appropriate. On the other hand, it was found that for clay, silty clay, and sitly clay loam texture, it is more appropriate to employ a linear equation to determine for estimating soil-moisture <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve</b> while the logistic equation can be more appropriately used for loam and sand loam textures...|$|R
