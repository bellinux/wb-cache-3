40|$|Prior {{empirical}} research, mainly {{conducted in}} US under the US GAAP, {{has indicated that}} managers in listed banks use loan loss provisions as a primary tool for income smoothing activities. Since 2005 the accounting environment in the European Union (EU) changed, as all listed companies are required to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Some arguments envisage that IFRS {{is a set of}} high quality standards that plug some inconsistencies relative to national General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The overall objective of the present study is to examine earnings management and in particular income smoothing through the use of loan loss provisions (LLP) to manage earnings under IFRS and <b>national</b> <b>GAAPs.</b> The sample consists of twenty large commercial banks listed in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) for the years 2004 - 2012 (including early adopters) and sixteen banks for the years 1996 - 2003 under each country’s national reporting regime. Furthermore we present the body of earning management literature in conjunction with agency theory in order to grasp managers’ opportunistic behavior. Finally we assess the institutional role of financial reporting standards and the arguments of how IFRS could restrict earnings management activities as proposed by some authors. Overall, our results indicate some degree of income smoothing activities through loan loss provisions by bank managers both under <b>national</b> <b>GAAPs</b> and IFRS. The study contributes to the broad literature body on earnings management, while testing income-smoothing activities on a single industry compared to previous studies where the samples comprises a variety of firms in different industries...|$|R
40|$|A b s t r a c t The {{management}} control departments of large multinationals need to coordinate {{a substantial number}} of foreign subsidiaries. On the one hand, therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop globally standardised {{management control}} practices. On the other hand, local customisation is necessary in order to take into account country and subsidiary differences. The literature rarely considers the organisational issues of management accounting and control in this context. This exploratory study intends to close this gap by analysing the current degree of management control standardisation in German multinational enterprises. Using contingency theory as a framework, eight expert interviews were conducted with management controllers. The results are diverse. Firstly, increased efforts towards more standardisation have clearly been made in recent years. In this context, controllers highlighted that the advantages of standardisation strongly exceed the disadvantages. Secondly, it can be shown that various contextual factors influence the degree of management control standardisation in different ways and with different intensities.

The {{purpose of the}} article is {{to answer the question}} if a separate standard (IFRS) is needed for business combinations under common control (BCUCC), which are not governed by any IFRS as the moment. In such cases, the approach resulting from IAS 8 should apply to them, which allows the use of national regulations to account for BCUCC. The authoress shortly described the theoretical issues related to the subject and presented the results of empirical research that verified the practical aspects of the problem. The research methodology involves a literature and legal act analysis, content analysis of financial statements, as well as deductive and inductive reasoning. On the basis of the gathered data the authoress concluded that even the existence of necessary regulations in <b>national</b> <b>GAAPs</b> does not guarantee that all the requirements related to the qualitative characteristics of the reported information are met and, as such, the main objectives for which IFRS were developed may not be met. As such, the authoritative guidance proves necessary.

40|$|Purpose – One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} changes to affect financial reporting {{in recent years has been}} the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This paper aims to examine the nature of the Income Statement and Net Equity IFRS adjustments for a sample of companies from the UK, Ireland and Italy following the introduction of IFRS. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of IFRS Reconciliation Statements are examined to identify the most significant IFRS adjustments. Using an index of conservatism, these amounts are further analysed to assess their impact on the accounting numbers reported under previous <b>national</b> <b>GAAP.</b> Findings – For all three countries, the IFRS profit was greater than that reported under previous <b>national</b> <b>GAAP.</b> IFRS also had a significant effect on net worth; while UK and Italian companies experienced an increase in equity upon the adoption of IFRS, the Irish firms in the sample recorded a decrease. The analysis also indicated that the impact of IFRS on profit and net worth was primarily attributable to a few core standards including IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 5, IAS 10, IAS 12, IAS 16, IAS 17, IAS 19, IAS 38 and IAS 39. Practical implications – A multi-country perspective for future IFRS research is required as the impact of individual IFRS varies in importance from one country to another. Originality/value – By analysing the IFRS that have had a significant impact on accounting numbers prepared under previous <b>national</b> <b>GAAP,</b> opportunities for future research are identified.

I further found that real earnings management has strictly increased, and that, despite the fact that both manifestations of earnings management strictly increased, due to the introduction of IFRS, they are increasingly used as substitutes of one another. This indicates that management looks for alternatives to manipulate earnings when accruals-based earnings management becomes more difficult, instead of lowering their earnings management activities.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{accounting}} harmonization in Europe has started in 1978 with {{the adoption of}} the Fourth Council Directive 78 / 660 /EEC regarding the annual accounts of limited liability companies. The harmonization process continued with the regulation of the consolidated annual accounts with the enactment of the Seventh Council Directive 83 / 349 /EEC. In 2002 the European Parliament has adopted the EC Regulation No. 1606 / 2002 requiring all listed group entities within EU to apply the International Accounting Standards for their consolidated financial statements starting from 2005. This has led to the use of a dual accounting standardization as listed entities are required to use IAS/IFRS while non-listed entities use the <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> harmonized with the 4 th and 7 th directives. The adoption of the new accounting directive 2013 / 34 /EU does not solve this differentiation as it doesn't allow the option for national accounting regulators the use of IFRS for SMEs. Romania, {{as a member of the}} European Union, is no exception from this usage of a dual accounting standard. After the fall of the communist regime, Romania has modernized its accounting system by adopting a French inspired, EU 4 th directive compliant <b>national</b> <b>GAAP.</b> Between 2001 and 2005 there was a strong interest towards the adoption of IAS/IFRS that went beyond the scope of EC Regulation No. 1606 / 2002. This has changed in 2005 when IAS/IFRSs were considered as an option of additional voluntary disclosure. From 2006, Romania has aligned its national legislation to the requirements of EC Regulation No. 1606 / 2002. The application of this dual standard accounting system has been cumbersome especially for the entities that were required to prepare two different annual accounts, one using IAS/IFRS and one using Romanian GAAP. This obstacle has been overcome in 2012 when certain entities were allowed to prepare their financial statements using only IFRS...|$|E

40|$|Accounting and {{financial}} reporting are valuable {{sources of information}} about the financial position and performance of a company. The development of the international capital market have brought needs for international, globally valid and acknowledged accounting norms. Currently, the IFRS are used in agreement with the European Commission directive for the elaboration of financial statements of companies which are issued by securities; the other entities continue using national generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). As the number of companies which apply the GAAP is predominant, the basis of the education of future accounting professionals is formed.

40|$|LONG ABSTRACT § INTRODUCTION § One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} changes to affect the financial reporting of EU-quoted firms in recent times has been introduction of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) since 2005. Therefore, in the European Union (EU), the basis underpinning the preparation of the annual report as well as the components, formats and presentations of the financial reporting have been changed. Many concerns have been raised about IFRS, some real and some serious. An independent assessment was, therefore, required to examine IFRS implementation in different EU countries and to assist future adopters of the IFRS. PURPOSE § This study examines the implementation of IFRS in three countries: the UK, Italy and Ireland. The study focused on these three countries because it was expected that companies in countries with a similar national accounting environment, such as the UK and Ireland, would experience similar reporting changes following the adoption of IFRS, and that companies in countries with a very different reporting environment, legal system and culture, such as Italy, would be affected differently by the adoption of IFRS. For example, the UK and Ireland are common law countries with accounting standards that focus primarily on the needs of shareholders, while Italy has a legal system based on civil law where traditionally creditors are viewed as being the most important users of financial statements. Thus, it was expected that the implementation of IFRS, with its shareholder focus, would require more of a cultural change in Italy than in the UK or Ireland. The following research objectives are addressed in this study: • To quantify {{the nature and extent of}} the changes in financial reporting that have been experienced as a result of IFRS adoption. In particular, the study examines the increase in disclosure relating to these new accounting standards as well as the changes to net profit and equity when comparing national Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to IFRS GAAP. • To assess the costs associated with the production and publication of the new information. • To identify the standards which have caused the greatest challenges for preparers and users to implement, reflecting education and training needs, changes to valuation models and the need for a general understanding of the accounting requirements and concepts. • To examine the usefulness of IFRS information from the perspective of preparers and users of financial statements, both from the usefulness of the contents being mandated as well as the formats in which the additional information must be disclosed. • To review whether the information required under IFRS is decision-useful for stakeholders. DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY § The above research objectives are considered within the framework of decision-usefulness to assess whether IFRS is more useful to users than <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> for making investment decisions, after consideration of the costs involved for both preparers and users. Three different methods of analysis were used to examine the introduction of IFRS to address the above research aims: • a content analysis of financial statements (in total 175 pre-IFRS annual reports and 175 -post IFRS annual reports were analysed); • an analysis of the reconciliation statement between IFRS and <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> using a ‘conservatism’ index (in total 125 reconciliation statements were analysed); and • a multiple-stakeholder perspective on the adoption of IFRS using interviews with preparers, auditors, analysts and regulators (in total 32 subjects were interviewed). Each of these three methods provides an international comparison on the adoption of IFRS between the UK, Italy and Ireland. FINDINGS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS § The findings from the content analysis comparison of company annual reports pre-IFRS and post-IFRS suggest that companies in Italy were more affected by the adoption of IFRS; the size of Italian annual reports grew far more significantly than those published in the UK or Ireland, although even in the latter two countries the annual reports increased substantially post-IFRS. With reference to the impact of IFRS on profit and equity the following results were found: the implementation of IFRS increased the reported profit of companies in the UK, Italy and Ireland such that <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> profit was only 66...|$|E

This process is not primarily an exercise or attempt of reshuffling the chart of account, nor only technical accounting and financial reporting matter is it. Changing accounting principles means changing the language of the business. A new global financial reporting model, as a new harmonizes and standardizes reporting language has to be the result of that process. Such a change has a pervasive impact. In fact, each hotel, each insurance or any other company, is likely to spend a significant amount of time addressing concerns around tax, valuation, treasury, legal, people, technology, and communications, following this process. Our objective in this paper is to discuss this actual process in the international financial reporting. Also, we will investigate the impact of this process on word hotel industry.

40|$|CURRENT VERSION August 8, 2008 Firms {{listed on}} stock exchanges within the European Economic Area are {{required}} to report consolidated financial statements according to IFRS from 2005. The firms that adopted IFRS in 2005 were also required to restate their 2004 financial statements from <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> to provide comparable accounting figures. These two sets of financial statements for 2004 are thus based on identical underlying economic activities and are fully specified according to two different reporting regimes. Our sample consists of 145 restatements from NGAAP to IFRS for firms listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway. We test whether the IFRS accounting figures correlate more strongly with stock market values than the corresponding NGAAP figures. We find little evidence of increased value-relevance after adopting IFRS when comparing and evaluating the two regimes unconditionally. On the other hand, when evaluating {{the change in the}} accounting figures from NGAAP to IFRS, we find evidence that the reconcilement adjustments to IFRS are marginally value-relevant due to increased relevance of the balance sheet and the normalized net operating income. By weighting our sample by firm size, intangible asset intensity and profitability, we learn that the increased value-relevance of the net operating income stems from different reporting of intangible assets. Since more intangible assets are capitalized according to IFRS than NGAAP, our finding is consistent with the view that capitalizing intangible assets is more value-relevant than expensing them as incurred or through goodwill amortization...|$|E

This examination is facilitated in three ways: (i) a content analysis is undertaken to investigate the magnitude and nature of the changes in IFRS-related disclosure presented in annual report and accounts produced prior to and following the introduction of IFRS; (ii) an analysis of the Reconciliation Statements produced upon first-time adoption of IFRS included in corporate annual reports to examine the impact on both profit and equity {{as a result of the}} transition from previous <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> to reporting in accordance with IFRS; and, (iii) an assessment of the new IFRS disclosures against the qualitative characteristics outlined in the IASB Decision-Usefulnessfr amework. In other words, it is an investigation of whether the claims of the IASI 3 about the usefulness of the mandated IFRS disclosures for decision-makers are supported in practice with the contents of corporate annual reports and accounts in the UK. The results of the content analysis indicate that the implementation of IFRS had a significant impact on the content of the annual report and accounts of UK companies. The amount of disclosure in company annual reports increased significantly following the introduction of the new reporting regime. Furthermore, there was a large increase in the physical size of the annual reports for the vast majority of the firms surveyed. The scale of the impact varied from standard to standard, however, the nature and magnitude of the information presented in UK-published annual reports has been fundamentally impacted by the introduction of IFRS. The Reconciliation Statement analysis results reveal that profit disclosed under UK GAAP increased by 105. 85 per cent following the implementation of IFRS. In addition, the results show that the introduction of IFRS had a significant impact on reported equity; however, there was an almost even split between those which experienced a favourable impact following the transition and those disclosing a negative effect on the balance sheet post-IFRS adoption. The main IFRS standards which impacted reported results under previous <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> were IAS 10, IAS 12, IAS 19, IAS 40 and the IFRS 3 / 1 AS 36 /IAS 38 group of standards. The assessmenot f the decision-usefulness of the new IFRS information reveals that the widespread variation in impact on reported results, the complexity of the supplementary narrative disclosures, absence of company-specific and forward-looking information, uncertainty about the long-term impact of the changeover and the lack of comparability between the Reconciliation Statements will likely have constrained the usefulness of the new disclosures for users and therefore their investment decisions. Thus, one of the aims of the standard setters does not seem to have been achieved as users of UK corporate annual reports were not supplied with more useful information about these companies compared to what was previously disclosed under UK GAAP.

40|$|Although the EU {{has made}} {{progress}} towards harmonization of accounting law, this cannot {{hide the fact}} that the harmonization of the financial accounting information across Europe, through the accounting directives did not reach the intended level of comparability and transparency. Through the adoption of IFRS a higher level of harmonization has been pursued. Up to the present, the implementation of IFRS in many European countries is only required for the consolidated statement of listed companies. To this day, numerous studies have focused on harmonization and convergence of financial accounting information in Europe, addressing impediments to convergence and providing the level of adoption of IFRS in the consolidated statements of listed European companies. However, less {{attention has been paid to}} the impact of implementing IFRS in the consolidated accounts of listed companies on the statutory accounting of listed and non-listed companies. In this paper, the pros and cons of complete harmonization, i. e. the implementation of IFRS for the statutory accounts is discussed. In the last part, an illustrative case study compares the position taken by the IASB and the related treatments in Belgian GAAP and the fourth directive. Whether <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> is to converge towards IFRS, or IFRS will become mandatory for statutory accounts, it is important to highlight the particular differences between both sets of standards. Although we worked on a spot basis, as we only have treated the differences concerning tangible and intangible assets, this gives a good example of the particular harmonization difficulties most European countries will have to cope with. harmonization, IFRS, SME, tangibles, intangibles, fiscal neutrality...|$|E
40|$|Firms {{listed on}} stock exchanges within the European Economic Area are {{required}} to report consolidated financial statements according to IFRS from 2005. The firms that adopted IFRS in 2005 were also required to restate their 2004 financial statements from <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> to provide comparable accounting figures. These two sets of financial statements for 2004 are thus based on identical underlying economic activities and are fully specified according to two different reporting regimes. Our sample consists of 145 restatements from NGAAP to IFRS for firms listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway. We test whether the IFRS accounting figures correlate more strongly with stock market values than the corresponding NGAAP figures. We find little evidence of increased value-relevance after adopting IFRS when comparing and evaluating the two regimes unconditionally. On the other hand, when evaluating {{the change in the}} accounting figures from NGAAP to IFRS, we find evidence that the reconcilement adjustments to IFRS are marginally value-relevant due to increased relevance of the balance sheet and the normalized net operating income. By weighting our sample by firm size, intangible asset intensity and profitability, we learn that the increased value-relevance of the net operating income stems from different reporting of intangible assets. Since more intangible assets are capitalized according to IFRS than NGAAP, our finding is consistent with the view that capitalizing intangible assets is more value-relevant than expensing them as incurred or through goodwill amortization.

40|$|Purpose - Since the 1960 s {{earnings}} {{management has}} been a widely researched area and became presumably known by the current accounting scandals. This paper aims at empirically showing which factors affect earnings management. Design/methodology/approach - According to former research literature factors are derived, which might influence the companies' earnings management behavior. These factors are the applied accounting standard, the industry sector and the country of official quotation. Although several measurements for earnings management like abnormal accruals or income smoothing exist, this paper is predominantly using the distribution of net income scaled by total assets (RoA) respectively total sales (RoS) as earnings management measure. These earnings management measures have been selected as they can measure the frequency of earnings management in reality and no estimates are necessary. Findings - In general, analyses show that the distribution in earnings management intervals differ from the total population. Most noteworthy is that by adoption of principle-based accounting standards (IFRS/US-GAAP), in case of this study no differences of earnings quality was observable. The other two variables yield in mixed results due to the robustness checks, which indeed questions the scaling variables for data-sets including the financial industries. Research limitations/implications - First, according to the chosen measurement parameter no distinct assertion concerning the reasons for execution or non-execution of earnings management can be deduced. Second, the method of earnings management's identification is not dividable and therefore real-, accounting-, legal- and illegal-earnings management cannot be identified. Third, the research results are just partially generalizable concerning representativity (e. g. other countries, non-market listed companies) and taken for granted just for similar data-sets Originality/value - Although prior studies presume a rise in earnings quality, which indicates a decrease in earnings management by the adoption of principle-based accounting standards (IFRS/US-GAAP) in comparison to <b>national</b> <b>GAAP,</b> {{there is no difference}} or superior accounting standard identifiable through the results...|$|E
40|$|The year 2005 {{marked the}} start of a new era in global conduct of business, and thefulfillment of a thirty-year effort to create the {{financial}} reporting rules for a worldwidecapital market. For during that year’s financial reporting cycle, as many as 7, 000 listedcompanies in the 25 European Union member states, plus many others in countries such asAustralia, New Zealand, Russia, and South Africa were expected (in the EU, required) toproduce annual financial statements in compliance with a single set of international rules—International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Many other business entities, whilenot publicly held and not currently required to comply with IFRS, will also do so, eitherimmediately or over time, in order to conform to what is clearly becoming the newworldwide standard. Since there are about 15, 000 SEC-registered companies in the USAthat prepare financial statements in accordance with US GAAP (plus countless nonpubliclyheld companies also reporting under GAAP), the vast majority of the world’s largebusinesses will now be reporting under one or the other of these two comprehensivesystems of accounting and financial reporting rules. Most other <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> standards have been reduced in importance or are being phasedout as nations all over the worlds are now embracing IFRS. For example, Canada hasannounced that Canadian GAAP (which was very similar to US GAAP) will be eliminatedand replaced by IFRS by 2011. More immediately, China will require listed companies toemploy IFRS. It is quite predictable that only US GAAP will (for the foreseeable future) remain as a competitive force in the accounting standards arena, and even that situation willbe more a formality than a substantive reality, given the formal commitment (andsubstantial progress made to date) to “converge” US GAAP and IFRS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Meek and Thomas (2004) {{call for}} {{research}} on the continued relevance of ‘rediscovered’ dichotomous accounting classifications. We provide such evidence by examining how developments surrounding the ‘IAS Regulation’ (1606 / 2002) influenced international differences in accounting systems in the European Union. Since a sufficient time series of actual post- 2005 International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) reporting practice is not yet observable, we propose an initial re-classification of accounting systems based on evidence available to date, that is, the degree of implementation of the IAS Regulation in the Member States. Consistent with Nobes (1998), {{we find that the}} degree of public accountability to outside investors (the ‘public/private’ criterion) is becoming the primary differentiator for accounting systems in Europe, surpassing country-level variables such as legal system and culture. The distinction between consolidated and individual financial statements is the second emerging differentiator. While consolidated accounting is becoming more uniform across countries, cross-country cultural differences are most likely to persist in individual accounting. Based on our analysis we highlight two important areas of future research beyond the consolidated financial statements of listed firms (e. g. Nobes, 2005; Schipper, 2005). First, at the country level, the interaction of IFRS and individual financial statements will need to be reassessed. In addition, research could help introduce a degree of differentiation into financial reporting regulation for unlisted firms, because these firms are not a homogeneous group. Also, the convergence of <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> systems with IFRS will benefit from fresh research insights. Second, at the firm level, future research could analyze {{the extent to which the}} determinants and consequences of IFRS adoption, an area well researched for publicly traded firms (e. g. Cuijpers and Buijink, 2005), generalize to unlisted firms. Such research will help detect emerging patterns of accounting systems within an international context. It will generate insights into the disconnect of consolidated accounts from national influences, the degree of uniformity of consolidated accounts among international firms, the continued relevance of traditional classifications of international accounting systems for individual accounts and accounts of unlisted companies, and the convergence of national standards with IFRS. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates whether IFRS {{adoption}} {{has led to}} {{an increase}} in the relevance of accounting information for investment decisions. Furthermore, the effects of IFRS are implicitly compared across accounting traditions. As such,  the effects of IFRS on the “quality” of financial reporting are measured based on the cases of listed firms in Germany and listed firms in the UK. This study approaches the effects of IFRS on the quality of financial reporting from two angles. First a review of the academic literature is done to determine whether there has been a general consensus about the effects of IFRS adoption on financial reporting of listed firms in Germany and the UK. As a result of this literature study, a number of propositions are deduced about the effects of IFRS. Subsequently, the investigation of the effects of IFRS takes a statistical perspective. Financial and accounting data are obtained for two samples, one of German listed firms and another of UK listed firms. A number of empirical models are used to determine the quality of financial reporting, including the earnings-returns association (Lev, 1989; Lev & Zarowin, 1999), asymmetric sensitivity of earnings and asymmetric persistence of earnings (Basu, 1997), and the market-to-book ratios (Roychowdhury & Watts, 2003). Additionally, a new tool is introduced for a joint interpretation of the econometric test results, leading potentially to a new method of financial report analysis under dynamic regulatory conditions. Significant statistical evidence is found suggesting a drastic reduction (to the point of complete elimination) in income smoothing in Germany corresponding to the transition from the German <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> to IFRS. Additionally, with the introduction of IFRS, the information content of accounting earnings in German firms appears to have increased substantially, while market-to-book ratios have converged towards “ 1 ”. On the other hand, the introduction of IFRS in the UK corresponds to statistical evidence consistent with a shift from asymmetric timeliness of earnings under UK GAAP to a significant downward bias in earnings under IFRS. The study also shows significant inter-industry differences in the effects of IFRS that suggest that the inconsistencies in the results of previous studies may have been due to the significant noise created by diverse samples, or due to biased industry representations in the data...|$|E
40|$|Within the EU the {{relation}} between financial and tax accounting will be significantly influenced by the regulation adopted in June 2002 that obliges all listed companies to prepare their consolidated accounts according to International Accounting Standards / International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS). Since dependency of financial and tax accounting according to different degrees prevails in all EU member states a linkage between IAS/IFRS and tax accounting seems to be possible. Compared to <b>national</b> <b>GAAP</b> the advantage of IAS/IFRS {{as a starting point}} for tax accounting derives from the advantages of the creation of a common tax base in the EU. However, the adoption of IAS/IFRS has to be restricted to those standards that are convenient for tax purposes. In particular, this means that tax accounting still has to follow the realisation principle as a general principle; the IAS/IFRS "fair value-accounting" therefore cannot be adopted for tax purposes. In this paper we present estimates for the consequences of IAS/IFRS-based tax accounting on the comparative effective tax burdens of companies in 13 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the USA). Therefore, certain provisions of IAS/IFRS were considered {{as a starting point for}} the tax base. The effective tax burdens are calculated on the basis of the European Tax Analyzer model which was enhanced for the purposes of this study. A further question arises as to what extent an exclusive harmonisation of the tax base will effectively reduce the current EU-wide differences of effective company tax burdens. It turns out that a common tax base cannot alleviate the current EU-wide differences of effective company tax burdens. A major finding of our study reveals that the effective tax burdens in all countries considered here (except Ireland) tend to increase slightly since the tax bases tend to become broader. This offers the possibility to member states to reduce the nominal tax rate leaving the overall effective tax burden unchanged. A tax policy of tax cut cum base broadening would not only tend to increase the attractiveness of the member states as a location for companies. At the same time, this would reduce dispersions of effective tax burdens across industries. Therefore, such a tax policy is in line of the long term Community goals to become more competitive in international terms...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in the past decade converging national Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), including United States (U. S.) GAAP, with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Furthermore, many countries have adopted, or partially adopted, IFRSs as their <b>national</b> <b>GAAP.</b> The globalisation of accounting standards motivates this study to examine the usefulness of U. S. GAAP reconciliation information over time. With the expectation that converged accounting standards decrease the usefulness of reconciliation information over time, this study examines the market reactions around the release of reconciliation information during 2002 – 2007. Decreasing usefulness of reconciliation information is expected because of accounting standards becoming increasingly similar to U. S. GAAP. This study shows that market reactions (abnormal returns and abnormal trading volume) to the release of reconciliation information are greater in the earlier period (2002 – 2004) than in the later period (2005 – 2007). This study also investigates how the usefulness of reconciliation information is affected by country-level attributes, namely, investor protection, earnings quality, and earnings and the book value of equity differences between U. S. and domestic GAAP. With the exception of earnings differences, results indicate support for the country-level attributes being associated with market reactions to the release of U. S. GAAP reconciliation information, when measured by abnormal trading volume. When market reactions are assessed using abnormal returns, no associations are found. The results of sensitivity analysis generally support the main results. Therefore, this study finds that the convergence of accounting standards leads to the decreasing usefulness of reconciliation information, indicating that the similarity of accounting standards is priced by the market over time. This study also finds some support for country-level factors impacting the usefulness of reconciliation information, as indicated by a positive association between abnormal trading volume and foreign registrants’ home country investor protection, earnings quality, and book value of equity differences. These results support the claims of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the usefulness of reconciliation information has decreased. This was a factor considered by the SEC when removing the requirement for reconciliation statements for foreign registrants preparing financial reports using IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The results also inform the SEC’s deliberations on continuing the reconciliation requirement for companies preparing financial reports using GAAP other than IFRSs as issued by the IASB...|$|E
