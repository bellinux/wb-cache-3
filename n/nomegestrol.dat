25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to their progestogenic activity, some progestins are antagonists of the androgen receptor {{and can be used}} therapeutically as antiandrogens. These progestins, with varying degrees of potency as antiandrogens, include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, megestrol acetate, <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly to progesterone, 19-norprogesterone is {{a potent}} {{progestogen}} and possesses high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). However, unlike progesterone, which is an antagonist of the MR, 19-norprogesterone acts as a partial agonist of the MR and produces mineralocorticoid effects such as sodium retention, polydipsia, and hypertension in animals. Like progesterone, 19-norprogesterone is very active as a progestogen parenterally but is only minimally active orally. A [...] study found that 19-norprogesterone had 47% of the affinity of aldosterone for the rat MR and that 17α-hydroxylation (17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone, or gestronol) decreased it to 13%. The addition of 6-methylation with formation of a double bond at this position (<b>nomegestrol)</b> further decreased the MR affinity to 1.2% of that of aldosterone, and subsequent acetylation of the 17α-hydroxy group (<b>nomegestrol</b> acetate) nearly abolished it (0.23%).|$|E
50|$|NOMAC is a norpregnane steroid and a {{derivative}} of progesterone {{belonging to the}} 19-norprogesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone groups.

50|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) entered {{clinical}} use and became widely marketed, largely superseding the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone esters. A variety of analogues of medroxyprogesterone acetate, such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, were subsequently developed and introduced as well. Progestogen esters {{of other groups}} of progestins have also been introduced, including the 19-norprogesterone derivatives gestonorone caproate, segesterone acetate (nestorone), <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate, and norgestomet (11β-methyl-17α-acetoxy-19-norprogesterone), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives etynodiol diacetate, norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, and quingestanol acetate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nomegestrol</b> acetate, {{abbreviated}} as NOMAC, is a progestin, or {{a synthetic}} progestogen, which {{was first introduced}} in the mid-1980s and {{is used in the}} treatment of gynecological disorders, in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms, and in hormonal contraceptives. It is marketed alone under the brand name Lutenyl and in combination with estradiol under the brand names Naemis and Zoely. NOMAC is widely available in Europe and in many countries throughout the world, though it is notably not available in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Although {{almost all}} {{combined}} oral contraceptives contain the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol, natural estradiol itself {{is also used}} in some hormonal contraceptives, including in estradiol-containing oral contraceptives and combined injectable contraceptives. It is formulated in combination with a progestin such as dienogest, <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate, or medroxyprogesterone acetate, and is often used {{in the form of}} an ester prodrug like estradiol valerate or estradiol cypionate. Hormonal contraceptives contain a progestin and/or estrogen and prevent ovulation and thus the possibility of pregnancy by suppressing the secretion of the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the peak of which around the middle of the menstrual cycle causes ovulation to occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nomegestrol</b> was {{patented}} in 1975, and NOMAC, {{under the}} developmental code name TX-066, was first {{described in the}} literature in 1983.

The drug was first introduced in Europe alone or in combination with estradiol under the respective brand names Lutenyl and Naemis {{for the treatment of}} gynecological disorders and menopausal symptoms in 1986, and was subsequently developed and approved in 2011 in Europe as an oral contraceptive in combination with estradiol under the brand name Zoely.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{clinical}} trials indicate that synthetic progestins may be unexpectedly relevant {{for the development}} of cardiovascular disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish whether <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate induces signaling events in human endothelial cells that differ from those of other progestins, such as natural progesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate. METHODS: We used human endothelial cells to study the action of <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate (either alone or in the presence of estradiol [E 2]) on the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and on the activity or expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). We compared the effects of <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate with those of progesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate. In addition, we characterized the signaling events recruited by these compounds. RESULTS: Progesterone and <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate increase NO synthesis by transcriptional and nontranscriptional mechanisms, whereas medroxyprogesterone acetate lacks such effects. When used together with physiological E 2 concentrations, progesterone and <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate do not interfere with (or even enhance) E 2 effects, whereas medroxyprogesterone acetate impairs E 2 signaling. A marked difference in the recruitment of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase explains the divergent effects of the three gestagens. CONCLUSION: Our findings show significant differences in the signal transduction pathways recruited by progesterone, <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate in human endothelial cells that may have relevant clinical implications...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Here {{we report}} {{the results of}} a study in which natural estrogens were given transdermally {{cyclically}} and continuously for 1 year, and a progestin of the latest generation, namely <b>nomegestrol</b> acetate, was given for 10 days every month and for 15 days every 2 months. METHODS: The patients were a group of 34 post-menopausal women (51 - 56 years), 18 of whom (group A) were treated with continuous transdermal estradiol (50 micrograms/day) and cyclic oral <b>nomegestrol</b> at a dose of 5 mg/day for 15 days every 2 months for 1 year. The other 16 women (group B) were treated with cyclic transdermal estradiol for 3 weeks with oral <b>nomegestrol</b> for 10 days (12 - 21) /month. Endometrial thickness was evaluated by transvaginal ultrasonography before and after treatment. At the end of treatment, an endometrial biopsy was performed. Serum total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides were assessed at baseline and every 4 months. The characteristics of the cycle were deduced from the diary cards recorded by the women. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the mean interval between the last dose of <b>nomegestrol</b> and the start of bleeding or in the duration of bleeding. The total number of days of bleeding per year was significantly lower in group A than group B (27 +/- 12 vs. 52 +/- 18; P < 0. 01). Total serum cholesterol and LDL significantly decreased after 1 year of treatment in both groups, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were found increased at most of the time points studied. CONCLUSIONS: The present protocol involving continuous transdermal administration of estrogen combined with oral progestin every 2 months gave good control of the menstrual cycle, did not increase the risk of endometrial pathology and met with good patient compliance...|$|E
