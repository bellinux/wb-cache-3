500|$|An afropop song lasting {{for three}} minutes and fifty-two seconds, [...] "Emergency" [...] was written by Douglas Jack, Patrick Okorie, and Raoul John Njeng-Njeng, while WizzyPro {{provided}} the original production. All three artists wrote their own individual verses, as performed over varying chord progressions. During Patoranking's verse, he refers to the track's lead artist and exclaims: [...] "I see emergency, <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> / WizzyPro beats causing madness". Badmus Bello Shuaibu, a writer for Naija Celebrity, inferred {{that the use of}} the word 'emergency' in Davido's 2014 single [...] "Aye" [...] was inspired by the repetitiveness in [...] "Emergency".|$|E
500|$|The {{concerts in}} England and Ireland {{received}} mixed feedback from critics. Kitty Empire (The Observer) was not {{impressed with the}} show at Windsor Hall. Empire wrote, [...] "It's easy to sneer at boy bands, but always worth considering their appeal. It {{goes without saying that}} One Direction are slick, and often bland. With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive". For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (Daily Mirror) gave the band a positive review. He states, [...] "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams. Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold-out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame-named <b>Na,</b> <b>Na,</b> <b>Na.</b> It was impossible to tell which one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire". Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan (Evening Herald) for the concert at Dublin's The O2. She says, [...] "THEY came, they saw, they conquered. Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2. Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold-out venue last night as Zayn, Harry, Louis, Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14,000 fans".|$|E

2500|$|... "Yellow Pansy Street" [...] is a {{standard}} rock song with a slight 60s influence and heavy usage of horns. The song opens up with wind chimes, a huge brass section, and a rockabilly guitar. It then cuts out {{for the start of}} the first verse which is only carried by the kick of a kick drum, the hit of a floor tom and an acoustic guitar. The second verse returns the brass section and other instruments before resting for Ryo Nishikido's [...] "Ne" [...] and returning for the chorus.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{difference}} in yielding ability of two genotypes which differ by only one single gene is compared : <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> (bourbon) and <b>Na</b> <b>na</b> (murta). 20 plants of each of 14 murta (<b>Na</b> <b>na)</b> progenies were used for comparison after discarding all <b>na</b> <b>na</b> plants which are dwarfed and practically unfruitful; each progeny was made of 10 <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> and 10 <b>Na</b> <b>na</b> individuals. The individual yields were recorded during 8 years (1939 to 1946) and it was shown that the <b>na</b> allele, besides its well known effect on the morphology of the leaves, has a remarkable influence on the yielding capacity of the <b>Na</b> <b>na</b> plants, reducing it, in average, to only 55, 9 % {{as compared with the}} <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> genotype. The Bartlett's test of homogeneity of variance when applied to study the variability between the plants of the bourbon and murta groups has shown that both groups are homogeneous, but a significant difference between their variances was found, the bourbon one being larger. The same test when applied to study the variation between the annual yields of the same groups of plants has led to the same conclusion. The <b>Na</b> <b>na</b> plants however were more suceptible to the die-back of the lateral branches after harvest, which even caused the death of several plants. Considering that fruit size and weight of both varieties (bourbon and murta) are practically identical, it is concluded that the lower fruit number of the murta genotype is responsable for its lower yields. As its flowers are normally fertile, pollen being produced in abundance, it is supposed that a lower number of internodes, or a lower number of flowers in the inflorescences or even a lower total number of flowers in each leaf axil is responsable for the decrease in yield of the murta variety. The results of this study are also of practical importance suggesting the elimination of all murta plants in a coffee plantation and their replacement by bourbon...|$|R
