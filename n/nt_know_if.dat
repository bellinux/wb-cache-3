50|$|Westgate - Quilpie, 201 km. In 1910 the Queensland {{government}} {{adopted a}} significant {{plan to build}} a railway on the Queensland section of the alignment proposed from Bourke in western NSW, to Darwin in the <b>NT,</b> <b>known</b> as the ‘Great Western Railway’. To connect to that alignment, construction began in 1911 from Westgate (21 km south of Charleville) in a westerly direction. The First World War hampered construction, which ceased in April 1917, making Quilpie the effective terminus. Despite suggestions after the war that construction be recommended, the GWR project was never re-activated. Quilpie (population 560) became the loading point for significant numbers of cattle from western areas. The line is still known as the Great Western line by QR.|$|R

40|$|Selenocysteine is cotranslationally {{incorporated}} into selenoproteins {{in a unique}} pathway involving tRNA mediated suppression of a UGA nonsense codon (1 - 3). The DNA sequence of the gene for this suppressor tRNA from Escherichia coli predicts unusual features of the gene product (4). We determined the sequence of this serine tRNA (tRNA(UCASer]. It is the longest tRNA (95 <b>nt)</b> <b>known</b> to date with an acceptor stem of 8 base pairs and lacks some of the 'invariant' nucleotides found in other tRNAs. It is the first E. coli tRNA that contains the hypermodified nucleotide i 6 A, adjacent to the UGA-recognizing anticodon UCA. The implications of the unusual structure and modification of this tRNA on recognition by seryl-tRNA synthetase, by tRNA modifying enzymes, and on codon recognition are discussed...|$|R
