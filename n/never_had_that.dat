5|$|After {{an attempt}} on Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) life, Mark is {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective in the case. When he received conflicting information from the suspects he interviews, Mark struggled to identify the culprit. McGregor told a writer from SX News that he enjoyed {{being involved in the}} storyline, as he had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> much responsibility before. To prepare for the role, McGregor chose to research his character's job. Mark was described as being handsome, charming and a perfectionist. He was dedicated to his job as a police detective and often put his work ahead of everything else. As a consequence, Mark struggled to balance his work and personal lives. McGregor stated that he shared some similarities with Mark and he enjoyed getting into character.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
500|$|... "Love American Style" [...] {{was written}} by Melissa Rosenberg and {{directed}} by Robert Lieberman. The episode was Rosenberg's first for the series and her first on a show written for a premium network. Having had over 10 years' experience in writing for free-to-air commercial networks—which typically have 22–26 episodes per season rather than 12, with a much tighter schedule—she finished writing the script five weeks before it was due for preparation. She said that [...] "There was {{time to think about}} storytelling. I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> on any show; it's just wonderful." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{went through}} possible restoration during Birds of Prey {{when she is}} infected with microscopic machines known as nanites by the super villain Brainiac, which attempted to repair her DNA. Marc Dipaolo, author of War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film (2011) commented that DC writers and editors would not allow her to recover completely, and that [...] "he decision was made because there were not enough handicapped superheroes in the DC Universe to justify 'curing' one, and {{because it would have}} been odd to see Barbara Gordon escape from her wheelchair in the world of fiction when Christopher Reeve <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written to not require Gillian Anderson at all. As a result, the {{finished}} episode only features stock footage of Scully from [...] "Within", and Anderson {{was not required}} to film any new scenes. Anderson later revealed that she was extremely grateful for this and other [...] "Doggett-centric" [...] episodes, because they provided her time {{to spend time with}} her daughter, Piper Maru, who was attending school in Canada. Anderson insisted that the show both understand her situation and make accommodations: in an interview, she explained, [...] "I was determined that they respect that I would work for three weeks and then have two or three weeks off to go and be with her. So they agreed to that, and that was important to me. I'd <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> before on the show." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is really not that fun. I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which I think is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{attended}} Southport State Primary School {{and experienced}} the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as {{she wanted a}} life similar to her school friends. [...] "Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that.</b> I'd get {{home from school and}} {{there was nothing in the}} cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
500|$|Off-screen Wolfenden, Hardwick and Chittel {{were thrilled}} by Amy's inclusion. Wolfenden said Halfpenny's acting skill has [...] "freshened {{the whole place}} up." [...] In comparison, David was {{initially}} hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family. However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens and results in Amy developing feelings for him. Wolfenden said David [...] "has {{a soft spot for}} Amy" [...] and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his [...] "little sister." [...] When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because [...] "she <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> sort of affection when she was growing up." [...] Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home.|$|E
500|$|Directed by Nick Marck, [...] "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{was written}} by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and {{penultimate}} writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do {{not appear in the}} episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a special connection with Hannigan on-set: [...] "We get together and just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, we really have a sister-brother thing going on. I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> kind of connection with an actress before. It totally works." [...] Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode.|$|E

500|$|Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, who {{directed}} the previous One-Shot, Item 47, returned as director, while writer Eric Pearson also returned from the previous One-Shots. D'Esposito noted that the short had twice the budget of Item 47, but {{the same amount of}} shooting time so [...] "the scope of it is much bigger. It's set in a period, there are more actors involved, the scale's bigger, there are three fight scenes—we've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> in any of [...]" [...] Atwell agreed to the project after watching Item 47, and due to her love for the character and potential [...] "to show off some of her skill sets" [...] that were not seen in the film. Atwell worked for three days with the stunt team to rehearse the pre-choreographed fight sequences for the short. D'Esposito elaborated on the decision to focus on Carter, saying, [...] "It's telling the best story, and finding that story we want to tell—whether it's connectivity to the Marvel Universe, or it's highlighting a character. In the case of Hayley, it's a little bit of both. We wanted to tell Peggy Carter's story—she's been left back in the '40s. Announcing to the world that she was running S.H.I.E.L.D. with Howard Stark is a great connectivity." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity. Maybe even a glimmer of a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E

[...] It is also nice to have each episode complete within itself, while still carrying on the saga of Blake's struggle against the 1984-ish Federation.

2500|$|After Marvel Entertainment {{was bought}} by the Walt Disney Company and Marvel Studios became its [...] "own entity", without other {{companies}} working with them as distribution companies, the studio commissioned a new logo for their films and television series starting with Thor: The Dark World, the first film to feature solely the Marvel logo. Feige explained that [...] "We didn’t want to re-invent the wheel , but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, [...] like all great studio logos, you need a fanfare, and we’d <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> before."
