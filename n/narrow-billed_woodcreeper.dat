50|$|The <b>narrow-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (Lepidocolaptes angustirostris) is {{a species}} of bird in the Dendrocolaptinae subfamily. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Suriname, and Uruguay. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical dry forests and dry savanna. As all members of its subfamily, it is a creeping bird which lives on small arthropods and vertebrates it catches under the bark of trees. The woodcreeper nests in cavities, both natural and bird-(e.g. woodpecker)made. It lays two to three white eggs, brooded jointly by the pair.|$|E

Woodcreepers (Dendrocolaptidae) {{are part of a}} highly specialized group within the Suboscines of the New World. They are forest birds exclusive to the Neotropical region and similar to woodpeckers, at a comparable evolutionary stage. This paper describes {{for the first time the}} karyotypes of the Olivaceous and the <b>Narrow-billed</b> <b>Woodcreeper</b> using conventional staining with Giemsa and silver nitrate staining of the nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NORs). Metaphases were obtained by fibular bone marrow culture. The chromosome number of the Olivaceous Woodcreeper was 2 n = 82 and of the <b>Narrow-billed</b> <b>Woodcreeper,</b> 2 n = 82. Ag-NORs in the largest macrochromosome pair and evidence of a chromosome inversion are described herein for the first time for this group...|$|E
40|$|Young {{specimens}} (“ninhegos”) of the <b>Narrow-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> Lepidocolaptes angustirostris sustained about 67 larvae from 2005 to 2006. Larvae {{were observed}} from the 4 th day after hatching. They were removed and their life cycle was accompanied. Eightheen larvae reached the adult stage. They {{were put into}} an artificial nest inside a plastic box and their life cycle was observed until hatching. As soon as the adults began dying, we preserved them in alcohol 70 % for further identification. No previous information exists about L. angustirostris as a potential host for Philornis, and this work represents the first record for this species...|$|E

40|$|Lepidocolaptes angustirostris is a South American woodcreeper that inhabits {{predominantly}} open lowlands {{such as the}} Cerrado, Chaco and Caatinga. Eight subspecies {{are currently}} recognized based on plumage patterns and geographical distribution. However, a more detailed morphological analysis and taxonomic revision have not been done in this species. The objective {{of this study was}} to conduct a taxonomic revision of L. angustirostris using morphometrical and plumage character, and a Generalized Linear Models analyzes (GLM) were elaborated to identify environmental variables that could account for this variation. We found a high level of intergradation among all named populations. The principal component analyzes show certain levels of morphological differentiation among the taxa, with a first component formed by bill characters (bill length, exposed and total culmen), and a second one that includes the bill width and the tarsus-metatarsus length. In the GLM analyzes, two climatic variables explain the geographical variation in the taxon, temperature seasonality and precipitation of warmest quarter. The ecogeographic rules of Bergmann and Gloger can be applied to this variation, and, more narrowly, the Allen's rule. Thus, the populations of the <b>Narrow-billed</b> <b>Woodcreeper</b> tend to be larger to the south of the distribution. We propose here that L. angustirostris is a single species, with no subordinate taxa. Any evidence analyzed here did not support the taxonomic validity of the proposed subspecies in the taxon. Despite colour-polymorphism identified in the plumage patterns, the high level of intergradation and the poor resolution of geographical boundaries did not support the splitting of this species...|$|E
