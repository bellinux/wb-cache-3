25|$|As {{minister}} for War, he {{became involved in}} disputes with Foreign Secretary George Canning over the Walcheren Expedition and its failure. Canning {{saw it as a}} diversion of troops from the Peninsular War based on a hopeless plan. However, Castlereagh had the support of Lord Wellesley's younger brother General Arthur Wellesley (future Duke of Wellington), and evidence later surfaced that Canning himself had interfered with the plan, selecting the Earl of Chatham to command the expedition. The Portland government became increasingly paralysed by disputes between the two men. Portland was in deteriorating health and gave <b>no</b> <b>lead,</b> until Canning threatened resignation unless Castlereagh was removed and replaced by Lord Wellesley. Wellesley himself was neither complicit with nor even aware of the arrangement, but Portland secretly agreed to make this change when it became possible.|$|E
25|$|Rosenqvist {{secured the}} pole {{position}} for the second race and held his advantage heading into the first corner. He built up a large lead over Buemi on the first lap and it remained steady over the following 22 laps despite being required to lift and coast for electrical energy management. Despite narrowly avoiding conatct with teammate Heidfeld after being released from his garage, Rosenqvist kept first place following the mandatory switch to his second car. Rosenqvist was immediately investigated by the stewards who issued him with a ten-second time penalty. Rosenqvist finished first on the road but the application of his time penalty handed Buemi his sixth victory {{of the season and}} the 12th of his career.

25|$|Buemi {{closed up}} to Sarrazin {{on the final}} lap, {{starting}} an battle for third position. He was unable to get past Sarrazin after the two battled for the complex comprising turns six and eight which included wheel-to-wheel contact. Vergne continued to push di Grassi {{for the remainder of}} the race but was unable to draw close enough to mount a serious attempt at passing, and di Grassi held on to the lead to secure the victory. Vergne finished three-tenths of a second adrift in second with teammate Sarrazin taking third. Buemi was fourth on the road, ahead of Abt in fifth and Bird who gained twelve positions over the course of the event to clinch sixth. Prost, Evans, Frijns, and the limping Rosenqvist rounded out the top-ten points scoring positions. Dillmann, d'Ambrosio, Engel, Piquet and Félix da Costa filled the next five positions with Turvey and Carroll were the last of the classified finishers. It was di Grassi's second victory of the season, his first in Montreal, and the sixth of his career. There were <b>no</b> <b>lead</b> changes during the course of the race as di Grassi led every lap contested.|$|E
25|$|López {{lined up}} an passing {{manoeuvre}} on Vergne and got {{ahead of him}} around the outside under braking for turn nine to move into fifth place six laps later. Vergne became vulnerable from attack from the other Virgin car of Bird, but stopped battling with him after Vergne continued to aggressively defend his position. Unhindered in the closing stages of the race, Rosenqvist crossed the start/finish line after 46 laps to finish first on the road, 2.9 seconds ahead of Buemi. With the application of Rosenqvist's ten-second time penalty, Buemi inherited the victory. Di Grassi was a further 3.6 seconds adrift in third with his teammate Abt in fourth. López finished fifth with Vergne sixth and Bird seventh. Prost and Turvey followed in eighth and ninth places. Heidfeld rounded out the top-ten points-scoring positions. Félix da Costa, Piquet, d'Ambrosio, Sarrazin and Dillmann filled the next five positions with Carroll, Evans and Frijns {{the last of the}} classified finishers. It was Buemi's sixth victory of the season and the 12th of his career. There were <b>no</b> <b>lead</b> changes in the event as Rosenqvist was the only driver to lead every lap of the race.|$|E
25|$|Di Grassi won {{the pole}} {{position}} for the first race by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and held off an challenge from Sarrazin to maintain the lead {{at the start of}} the event. He pulled away from the field and attention focused on his championship rival Sébastien Buemi, demoted from second to twelfth on the grid for changing his battery, after sustaining steering arm damage on the first lap but was able to move up the field during the course of the race. The race was neutralised with a full course yellow flag when Loïc Duval and Nick Heidfeld collided on the 14th lap. Most drivers made pit stops to switch into a second car and di Grassi remained the leader following the end of the pit stops. Sarrazin ceded second to teammate Vergne who then started to draw closer to di Grassi but his chase was neutralised when López crashed on lap 24, necessitating the safety car's deployment. Di Grassi kept the lead at the restart five laps later and held off Vergne for the remainder of the race to secure his second victory of the season and the sixth of his career. <b>No</b> <b>lead</b> changes occurred as di Grassi was the only driver to lead laps in the first race.|$|E

Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of condition until shortly before his death. King has announced his desire for the band to continue, but Araya was more uncertain, stating, [...] "After 30 years, it would literally be like starting over," [...] and expressing doubts that Slayer's fanbase would approve of such a change. In March 2015, Araya revealed that the band had recorded one song prior to Hanneman's passing, and that the song would appear on the album. The result was the song [...] "Piano Wire". Araya explained that Hanneman would be a part on the album when King later dismissed the claim saying, [...] "Jeff Hanneman isn't physically playing on this record. Somebody reported some bullshit. People say shit when they don't know what's actually going on. Even though Jeff's song, [...] "Piano Wire", was recorded during the last album cycle, I played all the guitar.

2500|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Brown at the CDC {{essentially}} confirmed Edwards's findings. [...] It {{also found that}} the 15,000 [...] "partial pipe replacements" [...] performed by WASA—where lead service lines were replaced up to a homeowner's property line, but no further—may not have effectively reduced lead levels, and may have made the problem worse. WASA spent $97 million to replace 17,000 pipes, including the 15,000 partial replacements. A Post article about the report lead to jammed phone lines at WASA and increased demand for bottled-water delivery. [...] The study indicated that there is no safe level of lead in drinking water, and that children in homes with even a partial lead service line are at a much higher risk of lead poisoning than those with <b>no</b> <b>lead</b> in the line. WASA said the finding [...] "is not news" [...] to them; General Manager George Hawkins told WAMU that the utility had been acting as if the CDC's findings were fact for some time before the report was released. Hawkins said that WAMU was not seeing elevated levels of lead in homes with partial pipe replacements.|$|E
2500|$|In 1835 a Low Level (or Low Horse Level) {{was begun}} {{from the side}} of the ravine which carries the Swart Beck from the upper valley down to the lower valley of Glenridding, a point over [...] lower than the High Level. A wooden bridge over the ravine from a narrow terrace on the west side gave access to the new level. From this point the miners had to {{excavate}} a distance of [...] to reach the vein, work which took nearly six years to complete and cost around £2,500. The new level was driven towards the Greenside vein by following two other soft but barren veins where possible. The vein was reached at the end of 1840, but far to the south of the higher workings, and in barren ground. Levels were driven both north and south from this point. The one to the south, known as Marshall's Level, was driven more than , but <b>no</b> <b>lead</b> was found. But the level to the north discovered the South Ore Shoot, a new lead-rich part of the vein in 1844. During the nineteenth century natural ventilation was adequate in the many interconnected levels of the mine. In blind headings a fan blast, worked by a boy, was used, or in very long drives a more powerful waterblast drove air down cast iron pipes to within a few yards of the miners at the forehead.|$|E

6000|$|They {{who have}} made but {{superficial}} studies in {{the natural history of}} the human mind have been taught to look on religious opinions as the only cause of enthusiastic zeal and sectarian propagation. But there is no doctrine whatever, on which men can warm, that is not capable of the very same effect. The social nature of man impels him to propagate his principles, as much as physical impulses urge him to propagate his kind. The passions give zeal and vehemence. The understanding bestows design and system. The whole man moves under the discipline of his opinions. Religion is among the most powerful causes of enthusiasm. When anything concerning it becomes an object of much meditation, it cannot be indifferent to the mind. They who do not love religion hate it. The rebels to God perfectly abhor the Author of their being. They hate Him [...] "with all their heart, with all their mind, with all their soul, and with all their strength." [...] He never presents Himself to their thoughts, but to menace and alarm them. They cannot strike the sun out of heaven, but they are able to raise a smouldering smoke that obscures him from their own eyes. Not being able to revenge themselves on God, they have a delight in vicariously defacing, degrading, torturing, and tearing in pieces His image in man. Let no one judge of them by what he has conceived of them, when they were not incorporated, and had <b>no</b> <b>lead.</b> They were then only passengers in a common vehicle. They were then carried along with the general motion of religion in the community, and, without being aware of it, partook of its influence. In that situation, at worst, their nature was left free to counterwork their principles. They despaired of giving any very general currency to their opinions: they considered them as a reserved privilege for the chosen few. But when the possibility of dominion, lead, and propagation presented themselves, and that the ambition which before had so often made them hypocrites might rather gain than lose by a daring avowal of their sentiments, then the nature of this infernal spirit, which has [...] "evil for its good," [...] appeared in its full perfection. Nothing, indeed, but the possession of some power can with any certainty discover what at the bottom is the true character of any man. Without reading the speeches of Vergniaud, Français of Nantes, Isnard, and some others of that sort, it would not be easy to conceive the passion, rancor, and malice of their tongues and hearts. They worked themselves up to a perfect frenzy against religion and all its professors. They tore the reputation of the clergy to pieces by their infuriated declamations and invectives, before they lacerated their bodies by their massacres. This fanatical atheism left out, we omit the principal feature in the French Revolution, and a principal consideration with regard to the effects to be expected from a peace with it.|$|E
