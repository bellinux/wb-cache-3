500|$|Herc {{carefully}} {{studied the}} dancers. [...] "I was smoking cigarettes and I {{was waiting for}} the records to finish. And I <b>noticed</b> <b>people</b> was waiting for certain parts of the record," [...] he says. It was an insight as profound as Ruddy Redwood's dub discovery. The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it was all about the groove, building it, keeping it going. Like a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E
500|$|Jason Trost {{conceived}} The FP {{when he was}} 16 {{years old}} and regularly played Dance Dance Revolution. He <b>noticed</b> <b>people</b> playing the game intensely and thought of treating the gameplay [...] "like some blood sport". Trost made short films throughout high school before briefly attending film school. After dropping out, he used his tuition money to fund a short film, also titled The FP. The short film {{was based on the}} original feature-length script, but only the first ten pages were filmed. The feature film recreated several shots from the short film. Trost said the feature film was inspired by what they imagined a Dance Dance Revolution movie made by producer Jerry Bruckheimer would look like.|$|E

I {{remember}} one man who couldn't get any work to do and his wife died, so he pawned his clothes and bought a revolver; but he made a mess of it, he only shot out an eye and he got all right. And then, if you please, with an eye gone and a piece of his face blow away, he {{came to the conclusion that}} the world wasn't such a bad place after all, and he lived happily ever afterwards. Thing I've always <b>noticed,</b> <b>people</b> don't commit suicide for love, as you'd expect, that's just a fancy of novelists; they commit suicide because they haven't got any money. I wonder why that is." ...|$|E

6000|$|At noon, his Majesty, thrifty of time, did enter: on horseback, Schwerin {{riding with}} him; behind him {{miscellaneous}} chief Officers; Borck and Posadowsky among others; some miscellany of Page-people following. With this natural escort, he rode in; Town-Major (Commandant of Town-guard), with drawn sword going ahead;--King wore his usual Cocked Hat, and practical Blue Cloak, both a little dimmed by service: but his gray horse was admirable; and four scarlet Footmen, grand as galloon and silver fringe could make them, did the due magnificence in dress. He was very gracious; saluting to this side and to that, where he <b>noticed</b> <b>people</b> of condition in the windows. [...] "Along Schweidnitz Street, across the Great Ring, down Albrecht Street." [...] He alighted, to lodge, at the Count-Schlegenberg House; {{which used to}} be the Austrian Cardinal von Sinzendorf Primate of Silesia's hired lodging,--Sinzendorf's furniture is put gently aside, on this new occasion.

The [...] "immense shoutings," [...] Dryasdust assures me, have been exaggerated; and I am warned not to believe the KRIEGS-FAMA such and such a Number, except after comparing it with him.--That day there was dinner of more than thirty covers, Chief Syndic Gutzmar and other such guests; but as to the viands, says my friend, these, owing to the haste, were nothing to speak of.

60|$|Later, {{the ladies}} brought Jeff {{with them when}} they came to Westover's studio, and the painter {{perceived}} that they were very good friends, as if they must have met several times since he had seen them together. He interested himself in the growing correctness of Jeff's personal effect. During his Freshman year, while the rigor of the unwritten Harvard law yet forbade him a silk hat or a cane, he had kept something of the boy, if not the country boy. Westover had noted that he had always rather a taste for clothes, but in this first year he did not get beyond a derby-hat and a sack-coat, varied toward the end by a cutaway. In the outing dress he wore at home he was always effective, but there was something in Jeff's figure which did not lend itself to more formal fashion; something of herculean proportion which would have marked him of a classic beauty perhaps if he had not been in clothes at all, or of a yeomanly vigor and force if he had been clad for work, but which seemed to threaten the more worldly conceptions of the tailor with danger. It {{was as if he were}} about to burst out of his clothes, not because he wore them tight, but because there was somehow more of the man than the citizen in him; something native, primitive, something that Westover could not find quite a word for, characterized him physically and spiritually. When he came into the studio after these delicate ladies, the robust Jeff Durgin wore a long frockcoat, with a flower in his button-hole, and in his left hand he carried a silk hat turned over his forearm as he must have <b>noticed</b> <b>people</b> whom he thought stylish carrying their hats. He had on dark-gray trousers and sharp-pointed enamelled-leather shoes; and Westover grotesquely reflected that he was dressed, as he stood, to lead Genevieve Vostrand to the altar.|$|E
6000|$|He dressed {{himself as}} quickly as he could, and went down into the hotel vestibule, where he had <b>noticed</b> <b>people</b> selling flowers the evening before, but {{there was no one there}} with them now, and none of the florists' shops on the street were open yet. He could not find {{anything}} till he went to the Providence Depot, and the man there had to take some of his yesterday's flowers out of the refrigerator where he kept them; he was not sure they would be very fresh; but the heavy rosebuds had fallen open, and they were superb. Dan took all there were, and when they had been sprinkled with water, and wrapped in cotton batting, and tied round with paper, it was still only quarter of eight, and he left them with the man till he could get his breakfast at the Depot restaurant. There it had a consoling effect of not being so early; many people were already breakfasting, and when Dan said, with his order, [...] "Hurry it up, please," [...] he knew that he was taken for a passenger just arrived or departing. By a fantastic impulse he ordered eggs and bacon again; he felt, it a fine derision of the past and a seal of triumph upon the present to have the same breakfast after his acceptance as he had ordered after his rejection; he would tell Alice about it, and it would amuse her. He imagined how he would say it, and she would laugh; but she would be full of a ravishing compassion for his past suffering. They were long bringing the breakfast; when it came he despatched it so quickly that it was only half after eight when he paid his check at the counter. He tried to be five minutes more getting his flowers, but the man had them all ready for him, and it did not take him ten seconds. He had said he would carry them at half-past nine; but thinking it over on a bench in the Garden, he decided that he had better go sooner; they might breakfast earlier, and there would be no fun if Alice did not find the roses beside her plate: that was the whole idea. It was not till he stood at the door of the Pasmer apartment that he reflected that he was not accomplishing his wish to see Alice by leaving her those flowers; he was a fool, for now he would have to postpone coming a little, because he had already come.|$|E

5000|$|Tetracycline {{was being}} used by Nubians, based on bone remains between 350 AD and 550 AD. The {{antibiotic}} was in wide commercial use only in the mid 20th century. The theory is earthen jars containing grain used for making beer contained the bacterium streptomycedes, which produced tetracycline. Although Nubians {{were not aware of}} tetracycline, they could have <b>noticed</b> <b>people</b> fared better by drinking beer. According to Charlie Bamforth, a professor of biochemistry and brewing science at the University of California, Davis, said [...] "They must have consumed it because it was rather tastier than the grain from which it was derived.

Konami <b>noticed</b> <b>people</b> asking multiple questions regarding these teasers to which they responded that answers would be delivered during E3.
