5000|$|The ophicleide, {{like the}} keyed bugle (the soprano member of its 'family') has a {{fingering}} system {{like no other}} wind instrument. All keys except one are normally closed, opening only when a finger presses the associated key lever. Just below the bell is {{the largest of the}} key-covered tone holes, which is normally open, closing only when the lever is pressed. This normally open tone hole is the acoustic bell, with the bell itself having little effect on sound or pitch. The sound produced with no key levers pressed is the <b>nominal</b> <b>pitch</b> of the instrument. If the player presses the lever for this normally open tone hole, that hole is closed and the now-longer air column extends past this hole up to the bell, lowering the pitch by one half step. In general, the player can obtain all the [...] "partial" [...] pitches available for a given air column length. To play a higher series of partials, he opens one of the normally closed tone holes, effectively making that hole the [...] "bell" [...] of the instrument, with a corresponding shorter air column and higher series of pitches. The left hand controls three such tone holes plus the normally open one below the bell. Pitches in the upper and middle range of the instrument can be obtained by using only the left hand's set of tone holes, and the right hand can hold and stabilize the instrument. At the point where the air column is shortened by opening all of the left hand tone holes, there comes a difficult couple of notes that can best be played by continuing to shorten the air column with two fingers of the right hand, before the series of partials [...] "wraps" [...] and the left hand is used again for another set of notes. In the lowest octave, some pitches cannot be obtained very well using the holes closer to the bell. For these notes, the other fingers of the right hand can open a few more tone holes that are relatively closer to the mouthpiece than to the bell. Some instruments were made with between one and three extra right hand keys to provide better intonation for specific notes in this register. The right hand keys may also be used in the upper registers as alternate fingerings to facilitate faster passages or to improve intonation. With the exception of these special few pitches in the low octave, the combinations of partials on various sets of opened tone holes results in the left hand fingers going through something very similar to what they would be doing to manipulate the valves on a modern brass instrument.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Development and {{application}} of composite materials in modern industry are very dynamic. Composite materials seem to be replacing steel and aluminium ones.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} use of model predictive control (MPC) in application to wind turbine operation from start-up to cut-out. The studies conducted {{are focused on the}} design of an MPC controller for a 650 KW, three-bladed horizontal axis turbine that is in operation at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2 ̆ 7 s National Wind Technology Center outside of Golden, Colorado. This turbine is at the small end of utility scale turbines, but it provides advanced instrumentation and control capabilities, and there is a good probability that the approach developed in simulation for this thesis, will be field tested on the actual turbine. MPC is an active area for turbine control research, because wind turbine operation is complicated by multiple factors that are intrinsic to harvesting power from the wind resource: Since the goal of the turbine is to produce as much energy as possible from the available power in the air ow passing through the turbine 2 ̆ 7 s rotor plane, either the turbine 2 ̆ 7 s blade pitch (used to regulate aerodynamic torque), or the generator load torque (used to regulate rotor speed at the optimal tip-speed-ratio) are routinely set at the limits of their operating range. There is a significant variation in the gain from perturbations in blade pitch to perturbations in bending moments and torque. This variation is dependent on the relative speed between the blade and wind, and the <b>nominal</b> blade <b>pitch.</b> As a result, gain scheduling techniques are found to be necessary in order to obtain adequate speed regulation, and optimal load mitigation. The three individual pitch (IP) commands and the generator load command, along with structural loads that can be in conflict with speed regulation objectives, make the turbine control problem inherently multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) in nature. Advanced measurement technologies like LIDAR (light detection and ranging) make {{the use of}} preview control plausible in the near future. Standard formulations of MPC accommodate each of these issues. Also, a common MPC technique provides integral-like control to achieve offset-free operation [9]. At the same time in wind turbine applications, multiple studies [38, 5, 73] have developed -forward 2 ̆ 2 controls based on applying a gain to an estimate of the wind speed changes obtained from an observer incorporating a disturbance model. These approaches are based on a technique that can be referred to as disturbance accommodating control (DAC) [32]. In this thesis, it is shown that offset-free tracking MPC [52] is equivalent to a DAC approach when the disturbance gain is computed to satisfy a regulator equation. Although the MPC literature has recognized that this approach provides stable 2 ̆ 2 [20] disturbance rejection and tracking, this step is not typically divorced from the MPC computations repeated each sample hit. The DAC formulation is conceptually simpler, and essentially uncouples regulation considerations from MPC related issues. This thesis provides a self contained proof that the DAC formulation (an observer-controller and appropriate disturbance gain) provides structurally stable regulation...|$|R
40|$|A novel force {{measurement}} technique {{has been developed}} at the impulsive facility HIEST, in which the test model is completely non-restrained {{for the duration of}} the test, so it experiences completely free-flight conditions for a period on the order of milliseconds. This technique was demonstrated with a three-component aerodynamic {{force measurement}} with a blunted cone of total length 318 mm and a total mass of 22 kg in hypervelocity test flow. A miniature modelonboard data-logger, which was a key technology for this technique, was also developed in order to store the measured data. The data-logger was designed to be small enough to be instrumented in test models, with an overall size of 100 mm x 100 mm x 70 mm, including batteries. Since the logger was designed to measure force and pressure, it includes six piezoelectric amplifiers and four piezoresistive amplifiers, as well as high-speed analogue-digital converters, which digitize the measured data with 16 -bit resolution. The logger’s sampling rate and sample size are 500 kHz and 400 ms, respectively. For the autonomous operation, the logger waits for a trigger signal (accelerometer output) and then starts to take measurements with arbitrary adjustable trigger threshold level and pre-trigger delay time. Measured data is stored to static memory for transfer to a PC via a USB interface after a wind tunnel test. To demonstrate the entire measurement system, wind tunnel experiments were conducted in HIEST. In the present wind tunnel test campaign, records of pressure, axial force, <b>nominal</b> force and <b>pitching</b> moment were obtained under conditions of H 0 = 4 MJ/kg, P 0 = 14 MPa. This demonstrated that the system worked correctly in the short test duration and harsh conditions typical of HIEST.

40|$|Absolute pitch (AP) {{is a form}} {{of sound}} {{recognition}} in which musical note names are associated with discrete musical pitch categories. The accuracy of pitch matching by non-AP musicians for chords has recently been shown to depend on stimulus familiarity, pointing to a role of spectral recognition mechanisms {{in the early stages of}} pitch processing. Here we show that pitch matching accuracy by AP musicians was also dependent on their familiarity with the chord stimulus. This suggests that the pitch matching abilities of both AP and non-AP musicians for concurrently presented pitches are dependent on initial recognition of the chord.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{bi-directional}} horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) rotors was prototyped. The geometry and motion {{parameters of the}} turbine series cover {{a wide range of}} tidal turbine operating conditions targeted to the tidal flow speed probability distribution of the Bay of Fundy, NS Canada. A generic yet novel wind/tidal turbine rotor design and optimization procedure was developed and used for the optimization process. In the process, optimum annual energy production, as a benchmark, was obtained and used for comparison by taking into account both rotor hydrodynamic power production performance characteristics and annual tidal inflow speed probability distribution. The diameter of the full-scale bi-directional HATT rotor series developed is 20 -m. Optimum values of various variables were obtained for maximum annual energy production. These optimum values include: uniform pitch-diameter-ratio (p/D) distributions, <b>nominal</b> <b>pitch</b> values with different curve forms of non-uniform p/D distributions, shaft rotational speeds under fixed rotor diameter, diameter at fixed tip-speed-ratio (TSR), a combination of optimum shaft speeds at corresponding inflow speeds and optimum uniform p/D distribution at a fixed rotor diameter, number of rotor blades at fixed chord length, rotor solidity at fixed number of blades, and the combination of number of blades and solidity for both optimum constant pitch distribution and optimum linear pitch distribution. For the 20 -m bi-directional HATT, a substantial improvement in power coefficient Cpow was obtained, from 0. 28, {{as a result of the}} primary optimization process (for both optimum uniform p/D distribution and shaft speed n), to the final maximum of 0. 43. This corresponds to a 56 % increase in annual energy production of 1230 MW h, from 2188 to 3418 MW h, an improved energy production equivalent to the energy generated from 600 tonnes of coal (at 2 kW h per 1 kg coal from a standard thermal power plant). The annual energy production from the optimized 20 -m bi-directional HATT before the deduction of mechanical and electrical conversion loses, is 3418 MW h, equivalent to the electric energy generated from 1550 tonnes of coal.

40|$|If {{one-dimensional}} (1 D), p–period and arbitrarily structured grating position-related topographical signals {{coexist with}} noise, {{it is difficult}} to evaluate the pitch practically using the centre-of-gravity (CG) method. The Fourier-transform-based (FT) method is the most precise to evaluate pitches; nevertheless it cannot give the uniformity of pitches. If a cross correlation filter ̶ a half period of sinusoidal waveform sequence (pT period), cross-correlates with the signals, the noise can be eliminated if pT is equal to p. After cross-correlation filtering, the distance between any two adjacent waveform peaks along the direction perpendicular to 1 D grating lines is one pitch value. The pitch evaluation based on the cross-correlation filtering together with the detection of peaks position is described as the peak detection (PD) method in this paper. The pitch average and uniformity can be calculated by using the PD method. The computer simulation has indicated that the average of pitch deviations from the true pitch and the pitch variations are less than 0. 2 % and 0. 2 % for the sinusoidal and rectangular waveform signals with up to 50 % uniform white noise, less than 0. 1 % and 1 % for the sinusoidal and rectangular waveform signals and 0. 6 % and 2. 5 % for the triangular waveform signal if three waveform signals are mixed with Gaussian white, binomial and Bernoulli noise up to 50 % in standard deviation, one probability and trial probability respectively. As the examples, a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with 0. 246 nm distance between atoms and a 1 D grating with 3000 nm <b>nominal</b> <b>pitch</b> are measured by a ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (UHV STM) and a metrological atomic force microscope (AFM) respectively. After the position-related topographical signals are cross-correlation filtered, the 0. 240 nm and 3004. 11 nm pitches calculated by using the PD method are very close to the 0. 240 nm and 3003. 34 nm results evaluated by the FT method...|$|E
40|$|Nanoroughness is {{becoming}} a very important specification for many nanostructures and nanodevices, and its metrology impacts not only the nanodevice properties of interest, but also its material selection and process development. This Ph. D. thesis presents an investigation into fabrication and nanoroughness characterization of nanoscale specimens and MIS (metal-insulator-semiconductor) capacitors with 2 HfO as a high k dielectric. Self-affine curves and Gaussian, non-Gaussian, self-affine as well as complicated rough surfaces were characterized and simulated. The effects of characteristic parameters on the CD (critical dimension) variation and {{the properties of the}}se rough surfaces were visualized. Compared with experimental investigations, these simulations are flexible, low cost and highly efficient. Relevant conclusions were frequently employed in subsequent investigations. A proposal regarding the thicknesses of the deposited films represented by nominal linewidths and pitch was put forward. The MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) process was introduced and AlGaAs and GaAs were selected to fabricate nanolinewidth and nanopitch specimens on GaAs substrate with nominal linewidths of 2 nm, 4 nm, 6 nm and 8 nm, and a <b>nominal</b> <b>pitch</b> of 5 nm. HRTEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy) image-based characterization of LER/LWR (Line Edge Roughness/Line Width Roughness) in real space and frequency domains demonstrated that the MBE-based process was capable of fabricating the desired nanolinewidth and nanopitch specimens and could be regulated accordingly. MIS capacitors with 2 HfO film as high k dielectric were fabricated, and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) image-based nanoroughness characterization, along with measurement of the MIS capacitor electrical properties were performed. It was concluded that the annealing temperature of the deposited 2 HfO film was an important process parameter and 700 ℃ was an optimal temperature to improve the properties of the MIS capacitor. Also, by quantitative characterization of the relevant nanoroughness, the fabrication process can be further regulated. The uncertainty propagation model of SEM based nanoroughness measurement was presented according to specific requirements of the relevant standards, ISO GPS (Geometric Product Specifications and Verification) and GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement), and the method for implementating uncertainties was evaluated. The case study demonstrated that the total standard uncertainty of the nanoroughness measurement was 0. 13 nm, while its expanded uncertainty with the coverage factor k as 3 was 0. 39 nm. They are indispensable parts of LER/LWR measurement results. ...|$|E
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPMs), {{generally}} {{including such}} instruments as Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STMs) and Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs), {{have been widely}} applied to measure engineering surfaces {{in a variety of}} fields, such as material sciences, semiconductor industry, and biotechnology. SPMs will also be a potential tool in nanotechnology, for example nanolithography, atom manipulation, and nanometrology. Normally, a commercial AFM consists of a laser, a photo-detector, a controller, a piezo-scanner, and a cantilever tip. The piezo-scanner is critical to the performance of AFMs. The intrinsic properties of piezo-scanners, for instance non-linearity, hysteresis, aging, thermal drift, creep, and coupling effect will result in measurement errors that may reach up to 20 % of the reading. To reduce major measurement errors mentioned above, an AFM should be periodically calibrated with a traceable standard. The goal of my research study was to design a state-of-the-art Traceable Atomic Force Microscope (TAFM) {{to be used as a}} primary realization of nanometer scale standards for Taiwan industry. The TAFM was composed of a commercial AFM, two laser interferometers, a 3 -axis active compensation flexure stage, a super-Invar metrology frame, a vibration isolator, and a temperature-controlled enclosed box with circulating water. To eliminate the Abbe-offset, the surface-plane of specimens was arranged on the same plane-level to the laser beams emitted by interferometers. The compensation flexure stage was aimed to provide a perfect reference motion mechanism. To achieve the direct traceability to the definition of meter, two interferometers were added to the flexure stage. The TAFM was evaluated to have an expanded uncertainty of 2. 5 nm at a confidence level of 95 % and 29 degrees of freedom for a <b>nominal</b> <b>pitch</b> value of 292 nm. Since the expanded uncertainty of pitch measurement is not satisfactory and there is no traceability in the Z direction. The TAFM needs to be improved to meet the requirement of an expanded uncertainty of no more than 0. 5 nm at 95 % confidence level at all three axes. The requirement can be achieved by the following improvements: A laser interferometer is added to the flexure stage for Z-height calibration. To reduce the noise of laser interferometer to about 5 nm, the support of the enclosed box is moved from tabletop to the floor. The metrology frame is improved by changing the reference mirrors from AFM to flexure stage, thickening the super-Invar frame, shortening the structure loop and metrology loop, using one material, and realizing a symmetrical mechanism design. The passive temperature control is changed to active temperature control, which will approach an anticipative temperature stability of (20 ¡Ó 0. 1) ¢XC in the measuring volume...|$|E
40|$|Floating {{offshore}} wind turbines {{are taking on}} more and more prominence, as the industry moves towards larger turbines, farther offshore, in deeper water. The increase in turbine size can reduce the costs of {{offshore wind}} energy, but requires larger support structures. Rather than redesigning the structure completely, a rational methodology for upscaling an existing floating substructure can improve {{the efficiency of the}} design process. This work presents a guideline for the optimization and upscaling of a semi-submersible floating platform, addressing also special challenges related to changes in turbine technology, as well as design criteria for floating platforms. The OC 4 semi-submersible platform is used as starting point of this study. Based on analysis results of an initial elementary upscaling procedure, the main criteria, when dealing with a semi-submersible floating platform, are specified. Optimization is then carried out, focusing on stability and eigenfrequencies. Reducing the upper column diameter and changing the ballast position within the columns, yields longer natural periods in heave and pitch, a lighter and cheaper platform, and a less over-conservative, but still stable and safe system. Based on this optimized design, a guideline for an upscaling procedure for any other turbine is given. The main scaling factor is determined from the mass ratio of the top structures, rather than the turbine rating. The main column is scaled, so that it fits the new tower base diameter. The scaling factor for the upper columns is computed, based on the ratio of the overturning moments, and considers the contribution of the different columns to the stiffness component in pitch. The mooring line length is scaled, such that it can yield a predefined stiffness. Finally, the controller gains are recalculated, based on the expected natural frequency in pitch. The optimization and upscaling process is carried out for Fraunhofer's offshore wind turbine IWT- 7. 5 - 164 and the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine. The floating wind turbines are analyzed, modelled and simulated by means of simplified spreadsheet methods, linear frequency-domain calculations (in DNV's software HydroD), and detailed equation-based models (in Fraunhofer's software Modelica). The systems are evaluated regarding their eigenfrequencies, <b>nominal</b> <b>pitch,</b> stability and global performance in selected sea states, taking variable buoyancy and center of buoyancy into account, and adjusting the blade-pitch controller gains. The results, obtained from both computer programs and the initial hand calculations, are comparable and satisfying. The structural integrity is proved by a simplified approach, using tank pressure and sea pressure for computing the equivalent stress. More detailed strength checks for fatigue and ultimate limit states, as well as optimization of the mooring system, are left for future work...|$|E
