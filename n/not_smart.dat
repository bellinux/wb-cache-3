5|$|Later {{that spring}} Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call {{to spend the}} warm season in Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{at the tip of}} Cape Cod, and {{to take part in the}} {{communal}} theater productions of the Provincetown Players. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's The Game, in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as <b>Not</b> <b>Smart</b> by Wilbur Steele and Bound East for Cardiff by O'Neill.|$|E
25|$|After his collegiate career, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL drafted Unitas in {{the ninth}} round. However, Unitas was {{released}} before the season began as the odd man out among four quarterbacks trying to fill three spots. Steelers Head Coach Walt Kiesling had {{made up his mind}} about Unitas; he thought he was <b>not</b> <b>smart</b> enough to quarterback an NFL team, and Unitas was not given any snaps in practice with the Steelers. Among those edging out Unitas was Ted Marchibroda, future longtime NFL head coach. Out of pro football, Unitas—by this time married—worked in construction in Pittsburgh to support his family. On the weekends, he played quarterback, safety and punter on a local semi-professional team called the Bloomfield Rams for $6 a game.|$|E
500|$|Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine {{also noted}} Doug Liman's [...] "restrained {{approach}} to the material" [...] as well as Matt Damon and Franka Potente's strong chemistry, but ultimately concluded the film was [...] "smart, but <b>not</b> <b>smart</b> enough". J. Hoberman of The Village Voice dismissed the film as [...] "banal" [...] and as a disappointment compared against Liman's previous indie releases; Owen Gleiberman also criticised the film for a [...] "sullen roteness that all of Liman's supple handheld staging can't disguise".|$|E

BJ Hickman, an intervention expert who appeared in two episodes, noticed Goldstein [...] "had a moment" [...] holding the crack pipe, and later {{felt the need to}} call his sponsor. Goldstein later said of the experience: [...] "I realized my palms were sweaty and I was like, wait a minute, this is <b>not</b> <b>smart</b> for me to be holding this." [...] In another episode, a police officer shows Goldstein confiscated drugs, including a bag of crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Goldstein leaves the building, informing the camera crew that he felt so tempted to consume the drugs that it was not safe for him to remain there.|$|E

Reviewer Ed Gonzalez at Slant Magazine {{called the}} picture [...] "better than most films of its ilk", and praised the death scenes—which he called [...] "some of the juiciest and most convincing {{decapitation}} sequences since Argento's Trauma". Writing for IndieWire, critic Michael Koresky found the film lacking in nuance, [...] "more efficient than innovative", and even somewhat stale, yet {{said it was}} pleasurable and gleeful and managed to catch the audience's attention. Peter Hartlaub was more critical of the film in his review, concluding that Hellbent was <b>not</b> <b>smart,</b> not scary, and numbingly predictable. In contrast, The Seattle Times film reviewer Jeff Shannon thought the film novel and praised it for returning to the simple tropes of early horror films. He enjoyed the combination of gore and humor, although Hartlaub did not find that the humor redeemed the film.|$|E
