The episode features seven cover versions of songs, each of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the series' one-week debut high in the US. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of the musical performances, with some complaining of the tangential relationship between the numbers and religion, and others appreciating that the Glee versions brought <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the songs.|$|E

To promote the book, the anchor and World News Tonight started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, 50 States/One Nation/One Year. Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, In Search of America failed to generate much interest or sales.|$|E

The paper examines this adaptation of adoptives at the semantic level. Data were collected through observation, participant observation and a questionnaire. The paper established that Shona lingo borrows different items of grammar as they are from mainstream Shona but attaches <b>new</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>to</b> them. The identified resultant semantic changes include, changes in the ranges of meaning resulting in extension or narrowing the semantic content of the word, radical shift in meaning and changes in emotive value resulting in amelioration or pejorative meanings. The paper also shows how Shona lingo is reflective of the socio-economic situation of the Zimbabwean society. </p...|$|R

500|$|The 1920 {{opening of}} the Michigan Avenue Bridge, {{which was part of}} the efforts to enact the Burnham Plan of 1909, as well as the {{economic}} boom of the 1920s, brought wealth to the eastern sector of the Near North Side and paved the way for a luxury shopping district on North Michigan Avenue. Investors built high-rise apartment buildings such as those in the East Lake Shore Drive Historic District, and elaborate hotels. [...] The Bridge connected to a North Michigan avenue that served as a replacement for the former Pine Street which hosted warehouses and factory buildings near the river, and large mansions and rowhouses in northward sections in the neighborhoods of McCormickville and Streeterville. [...] Magnificent Mile architecture during the economic boom of the 1920s emphasized historicist architectural styles such as Beaux-Arts classicism, Gothic revival, and vertical-style modernism. The buildings redefined the Chicago skyline with stylistic variation that gave <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> urban context and design compatibility.|$|E
500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Love You To" [...] {{in early}} 1966 while the Beatles were enjoying an unusually long period free of {{professional}} commitments, {{due to their}} inability to find a suitable film project. He used the available time to further explore his interest in Indian music and the sitar, which, journalist Maureen Cleave noted in a contemporary article, [...] "has given <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> [...] life". Aside from honeymooning in Barbados with his wife, English model Pattie Boyd, Harrison's activities included receiving sitar tuition from an Indian musician at the Asian Music Circle (AMC) in north London, where he also attended music recitals, and seeing Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar perform at the Royal Festival Hall. As reflected in [...] "Love You To", Harrison continued to immerse himself in recordings by Shankar, who, when the pair met in June 1966, would agree to take Harrison as his student. This meeting {{took place at the}} home of the AMC's founders, Ayana and Patricia Angadi, whose network of friends and visitors added to Harrison's self-education in new forms of art, culture and politics.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1841 Charles and Emma Darwin moved from the turmoil of London to the countryside, to Down House, a quiet former parsonage {{in the village of}} Downe. He wrote, [...] "The flowers are here very beautiful". Darwin {{followed}} the recommendation of his friend, the leading botanist Robert Brown, and read Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen (The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilisation of Flowers Discovered). The little known book, published in 1793 by Christian Konrad Sprengel but never translated into English, introduced the idea that flowers were created by God to fulfill a teleological purpose: insects would act as [...] "living brushes" [...] to cross-fertilise plants in a symbiotic relationship. This functional view was rejected and mostly forgotten, as it contradicted the common belief that flowers had been created for beauty, and were generally self-fertilising. For Darwin, the concept of evolution gave <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> Sprengel's research into the mechanisms for cross-fertilisation. He welcomed its support for his supposition that cross-fertilisation in flowering plants tended to allow their offspring to avoid possible disadvantages resulting from self-fertilisation, and by 1845 he had verified many of Sprengel's observations.|$|E
500|$|On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release {{party at}} New York City's Industria Superstudio, and signed all the invitations under her Sex alter ego [...] "Dita".

500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
40|$|This work aims at {{analyzing}} the historical influence the alchemical thought had on William Blake’s work. By comparing {{the conflict of}} opposites present in The marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790) to the approach given to it in other historically previous texts – as in Meister Ekhardt’s, Jacob Boheme’s and in some ancient Eastern traditions such as Taoism – {{the idea was to}} set a background to this spiritual conflict and to set Blake as an ‘inventor of his own precursors’, as Jorge Luis Borges would put. The study of these systems showed some of the reasons why Blake’s philosophy seems so outsider for post-Enlightment readers, filling a symbolic gap that I intended <b>to</b> diminish. Giving <b>new</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>to</b> the past is giving <b>new</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>to</b> the present. In this sense, the work of William Blake may dialogue with issues that have been intensely felt in post-modernity, such as the will for integration, expressed through polyvalence and environmentalism...|$|R

The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff felt that the music was the worst aspect of the episode, similarly criticizing song selections based on their [...] relationship to religion. He felt that Kurt's performance was the only number which worked even slightly, commenting, [...] "it genuinely grows out of the moment, although the fact that Kurt is singing it to his dad never stops being kind of weird." [...] Both Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV's Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] brought <b>new</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the song, with Semigran naming it her favourite number of the episode.

In [...] "Special Education", when given his first opportunity to audition for a Warblers solo, Kurt asks Rachel for advice on selecting a song and she recommends [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] from Evita; the episode cuts between the two as they each sing the song. Both Colfer's and Michele's versions were released as singles, available for digital download, although neither appears on an album.
