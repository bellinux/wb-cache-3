40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the association between}} asset revaluations and discretionary accruals (a proxy for earnings management) using {{a sample of the}} largest 300 Australian companies. The results from this study indicate that the revaluation of <b>non-current</b> <b>assets</b> is positively associated with discretionary accruals. This finding is consistent with the argument that revaluation of assets reflects higher agency problems in the form of increased earnings management. Additional findings are that discretionary accruals are higher for firms reporting their <b>non-current</b> <b>assets</b> at fair values appraised by directors, than those of firms that use external appraisers. As well, the choice of auditors and the strength of corporate governance can constrain the opportunistic behaviour of managers in the accounting choice to revalue <b>non-current</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{examining}} the systems of accounting for marketable securities in Nigeria {{with a view}} to determine the impact of the accounting systems and the classification of Marketable Securities (MS) on the financial performance of banks. To achieve the above objective research questions were raised, hypotheses were formulated, and a review of related literature was made. In order to generate the necessary data for this study, data were sourced from the financial statements of banks and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin for a period of 15 years, i. e. 1995 – 2009. The data generated for the study were analyzed with the multiple regression analysis. Our findings indicated that, the unrealized gains arising from the classification of MS as current asset is a reduction to net income while the unrealized gains arising from the classification as <b>non-current</b> <b>asset</b> is a reduction to net asset. Based on the above findings, it was recommended that where marketable securities are debt instruments; they should be classified as current asset (temporary investment). But they should be classified as non-current assets (long-term investment) where they are equity instruments.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} accounting harmonisation and determinants explaining accounting measurement policy choice {{decisions by}} Asia-Pacific listed manufacturing companies. Using Thomas' (1991) theoretical framework, four contingent variables (country of reporting, company size, profitability and debt leverage) are examined as possible determinants of firms' accounting choices concerning <b>non-current</b> <b>asset</b> valuation measurement base, goodwill and depreciation. 130 listed manufacturing companies' annual reports were examined from Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. This study involves two phases. The first phase evaluates accounting harmonisation measurement indices {{in comparison with}} the extant literature. An important innovation is the operationalisation of Archer et. al. (1995) between-country and within-country C indices. Computed comparability indices indicated variations in the level of harmony across the five countries for all three accounting measurement practices. The second phase employed logistic regression to examine possible determinants of accounting policy choice decisions.

30|$|Motor Freight Transportation: The WACC of the Motor Freight Transportation cluster was {{negatively}} influenced by intensity of investment and systematic risk and positively influenced by ROA. The Motor Freight companies show relatively low asset intensity 1. If, {{in the case}} of the Motor Freight Transportation cluster, LSPs’ share of <b>non-current</b> <b>assets</b> decreased (intensity of investment), CoC would then increase. A certain amount of <b>non-current</b> <b>assets</b> is inevitable to ensure the operation of an LSP. As described for all LSPs, systematic risk also negatively influenced CoC in this cluster. The positive influence of ROA on WACC is surprising but, compared with the other clusters, it could be ascribed to the “light” asset structure of LSPs in the Motor Freight Transportation cluster.|$|R
