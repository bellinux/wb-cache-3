40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{docudrama}} is {{to inform the}} widest possible audience on topical issues in a fictional way. When dealing with well-known and easily identified places, there arises tensions between the representations of these places and their evocative power, tensions between their configuration in real life and how the filmmaker chooses to represent them. This is particularly true for films on prominent figures who evolve in prestigious places, like politicians in the public eye. One such person was Margaret Thatcher who {{was the subject of}} many docudramas, the most memorable ones being The Falklands Play and Thatcher: the Final Days. Whatever the intentions of the filmmakers who opt for docudrama, the result will inevitably be influenced by a genre that lends itself to empathy. The private nature of the places, for example the ones where the protagonists of the two films mentioned above evolve, acts as a reminder of the dramatic stage and increases the suspension of disbelief <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>empathy.</b> Opponents of docudrama were quick to pinpoint such a shortcoming for a genre that has often been intended to compete with investigative journalism. Unlike verbatim fiction, which puts a premium on the words uttered by the politicians and gives weight to the messages conveyed by being rigorously respectful of what was declared, docudrama avails itself of all the elements of fiction to achieve credibility and particularly references to exact places. The purpose of this speech was to try and examine the role of places, whether indexically featured or represented in detail, in the evidential claims of the docudrama filmmakers...|$|R
50|$|Effects {{of layoffs}} in the workplace: Layoffs have {{remained}} the greatest {{way for a}} company to cut costs.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to engage {{stakeholders}} in the development of a community based chronic pain-management service and identify their different agendas for service design and delivery. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected using the Nominal Group Technique (NGT), a ten-step process that generates qualitative and quantitative data. Seven NGT groups were conducted in the south-west region of the UK, three with General Practitioners and nurses, three with chronic pain patients, and one with Healthcare Commissioners. Findings – The patient agenda for service development focused on process of care issues particularly the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> deep- <b>empathy</b> and emotional support from providers, while professionals prioritised cost-effectiveness. While there was some overlap between agendas they were largely discrete and often contradictory. Research limitations/implications – The findings imply service planners will need to make trade- offs between cost-containment and patient satisfaction. The methodology did not allow trade-offs to be put to participants in a structured form. However, such techniques are available, for example, Conjoint Analysis. There may also be value in bringing together patients and professionals in joint focus groups, to see if the gap between their different agendas can be bridged through discussion. Originality/value – The findings provide a novel insight into the competing agendas of patients and professionals regarding service development and design which will be of value to service planners and managers as they strive to reconcile these differences...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Having {{children}} with chronic {{diseases such as}} asthma creates conditions that cause emotional and behavioral problems in parents. In most families, the mother tends to have the first role in caring for her child and therefore mothers endure greater psychological pressure than other family members.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of mothers of an asthmatic child. Methods: In this qualitative study data was collected through unstructured, in-depth interviews with 10 mothers who had an asthmatic child.

40|$|Purpose: Empathy is an {{important}} trait in physicians and {{a key element in}} the physician-patient relationship. Accordingly, one of the goals in medical education is developing empathy in students. We attempted to practically assess medical students’ empathy through their direct verbal expressions. Methods: The medical students’ empathy was measured using the modified Pencil-and-Paper Empathy Rating Test by Winefield and Chur-Hansen (2001). The students took 15 minutes or so to complete the scale, and it was then scored by one of two trained evaluators (0 to 4 points for each item, for a total score of 40). The subjects were 605 medical students, and the data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, independent t-test, and one-way analysis of variance in SPSS version 21. 0. Results: The students’ empathy scores were low (mean, 12. 13; standard deviation, 2. 55); their most common responses (78. 6 %) registered as non-empathetic. Differences in empathy were observed by gender (female students>male students; t=- 5. 068, p medical college; t=- 1. 935, p= 0. 053), and academic level (pre-medical 1 year < other years; t=- 4. 050, p< 0. 001).

40|$|Empathy is a {{personal}} trait which is viewed as {{an essential component of}} patient-centred care across the health professions. The patient is a person with needs and wants and emotions. They wish to be treated with respect and understanding, and have clear communications with their health care provider.

40|$|In {{light of}} school violence, {{bullying}} {{has been exposed}} as {{an important factor in}} student well-being and safety. This study investigated changes in shame dynamics and student attitudes related to bullying before and after students participated in a bullying prevention program offered at an elementary school. Students from four, third-grade classrooms (n = 118) participated in curriculum from Steps to Respect, a bullying prevention program. Students were administered questionnaires measuring perceptions and attitudes related to bullying at school and cards from the Thurston-Cradock Test of Shame (TCT), a projective test designed to assess shame dynamics, and rated by teachers as bullies, victims, or bystanders. As expected, in students identified by teachers as victims, perceptions of adult and bystander responsibility and likelihood of using assertiveness in response to bullying scenarios increased, while acceptance of bullying behaviors decreased, after participating in Steps to Respect curriculum. In the entire sample, perceived assertiveness increased, acceptance of bullying decreased, and perceptions of adult and bystander responsibility did not change significantly following the intervention. Interestingly, students 2 ̆ 7 projective stories included more themes of inflation and more references to bullying following the intervention. Students identified as bullies received higher maladaptive resolution scores following the intervention, demonstrating decreased coping abilities to resolve issues of shame and conflicts after they become aware of the presence of bullying around them. Bullying prevention programs need to continue reaching out to students identified as victims and bystanders by providing training in community responsibility, definitions of bullying behaviors, and assertiveness training. These programs should also address the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>empathy</b> and mental health intervention for both victims and bullies while paying attention to shame dynamics throughout the process...|$|E
40|$|Four {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to examine the nature of cyberbullying in Swedish schools using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The first two studies investigated what reasons/issues {{may be involved in}} the negative feelings that a victim of bullying may feel and how these related to different types of bullying. The content analysis yielded seven themes: helplessness, persistency, fright, anonymity, no avoidance, embarrassment and loneliness. Study Three used quantitative methods to examine various issues such as gender and age differences, but especially the distribution of the bullying material, the role of bystanders, and whether cyberbullies feel more or less remorse compared to traditional bullies. Findings showed that cyberbullies not only targeted their victims, but quite often showed the material to other people and/or uploaded it onto the Internet. The bystanders of cyberbullying mostly did nothing further to distribute the material, however when they did, they tended to help the victim more often than bully him/her further. When asked about feelings of remorse, cyberbullies expressed less remorse than traditional bullies. The findings are discussed in relation to the definition of bullying, and the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>empathy</b> raising awareness for bullies within the cyberbullying context. Study Four, a qualitative study, involved 10 pupils and examined issues such as what the pupils had experienced (as victims, bullies or bystanders), how it felt (impact), and how it was resolved. Practical implications of the findings include the highlighted need for different coping strategies to be applied for victims of cyberbullying and traditional bullying, as well as starting preventive strategies for cyberbullying in pupils as young as 7 years. In addition, the need to investigate cyberbullying in a different manner than that of traditional bullying is raised. This could have practical implications for researchers, but is also a theoretical concern related to the definition of cyberbullying. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The broad {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to present}} an alternative approach to empathy research. The three main questions raised are: What is empathy? How do its component psychological processes become active and operate together? How did empathy evolve? In answering these questions, most researchers have started from a conventional approach that {{can be described as}} focusing on short-term phenomena “inside the head” of an individual, evidence that is gathered exclusively in a laboratory environment, and neurocognitive processes that are universally shared by all humans. A problem with the conventional approach is that it makes social and normative issues in empathy research very difficult to analyze, let alone resolve. Issue such as: which contextual and social variables affect whether empathy occurs or not? Why do conflicting assessments of when empathy has occurred arise? And how should we decide between them? Resolving these issues on the conventional approach is hard because it ignores many important variables affecting empathy. There is a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> rethinking <b>empathy</b> in way that will more fully integrate the normative and environmental variables that affect its interactive complexity. My approach integrates three such variables. Namely, the environmental contexts of agents and targets, their values, and the motivational stances they adopt towards each other. In the first paper, I attempt to sort out disagreements about what empathy is. I then argue for an account of empathy that emphasizes care and other values. In the second paper, I explore the consequences of unconscious emotions for an account of empathy’s theory of empathic accuracy. In the third paper, I criticise evolutionary psychological accounts of empathy, and propose an enlarged theoretical framework that renders the account I develop in the first two papers consistent with recent advances in evolutionary theory, computer science, evolutionary biology, and philosophy. The three papers of this dissertation present a more detailed causal explanation of empathy that enables us to better predict when it will occur. It sketches a new evolutionary explanation of empathy. And it creates a theoretical space for the analysis of normative and environmental variables that will arguably be important <b>for</b> studying <b>empathy</b> going forward...|$|R

Method One hundred ninety-nine US residents com-pleted a survey using the online platform Mechanical Turk, comprising demographic questions, agreement with treatment withdrawal from each of the condi-tions, agreement with a series of ethical principles and three personality tests.

40|$|Despite {{the value}} of virtual teams in {{delivering}} global public relations programmes across geographical boundaries, accessing participants from diverse cultures and providing 24 -hour work cycles, global virtual teams are fraught with problems. Their geographical isolation, technology, different time zones and lack of visual cues mean leaders struggle to ensure these teams reach their potential. This longitudinal study explores leadership interactions in an annual public relations global virtual team learning project, GlobCom, which brings together an established supervisory team of lecturers and ad hoc teams of senior public relations students from 12 universities in 12 countries. The ongoing venture involves a live industry brief from an international client that requires competitive PR proposals to be developed by the student teams under real-time challenges. The study analyses interactions among the established supervisory global virtual team of lecturers and the interactions among the student virtual team leaders and their team mentor. The action research uses empirical data and applied integrated leadership theory, including interpersonal, group and organisational analysis, within a public relations organisational paradigm, to understand how leaders could improve interaction within these global virtual teams. The researcher is both a lecturer and team mentor to the student team leaders and has ongoing access to both the supervisory team and student team leaders. Action research is carried out within a pragmatic framework using empirically-derived data of team leader emails and online posts that are interpreted though a qualitative thematic analysis. This analysis shows how leaders can elicit actions, adopt roles specific to virtual teams and improve team participation. It offers insights into how relational interaction, combined with a task-related approach, can help virtual teams achieve their goals. The research identifies six specific action-eliciting interactive leadership styles and their levels of efficacy in each team stage. A new leadership tool, called DEPIQA, which is created from the empirical data, {{can be used to}} develop and monitor the leadership styles and moves research beyond the current simple division of passive and constructive interaction styles. The study shows the roles developed for face-to-face teams may not be transferrable to virtual teams and that delegated leadership roles are more effective than emerging functional roles. New team processes, leadership roles and team member roles that improve virtual team interaction are identified, along with a unique set of criteria for selecting a virtual team leader, which emphasises the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>empathy.</b> Virtual team stages are clarified and the much-needed research on later stages finds high team interaction in the later stage, as well as the initial stage. This study provides foundational research and offers a theoretical and practical framework for emerging scholarship on virtual team leadership and online communication. The findings expand the PR body of knowledge to globalisation and leadership through its analysis of virtual teams carrying out PR programmes. How PR is implemented affects an organisation’s reputation and the recommended interventions can empower practitioners, as part of the organisation’s dominant coalition, to lead the virtual teams that are integral to global PR programmes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In 1859 Charles Darwin {{challenged}} the Victorian worldview {{with his first}} controversial publication, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. The Victorian understanding of species-relatedness had primarily rested on the biblical idea of species-specific design by God, in which animals are considered wholly separate, and unrelated to, the human species. The Origin outlines the conflicting theory of evolution by natural selection, whereby animal species descend from one another over time, in response to factors such as climate, resource availability, and competition. Darwin thus suggests the mutability and connectivity of species. The Origin does not explicitly address human evolution. It does, however, imply that humanity is not exempt from possessing animal ancestry. The apparent <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>empathy,</b> respect and equality across all species is emphasised. Human evolution was given greater attention in Darwin’s second work, The Descent of Man and, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). 		 Herbert Spencer regarded natural selection as the ‘{{survival of the fittest}}’, a term which Darwin adopted in his fifth edition of The Origin in 1869. Described within The Origin as the survival of those better adapted for an immediate local environment, Darwin did not intend for the idea to transcend biology. Spencer, however, believed that survival of the fittest could be applied to sociology, and thus, as Social Darwinism, it became connected to ideas of racial superiority, eugenics, and justified genocide. 							 This thesis aims to analyse the nature of Darwin’s influence on novelists from the nineteenth century to present day. Of particular focus is how his ideas are represented and, on occasion, altered in the work of creative writers. The first half of this thesis focuses on late nineteenth-century authors writing in the immediate wake of The Origin. These novelists were inevitably influenced by Darwin’s ideas. Their fiction reflects both the Victorian fascination with Darwin, and the cultural, social, and theological unease that his theories stirred. Chapter One examines H. G. Wells’ The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), and War of the Worlds (1898), highlighting Wells’ intimate knowledge of Darwin’s theories, but also Wells’ anxieties about devolution and extinction. In Chapter Two attention turns to five late nineteenth and early twentieth-century novelists writing scientific romances and gothic fiction. Charles Kingsley’s Water Babies (1863), Samuel Butler’s Erewhon (1872), Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897), and Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World (1912) all exhibit respect for Darwin as a scientist, whilst also echoing Wells’ anxieties for the possible degeneration and regression of humanity. 								Having established these nineteenth-century contexts, I then move forward more than a century to explore neo-Victorian re-imaginings of Darwin and his ideas. Chapter Three focuses on The French Lieutenant’s Woman (1969) by John Fowles; Morpho Eugenia (1992) by A. S. Byatt; This Thing of Darkness (2005) by Harry Thompson; The Darwin Conspiracy by John Darnton (2005); and The Naturalist (2014) by Thom Conroy. These works showcase contemporary acceptance of many of Darwin’s views. Repulsion towards the way in which Darwin’s theories were applied in relation to issues of race creates a tension in these works, with Darwin perpetually mediated through a late twentieth and early twenty-first century lens. A similar self-reflexivity is evident in the Steampunk authors discussed in Chapter Four. In K. W. Jeter's Morlock Night (1979), Scott Westerfeld's Leviathan trilogy (2009 - 2011), and Mark Hodder's The Strange Affair of Spring Heeled Jack (2010), however, the seriousness of the neo-Victorians gives way to a playful spirit of fun...|$|E
40|$|Children, LiteraturePostmodern at Bedtime Ellen Handler Spitz The Three Pigs by David Wiesner Clarion Books, 40 pp., $ 16 Children love stories, and so {{we provide}} them. In the {{contemporary}} West we rely on books, {{but this was not}} always our way: as long ago as 1936, Walter Benjamin’s essay “The Storyteller” lamented the passing of the art of oral narration. The ancient art of oral storytelling endures {{in many parts of the}} globe. In southeast India, for example, I sat on the floor of a Chennai nursery and listened to a story, enthralled. Here, by contrast, we buy or borrow children’s books, or take them out of the attic, and read them to our offspring. In considering a growing trend in American books for children, I find it hard to push aside the question of why children love stories. An outstanding example will serve: a Caldecott Medal-winning picture book The Three Pigs, by David Wiesner. Said to exemplify dramatic changes that are occurring in children’s cultural lives as a result of web technology, Wiesner’s book has been touted for its special appeal to the population of children known as “cyberkids,” “digital youth,” and the “net generation. ” Books addressed to these allegedly postmodern children draw increasingly on hypertext and interactivity. They eschew linear plots, and favor formats that demand participation from individual child readers in various processes of active co-creation. Each book serves as an elaborate set-up for storylines that can vary not only from reader to reader but also from one reading to the next. An early groundbreaking example of this genre was David Macaulay’s Black and White, a picture book in which at least four versions of the same story are simultaneously recounted, but which may be read in any number of ways. Like a child clicking a mouse or tapping a screen, the reader of Black and White is free to move in any direction and thus to construct his or her own narrative. Not surprisingly, Wiesner dedicates his Three Pigs to Macaulay. Are the experiences offered by books of this type dramatically new? To claim as much is to risk a somewhat ahistorical perspective, and to assume that a passive receptive state is the mode with which children approach more traditional books. I am doubtful. John Dewey, Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, and Jerome Bruner, all noted psychologists, have shown persuasively that children invariably construct their worlds, and indeed must do so. Mental construction may seem passive from the outside, because it cannot be directly observed, but it occurs quite actively and passionately. Out of stories and out of life, children make what they need. They select, they re-work, they re-create. We must therefore recognize that in the presence of the great classic picture books—Potter’s Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902), Bemelmans’s Madeline (1939), Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are (1963) —children become as mentally engaged as they do with any of the post-Internet offerings. On the other hand, something is clearly new, in degree if not in kind; and the phenomenon deserves our serious consideration. More to the point, does it merit an unqualified welcome? The earliest versions of the Three Pigs story are buried in time, although we do have nineteenth-century English renderings of it. I want, as a foil, to consider Disney’s Silly Symphony animation, from 1932, with its refrain, “Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf?,” frequently issued in print form and known worldwide, because it forms, like so much of Disney’s work, an inescapable template. Disney’s pigs are “little,” that is, they are children; whereas Wiesner’s pigs are neither verbally nor pictorially “little. ” On the book jacket, Wiesner’s three porkers zoom in and eye us. We go snout to snout with them, as if looking in a mirror. Disney’s tiny fellows, on the other hand, caper at a distance; they are comical and vulnerable in their sailor suits, except of course for the wise guy in blue working man’s overalls and cap, who, channeling La Fontaine’s La cigale et la fourmi, warns the others against frivolity. The story, as Disney tells it, conforms to Aristotelian aesthetics: from start to finish, the plot conforms to propter hoc, replete with necessity and peripeteia (an unexpected reversal of fortune), as the industrious little pig saves his brethren by turning the tables on the wicked wolf, who flees in howling agony, his bottom scorched in boiling turp. And children feel good; they smile. They have been through fear, trembling, revenge, resolution, catharsis. And all of this in a single, justly famous, work of art. Wiesner draws in several linear styles, each one of which is associated with a different thread of his layered narrative. When the story starts, his art recalls the late Victorian Walter Crane’s illustrations for “This little pig went to market. ” As we read the text set neatly above the imagery, we are lulled into complacency. We are in the story we know. The wolf blows the first house down—but the threatened pig, instead of being eaten or running to his brother’s, simply exits the story altogether! He escapes danger by escaping the story. Imagine waking yourself up in the middle of a scary dream: now you are not in that story any more. The tale winds along until the wolf is about to do his worst, but the second pig steps out of the story, too, and joins the first. When the third pig joins them, they pick up some pages of their former story, fold them into a paper airplane, and defy gravity by flying the plane—a ubiquitous childhood fantasy—until it collapses under their combined weight and they find themselves inside “Hey Diddle Diddle,” where Wiesner now shifts his drawing style yet again to emulate the iconic Randolph Caldecott. Finally, with the cat from Hey Diddle Diddle (Disney uses this reference too in his version) the pigs return to their original story (“Let’s go home”) and end up supping with the added characters inside their house of brick. And Wiesner’s concluding tour-de-force is an image in which the wolf, trying blow down the house of brick, finds that his breath now scatters the very letters of the words of the story, so that its elemental structures come apart and are collected by the visiting dragon in a basket. On his final soup-slurping page, Wiesner writes in type unevenly set aslant: “And they all lived happily ever aft [no closure]. ” The book will intrigue, delight, and puzzle children. (Where did the pig go? What is he standing on? How did the wolf really eat the pig if he goes away? Why does it say so?). Wiesner’s tale turns back on itself to reveal its form, and to show that a story can be protean, metamorphic, and infinitely malleable. We have to co-construct it. Indeed, one of its boons is that, since there is no right way to read it, adults, too, are put to the test intellectually, (Wiesner’s pigs are not just children). The book can be seen as an unexpected lesson in the ethic of storytelling. But has something been lost? Fear, after all, has been drained completely away. By letting the pigs out of the story, Wiesner has pushed us out as well. We have no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>empathy,</b> no real worry any more about their fate, or our own, or about good or evil. When bad comes along here, you simply jump out of your story into another one: Click. Evil is therefore unreal. The pigs get away, but the wolf cannot. He exists only in the story. Unlike the pigs, he is trapped. And this is a deprivation. By eschewing an incantatory mode, by not luring children step by step into a transparent world and holding them spellbound as in a dream, this postmodern tale, artful and ingenious, wakes us up, and provides its own useful challenge to understanding. But there is a cost. The risk with the cyber-genre is that, with all its glitz, we lose the pity and terror which Aristotle extolled and Plato feared. Surely we need not make such a sacrifice. Think of Ovid, after all, with his Orpheus, Icarus, Daphne, and Phaeton: he did not write for children, but he proved forever that you can glide from story to story without losing the quiver, the throb, the core. Whatever the achievements of much new work in the field of children’s books—of David Wiesner’s work in particular—I confess that I am still on the lookout for those rare treasures that can make us tremble mightily like Disney’s giddy piglets under their blanket when the wolf is at the door.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} enhance {{understanding}} of the moral reasoning of gifted children. While research has explored the justice moral reasoning of gifted children (Arbuthnot, 1973; Chovan & Freeman, 1993; Gross, 1993; Henderson, Gold, & Clarke, 1984; Howard-Hamilton, 1994), this study explored prosocial moral reasoning, moral reasoning which involves conflict between one&# 146;s own needs and desires and the needs and desires of others. In addition, this study sought to gather empirical evidence for literature claims that gifted children {{have higher levels of}} empathy than their age peers (Lovecky, 1997; Piechowski, 2003; Silverman, 1993 b). The study aimed to investigate the possible relationships among giftedness, prosocial reasoning and empathy. Primary (elementary) school students aged between 9 and 12 years in the Sydney Metropolitan area were administered The Prosocial Reasoning Objective Measure (PROM), The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and The Index of <b>Empathy</b> <b>for</b> Children and Adolescents (IOE) questionnaires. The results for gifted students (n = 176) were compared with a control group of students not identified as gifted (n = 128). The study found that gifted students used more of the highest level of prosocial reasoning in the PROM than their age peers. Furthermore, gifted students used more empathic concern, fantasy empathy and cognitive empathy than their age peers, although ability was not predictive of the other empathy factors in the instruments. Small but significant correlations between some types of empathy and some levels of prosocial reasoning were also found, indicating possible relationships between empathy and prosocial reasoning. Interviews were conducted with selected students (n = 13) from the above sample, along with some of their teachers (n = 5) and parents (n = 2). Despite the small sample, the interviews seemed to indicate a relationship between experience with bullying and prosocial reasoning. The study highlights the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> an <b>empathy</b> questionnaire that specifically tests cognitive and affective empathy in children. A new questionnaire may unravel some of the seemingly contradictory results in the present study. The study also provides empirical evidence that gifted children use higher levels of prosocial moral reasoning and empathy than their age-peers...|$|R

40|$|Feeling {{pain and}} empathizing with another's pain are common human experiences. When observing another person in {{physical}} pain, people's pain sensitivity increases. Physical pain, ostracism and embarrassment are all negative emotional states. The present study seeks to clarify whether enhanced pain sensitivity {{is unique to}} <b>empathy</b> <b>for</b> physical pain or is a general response to <b>empathy</b> <b>for</b> negative affective states by exploring whether <b>empathy</b> <b>for</b> ostracism and <b>empathy</b> <b>for</b> embarrassment temporarily heighten pain sensitivity. After baseline pain testing using thermal scaling, cold pressor, and heat threshold measures, participants watched a series of empathy-inducing vignettes and then underwent the same pain testing. The study did not find <b>empathy</b> <b>for</b> physical pain or embarrassment, but there was some evidence that <b>empathy</b> <b>for</b> ostracism enhanced pain sensitivity. Women reported higher pain ratings and lower pain thresholds than men. Trait empathy correlated positively with pain sensitivity, but this relationship was heavily modulated by sex.

40|$|Some {{theories}} about the positive impact of markets on morality suggest that competition increases empathy, not between competitors, but between them and third parties. However, empathy may be a necessary evolutionary antecedent to guile, which is when someone knows what the other person wants and intentionally deceives him or her, and deception may have evolved {{as a means of}} exploiting empathy. This paper examines how individuals primed <b>for</b> <b>empathy</b> behave towards third parties in a simple economic game of deception. It reports the results of a data entry experiment in an online labor market. Individuals enter data randomized to be a prime <b>for</b> <b>empathy,</b> <b>for</b> guile, or a control. Empathy is then measured using a Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and guile is measured using a simple economic game. Individuals primed <b>for</b> <b>empathy</b> become less deceptive towards third parties. Individuals primed for guile become less likely to perceive that deceiving an individual is unfair in a vignette. These results are robust to a variety of controls and to restricting to workers who entered the prime accurately. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that empathy causes guile and suggests that empathy may cause those who are making judgements to become less deceptive...|$|R
