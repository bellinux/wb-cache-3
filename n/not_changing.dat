5|$|Physical trauma {{including}} tearing, friction or bumping of {{the piercing}} site, which may cause edema and delay healing. The risks can be minimized by wearing properly sized jewellery and <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> it unnecessarily, by not touching the piercing more than required for aftercare, and by being conscious of environmental factors (such as clothing) that may impact the piercing.|$|E
5|$|Risk to {{defensive}} capabilities: Security {{forces are}} <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> armaments annually, and thus small arms manufacturers need civilians as key customers. Crippling of civilian firearms market would likely lead to end of firearms manufacturing in the Czech Republic. At the same time, familiarity with semi-automatic versions of army rifles by civilians {{is a clear}} defensive advantage in case these {{people need to be}} drafted to defend the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many {{claims of}} the {{synthesis}} of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the Soviet Union and the United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and while the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery, this was reevaluated in 1997, giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> the element's name.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E

25|$|The anger {{generated}} by this controversy affects JTS to this day.

This was especially apparent as Schorsch was a strong proponent of <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> the movement's views on homosexuality, while Eisen was a proponent of making such changes. Despite their personal views, each felt it would be improper to overrule the CJLS.|$|E

25|$|Finland {{declared}} {{its independence from}} Russia following the October Revolution, which was followed up with the 1920 Treaty of Tartu, which ceded Petsamo to Finland, thus giving Finland access to the Barents Sea. This resulted in Norway and the Soviet Union no longer having a common border. The planned 1921 review was not carried out. A treaty regarding the border was signed between Finland and Norway on 28 April 1924, replacing the 1826 treaty, but <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> the border line. A review {{was carried out in}} 1925.

25|$|Prominent {{blood vessels}} (telangiectasia) {{over the white}} (sclera) of the eyes usually occur {{by the age of}} 5–8 years, but {{sometimes}} later or not at all. The absence of telangiectasia does not exclude the diagnosis of A-T. Potentially a cosmetic problem, the ocular telangiectasia do not bleed or itch, though they are sometimes misdiagnosed as chronic conjunctivitis. It is their constant nature, <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> with time, weather or emotion, that marks them as different from other visible blood vessels. Telangiectasia can also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin, especially the face and ears. They occur in the bladder as a late complication of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, have been seen deep inside the brain of older people with A-T, and occasionally arise in the liver and lungs.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} (put) moneyness is fixed-strike moneyness, where M=K, and {{the simplest}} call moneyness is fixed-spot moneyness, where M=S. These are {{also known as}} absolute moneyness, and correspond to <b>not</b> <b>changing</b> coordinates, instead using the raw prices as measures of moneyness; the corresponding volatility surface, with coordinates K and T (tenor) is the absolute volatility surface. The simplest non-trivial moneyness is the ratio of these, either S/K or its reciprocal K/S, which {{is known as the}} (spot) simple moneyness, with analogous forward simple moneyness. Conventionally the fixed quantity is in the denominator, while the variable quantity is in the numerator, so S/K for a single option and varying spots, and K/S for different options at a given spot, such as when constructing a volatility surface. A volatility surface using coordinates a non-trivial moneyness M and time to expiry τ is called the relative volatility surface (with respect to the moneyness M).|$|E

25|$|The 2009 mayoral {{election}} in Burlington, Vermont {{provides an example}} in which strategy theoretically could have worked but would have been unlikely in practice. In that election, most supporters of the candidate who came in second (a Republican who led in first choices) preferred the Condorcet winner, a Democrat, to the IRV winner, the Progressive Party nominee. If 371 (12.6%) out of the 2951 backers of the Republican candidate (those who also preferred the Democrat over the Progressive candidate for mayor) had insincerely raised the Democrat from their second choice to their first (<b>not</b> <b>changing</b> their rankings relative to their least favorite candidate, the IRV winner), the Democrat would then advance to the final round (instead of their favorite), defeated any opponent, and have won the IRV election. This {{is an example of}} potential voter regret in that these voters who sincerely ranked their favorite candidate as first, find out after the fact that they caused the election of their least favorite candidate, which can lead to the voting tactic of compromising. Yet because the Republican led in first choices and only narrowly lost the final instant runoff, his backers would have been highly unlikely to pursue such a strategy.|$|E
