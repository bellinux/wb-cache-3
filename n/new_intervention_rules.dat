Singapore’s {{approach is to}} improve firms’ internal safeguard, while Hong Kong’s approach is to require prior authorisation for new unlisted structured investment products by the securities regulator.

This article argues {{that it is difficult to}} review the merit of a financial product in advance and thus it is difficult to have a true gatekeeper for toxic financial products. Before product intervention, we must first identify clear objectives. Regulators have to strengthen the accountability of the reviewer and create concrete review standards if additional ex ante product review is preferred. Regulators may also consider setting up some minimum standards for retail financial products through public debate in order to filter unwanted features from the retail market...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} power control problem in {{wireless}} ad hoc networks with selfish users. Without incentive schemes, selfish users tend to transmit at their maximum power levels, causing significant interference to each other. In this paper, we study {{a class of}} incentive schemes based on intervention to induce selfish users to transmit at desired power levels. An intervention scheme can be implemented by introducing an intervention device that can monitor the power levels of users and then transmit power to cause interference to users. We mainly consider first-order <b>intervention</b> <b>rules</b> based on individual transmit powers. We derive conditions on design parameters and the intervention capability to achieve a desired outcome as a (unique) Nash equilibrium and propose a dynamic adjustment process that the designer can use to guide users and the intervention device to the desired outcome. The effect of using <b>intervention</b> <b>rules</b> based on aggregate receive power is also analyzed. Our results show that with perfect monitoring intervention schemes can be designed to achieve any positive power profile while using interference from the intervention device only as a threat. We also analyze the case of imperfect monitoring and show that a performance loss can occur. Lastly, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance improvement from using <b>intervention</b> <b>rules</b> and compare the performances of different <b>intervention</b> <b>rules.</b> Comment: 33 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many <b>new</b> <b>interventions</b> {{are being}} created to address health {{problems}} of the developing world. However, many developing countries have fragile health systems and {{find it difficult to}} accommodate change. Consequently, it is essential that <b>new</b> <b>interventions</b> are well aligned with health systems and their users. Establishing target product profiles (TPPs) is a critical, early step towards tailoring interventions to suit both of these constituencies. Specific analyses can help identify and establish relevant TPP criteria such as optimal formulation, presentation and packaging. Clinical trials for a <b>new</b> <b>intervention</b> should be designed to address both TPP-specific questions and anticipated use of the intervention in target countries. Examples are provided from research on malaria vaccines that are also applicable to other <b>new</b> public health <b>intervention...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{exchange rate}} dynamics in a managed floating exchange rate regime, under two alternative specifications of private expectations: adaptive expectations and long-run perfect foresight. The whole analysis follows the asset market approach to exchange rate determination. A built-in government reaction function {{is incorporated in}} a neoclassical general equilibrium portfolio balance model. The <b>intervention</b> <b>rule</b> employed, reflects both the "reference rate proposal" of Ethier and Bloomfield (1975) and the 3 rd guideline of the IMF {{for the management of}} floating exchange rates. The government intervenes in the foreign exchange market in order to minimize the discrepancies of the spot exchange rate from the government reference rate (estimate of the long-run exchange rate), at every moment in time. It is shown that the degree of success at which government intervention moderates short-run exchange rate variability depends on the degree of precision with which the government forms its estimate of the long-run exchange rate path. Any prediction errors lead to dynamic instability. A generalisation of the <b>intervention</b> <b>rule</b> leads to a stable long-run equilibrium even if the government uses the wrong estimate of the long-run exchange rate path (competitive exchange rate policies). However, the sustenance of these equilibria creates crises in the balance of payments and the system ultimately returns to the free floating long-run position. Persuance of competitive exchange rate policies increases the degree of reserve use and could lead to intervention at cross purposes, increasing the need for international liquidity. A re-interpretation of our <b>intervention</b> <b>rule</b> to reflect speculative behaviour leads to similar results as government intervention. The liquidation of speculative profits, however, creates additional short-run exchange rate variability, enhancing the non-profit making nature of government intervention...|$|R

Value of information methods have been shown previously to allow optimal design of clinical trials in comparing option (2) against option (1), by trading off the expected value and cost of sample information. However, this previous research has not considered the effect of cost of reversal on expected value of information in comparing these options. This paper demonstrates that, where a <b>new</b> <b>intervention</b> is adopted, the expected value of information is reduced under optimal decision making with costs of reversing decisions. Further, the paper shows that comparing expected net gain of optimally designed trials for option (2) vs (1) conditional on cost of reversal, and (3) vs (1) conditional on opportunity cost of delay allow systematic identification of an optimal decision strategy and trial design.
