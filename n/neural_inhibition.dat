5|$|Midazolam is a short-acting {{benzodiazepine}} {{in adults}} with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours. In the elderly, {{as well as}} young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of midazolam {{as well as its}} active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (↑ frequency of Cl− channel opening) resulting in <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition.</b> Almost all of the properties {{can be explained by the}} actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors.

40|$|Background—Nitric oxide (NO) {{blockade}} by L-nitroarginine {{methyl ester}} (L-NAME) inhibits pancreatic secretion in vivo and aggravates caerulein induced pancreatitis. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) {{is present in}} pancreatic islets, endothelium, and nerve fibres. L-NAME blocks all known NOS isoforms.  Aim—To investigate the source of NO blocked by L-NAME that inhibits amylase secretion.  Methods—Amylase output was measured in rats in response to caerulein (0. 1 - 50 µg/kg) alone or with indazole. Baseline secretion and the response to supramaximal caerulein were also examined after administration of indazole, L-NAME, haemoglobin, or aminoguanidine under continuous blood pressure measurement. In separate experiments, pancreatic secretion was measured after blockade of afferent nerve fibres by either systemic or local capsaicin. The effect of <b>neural</b> NOS <b>inhibition</b> on caerulein induced pancreatitis was also investigated.  Results—L-NAME, haemoglobin, and supramaximal caerulein (10 µg/kg) increased blood pressure, whereas indazole and suboptimal caerulein (0. 1 µg/kg) did not. Indazole and capsaicin decreased basal amylase output. L-NAME and haemoglobin reduced basal amylase output {{to a lesser extent}} and potentiated the inhibitory response to supramaximal caerulein. In contrast, full <b>neural</b> NOS <b>inhibition</b> by L-NAME partially reversed the expected caerulein induced suppression of amylase output. This effect was reproduced by indazole and capsaicin. Indazole did not alter responses to either optimal (0. 25 µg/kg) or suboptimal (0. 1 µg/kg) caerulein, nor, in contrast with L-NAME, aggravate the outcome of caerulein induced pancreatitis.  Conclusions—Reduction of circulating NO availability, probably of endothelial origin, is responsible for the decrease in amylase secretion observed in the early response to L-NAME. Nitrergic neurotransmission {{plays an important role in}} the control of pancreatic secretion and may induce opposite effects to endothelial NOS activity. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{embryonic}} ectodermal {{cells are}} cultured at low density {{in the absence}} of mesodermal cells they undergo neural differentiation (express neural genes), suggesting that neural differentiation is the default fate of ectodermal cells. In explant cultures (which allow direct cell-cell interactions) the same cells differentiate into epidermis. This is due to the action of BMP4 (a TGF-β family protein) that induces ectodermal cultures to differentiate into epidermis. During neural induction, noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm (notochord) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of BMP4.

Levels of GABA were strongly predictive of both intelligence and surround suppression, with higher levels of intelligence associated with higher levels of GABA and stronger surround suppression.

40|$|This thesis investigates sensory {{processing}} in autism spectrum conditions (ASC), specifically {{focusing on}} low-level visual perception. Previous literature indicates that sensory problems are prevalent in ASC, and affect individuals across {{a range of}} modalities and in a variety of ways. Study one of this thesis examines a low-level visual process, orientation discrimination, in neurotypical individuals (n= 94) and demonstrates that orientation discrimination thresholds are lower (enhanced) in those with higher levels of autistic traits compared to those with lower levels of autistic traits. Study two (n= 96) confirms that enhanced orientation discrimination is also present in individuals with an autism spectrum diagnosis, as individuals with an ASC show significantly lower orientation discrimination thresholds than matched control participants. As orientation discrimination is closely linked to <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition,</b> the possibility that disruption in the balance of neural excitation and inhibition (E/I) may be present in those with enhanced orientation discrimination was investigated in studies three and four. Peak gamma frequency, a metric said to capture the balance of neural E/I, was measured in both individuals with higher levels of autistic traits and those with a clinical ASC diagnosis. The results of study three (n= 33) and study four (n= 80) show that visually-induced peak gamma frequency is higher in individuals with higher levels of autistic traits, and those with an ASC diagnosis. This thesis employs both a psychophysical measure and a neural measure which tap into <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition.</b> In the context of previous literature (e. g. Muthukumaswaramy et al., 2009) the results of the research presented in this thesis suggests, in direct contrast to the increased excitation model of ASC (Rubenstein & Merzenich, 2003), that <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition</b> levels may actually be increased in at least some individuals with ASC. ...|$|E

New to this study was the visual Go/NoGo task, which we included to investigate whether enhanced <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition</b> in bilinguals extends from the auditory to the visual modality. Results confirmed our original findings and revealed greater inhibition in bilinguals compared to monolinguals.

Interestingly, during the visual Go/NoGo task, event related brain potentials did not distinguish the two groups, and behavioral responses were similar between the groups regardless of task modality. Thus, only auditory trials that required inhibitory control revealed between-group differences indicative of greater <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition</b> in bilinguals.

40|$|While {{perception}} {{is recognized as}} being atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC), the underlying mechanisms for such atypicality are unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that individuals with ASC will show enhanced orientation discrimination compared with neurotypical observers. This prediction is based both on anecdotal report of superior discriminatory skills in ASC and also on evidence in the auditory domain that some individuals with ASC have superior pitch discrimination. In order to establish whether atypical perception might be mediated by an imbalance in the ratio of neural excitation and inhibition (E:I ratio), we also measured peak gamma frequency, which provides an indication of <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition</b> levels. Using a rigorous thresholding method, we found that orientation discrimination thresholds for obliquely oriented stimuli were significantly lower in participants with ASC. Using EEG to measure the visually induced gamma band response, {{we also found that}} peak gamma frequency was higher in participants with ASC, relative to a well-matched control group.

The findings were then evaluated with special reference to the neurophysiology of pain and implications for the analgesic effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT). Background: LLLT {{is used in the}} treatment of pain, and laser-induced <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition</b> has been proposed as amechanism. To date, no study has systematically evaluated the effects of LI on peripheral nerve, other than those related to nerve repair, despite the fact that experimental studies of LI on nerves have been conducted over the past 25 years. Methods: We searched computerized databases and reference lists for studies of LI effects on animal and human nerves using a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: We identified 44 studies suitable for inclusion. In 13 of 18 human studies, pulsed or continuous wave visible and continuous wave infrared (IR) LI slowed conduction velocity (CV) and/or reduced the amplitude of compound action potentials (CAPs). In 26 animal experiments, IR LI suppressed electrically and noxiously evoked action potentials including pro-inflammatory mediators. Disruption ofmicrotubule arrays and fast axonal flowmay underpin <b>neural</b> <b>inhibition.</b> Conclusions: This review has identified a range of laser-induced inhibitory effects in diverse peripheral nerve models, which may reduce acute pain by direct inhibition of peripheral nociceptors.

Little {{is known about}} the functional integrity of neural circuitry supporting these processes in suicidal behavior in adolescence. Method - Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used in 15 adolescent suicide attempters with a history of major depressive disorder (ATTs), 15 adolescents with a history of depressive disorder but no suicide attempt (NATs), and 14 healthy controls (HCs) during the performance of a well-validated go-no-go response inhibition and motor control task that measures attentional and behavioral control and has been shown to activate prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortical circuitries. Questionnaires assessed symptoms and standardized interviews characterized suicide attempts. Results - A 3 group by 2 condition (go-no-go response inhibition versus go motor control blocks) block-design whole-brain analysis (p <. 05, corrected) showed that NATs showed greater activity than ATTs in the right anterior cingulate gyrus (p =. 008), and that NATs, but not ATTs, showed significantly greater activity than HCs in the left insula (p =. 004) to go-no-go response inhibition blocks. Conclusions - Although ATTs did not show differential patterns of neural activity from HCs during the go-no-go response inhibition blocks, ATTs and NATs showed differential activation of the right anterior cingulate gyrus during response inhibition.
