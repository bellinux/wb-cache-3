40|$|Aim: To {{demonstrate}} that <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> of flat mounted internal limiting membrane specimens clearly delineates cellular proliferations at the vitreomacular interface. Methods: ILM specimens harvested during vitrectomy were fixed in glutaraldehyde 0. 05 % and paraformaldehyde 2 % for 24 h (pH 7. 4). In addition to <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy,</b> immunocytochemistry using antibodies against glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament (NF) was performed. After washing in phosphatebuffered saline 0. 1 M, the specimens were flat-mounted on glass slides without sectioning, embedding {{or any other}} technique of conventional light microscopy. A cover slide and 49, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) medium were added to stain the cell nuclei. Results: <b>Interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> clearly delineates cellular proliferations at the ILM. DAPI stained the cell nuclei. Areas of cellular proliferation can be easily distinguished from ILM areas without cells. Immunocytochemistry can be performed without changing the protocols used in conventional <b>microscopy.</b> Conclusion: <b>Interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> of flat mounted ILM specimens gives {{new insights into the}} distribution of cellular proliferations at the vitreomacular interface and allows for determination of the cell density at the ILM. Given that the entire ILM peeled is seen en face, the techniques described offer a more reliable method to investigate the vitreoretinal interface in terms of cellular distribution compared with conventional microscopy. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{miniature}} digital light projector (pico-DLP), {{a prototype of}} a Structured Illumination Microscope (SIM) has been developed. The pico-DLP is used to project fringes onto a sample and applying the three-step phase shifting algorithm together with the absolute phase retrieval method, the 3 D shape of the object surface is extracted. By using a specific optical system instead of a conventional microscope objective, the device allows 3 D reconstructions of surfaces with both a 10 magnification and a high depth of field obtained thanks to a small numerical aperture of 0. 06 offering an acceptable lateral resolution of 6. 2. An image processing algorithm has been developed to reduce the noise in the acquired images before applying the reconstruction algorithm and so optimize the reconstruction method. Compared with <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> and confocal microscopy that have a shallower depth of field per XY image, the microscope developed achieves a depth of field about 700 and requires no vertical scanning, which greatly reduces the acquisition time. Although the system at this stage {{does not have the}} same resolution performance as <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy,</b> it is nonetheless faster and cheaper. One possible application of this SIM technique would be to first reconstruct in real-time parts of an object before performing higher resolution 3 D measurements with <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy.</b> As with all classical optical instruments, the lateral resolution is limited by diffraction. Work is being carried out with the prototype SIM system to be able to exceed the lateral resolution limits and thus achieve super resolution...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{demonstrates the}} advantages of using a camera with a pixelated polarization mask allowing spatial carrier phase shifting in <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy.</b> An <b>interference</b> microscope in the Michelson and Linnik configurations integrates a camera equipped with a pixelated polarization mask. The camera utilizes polarization to simultaneously capture four phase shifted interferograms. Each set of four phase shifted fringe patterns permits the calculation of fringe contrast and phase {{at a point in}} the vertical scan of a test surface. The use of a short coherence source enables construction of a coarse surface profile by estimating the localization of the peak fringe contrast over the vertical scan. The coarse profile allows unwrapping of the less noisy, though circumstantially ambiguous, phase data. Established phase shifting <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> methods utilize temporal phase shifting techniques. Temporal methods contrast spatial methods by acquiring each set of interferograms necessary for calculating fringe contrast and phase by scanning the test object. The scanning changes the optical path difference between the interferometer arms thus inducing the phase shifts. While both methods scan the test surface, spatial methods acquire all of the information needed to calculate fringe contrast and phase simultaneously while the temporal methods require data from multiple points in the scan. Furthermore, the focus and fringe contrast also change between phase shifts and introduce a small error in temporal methods. However, the largest source of error results from the time taken between capturing the phase shifted frames comprising each set where environmental disturbances such as vibration can change the fringe pattern. The subsequent work shows the practicality of performing <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> with a pixelated polarization mask as well as the technique's relative vibration insensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results on}} the application of <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> and wavelet-analysis for cell visualization and studies of cell dynamics. We demonstrate that interference imaging of erythrocytes can reveal reorganization of the cytoskeleton and inhomogenity {{in the distribution of}} hemoglobin, and that interference imaging of neurons can show intracellular compartmentalization and submembrane structures. We investigate temporal and spatial variations of the refractive index for different cell types: isolated neurons, mast cells and erythrocytes. We show that the refractive dynamical properties differ from cell type to cell type and depend on the cellular compartment. Our results suggest that low frequency variations (0. 1 – 0. 6  Hz) result from plasma membrane processes and that higher frequency variations (20 – 26  Hz) are related to the movement of vesicles. Using double-wavelet analysis, we study the modulation of the 1  Hz rhythm in neurons and reveal its changes under depolarization and hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. We conclude that <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> combined with wavelet analysis is a useful technique for non-invasive cell studies, cell visualization, and investigation of plasma membrane properties...|$|R
