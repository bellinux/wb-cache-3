5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the arctometatarsus first evolved; it was <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the {{earliest}} tyrannosauroids like Dilong, but {{was found in}} the later Appalachiosaurus. This structure also characterized troodontids, ornithomimids and caenagnathids, but its absence in the earliest tyrannosauroids indicates that it was acquired by convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|Overdifferentiation is when phonemic distinctions from one's primary {{language}} are {{imposed on the}} sounds of the second system where they are not required; underdifferentiation of phonemes occurs when two sounds of the second system are not maintained because they are <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the primary system.|$|E

5|$|The Orange Box {{received}} critical acclaim, with Portal {{being recognized}} as a surprise favorite of the package. The PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box was noted for several technical shortcomings that were <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the other versions, {{only a few of}} which were fixed through a single patch.|$|E
5|$|This {{secretion}} process {{occurs in}} {{all types of}} mammalian milk, including human and bovine. However, it is distinct from the lipid secretion mechanism used by all other non-mammary cells. That makes MFGM unique to milk and it is <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> non-dairy food products.|$|E
5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, although they were <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the same layer. Because the tracks were found {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E

5|$|As the MacBook Pro uses a {{different}} hardware platform from earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, {{and does not}} support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features. Rosetta is <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1986, {{the game}} was ported to {{numerous}} platforms with different companies handling the conversions; several home versions were published by Electronic Arts, Tiger Electronics released handheld and tabletop LCD versions of the game, and it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by Rare. The Commodore 64 version had a secret extra level <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> other versions.|$|E

5|$|Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based {{thyroid gland}} extract, most {{commonly}} from pigs. It {{is a combination}} therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{was first}} re-released for the MSX2 system and was {{published}} by Microcabin in Japan in June 1989. It had access to almost {{three times as much}} storage space as the Famicom version but suffered from problems <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> Nintendo's cartridge media, including noticeable loading times. There were also minor graphical upgrades, much-improved music tracks, and sound effects.|$|E
5|$|Fleming made {{a number}} of revelations about Bond's {{character}} within the book, including showing an emotional side that was <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the previous stories. In common with Fleming's other Bond stories, he used the names and places of people he knew or had heard of and Blofeld's research station on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss Mittersill, which the Nazis had turned into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races.|$|E

5|$|For {{implementing}} associative arrays, hash tables, a {{data structure}} that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records; most implementations require only amortized constant time on average. However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, {{as the only}} information given on a failed search is that the target is <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. In addition, all operations possible on a sorted array can be performed—such as finding the smallest and largest key and performing range searches.|$|E
5|$|Forster was <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> Mainz {{during the}} siege. As {{representatives of the}} Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part of}} the French Republic. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and it is probably <b>not</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the liquid state. Techniques like the one {{used to measure the}} extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E
