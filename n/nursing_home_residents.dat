5|$|The role of {{the main}} {{caregiver}} is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects.

Nevertheless, two-thirds of <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>residents</b> have dementias.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the need of assistance with daily oral hygiene measures among <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>resident</b> elderly versus the actual assistance received from the staff. The need of daily oral hygiene assistance was assessed descriptively for <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>resident</b> elderly who participated in an annual oral health screening in three geographical regions in Sweden, in the year 2008. All individuals of age � 65 years were included (n = 22, 453; 6, 327 men; 16, 126 women). The proportion of individuals in need of assistance with daily oral hygiene measures was 77. 5 % (n= 22, 453), whereas the proportion of individuals receiving assistance with daily oral hygiene measures was 6. 9 % in total (n= 22, 453). The proportions were largely similar in all geographical regions. There {{seems to be a}} large discrepancy between the need of assistance with daily oral hygiene measures, and the oral hygiene assistance received, among <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>resident</b> elderly...|$|R

25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>residents</b> must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E
500|$|Kate wrote Mother Millett (2001) {{about her}} mother who in her later years {{developed}} several serious health problems, including a brain tumor and hypercalcaemia. Made aware of her mother's declining health, Millett visited her in Minnesota; their visits included conversations about their relationship and outings to baseball games, museums, and restaurants. When her mother was {{no longer able to}} care for herself in her apartment, she was placed in a nursing home in St. Paul, Minnesota, which was one of Helen Millett's greatest fears. Kate visited her mother and was disturbed by the care she received and her mother's demoralized attitude. <b>Nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>residents</b> who were labeled as [...] "behavioral problems", as Helen was, were subject to forcible restraint.

500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>residents</b> that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately, Elderspeak {{is based}} on {{stereotypes}} and not actual behaviour of elders because it is used in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. Elderspeak is actually offensive but <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>residents</b> are no longer offended by these speech patterns because they have claimed it as a normal habit. [...] The use of elderspeak in more [...] “warmth” [...] and lower in a “superiority” dimension when the speaker was a family member and/or friend compared to an unfamiliar. Generally, young adults use an overstated version of elderspeak when addressing impaired older persons. When older adults converse with older people with cognitive impairments, they make speech accommodations {{to a lesser extent}} than young people. They speak more slowly and incorporate more pauses, however they do not use more repetition as young people do. It is possible that older speakers may not accommodate their speech as much in order to avoid seeming patronizing. Research shows that approximately 80% of communication is non verbal. Elderspeak involves communicating to the older adult in a coddling way, which includes non verbal cues and gestures. An example would be looming over a wheelchair or bed in dominancy, or a pat on the buttocks resembling parent-child touching.|$|E
