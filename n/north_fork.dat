5|$|The United States Geological Survey {{monitored}} {{the flow of}} Little Butte Creek at seven different stream gauges: two on the south fork, three on the <b>north</b> <b>fork,</b> and two on the main stem. The first opened in 1908 at the newly constructed Fish Lake Dam on the <b>north</b> <b>fork,</b> while the last opened in 1927 near the Big Elk Ranger Station on the south fork. By 1989, all seven were closed. The data recorded by the lowermost gauges of both forks and the main stem are listed below.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E

5|$|The faster-moving streams took {{advantage}} of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.|$|E

US-283 splits off to the northwest two miles (3km) after that, and SH-34 continues north, crossing into Beckham County. SH-34 then bridges over the <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of the Red River.

5|$|On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 {{crashed on}} the banks of the Stillaguamish River's <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing {{personnel}} from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered a fire in the fourth after a dutch roll had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made an emergency landing in the riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.|$|E
5|$|On both {{approach}}es, the dropoff is steep {{enough for}} Highway 82 {{to require a}} 6% grade and switchbacks: one on the west and three on the east. The former approach uses the narrow valley of the Roaring Fork River, {{a tributary of the}} Colorado, which rises from Independence Lake west of the pass. Its walls are steeper but shallower than those of the <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> of Lake Creek, which drains into Twin Lakes Reservoir and the headwaters of the Arkansas River, on the east.|$|E
5|$|Since its inception, {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars have been poured into the Auburn Dam project, but no further work has been done since the 1980s.

As of now, massive evidence of the dam's construction still remain in the <b>North</b> <b>Fork</b> American River canyon, specifically the excavations for the abutments and spillway, with the consequences of increased erosion.|$|E
