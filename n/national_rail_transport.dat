40|$|Coal is a {{strategic}} commodity in South Africa {{as it is}} the Primary source of energy in form of electricity and synthetic liquid-fuels. It is also a feedstock in the heavy industries that include steel, cement, aluminium smelters and paper. Its role in socio-economic development spans over 100 years. Therefore, the importance of coal supply chain cannot be overemphasised. The mining industry and the role players comprises the South African government, public and private enterprises. Hence, there is need for collaboration of the three parties in a public-private partnership (PPP) model to enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency. The government role in the legislative environment, issuing of exploration, mining and water licenses among others is crucial for the industry. The state-owned corporations such as Transnet, the only <b>national</b> <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> logistics company and electricity supply company (Eskom), the main electricity generating company and the leading customer/consumer of the South African coal underpins the extent of the state involvement in the industry. The private sector role of ownership of the coal-mines is dominated by the big five international organisations namely BHP Billiton, Anglo Coal, Xstrata/Glencore, Sasol and Exxaro and the black economic empowerment (BEE) companies or junior miners. The electricity and the liquid-fuels types of energy impact on all sectors of the economy. It is this complex relationship by all the role players in the coal-mining industry supply chain that requires enhanced collaboration in a PPP model to harmonise the entire operations in the value-chain. The relationship of the industry players was observed through the mining process, coal transportation to the domestic customers/consumers and export markets. The coal transport logistics infrastructures comprising conveyor belts, rail, road and water were explored and constraints requiring PPP solutions identified...|$|E

40|$|For decades, the <b>rail</b> freight <b>transport</b> {{system in}} Europe {{had been an}} {{aggregation}} of separated national systems due to the long established <b>national</b> regime. <b>Rail</b> <b>transport</b> market was primarily with a domestic focus and organised by closed <b>national</b> monopolies.

30|$|Regarding {{intermodal}} <b>rail</b> <b>transport,</b> the Flemish aid (N 566 / 02) for {{combined transport}} provided {{an annual budget}} of € 3 million for the acquisition of combined transport equipment, transshipment equipment and aid for information systems. The subsidy scheme, which expired end of 2003, covered investment costs of the railway operators with the objective to offer new combined transport operations, i.e. a new route, new types of traffic or a new contract, to expand existing combined transport operations or to maintain the capacity of existing combined transport operations. A new subsidy (N 249 / 04) is specifically designed to <b>national</b> intermodal <b>rail</b> <b>transport.</b> The Belgian government grants {{an annual budget of}} € 30 million to the intermodal operators, which offer transport services within Belgium of minimum 51  km. The subsidy is composed of a fixed part (20 Euros) and a variable part (maximum 0.40 Euros per kilometre). The objective of the aid scheme, which is extended till end 2008 (N 656 / 07), is to help maintain existing rail traffic levels of 300, 000 ITU and to increase rail traffic by 20 % over a period of 3  years.|$|R
30|$|In general, {{primarily}} {{the port of}} Piraeus and the other main ports {{of the country are}} disadvantaged compared with other ports in the wider Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe in several points. These are essentially the lack of intermodal transport, particularly the use of containers. In most modern ports in the transport of containers allows the carriage to be combined with road and <b>rail</b> <b>transport,</b> greatly reducing the time and cost of loading and unloading. More specifically, the major disadvantages [3, 21, 22] relate to the failure to connect to the <b>national</b> <b>rail</b> network (combined <b>transport),</b> the poor management and limited cargo containers, the low availability storage containers at ports and in the region, the relatively limited number of positions of ships, the imbalance in the development of modern port operations and services and the absence of an organized policy of attracting new customers (strong dependence on a few activities and a limited group of customers).|$|R
