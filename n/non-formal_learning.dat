40|$|The {{monograph}} {{presents an}} overview of the system regulating the recognition of <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> in the European Union. <b>Non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> are an important factor in the further development of such a qualification and of the educational system in the European Union. This is demonstrated by current strategic documents, for example the Lisbon Strategy, Memorandum on lifelong learning, Resolution on lifelong learning, etc. This is also part of the Bologna and Copenhagen processes. The success of the development of <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> will be dependent on the level of development of the recognition of <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning.</b> In an effort to establish a uniform system of development in this area, the ministers of education adopted common guidelines for the recognition of prior learning. Despite this desire for homogenized recognition of learning, there is in the European Union a range of different forms of recognition. Thus, the monograph will deal with the response of individual countries to homogenization. We were especially interested in analysing a normative basis for the recognition of prior learning and qualifications in the Slovenian educational system. ...|$|R

50|$|The term {{is often}} conflated, however, with <b>non-formal</b> <b>learning,</b> and self-directed learning.

The conflated meaning of informal and <b>non-formal</b> <b>learning</b> explicates mechanisms of learning that organically occur outside the realm of traditional instructor-led programs, e.g., reading self-selected books, participating in self-study programs, Kitchen Table science, navigating performance support materials and systems, incidental skills practice, receptivity of coaching or mentoring, seeking advice from peers, or participation in communities of practice, to name a few.

Analizuojamas studentų poreikis vertinti ir pripažinti neformaliuoju ir savaiminiu būdu įgytus mokymosi pasiekimus. Diskutuojama apie tai, kad neformaliojo ir savaiminio mokymosi pasiekimų vertinimas ir pripažinimas padeda siekti aukštojo mokslo prieinamumo, individualizuotų studijų, lankstesnės studijų organizavimo tvarkos. Learning is {{a complex}} and multidimensional {{subject-matter}} that exceeds far beyond formal education boundaries. Modern world regards learning as a variety of activities; it regards learning as both activities and roles that change depending on time and situation. Life-long learning widens the concept of teaching and learning, and learning self-management and autonomy are becoming important peculiarities of a person’s activity and identity. Practical employment of life-long learning involves several main aims. First of all, it is a factor of economic growth, and the main incentive {{for the development of}} state, enterprise, and individual competitive ability. Secondly, it is a factor for citizenship promotion: learning is important for social integration, multicultural linkage, and community maintenance. Finally, learning is important for personal development, strengthening of personal value and life quality assurance.

The object of the research is the topicality of validation of <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> achievements.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} European {{policy on}} the validation of <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning,</b> which {{is presented as a}} “salvation narrative” that can improve the functioning of the labour market, provide a way out from unemployment and strengthen the competitiveness of the economy. Taking as our starting point recent findings in adult education theory on the validation of <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning,</b> we aim to prove the thesis that what European validation policy promotes is above all economic purpose and that it establishes a “Credential/Credit-exchange” model of validation of <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning.</b> We proceed to ecxamine the effect of European VNIL policy in selected European countries where validation arrangements are linked to the qualifications framework. We find that the “Credential/ Credit-exchange” validation model was first established in a few individual European countries and then transferred, as a “successful” model, to the level of common European VNIL policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the recognition}} of <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> based on perspectives of critical theory and postmodernism in adult education. In light of contemporary findings {{in the theory of}} adult education, we demonstrate that the theorists and practitioners of the recognition lay too much hope in the philosophy and methodologies which should serve to assess, evaluate, accredit and recognize non-formally and informally acquired knowledge. On this basis, we will highlight the need for re-theorising the »self-evident« assumptions and »positive« effects which {{the recognition of}} <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> has on individuals and society. Having said this, we shall first a) define the concept of recognition; b) present various ideas, models and methods of recognizing non-formally and informally acquired knowledge; c) highlight the results of recent studies on the recognition of non-formal and informal learning; d) justify the need for re-theorising the recognition and demonstrate the possibilities for further development of the idea of recognizing <b>non-formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> in adult education...|$|R

50|$|Formal {{learning}} is education normally delivered by trained teachers {{in a systematic}} intentional way within a school, higher education or university. It {{is one of three}} forms of learning as defined by the OECD, the others being informal learning, which typically takes place naturally as part of some other activity, and <b>non-formal</b> <b>learning,</b> which includes everything else, such as sports instruction provided by non-trained educators without a formal curriculum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Non-formal</b> <b>{{learning}}</b> has {{experiential learning}} activities that foster {{the development of}} skills and knowledge. This helps in building the confidence and abilities among the youth of today. It also helps in development of personal relationships not only among the youth but also among the adults. It helps in developing interpersonal skills among the young people as they learn to interact with peers outside the class and with adults in the community.|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>non-formal</b> <b>learning</b> include {{swimming}} {{sessions for}} toddlers, community-based sports programs, and programs developed by {{organisations such as}} the Boy Scouts or the Girl Guides, community or non-credit adult education courses, sports or fitness programs, professional conferences and continuing professional development.
