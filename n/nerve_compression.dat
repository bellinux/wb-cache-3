40|$|Introduction: Objective of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic values of the Arm Squeeze Test. The test consist in squeezing the middle third of the upper arm. Our hypothesis is that squeezing is responsible for pain only in patients with cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> from C 5 to T 1. Materials and methods: 1567 patients were included in this study. Diagnosis of cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> or shoulder disease was clinically and strumentally formulated beforer performing test. Then, patients were subdivided as follow: 903 with rotator cuff tear, 155 with shoulder adhesive capsulitis 101 with acromioclavicular(AC) joint arthropathy, 55 with calcifying tendonitis, and 48 affected by gleno-humeral arthritis. The study sample included 305 patients with cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> from C 5 to T 1 with pain irradiating to one or both shoulders. 350 healthy volounteers were recruited as controls. The test was positive when score on a VAS Scale was 3 points or higher on squeezing the middle third of the upper arm compared to AC joint and anterolateral-subacromial area. Results: The test was positive in 295 / 305 (96, 7 %) of patients with cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression,</b> compared to 35 / 903 (3, 87 %), 3 / 155 (1, 93 %), 0 / 101 (0 %), 1 / 55 (1. 81 %), 4 / 48 (8, 33 %) of those with rotator cuff tear, adhesive capsulitis, AC arthropaty, calcifying tendonitis and glenohumeral arthritis, respectively. A positive result was obtained in 14 / 350 asymptomatic subjects(4 %). If cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> was compared to shoulder conditions, the test had sensitivity from 0. 97 to 0. 99 and specificity from 0. 93 to 0. 96. Respect to controls, sensitivity was 0. 98 and specificity was 0. 97. Conclusions: The Arm Squeeze Test may be useful to distinguish cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> from shoulder disease in case of doubtful diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: While the Lasègue {{straight}} leg raising test is an established test for lumbar <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression,</b> an established equivalent for cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> is missing. The {{aim of this}} bi-modal study was {{to find the most}} effective way to stretch the cervical nerve roots anatomically in cadavers and to assess its value in the clinical setting. METHODS: Three positional maneuvers of the upper limb were tested on three cadavers to determine the displacement by stretch of the nerve roots C 5, C 6 and C 7. The maneuver which was most efficient in nerve root displacement was applied in 24 patients with confirmed symptomatic cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> (cases) and 65 controls to assess the clinical value of the test. RESULTS: The most efficient way to displace the cervical nerve roots by stretch was to apply dorsal pressure on the humeral head with the shoulder in 80 ° of abduction and 30 ° of extension, with slight elbow flexion while the head is facing the contralateral side. This maneuver produced 4 - 5 mm of nerve root displacement in cadavers. This test aggravated radicular symptoms in 79 % of the patients with cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> and was negative in 98 % of the controls. CONCLUSION: The described abduction extension test with posterior push on the humeral head creates a fulcrum over which the brachial plexus can be displaced to create stress on cervical nerve roots. This simple test is easy to perform clinically and aggravates radicular symptoms in most of the patients with cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> while it is negative in nearly all of the controls...|$|R
25|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} {{is estimated to}} affect one out of ten people during their lifetime and {{is the most common}} <b>nerve</b> <b>compression</b> syndrome. It accounts for about 90% of all <b>nerve</b> <b>compression</b> syndromes. In the U.S., 5% of people have the effects of carpal {{tunnel syndrome}}. Caucasians have the highest risk of CTS compared with other races such as non-white South Africans. Women suffer more from CTS than men with a ratio of 3:1 between the ages of 45–60 years.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{design a}} model that could {{accurately}} predict eventual lumbar disc surgery in the patient initially presenting with clinical findings of <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression.</b>  METHODS—Prospective study in 183 patients with <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> sampled from a primary care population. All patients underwent a standardised history, physical examination, and MRI. Surgery {{carried out in the}} next 6 months was recorded. Models were constructed to predict whether patients eventually received surgery.  RESULTS—Two models were constructed. Reduced model A was based on baseline findings, only, and contained six variables. Model B incorporated change over time as well and contained 10 variables. The area under the curve (in a receiver operating characteristic) for these models was 0. 86 and 0. 92, respectively. It was shown that at a probability cut off of 0. 60, model B predicted eventual surgery with a sensitivity of 57 % and a specificity of 100 %.  CONCLUSIONS—Given the requirement of a high specificity, eventual operation could be adequately predicted in a sample of 183 patients with clinical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression.</b> The application of the model in patients with <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> might lead to earlier operation in a subset of patients resulting in a reduction of duration of illness and associated indirect costs. An important prerequisite for future application would be the validation of the prediction rule in another population. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{hypothesis}} is explored that CRPS I (the "new" RSD) persists due to undiagnosed injured joint afferents, and/or cutaneous neuromas, and/or <b>nerve</b> <b>compressions,</b> and is, therefore, a misdiagnosed form of CRPS II (the "new" causalgia). An IRB-approved, retrospective chart review {{on a series}} of 100 consecutive patients with "RSD" identified 40 upper and 30 lower extremity patients for surgery based upon their history, physical examination, neurosensory testing, and nerve blocks. Based upon decreased pain medication usage and recovery of function, outcome in the upper extremity, at a mean of 27. 9 months follow-up (range of 9 to 81 months), gave results that were excellent in 40 % (16 of 40 patients), good in 40 % (16 of 40 patients) and failure 20 % (8 of 40 patients). In the lower extremity, at a mean of 23. 0 months follow-up (range of 9 to 69 months) the results were excellent in 47 % (14 of 30 patients), good in 33 % (10 of 30 patients) and failure 20 % (6 of 30 patients). It is concluded that most patients referred with a diagnosis of CRPS I have continuing pain input from injured joint or cutaneous afferents, and/or <b>nerve</b> <b>compressions,</b> and, therefore, similar to a patient with CRPS II, they can be treated successfully with an appropriate peripheral nerve surgical strategy. </p...|$|R

Less obvious dangers include <b>nerve</b> <b>compression</b> and resulting damage, circulation problems and fainting, and the recently recognized harness hang syndrome. Harness hang syndrome appears to relate to suspension with the legs below the heart, as in the case when someone is suspended in a standing position, with no weight on their legs.

40|$|As many as 30 % of Americans {{suffer from}} chronic pain. Both {{chemical}} irritation and mechanical compression have {{been implicated in}} nerve root-mediated pain. However, the relative effects of these neural insults on pain symptoms are unclear. In vivo pain models characterize tissue injury, pain symptoms, and the physiologic nociceptive mechanisms relating the two. However, differences in spinal inflammation have not been defined for painful transient cervical <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> injuries. The central hypothesis of this work was that persistent cervical nerve root-mediated pain produced by mechanical injury alone is mediated through different inflammatory pathways than the pain resulting from a combined mechanical and chemical injury. Behavioral hypersensitivity was quantified after <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> with and without a chemical insult to define the relative roles of each of a mechanical compression and chemical irritation in inducing persistent pain. Although spinal glial reactivity has been detected in pain models, {{not all of the}} hallmarks of glial reactivity were described and the relationships between behavioral hypersensitivity and spinal glial reactivity have not been quantified for transient mechanical loading of the cervical nerve root. Accordingly, spinal glial reactivity was temporally assessed after injury using markers of activation and cellular proliferation. Also, inflammatory cytokines in the DRG and spinal cord were quantified temporally after both painful <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> injury types and the spinal cellular source of interleukin- 1 α was identified. Pharmacologic agents were used to selectively block cytokine signaling in order to identify relationships between inflammatory cytokines, behavioral hypersensitivity and spinal glial reactivity in painful nerve root injury. Finally, it remains unknown how the duration of applied compression affects resulting pain symptoms and spinal inflammation. As such, coordinated in situ and in vivo studies were completed to establish relationships between the duration of applied <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression,</b> the mechanical response of the root, and inflammatory outcomes in order to define mechanical responses induced by compression that transduce nociceptive signals and mediate pain. Collectively, studies establish relationships between <b>nerve</b> root <b>compression</b> and chemical irritation, pain symptoms, and spinal inflammation, and lay a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of nerve root injury that lead to persistent pain. ...|$|R

2500|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the sciatic nerve is compressed or pinched by the piriformis muscle of the hip. [...] It usually only affects one hip at a given time, though both hips may produce piriformis syndrome {{at some point in}} the patient's lifetime, and having had it once greatly increases the chance that it will recur in one hip or the other at some future point unless action is taken to prevent this. Indications include sciatica (radiating pain in the buttock, posterior thigh and lower leg) and the physical exam finding of tenderness in the area of the sciatic notch. If the piriformis muscle can be located beneath the other gluteal muscles, it will feel noticeably cord-like and will be painful to compress or massage.
