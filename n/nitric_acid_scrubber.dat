40|$|Since 1963, the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory {{has been}} using {{fluidized-bed}} technology to convert high-level radioactive liquid waste into a granular solid for interim storage before eventual long-term storage. The calcining process uses kerosene, oxygen, air and a cooling jacket to maintain {{the temperature of the}} fluidized bed at approximately 400 C. The solids are moved to storage bins and the combustion gases and fine particles are swept from the bed to an atmospheric protection system. This atmospheric protection system includes a cyclone to collect larger particles; a <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>scrubber</b> to cool gases and collect small particles; a condenser to reduce water content; silica gel beds to adsorb volatile ruthenium, water, and hydrocarbons; and a series of high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to collect minute particles. The calcination process solidifies waste solutions containing molar levels of acid, nitrate, fluoride, zirconium, aluminum, iron, boron, and cadmium; minor levels (< 0. 1 %) of various fission products and organics; and trace levels (< 50 ppm) of chloride and sulfate. Because the process burns kerosene in the presence of other organics and chloride salts; the calciner was considered a potential production source of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD). Therefore, it was necessary to determine if PCDD were being released from the calcination process. Because a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and PCDD standards were not available, a screening procedure using two gas chromatographs with electron capture detectors and no PCDD calibration standards was developed...|$|E
25|$|<b>Acid</b> gas <b>scrubbers</b> {{are used}} to remove {{hydrochloric}} <b>acid,</b> <b>nitric</b> <b>acid,</b> hydrofluoric acid, mercury, lead and other heavy metals. The efficiency of removal {{will depend on the}} specific equipment, the chemical composition of the waste, the design of the plant, the chemistry of reagents, and the ability of engineers to optimize these conditions, which may conflict for different pollutants. For example, mercury removal by wet scrubbers is considered coincidental and may be less than 50%. Basic scrubbers remove sulfur dioxide, forming gypsum by reaction with lime.|$|R

Because of growing suburbanization, odor removal is increasingly considered important as well. In this review, we report the results of the on-farm research on full-scale operated scrubbers for treatment of exhaust air from animal houses with regard to NH 3 and odor removal in The Netherlands. The NH 3 removal of <b>acid</b> <b>scrubbers</b> ranged from 40 % to 100 % with an overall average of 96 %. The NH 3 removal of biotrickling filters ranged from - 8 % to + 100 % with an overall average of 70 %. Minimum empty bed air residence times (EBRTs) were 0. 4 to 1. 1 s. For <b>acid</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> process control with pH measurement and automatic water discharge is sufficient to guarantee sufficient NH 3 removal. For biotrickling filters, however, improvement of process control is necessary to guarantee sufficient NH 3 removal. The odor removal of <b>acid</b> <b>scrubbers</b> ranged from 3 % to 51 % with an overall average of 27 %. The odor removal of biotrickling filters ranged from - 29 % to + 87 % with an overall average of 51 %. Minimum EBRTs were 0. 5 to 2. 3 s.

25|$|Dilute <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> may be {{concentrated}} by distillation up to 68% acid, {{which is a}} maximum boiling azeotrope containing 32% water. In the laboratory, further concentration involves distillation with either sulfuric acid or magnesium nitrate which act as dehydrating agents. Such distillations must be done with all-glass apparatus at reduced pressure, to prevent decomposition of the acid. Industrially, highly concentrated <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> is produced by dissolving additional nitrogen dioxide in 68% <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> in an absorption tower. Dissolved nitrogen oxides are either stripped {{in the case of}} white fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid,</b> or remain in solution to form red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid.</b> More recently, electrochemical means have been developed to produce anhydrous <b>acid</b> from concentrated <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> feedstock.|$|R

Anhydrous <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> is a colorless mobile liquid with a density of 1.512g/cm3, which solidifies at −42°C to form white crystals.
