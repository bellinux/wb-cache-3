25|$|Proteus insinuates {{that he will}} rape her ("I'll force thee {{yield to}} my desire"), but at this point, Valentine {{intervenes}} and denounces Proteus. Horrified at what has happened, Proteus vows that the hate Valentine feels for him is <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hate he feels for himself. Convinced that Proteus' repentance is genuine, Valentine forgives him and seems to offer Silvia to him. At this point, overwhelmed, Julia faints, revealing her true identity. Upon seeing her, Proteus suddenly remembers his love for her and vows fidelity to her once again. The Duke and Thurio are brought as prisoners by the outlaws. Seeing Silvia, Thurio claims her as his, but Valentine warns Thurio that if he makes one move toward her, he will kill him. Terrified, Thurio renounces Silvia. The Duke, disgusted with Thurio's cowardice and impressed by Valentine's actions, approves his and Silvia's love, and consents to their marriage. The two couples are happily united, and the Duke pardons the outlaws, telling them they may return to Milan.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E

It {{was inspired by}} Titian's painting Miracle of the Jealous Husband which Nielsen had seen on his honeymoon in Italy in 1891. On one of the copies, he wrote: [...] "To my own Marie!

500|$|Music halls, {{where both}} Nan and Kitty are employed—and put on display—as male impersonators, allow {{about half the}} novel's action and {{commentary}} on gender to take place, according to scholar Cheryl Wilson. When Nan puts on trousers {{for the first time}} to perform as Kitty's partner and realises the impact of their double act together, she states, [...] "whatever successes I might achieve as a girl, they would be <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> triumphs I should enjoy clad, however girlishly, as a boy". Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel, and some performers are quite popular. Only certain types of depictions of men, however, were acceptable in reality. Nan and Kitty pretend to be London [...] "swells": gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts. Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions, as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class, and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh at themselves. Mashers such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity.|$|E
500|$|On {{the balance}} between {{creating}} new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics {{in a way that}} works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan. On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, [...] "We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it." [...] About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> films or even series like Game of Thrones. He explained that the series does attempt to create [...] "Marvel moments" [...] as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments—something that works really well on television—so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale. Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so [...] "If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we {{want to be in the}} car with the character having that experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{technique}} of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which {{were sold to}} the general public was extremely effective. A good example was The physical basis of life, a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme— that vital action is nothing more than [...] "the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it"— shocked the audience, though that was <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uproar when it was published in the Fortnightly Review for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said [...] "No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation". The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word; Punch added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1972, Gaudron {{had entered}} a {{bar with a}} male {{barrister}} friend when the waitress informed the friend that the bar did not serve women. Gaudron [...] "patiently explained to the barmaid that my friend didn't want a woman because he'd brought his own," [...] eventually creating [...] "something of a scene" [...] which {{attracted the attention of}} Labor politician Clyde Cameron, who said that he didn't realise such sexual discrimination still existed. Gaudron said that [...] "the discrimination being practised in that particular hotel was <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discrimination over which he would undoubtedly preside when he became Minister for Industrial Relations after the next election." [...] However, the Whitlam government was elected on 2 December, and Cameron duly became Minister for Industrial Relations. Whitlam called Gaudron on 3 December to hire her to argue the case.|$|E

2500|$|However, while {{comparing}} the Israel Lobby with the Arab Lobby, Mitchell Bard notes that [...] "From the beginning, the Arab lobby has faced {{not only a}} disadvantage in electoral politics but also in organization. There are several politically oriented groups, {{but many of these}} are one man operations with little financial or popular support." [...] The Arab American Institute is involved in supporting Arab-American political candidates, but, according to award-winning journalist Ray Hanania [...] "it’s <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> funds that AIPAC raises not just for Jewish American congressmen, but for congressmen who support Israel." [...] Furthermore, Arab American lobbies face a problem of motivation; Jewish Americans feel the need to support their homeland (as well as other states in the Middle East who have signed peace treaties with Israel) in active, organized ways. Arab Americans do not appear to have a similar motivation {{when it comes to their}} own homelands.|$|E

What she does not know is that the issues between Mark and his father are <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> issues between Mark's father and Tricia, his daughter-in-law." [...] Indeed, Tricia was extremely pensive about the reunion, even more so when Frank was taken ill and admitted to the hospital. Sharon Maughan expanded on the storyline: [...] "Tricia's horrified when Lisa tells her that Frank had a suspected stroke in the night and was rambling on about Chrissie being his daughter. At first, Tricia claims that Frank doesn't know what he is talking about because he is ill. But later, when Lisa finds her crying, she breaks down and reveals that Frank raped her when she was a teenager, during the time she was married to Mark." [...] Tricia had Frank take a secret paternity test, confirming that he was indeed Chrissie's biological father. [...] As his condition deteriorated, she lied, claiming that he had expressed an instruction that he did not wish to be resuscitated. Frank died, and Tricia hoped that Chrissie's true paternity could remain a secret.|$|E
