5|$|The {{demands of}} combat during World War II led {{to changes in}} the {{composition}} of Army units. The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units, and these began to be raised in 1941. These units were not suitable for jungle warfare, however, and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944. Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles. This organisation proved only moderately successful, and the divisions were strengthened for their 1944–45 campaigns. The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities in August 1945 and was finally completed on 15 February 1947. A total of 730,000 personnel enlisted in the Australian Army during the war, a figure which represented around 10 percent of the population. Nearly 400,000 men ultimately served overseas, with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas.

The almost constant rain and fetid jungle conditions resulted in increasing numbers of <b>non-battle</b> <b>casualties</b> and as the battalion's numbers dwindled, in early January 1943 it was relieved by the 2/9th Battalion and moved back to Port Moresby by air, concentrating around Donedabu with a strength of just 17 officers and 302 other ranks. A period of training and rebuilding was undertaken to prepare the battalion to return to the front, but in early March, they were ordered to Australia. Sailing upon the transport Duntroon, they disembarked in Cairns and after a period of leave concentrated on the Atherton Tablelands {{with the rest of the}} 30th Brigade, which now consisted of the 39th and 3rd/22nd Infantry Battalions. At this time, the government decided that the 30th Brigade would be converted to an all-AIF unit, and to conduct a period of intense training before sending it back to New Guinea. As a result, many of the 49th Battalion's Militia personnel were transferred to the 36th Battalion in late May, reducing the 49th to a cadre staff of just over 160 AIF personnel. Throughout June, the 49th Battalion took part in brigade exercises, but early the following month the decision was made that the 30th Brigade would be disbanded and used to reinforce the 6th Division, with reinforcements being sent specifically to the 16th and 19th Brigades. Consequently, the 49th Battalion was disbanded on 3 July 1943 and its remaining personnel were transferred to the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, with whom they went on to see further action, fighting in the Aitape–Wewak campaign with the 6th Division late in the war.|$|R

2500|$|Casualties {{amongst the}} Australians between 22 July and 16 November 1942 were 39 {{officers}} and 586 men killed and a further 64 officers and 991 men wounded, {{for a total}} of 625 killed and 1,055 wounded. [...] Notably, three battalion commanders were killed or captured in the first month of fighting. <b>Non-battle,</b> or sickness, <b>casualties</b> are not accurately recorded but are stated to have been about two to three times the battle casualty figure. The exact number of Japanese casualties is not known, although Williams estimates battle casualties at 2,050 between the initial fighting around Awala and the final battle at Oivi–Gorari. Non battle casualties, however, increase this figure and it is estimated that of the 6,000 troops, or five infantry battalions, that were committed to the fighting, up to 75% became casualties, being either killed, wounded or becoming ill.|$|R
