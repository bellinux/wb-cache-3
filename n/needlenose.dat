5000|$|As a {{reasonably}} popular aquarium fish Xenentodon cancila, has been traded under {{a variety of}} common names, including needlefish, silver needlefish, Asian freshwater needlefish, <b>needlenose</b> halfbeak, freshwater gar, <b>needlenose</b> gar and numerous others. While belonging to the same family as the marine needlefish known in Europe as gar or garpike, Belone belone, these fish are much more distantly related to other fishes sometimes called gars (such as the North American gars and South American pike characins). In Assam it is locally known as Kokila. It is known as [...] "Yonna (යොන්නා) or Habarali (හබරලි)" [...] in Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|The {{longnose gar}} (Lepisosteus osseus) is a {{primitive}} ray-finned fish of the gar family. It {{is also known}} as the <b>needlenose</b> gar. L. osseus is found along the east coast of North and Central America in freshwater lakes and as far west as Kansas and Texas and southern New Mexico. The gar have been present in North America for about 100 million years.|$|E
50|$|Caridina gracilirostris is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} shrimp in the family Atyidae. It has a wide native range extending from Japan and Fiji through Indonesia to Madagascar. It is an algae-eating species that lives in mangroves and marshes. It is often kept as a pet in freshwater aquariums due to its unique red rostrum, which gives it an unusual appearance. Its common names include red front shrimp, red rhinoceros shrimp, red nosed phantom shrimp, and <b>needlenose</b> caridina.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the road}} trip to Hackensack, Chucky and Tiffany kill anyone who stands in Jessie's and Jade's way, (therefore their way) {{including}} Jade's uncle {{who comes to}} leave a bag of marijuana for <b>Needlenose</b> to find and arrest Jesse for, and <b>Needlenose</b> who pulls Jesse and Jade over, finds the bag, and intends to arrest Jesse thus stopping the trip to Hackensack to Chucky's amulet. Jesse and Jade are soon on the run when they are informed by David {{that the police are}} pinning the murders of Bailey and Damian on them while also comparing Jesse and Jade to [...] "Bonnie and Clyde" [...] and [...] "Mickey and Mallory" [...] from Natural Born Killers, both a couple who were coincidentally mass murderers themselves (or multiple murderers, as David puts it, as [...] "Mass murderers do it all at once."). Jesse and Jade are completely unaware that Chucky and Tiffany are not only alive, but the real culprits behind the murders and Warren's disappearance (as it is not known yet that he was murdered as well) and begin to gradually suspect each other, both too horrified and in love to leave the other and sell the other out to the cops.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{across the}} Atlantic in the UK's {{exclusive}} Transformers title, the Decepticon Double Targetmasters {{became a part}} of the new Mayhem Attack Squad, charged with hunting down and killing the renegade Decepticons, Catilla and Carnivac. The cowardly <b>Needlenose</b> was given leeway by Spinister and allowed onto the mission, but after the successful murder of Catilla, his nervousness consumed him. Fearing retribution from Carnivac, he subjected his fellow troops to unregistered timing exercises, earning him nothing but their ire and a lack of credibility - something that came back to haunt him when he was attacked and killed by a vengeful Carnivac, and his fellow Decepticons refused to heed his calls for help.|$|E
50|$|Nathan Edward (Ned) Rhyerson (aka <b>Needlenose</b> Ned) (Jed Rees) {{was born}} on February 2, 1972 in Glendale, CA. He is {{unmarried}} and has no criminal record. He leads Burbank police on a 20-mile high speed car chase before crashing his car into the Burbank Buy More {{as part of a}} complex Fulcrum plot to determine the whereabouts of Bryce and the Intersect, as well as to determine who Sarah and Casey were protecting at the Buy More. He pretends to be a frightened and confused amateur criminal, though he was later revealed to be much more capable than he initially let on. Rhyerson is neutralized when Morgan, Big Mike, and Captain Awesome use a pneumatic snow flocking machine to disorient and disarm him.|$|E
50|$|The Autobot Double Targetmasters' {{roles were}} brief ones - {{they were seen}} {{participating}} in a raid on Cybertron led by Jazz, Grimlock and Bumblebee. The three also served as Emirate Xaaron's support crew when Galvatron (acting as Unicron's herald) attacked. The Decepticons, on the other hand, played more prominent parts as troops {{under the command of}} Thunderwing who served him during his quest for the lost Creation Matrix - Spinister, in particular, came to doubt Thunderwing's sanity as his commands became more and more unhinged. <b>Needlenose,</b> though seen often during the Matrix Quest, seems to be unnerved by Thunderwing's later erratic behavior, but not to the point of complaining. Quake, in turn, is noted for his durability, having taken fatal damage from Unicron during the Chaos-Bringer's attack on Cybertron and lived to tell the tale.|$|E
5000|$|After being {{awakened by}} the theme music from Star Wars, the station and shuttle crews got to work {{preparing}} for the mission's fourth EVA. The spacewalk began at 10:03 UTC. After translating out to the robotic arm, Parazynski attached himself to the adjustable portable foot restraint (APFR), and {{was taken to the}} solar array worksite. Working slowly, with direction from Wheelock and the ground team, Parazynski secured the five cufflinks to the array, and then backed away to observe the deploy action. Inside the station, the crew deployed the array a half a [...] "bay" [...] at a time, and the array was fully deployed at 15:23 UTC. After performing additional inspections of both the 2B, and 4B arrays, Parazynski and Wheelock finished the EVA at 17:22 UTC. With the mission's final spacewalk completed, Parazynski has completed seven EVAs, for a total time of 47 hours, 05 minutes, placing him 5th overall for total EVA duration. Wheelock completed three EVAs, for a total time of 20 hours, 41 minutes, and the total EVA time for STS-120 was 27 hours, 14 minutes. During the EVA, a pair of <b>needlenose</b> pliers floated free of the equipment, and was observed floating nearby the window by the crew inside the station. The tool floated clear of the station, and was not a hazard.|$|E
40|$|EVA objectives, procedures, and {{equipment}} for the Shuttle are reviewed. The EVA will occur as a planned excursion, to complete a mission objective, or on a contingency basis as support for the mission or to effect repairs to the Orbiter or its payload. Configurations for {{the placement of the}} airlock for EVA with and without Spacelab payloads are discussed, along with the various EVA tasks which could be expected as necessary for mission completion. Handholds have been placed in strategic positions on the RMS and along the payload doors, and a safety tether has been incorporated with line extension out to 25 ft. Off-the-shelf tools such as <b>needlenose</b> pliers, forceps, diagonal cutters, etc. are carried as standard {{equipment for the}} repair of malfunctioning equipment and doorlatches. Finally, attention is given to EVA lighting, communication, life-support, and work station restraint systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —The jaw {{morphology}} of needlefishes (Beloniformes: Belonidae) {{passes through}} dis-tinctive ontogenetic stages. When hatched, larvae have short jaws of equal length. The lower jaw first elongates {{to produce a}} "halfbeak " form, then the upper jaw elongates to produce the adult "needlenose " morphology. Onset and duration of the halfbeak stage vary among belonid species. We tested the hypothesis that heterochronic evolution produced this diversity in jaw morphology. First, a cladogram was developed for 27 belonid species. Ontogenetic trajectories for upper and lower jaw elongation were determined for 18 of these species. For upper and lower jaw elongation, trajectories of these 18 species were statistically compared to determine character transitions, which were then mapped onto the cladogram. The {{results showed that the}} growth trajectories of upper and lower jaws changed independently of each other, and that neoteny and acceleration occurred repeatedly during belonid evolution. Evidence suggests post-displacement and predisplacement were also important mechanisms. The resulting morpholog-ical diversity may be interpreted as adaptations to food availability, because jaw morphology (halfbeak vs. <b>needlenose)</b> seems to be correlated with feeding modes (planktivory vs. piscivory).
