25|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is unique and complex. The drug works by damaging bacterial DNA, since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is {{made possible by the}} rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (<b>nitrofuran</b> reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad {{mechanism of}} action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{pre-treatment}} of a commercially available carbon-nanofibre screen-printed electrode (CNF-SPE) using a single one-step process was evaluated and {{applied for the}} analytical determination of <b>nitrofurans.</b> The optimal pre-treatment conditions were found to include a soaking process in Britton–Robinson buffer / Dimethylformamide (DMF) 70 / 30 % solution for 15 min of activation time. Voltammetric curves were obtained for several biologically significant <b>nitrofurans</b> (furazolidone, nitrofurazone and nitrofurantoin) using the activated CNF-SPE, and a considerable increase in the peak current was observed. According to the chronoamperometric results, the calculated active area for a CNF-SPE activated with the pre-treatment was increased approximately 19 times compared to the active area of a non-activated electrode. Changes in the morphology of the electrode active area were observed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images after the activation pre-treatment. The carbon nanofibre surfaces became rougher and this increase in roughness was directly related to an enlargement of the electroactive area, with a corresponding increase in the active-site availability for the nitro compounds.
