5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and {{equal protection of}} the law, though <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Kripik {{pulls his}} hand {{free of the}} single manacle used to chain him down, but mangles his hand while doing so. Kripik flees the post with his team of sled dogs, heading for his family's old village. Hunt and Balk pursue him. The rifle Kripik steals proves useless when the bullets are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> gauge. Kripik is forced to kill his sled dogs one by one for food. In a driving blizzard, Kripik falls short of {{reaching}} his family, and is attacked and injured by a wolf (which he manages to kill). Kripik is found by his eldest son Orsodikok (now a teenager), rescued, and fed by his family.|$|E
5|$|In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, Ahalya is {{depicted}} as a romantic adulteress. When Brahma creates Ahalya as the most beautiful being, she {{falls in love with}} Indra and longs for him, but Brahma grants her to Gautama. After Ahalya's marriage, Indra too craves for her. He frequently visits her and flirts with her in Gautama's absence. At one point, Ahalya receives a visit from Indra's female messenger, who proceeds to mock husbands who avoid sex by saying that it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> day for pleasure. Ahalya protests, maintaining that she imagines Gautama to be Indra as they have sex and that a woman should be a stone, forgoing all thought of sexual gratification. That night, when Ahalya longs for conjugal bliss, Gautama refuses her, saying that she is not in her fertile period. Agitated, she wishes that Indra was there to satisfy her. Indra perceives her wish and comes in Gautama's disguise, but is revealed by his seductive speech. Ignoring the deception, Ahalya joyously makes love to him.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, {{some states}} were more {{favorable}} to women's legal status than others; New York, for example, had been giving women full property, parental, and widow's rights since 1860, but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote. No state or territory allowed women's suffrage when the Equal Protection Clause took effect in 1868. In contrast, African American men had full voting rights in five states, at that time.|$|E

25|$|Macau did {{not develop}} {{as a major}} {{settlement}} until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century. In 1513, Jorge Álvares became the first Portuguese to land in China. In 1535, Portuguese traders obtained the rights to anchor ships in Macau's harbours and to carry out trading activities, though <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to stay onshore. Around 1552–1553, they obtained temporary permission to erect storage sheds onshore, in order to dry out goods drenched by sea water; they soon built rudimentary stone houses around the area now called Nam Van.|$|E
25|$|Those {{witnesses}} and other witnesses from the Forensic Science Service told the Court of Appeal {{that this was}} <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> conclusion to draw from {{the discovery of the}} particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the jury would have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.|$|E
25|$|At the end {{of season}} one, James Read made Michael Gleason {{aware that he was}} unhappy with the {{direction}} of his character. Gleason released him from the series and also let Janet DeMay go, thinking that the detective/investigator and secretary characters could be combined into one character. Gleason originally wrote the replacement character, Mildred Krebs, as an attractive 35-year-old woman who was a rival for Steele's affections. Doris Roberts, an established character actress who had recently won an Emmy for a guest role on St. Elsewhere, asked to read for the part. Although Roberts was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> age for the character Gleason originally conceived, she won him over with her audition. Gleason then changed the character of Mildred Krebs to reflect the casting.|$|E

25|$|Rumsfeld {{resigned}} from Congress in 1969– his fourth term– to serve President Richard Nixon in his administration, {{and he would}} serve {{in a variety of}} executive branch positions throughout the Nixon presidency. In 1969, Nixon sought to reform and reorganize the United States Office of Economic Opportunity, an organization created during the Kennedy administration and greatly expanded as a part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs, rather than eliminate it outright. He appointed Rumsfeld Director of the organization with Cabinet rank. Rumsfeld had voted against the creation of OEO when he was in Congress, and initially rejected Nixon's offer, citing his own inherent belief that the OEO did more harm than good, and he felt that he was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> person for the job. He only accepted after personal pleas from the president.|$|E
25|$|Workers {{in federal}} {{agencies}} had formed craft-based unions {{on the local}} level beginning in the early 1880s. The growing power of these and other unions in the federal government led President Theodore Roosevelt to issue two Executive Orders (in 1902 and 1906) essentially banning unions in the federal civil service. Under Congressional pressure, President William H. Taft made the Executive Orders less onerous in 1912. Unhappy with Taft's refusal to rescind the orders entirely, Congress passed the Lloyd-La Follette Act (§6, 37 Stat. 555, 5 U.S.C. § 7511) on August 24, 1912, declaring establishing the right of federal employees to join unions (albeit <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> for them to bargain collectively). Five years later, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) acted to bring the various local unions together to form a single national union, the National Federation of Federal Employees, in September 1917.|$|E
25|$|In a {{press conference}} November 5, 2006, Chen rebutted the charges against his wife and members of his Presidential office. He said that Taiwan {{government}} offices advised him to prepare the receipts in such a fashion, and that {{after six years of}} doing so, it is strange that they would never mention an irregularity if it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way to do it. He promised that all of the money actually went to diplomatic missions and did not go into any private pockets. Furthermore, he mentioned that when he took office, he thought his salary was so excessive that he cut his own salary in half, and that reduction is more than the amount he is accused of embezzling, so {{there is no need for}} him to take that money. In addition, he said that if the charges against his wife were proven in a court of law just as they were charged, then he would at that time step down as President of the Republic of China.|$|E

25|$|As of 2010 {{approximately}} 5% of {{the population}} of Macau self-identifies as Christian, predominantly Catholic. Catholic missionaries were the first to arrive in Macau. In 1535, Portuguese traders obtained the rights to anchor ships in Macau's harbours and to carry out trading activities, though <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to stay onshore. Around 1552–1553, they obtained temporary permission to erect storage sheds onshore, in order to dry out goods drenched by sea water; they soon built rudimentary stone houses around the area now called Nam Van. In 1576, Pope Gregory XIII established the Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau. In 1583, the Portuguese in Macau were permitted to form a Senate to handle various issues concerning their social and economic affairs under strict supervision of the Chinese authority, but there was no transfer of sovereignty. Macau prospered as a port but was the target of repeated failed attempts by the Dutch to conquer it in the 17th century. Cai Gao was the first mainland Chinese convert of the 19th-century Protestant missions. He was baptized by Robert Morrison at Macau in 1814.|$|E
25|$|Let's Plays {{can also}} be seen harming a game's {{distribution}} particularly for short, linear, narrative-driven games, since viewers can witness the entire game from a Let's Play recording without purchasing it and have no incentive to purchase the title. For the art game That Dragon, Cancer, its developer Ryan Green noted that while there were Let's Plays of the game, several which commented emotionally on the game's topic, some of these playthroughs had simply played through the game without added commentary, and provided no links to where players could learn more about the title. Green and his team at Numinous Games had used YouTube's ContentID to have some of these videos taken down, a result that brought some complaints and which Green admitted later was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> approach to address the issue. Green requested that with games such as That Dragon, Cancer, that those creating Let's Play use the playthrough of the game to initiation conversations with their viewers, and that viewers could show their appreciation of the game by tipping the developers in lieu of purchasing the full title.|$|E
25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she came to the house after the funeral, she turned her head to the left, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced wedding cake to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E
