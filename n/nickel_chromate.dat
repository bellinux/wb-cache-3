50|$|<b>Nickel</b> <b>chromate</b> is dark in colour, {{unlike most}} other chromates which are yellow.|$|E
50|$|When heated {{at lower}} oxygen {{pressure}} around 600°C, <b>nickel</b> <b>chromate</b> decomposes to the nickel chromite spinel, nickel oxide and oxygen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nickel</b> <b>chromates</b> {{can also}} {{crystallize}} with ligands Ni(1,10-phenanthroline)CrO4•3H2O•H2O which forms triclinic olive coloured crystals, and orange crystals of Ni(1,10-phenanthroline)3Cr2O7•3H2O and yellow powdered Ni(1,10-phenanthroline)3Cr2O7•8H2O.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nickel</b> (II) <b>Chromate</b> (NiCrO4) is an acid-soluble compound, red-brown in color, {{with high}} {{tolerances}} for heat. It and the ions that compose {{it have been}} linked to tumor formation and gene mutation, particularly to wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Many contact sensitizers or {{irritants}} {{are known}} to cause contact dermatitis superimposed on nummular dermatitis. Studies have implicated <b>nickel,</b> cobalt, <b>chromate,</b> and fragrance as likely culprits. Xerosis, or dehydration of skin is also a likely cause. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria or Candida may also play a role.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of <b>nickel</b> <b>chromate</b> {{is the same}} as for chromium vanadate, CrVO4. Crystals have an orthorhombic structure with unit cell sizes a=5.482 Å, b=8.237 Å, c=6.147 Å. The cell volume is 277.6 Å3 with four formula per unit cell.|$|E
50|$|The {{infrared}} spectrum of <b>nickel</b> <b>chromate</b> show {{two sets of}} absorption bands. The first includes lines at 925, 825, and 800 cm−1 due to Cr-O stretching, and the second has lines at 430, 395, 365 (very weak) due to Cr-O rock and bend and 310 cm−1 produced from Ni-O stretching.|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{reduction}} of nickel ions in dilute solution using a divided GBC-cell {{is of interest}} for purification of waste waters. A typical solution to be treated is the effluent from steel etching processes which contain low quantities of <b>nickel,</b> <b>chromate</b> and chromium ions. Reduction of chromate in a divided GBC-cell results in effluent containing Cr 3 + ions. This paper examines the limitations to further treatment of the effluent by electrochemical {{reduction of}} nickel ions. Nickel current efficiency has been determined by varying temperature, pH, current density and concentration of supporting electrolyte. It {{was found that the}} presence of a complexing agent, e. g. NH 4 + is necessary. To deposit nickel, complete removal of Cr 3 + ions from the solution is inevitable. Optimum nickel current efficiencies are obtained at pH 5 and current density 10 mA cm– 2...|$|E
50|$|Nickel perchlorate, Ni(ClO4)2•6H2O, <b>nickel</b> chlorate, Ni(ClO3)2•6H2Onickel <b>chromate</b> (NiCrO4), <b>nickel</b> {{chromite}} (NiCr2O4), nickel(II) titanate, nickel bromate Ni(BrO3)2•6H2O nickel iodate (Ni(IO3)2•4H2O), {{nickel stannate}} (NiSnO3•2H2O) {{are some other}} oxy-salts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nickel</b> (II) <b>Chromate</b> can {{be formed}} in the lab by heating a mixture of chromium(III) oxide and nickel oxide at between 700 °C and 800°C under 1000 atmosphere's {{pressure}} of oxygen. It can be produced at 535°C and 7.3 bar oxygen,, but the reaction takes days to complete. If the pressure is too low or temperature too high but above 660° then the nickel chromium spinel NiCr2O4 forms instead.|$|R
40|$|There {{are limited}} {{reports of the}} {{prevalence}} of positive reactions in healthy adults to patch tests with standard allergens; there are no recent comprehensive studies from Australia. Healthy adult volunteers (n = 219) from the Western Australian community were patch tested using the European standard series of allergens. Seventy-seven (35 %) reacted {{to at least one}} allergen, positive patch tests being most prevalent to nickel sulfate (20 %), potassium dichromate (9 %), cobalt chloride (6 %) and fragrance mix (4 %). Prevalence of positive patch tests to <b>nickel</b> and <b>chromate</b> was higher than that reported for another healthy population, which may stem from self-selection of volunteers or geographical differences, including extent of exposure to allergens...|$|R
30|$|The {{level of}} heavy metal {{tolerance}} {{is very high}} in P. putida W 619 in comparison to other P. putida strains (Canovas et al. [2003]; Taghavi et al. [2009]). In P. putida W 619, copper, cobalt, zinc, cadmium, arsenate, mercury, <b>nickel</b> <b>chromate,</b> and molybdenum resistance genes are present in two genomic regions (1 and 31). Heavy metal tolerance of P. putida LS 46 has not been investigated, but this strain encodes genes for heavy metal resistance present in genomic region 1 of P. putida W 619. These genes are involved in copper, cobalt, zinc, and cadmium resistance. However, the genes located on genomic region 31 of P. putida W 619, involved in copper and chromate resistance, were absent {{in the majority of}} P. putida strains, including P. putida LS 46 (Additional file 1 : Table S 8). All P. putida strains lacked the genes present in genomic region 18 of P. putida W 619, which were associated with mercury and nickel resistance.|$|E
40|$|The {{patch test}} results from 1, 000 {{patients}} tested with the ICDRG standard series are analyzed for positive reactions to potassium dichromate, nickel sulphate, and cobalt chloride. Nickel {{appears to be}} the most common sensitizer, especially among women, although false-negative reactions may occur if it is tested with a 2. 5 % concentration in yellow petrolatum. Chromate dermatitis is generally of occupational origin among men. It is also quite common among Belgian women, probably because of the widespread use of Javel (liquid bleach), containing sodium dichromate as a colouring and stabilizing agent. Positive patch test reactions to cobalt are generally accompanied by allergic reactions to <b>nickel</b> or <b>chromate.</b> Its role as a primary allergen, however, must never be overlooked. The relationship between these metals and hand and foot eczema is evaluated. The results of a follow-up questionnaire are given. More than 70 % of the patients allergic to <b>chromates</b> or <b>nickel</b> continued to suffer from contact eczema after the diagnosis had been made and therapeutic measures taken. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{clinical}} {{model to}} examine the hypothesis that venous hypertension of the lower leg per se can cause lower leg stasis dermatitis is described. To prove this concept, we retrospectively studied a consecutive series of 38 patients with lower leg dermatitis who underwent phlebological examination at our consultation {{over a period of}} four years. Among those patients who had an insufficiency of the superficial veins only, without insufficiency of the deep veins, 22 had undergone patch testing to common allergens in phlebology. We found 10 patients with a stasis dermatitis of the lower leg and an incompetent great saphenous vein, six of whom had no detectable contact sensitization at all and another four exclusively to phlebologically irrelevant substances, e. g. <b>nickel,</b> cobalt, <b>chromate</b> or epoxid resin. All these 10 patients showed long saphenous vein incompetence from the groin to the medial aspect of the leg. All were operated by classical flush ligation and saphenectomy. Lower leg dermatitis healed in all 10 patients within 8 - 12 weeks and no recurrence was observed (1 year follow-up). These results support clinical experience that venous hypertension alone indeed can cause lower leg dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|Sixty four {{patients}} (40 males, 24 females) {{of contact}} dermatitis of hands were patch tested. The patients included housewives (22), factory workers (16), office workers (8), medical and para - medical personnel (8), building workers (3), teachers (4), and photographer, farmer and student one each. The substances tested included battery of metals, rubber chemicals, common medicaments and suspected substances. Sensitivity to metals {{was found in}} 34 (53. 1 %) patients and <b>nickel,</b> cobalt and <b>chromate</b> in 40. 6, 31. 2 and 21. 8 % patients respectively. Medicament, rubber and vegetable sensitivity was found in 26 (40. 6 %), 13 (20. 3 %) and 13 (20. 3 %) patients respectively. The miscellaneous sensitizers were positive in 15 (23. 4 %) patients. They included plants oils, file cover, currency notes, DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), PPD (paraphenylenediamine) formaldehyde, mercuric chloride, film and paper developer...|$|R
40|$|The 163 -kilobase-pair (kb) plasmid pMOL 28, which determines {{inducible}} {{resistance to}} <b>nickel,</b> cobalt, <b>chromate,</b> and mercury salts in its native host Alcaligenes eutrophus CH 34, {{was transferred to}} a derivative of A. eutrophus H 16 and subjected to cloning procedures. After Tn 5 transposon mutagenesis, restriction endonuclease analysis, and DNA-DNA hybridization, two DNA fragments, a 9. 5 -kb KpnI fragment and a 13. 5 -kb HindIII fragment (HKI), were isolated. HKI contained EK 1, the KpnI fragment, as a subfragment flanked on both sides by short regions. Both fragments were ligated into the suicide vector pSUP 202, the broad-host-range vector pVK 101, and pUC 19. Both fragments restored a nickel-sensitive Tn 5 mutant to full nickel and cobalt resistance. The hybrid plasmid pVK 101 ::HKI expressed full nickel resistance in all nickel-sensitive derivatives, either pMOL 28 -deficient or -defective, of the native host CH 34. The hybrid plasmid pVK 101 ::HKI also conferred nickel and cobalt resistance to A. eutrophus strains H 16 and JMP 222, Alcaligenes hydrogenophilus, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas oleovorans, but to {{a lower level of}} resistance. In all transconjugants the metal resistances coded by pVK 101 ::HKI were expressed constitutively rather than inducibly. The hybrid plasmid metal resistance was not expressed in Escherichia coli. DNA sequences responsible for nickel resistance in newly isolated strains showed homology to the cloned pMOL 28 -encoded nickel and cobalt resistance determinant...|$|R
40|$|Sensitization to metals is {{assessed}} {{mostly in}} clinical populations. Studies {{in the general}} population are scarce. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of metal sensitization {{in the general population}} and to determine risk factors for nickel sensitization. In five European countries (the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Sweden) a random sample (n= 3119) from the general population aged 18 - 74 years was patch tested with the TRUE Test. Different risk factors for contact allergy to nickel sulfate were investigated in terms of odds ratios (ORs). Overall, the age-standardized prevalences of sensitization to <b>nickel,</b> cobalt and <b>chromate</b> were 14. 5 %, 2. 1 % and 0. 8 %, respectively. The prevalence of nickel sensitization showed a variation among different countries; the highest prevalences were seen in Portugal (18. 5 %) and Italy (16. 4 %), while the lowest prevalence (8. 3 %) was seen in Sweden. The prevalence of cobalt sensitization varied between 3. 8 % (the Netherlands) and 0. 9 % (Italy), and the prevalence of chromate sensitization varied between 1. 3 % (Portugal) and 0. 4 % (Italy and the Netherlands). The highest crude prevalences of strongly positive (++) andextreme (+++) reactions to nickel were observed in Italy (14. 7 %) and Portugal (14. 2 %). These countries showed the lowest prevalences of irritant/doubtful reactions: 0. 5 % and 1. 1 %, respectively. The prevalence of sensitization to nickel increases in younger age groups from 12. 1 % (18 - 30 years) to 20. 6 % (31 - 45 years), then decreases to 16. 1 % (46 - 60 years) and 7. 4 % (61 - 74 years) in higher age groups. Stratification for sex showed a higher crude prevalence of nickel sensitization in women (22. 2 %) than in men (5. 2 %). The highest prevalence in women (31. 8 %) was seen in the age group 31 - 45 years, while in men the highest prevalence (7. 9 %) was found in the age group 46 - 60 years. Estimates from univariate logistic regression models showed strongly significant associations between sensitization to nickel and female sex [OR 5. 19, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 99 - 6. 74], piercing use ever (OR, 4. 24, 95 % CI 3. 33 - 5. 40) and three or more current piercings (OR 5. 58, 95 %CI, 4. 02 - 7. 76). For age the OR was 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 81 - 0. 97). No significant association was observed for atopic dermatitis (OR 1. 17, 95 % CI 0. 79 - 1. 72). The above-mentioned associations were still significant in a multiple regression model. In conclusion, the prevalence of contact allergy to nickel in the general population was high. Sensitization to nickel decreased in older age groups. There were differences in the prevalence between countries, with the highest prevalence of nickel sensitization in Portugal and Italy. The lowest prevalence in Sweden supports the effectiveness of long-standing adequate regulation...|$|R
