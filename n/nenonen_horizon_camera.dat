5000|$|The first {{satellites}} in {{the program}} orbited at altitudes 100 mi above {{the surface of the}} Earth, although later missions orbited even lower at 75 mi). Originally, Corona satellites were designed to spin along their main axis so that the satellite would remain stable. Cameras would take photographs only when pointed at the Earth. The Itek camera company, however, proposed to stabilize the satellite along all three axes—keeping the cameras permanently pointed at the earth. [...] Beginning with the KH-3 version of the satellite, a <b>horizon</b> <b>camera</b> took images of several key stars. A sensor used the satellite's side thruster rockets to align the rocket with these [...] "index stars," [...] so that it was correctly aligned with the Earth and the cameras pointed in the right direction. Beginning in 1967, two <b>horizon</b> <b>cameras</b> were used. This system was known as the Dual Improved Stellar Index Camera (DISIC).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new <b>camera</b> system called <b>Horizon</b> View <b>Camera</b> (HVC). The HVC {{is a system}} in which the optical axis of a camera is {{directed}} at the horizon with a mirror so that obtained image contains objects on the ground without including the ground itself. Therefore, by using the HVC system, separating objects from the ground becomes very easy. In this paper, we measured the distance to the object by using the obtained image actually and easily. Moreover, there are many other useful features in the HVC system. In order to improve the processing cost and accuracy, we propose a new idea whereby the detection of objects becomes easier and the results are more accurate by the experiment. ...|$|R
2500|$|Zenit (...) is a Russian (and {{formerly}} Soviet) camera brand {{manufactured by}} KMZ {{in the town}} of Krasnogorsk near Moscow since 1952 and by BelOMO in Belarus since the 1970s.

Among related brands are Zorki for 35mm rangefinder cameras, Moskva (Moscow) and Iskra for medium-format folding <b>cameras</b> and <b>Horizon</b> for panoramic <b>cameras.</b> In the 1960s and 1970s, they were exported by Mashpriborintorg to 74 countries.|$|R
30|$|Higher resolutions, high frame {{rates and}} high {{accuracy}} are {{of critical importance}} for automotive vision [2, 11]. New developments by sensor manufacturers and the rising number of demanding applications sitting on the <b>horizon</b> (awaiting better <b>cameras)</b> indicates that the market will be performance-driven for the foreseeable future. Such performance needs to be reflected at the systems-level and hence, {{the objective of this}} paper was to definitively address the synchronisation problem that arises between different cameras when combined in a multivision set.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 {{the camera}} was picked up again by KMZ and reworked, {{especially}} on the exterior. This time KMZ called the <b>camera</b> <b>Horizon</b> 202. Instead of a metal case, the outside was now made of ABS plastic. The interior workings, however, did not change much. The biggest change was {{the addition of a}} second gear, resulting in an additional set of shutter speeds. This left the photographer with 8 speeds to choose from: 1/2 s, 1/4 s, 1/8 s, 1/15 s, 1/30 s, 1/60 s, 1/125 s and 1/250 s. In latter models the speeds 1/15 s and 1/30 s where dropped in favor of a more evenly running mechanism. Since 2006 it is sold in a stripped down version with only two shutter speeds (1/2 s and 1/60 s) as Horizon Kompakt ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the rapid {{spreading}} of stereoscopy in the consumer market, three-dimensional (3 D) vision systems are replacing two-dimensional devices. A fast growing technology in the 3 D visualization systems market is multi-views autostereoscopic displays (ADs). However, these devices have not yet found a direct application in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), as it is really challenging to embed a high number of point-of-views in a device which has to pass through a MIS incision. The aim of this work is the development of a miniaturized vision acquisition system for MIS, which can be interfaced with multi-views ADs. The system is anchored by a magnetic link to the abdomen and freely moved by magnetic actuation to adjust the point of view and the <b>horizon</b> of the <b>cameras.</b> The laparoscope can embed up to 9 cameras, while matching typical MIS access incision siz...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} cognitions of cyclists during a competitive time trial (TT) event using Think Aloud (TA) protocol analysis. Design: Single group, observational design. Method: Fifteen male and three female cyclists from the North West of England verbalised their thoughts throughout an outdoor competitive 16. 1  km cycling TT (Level 2 TA). Verbalisations were recorded using iVue <b>Horizon</b> 1080 P <b>camera</b> glasses. Data were transcribed verbatim, analysed using deductive content analysis and grouped into themes: (i) Pain And Discomfort (Fatigue, Pain), (ii) External Feedback (Time, Speed, Heart Rate), (iii) Environment (Surroundings, Traffic and Other Cyclists), and (iv) Pace and Distance (Pace, Distance). The number of verbalisations within each theme was analysed by distance quartile using Friedman tests to examine changes in cognitions over time. Results: Associative themes, including Fatigue and Pain, were verbalised {{more frequently in}} the earlier stages of the TT and less in the final quartile, whereas verbalisations about Distance significantly increased in the last quartile. Conclusions: This study demonstrates how a novel data collection method can capture in-event cognitions of endurance athletes. It provides an important extension to previous literature, showing how individuals may process and attend to information over time during an exercise bout. Future research should establish the relationship between performance and cognitive processes. © 2017 International Society of Sport Psycholog...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} self-calibration and motion recovery from a single snapshot obtained under a setting of two mirrors. The mirrors are able to show five views of an object in one image. In this paper, the epipoles of the real and virtual cameras are firstly estimated from {{the intersection of the}} bitangent lines between corresponding images, from which we can easily derive the <b>horizon</b> of the <b>camera</b> plane. The imaged circular points and the angle between the mirrors can then be obtained from equal angles between the bitangent lines, by planar rectification. The silhouettes produced by reflections can be treated as a special circular motion sequence. With this observation, technique developed for calibrating a circular motion sequence can be exploited to simplify the calibration of a single-view two-mirror system. Different from the state-of-the-art approaches, only one snapshot is required in this work for self-calibrating a natural camera and recovering the poses of the two mirrors. This is more flexible than previous approaches which require at least two images. When more than a single image is available, each image can be calibrated independently and the problem of varying focal length does not complicate the calibration problem. After the calibration, the visual hull of the objects can be obtained from the silhouettes. Experimental results show the feasibility and the preciseness of the proposed approach...|$|R
