5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} <b>numerical</b> <b>values</b> ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, the effectiveness of physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, the effectiveness of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. The player controls the movement of the player character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the player loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The player character possesses <b>numerical</b> <b>values</b> for their health and armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As the player character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the player character will die. Armor lessens the impact to the player character's health from hostile action, but once depleted the player will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the <b>numerical</b> <b>values</b> of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is mapped to p, while a is mapped to 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.|$|E
25|$|The Numerical Stroop effect {{demonstrates}} the {{close relationship between}} <b>numerical</b> <b>values</b> and physical sizes.

Comparing digits in incongruent trials (e.g., 3 5) is slower than comparing digits in congruent trials (e.g., 5 3) and the difference in reaction time is termed the numerical Stroop effect. The effect of irrelevant <b>numerical</b> <b>values</b> on physical comparisons (similar to the effect of irrelevant color words on responding to colors) suggests that <b>numerical</b> <b>values</b> are processed automatically (i.e., even when they are irrelevant to the task).|$|E

40|$|Perceived {{duration}} {{has been}} shown to be positively related to task-irrelevant, nontemporal stimulus magnitude. To account for this finding, Walsh's (2003) A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM) model suggests that magnitude of time is not differentiated from magnitude of other nontemporal stimulus characteristics and collectively processed by a generalized magnitude system. In Experiment 1, we investigated the combined effects of stimulus size and numerical quantity, as two nontemporal stimulus dimensions covered by the ATOM model, on duration judgments. Participants were required to reproduce the duration of target intervals marked by Arabic digits varying in physical size and <b>numerical</b> <b>value.</b> While the effect of stimulus size was effectively moderated by target duration, the effect of <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> appeared to require attentional resources directed to the <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> in order to become effective. Experiment 2 was designed to further elucidate the mediating influence of attention on the effect of <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> on duration judgments. An effect of <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> was only observed when participants' attention was directed to digit value, but not when participants were required to pay special attention to digit parity. While the ATOM model implies a common metrics and generalized magnitude processing for time, size, and quantity, the present findings provided converging evidence for the notion of two qualitatively different mechanisms underlying the effects of nontemporal stimulus size and <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> on duration judgments. Furthermore, our data challenge the implicit common assumption that the effect of <b>numerical</b> <b>value</b> on duration judgments represents a continuously increasing function of digit magnitude...|$|R
