40|$|The edge-localized, high-confinement mode {{regime is}} of {{interest}} for future Tokamak reactors since high performance has been sustained for long durations. Experiments in the Joint <b>European</b> <b>Tokamak</b> [M. Keilhacker et al., Nuclear Fusion 39, 209 (1999) ] have studied this regime using scans with the toroidal field and plasma current varied together in H, D, DT, and T isotopes. The local energy transport in more than fifty of these plasmas is analyzed, and empirical scaling relations are derived for energy transport coefficients during quasi-steady state conditions using dimensionless parameters.

40|$|A {{metallurgical}} post-mortem {{investigation has}} been carried out on Mark 1 Hypervapotron elements from the Joint <b>European</b> <b>Tokamak</b> (JET), with the aim of aiding engineers in improving the future design of such high heat flux (HHF) component. Optical and electron microscopy and X-ray techniques have been utilised. Work has predominately focused on the electron beam (EB) welded and vacuum brazed joints of the Hypervapotron. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) has been used to assess the chemical composition while micro and nano indentation testing has been used to study the hardness profiles of these joints. Poor quality control of the vacuum brazing process resulted in nickel based filler material, contaminating internal surfaces. Variable penetration and entrapped voids in the EB welds suggested weld spiking occurred during the joining process. Details of these findings and a critical assessment of the potential implications are given where appropriate...|$|R
40|$|The Joint <b>European</b> <b>Tokamak</b> (JET) {{is a large}} {{machine for}} {{experiments}} on fusion plasmas. Many of the experiments use real-time measurements and controls to establish and/or maintain specific plasma conditions. Each Instrument (Diagnostic or Heating/Fuelling/Magnet) is connected to a network. The number of systems has now grown to over thirty, and new systems are being planned for the future. Since some of the systems are used to control critical parameters of the JET plasma, we are improving the availability, reliability and maintainability of the facility. We must ensure that systems check their message structures against a central Data Dictionary, at build-time and run-time and secondly that the systems check their input data streams are alive before, during and after a JET pulse. Finally, we are developing high-level control configuration tools. From all of these, we identify some general principles which are applicable {{to the next generation}} machines...|$|R
