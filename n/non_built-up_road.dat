To measure the speeds at which drivers choose to travel in unconstrained conditions on motorways and <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> A <b>roads</b> (both single and dual carriageway), subject only to the normal maximum speed limit.

50|$|For {{road traffic}} safety {{purposes}} {{it can be}} helpful to classify roads into three usages: built-up urban streets with slower speeds, greater densities, and more diversity among <b>road</b> users; <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> rural <b>roads</b> with higher speeds; and major highways (motorways/ Interstates/ freeways/ Autobahns, etc.) reserved for motor-vehicles, and which are often designed to minimize and attenuate crashes. Most injuries occur on urban streets but most fatalities on rural roads, while motorways are the safest in relation to distance traveled. For example, in 2013, German autobahns carried 31% of motorized road traffic (in travel-kilometres) while accounting for 13% of Germany's traffic deaths. The autobahn fatality rate of 1.9 deaths per billion-travel-kilometres compared favorably with the 4.7 rate on urban streets and 6.6 rate on rural roads.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, Hamburg had {{an area of}} 755.2 km2, 92% was {{land and}} 8% water areas. Area for the traffic {{infrastructure}} was 12% (9183 ha). These were <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> areas.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{authored}} by Gabriella Kosztolanyi-Ivan, Csaba Koren and Attila Borsos is to evaluate road scenes and particularly if characteristics of <b>built-up,</b> <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> nature and the complexity of scenes could {{be linked to the}} speeding choice made by the driver and could explain some unsafe situations. Of course, speeding is a well-known factor of risk, but the originality of this paper is the proved link existing between built environmental characteristics and the speeding choice of the road user. That question is not completely new. Indeed, authors refer to Montel et al. works, based on reconstruction of accident scenes [9], which explained that drivers take into consideration some categories of roads when they decide of their driving and choose their speed. The authors aim is here to highlight the role and importance of the perception of road scenes by the road user. They use pictures of scenes (<b>built-up</b> scenes and <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> ones and more ambiguous scenes), submitted to 500 subjects. They show “that standard deviations of speeds at not clearly identified sites are considerably higher than at clear <b>built-up</b> or clearly <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> sites”. Authors develop then a tool (program) to recognize and digitize scenes and they show that if the program is able to recognize clear <b>built-up</b> sites and <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> sites, it’s less obvious concerning transition sites. They also show a consistent classification between human and program. The added value provided by this paper is by proving that speed dispersion {{could be used as a}} means for determining ambiguous scenes and thus less safe scenes.|$|R

The variations are attributable to greater absorbency of man-made materials, and building density which restrict air-flow. The urban heat island had expanded into Hung Hom since January, when the first image was taken.|$|R
30|$|Other {{results of}} this survey show that both the {{standard}} deviations and the relative standard deviation of speeds at not clearly identified sites are considerably higher than at clearly built-up or clearly non-built-up sites. This reflects the uncertainty of drivers with speed choice at such locations. An interpretation consistent with the self-explaining road notion {{is that it is}} less easy for them to categorize these sites as <b>built-up</b> <b>roads</b> (implying a lower legal speed limit) or non-built-up roads.|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{comparison}} between three image classifications of remote sensing imagery to estimate change detection in urban area (Tabriz, Iran) by Post Classification Comparison (PCC) technique. In order to investigate an appropriate method for extracting changes, pixel-based image classifiers such as: Maximum likelihood Classifier (MLC), Neural Network Classification (NN) and an Object-Oriented (OO) image Classifier were tasted and compered by using Landsat TM and ETM+ image respectively belong to 1990 and 2010. A priori defined five land cover classes in classification scheme were built-up, vegetated area, bare areas, water bodies and roads. The accuracy of each method was assessed using reference dataset from high resolution satellite image and aerial photograph. The results shows that the MLC method has achieved an overall accuracy of 69 % with kappa coefficient of 0. 67, NN 92 % overall accuracy with a kappa coefficient of 0. 90 and object oriented with 94 % overall accuracy and 0. 92 coefficient kappa. The PCC technique reliably identified area of change {{was used as the}} change detection technique for evaluating the three classification method. Different classification methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Quantitative results shows that, the MLC method is found to be unable to differentiate urban areas such as <b>Built-up,</b> <b>Roads</b> and Barren, the Object-Oriented Classifier has superior performance in classifying Vegetation and Water areas and the Neural Net Classifier also has the best performance in classifying <b>Built-up,</b> <b>Road</b> and Barren areas...|$|R

The training database contains only clearly built-up and non-built-up pictures. In the training urban database there are pictures showing dense built-up scenes and also pictures with fewer houses along the road. Looking at the training rural database we can find pictures with dense vegetation nearby the road and also cross sections where vegetation is rare or absolutely lacking. In the training database road marking conditions also vary including locations with visible pavement markings and also no markings at all.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Urban Change is {{the global}} {{phenomenon}} {{in which the}} <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> area is converted into a built up area {{over a period of}} time through a process called Urbanization. The rate of urban change depends upon many factors. The increase in urban land in a region affects numerous parameters associated with it. One of the most important factors associated with a region or country is the sustainable development of that region. Sustainable Development helps to meet the needs of the human keeping in balance the natural environment. India along with other developing countries has increased the concern about the sustainable development. There are different approaches to study urban change phenomenon and in this case study one of these approaches have been used to quantify the amount of Urban Change in the defined study area. The approach used is GIS where the data source has been Google Earth and ArcGIS for further analysis of the digitized image.

40|$|Interests in {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) data analysis {{is driven by the}} constantly increased spatial resolutions of the acquired images, where the geometries of scene objects can be better defined than in lower resolution data. This paper addresses the problem of the built-up areas extraction in high-resolution (HR) SAR images, which can provide a wealth of information to characterize urban environments. Strong backscattering behavior is one of the distinct characteristics of built-up areas in a SAR image. However, in practical applications, {{only a small portion of}} pixels characterizing the built-up areas appears bright. Thus, specific texture measures should be considered for identifying these areas. This paper presents a novel texture measure by combining the proposed labeled co-occurrence matrix technique with the specific spatial variability structure of the considered land-cover type in the fuzzy set theory. The spatial variability is analyzed by means of variogram, which reflects the spatial correlation or non-similarity associated with a particular terrain surface. The derived parameters from the variograms are used to establish fuzzy functions to characterize the <b>built-up</b> class and <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> class, separately. The proposed technique was tested on TerraSAR-X images acquired of Nanjing (China) and Barcelona (Spain), and on a COSMO-SkyMed image acquired of Hangzhou (China). The obtained classification accuracies point out the effectiveness of the proposed technique in identifying and detecting built-up areas...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the potential of spatial metrics for describing distinct types of urban morphology at block level. Urban blocks typically consist of <b>built-up</b> and <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> areas, with a specific composition and configuration. To characterize the twodimensional structure of urban blocks, next to traditional, landscape ecological metrics, two alternative methods are proposed, describing the alternation between, and the characteristic size of built-up and non-built-up surfaces along a set of radial and contourbased profiles. Urban areas are, of course, also characterized by their third dimension. Therefore, also metrics were developed describing different characteristics of the elevation pattern of built-up areas. A case study was carried out on the Brussels-Capital region. Several vector layers of the large-scale UrbIS database for the region were used to define the blocks, the delineation of individual buildings within each block, {{and the number of}} floors for each building. High-resolution satellite data were used to define the presence of green in non-built areas. A combination of the metrics proposed shows clear potential for describing different types of urban morphology. Yet there are several issues that require further research, such as the relation between different types of urban morphology and urban land use, as well as the potential of additional data (satellite imagery, digital elevation models, socioeconomical data) for improving the distinction between different urban morphologies and/or land-use types. 1...|$|R

The front is an early Tudor brick gatehouse built by Cardinal John Morton and completed in 1495. Cardinal Pole lay in state in the palace for 40 days after he died there in 1558.

40|$|Accurate {{postal code}} maps could play an {{important}} role within GIS as the postal code has the potential to link the address description of buildings and their location in a certain global reference system. This relationship is possible in both directions: address matching and geocoding. These operators demand a certain mechanism in translating an exact geometric position (i. e. WGS 84 coordinate) into a location indication (town, street, house number) and vice versa. As most built-up parcels are provided with a postal code this indicator could be used as the linkage. This paper describes the procedure, based on the Dutch cadastral registration, to obtain a reliable 6 -position planar postal code map for the Netherlands. Problems with existing postal code maps, like intersecting of houses and arbitrary derived boundaries are avoided. For a planar coverage, <b>non</b> <b>built-up</b> parcels having no assigned postal code should be assigned a plausible postal code. Therefore special attention is given to infrastructural parcels. These parcels are divided at their skeleton first and then piecewise attached to their neighbor parcels. This new approach results in very reliable postal code maps, which are visually attractive too as infrastructure lines can be regognized. The procedure is generic and can be applied to other administrative parcel information as well. The algorithm is implemented using the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL), and the possibilities and limitations of this library are addressed as well. The reliability of the derived planar postal code map is discussed and some results are shown by figures. A short overview of alternatives and improvements concludes this paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} simulate built-up expansion and densification based {{on a combination of}} a non-ordered multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and cellular automata (CA). The probability for built-up development is assessed based on (i) a set of built-up development causative factors and (ii) the land-use of neighboring cells. The model considers four <b>built-up</b> classes: <b>non</b> <b>built-up,</b> low-density, medium-density and high-density built-up. Unlike the most commonly used built-up/urban models which simulate built-up expansion, our approach considers expansion and the potential for densification within already built-up areas when their present density allows it. The model is built, calibrated, and validated for Wallonia region (Belgium) using cadastral data. Three 100 × 100 m raster-based built-up maps for 1990, 2000, and 2010 are developed to define one calibration interval (1990 – 2000) and one validation interval (2000 − 2010). The causative factors are calibrated using MLR whereas the CA neighboring effects are calibrated based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The calibrated model is applied to simulate the built-up pattern in 2010. The simulated map in 2010 is used to evaluate the model’s performance against the actual 2010 map by means of fuzzy set theory. According to the findings, land-use policy, slope, and distance to roads are the most important determinants of the expansion process. The densification process is mainly driven by zoning, slope, distance to different roads and richness index. The results also show that the densification generally occurs where there are dense neighbors whereas areas with lower densities retain their densities over time...|$|R
