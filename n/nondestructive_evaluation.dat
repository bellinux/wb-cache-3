40|$|Inverse {{problems}} and inverse analyses, which deal with estimation of inputs or source from outputs or results, have been receiving increasing attention in various fields {{of science and}} engineering. A reasonable classification of the inverse problems is described. The nature of inverse {{problems and}} difficulties encountered in the inverse analyses are discussed. Typical inversion analysis schemes for solving the inverse problems are summarized. <b>Nondestructive</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{can be regarded as}} inverse problems. As an example of <b>nondestructive</b> <b>evaluations</b> the identification of cracks and defects from electric potential distributions observed on cracked bodies is discussed. The author and his coworkers proposed the active electric potential CT (computed tomography) method, in which the measurements of electric potential under various electric current application conditions are compared with numerical analyses of electric potential distributions for crack identification. The uniqueness and the stability of the identification are discussed. Examples of the applications of the active electric potential CT method to identification of two-dimensional cracks and threedimensional cracks are given. By using the piezoelectric film, the present author and his coworkers proposed the passive electric potential CT method, which did not require electric current application. The applicability of the passive electric potential method to identification of two-dimensional and three-dimensional cracks and delamination in composite materials are demonstrated. The enclosure method and the probe method proposed recently by Ikehata for direct reconstruction of voids and inclusions are introduced. Inverse analysis schemes related to the residual stress and strain estimation and the defect identification using thermography are also discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Details of {{the method}} {{used to measure the}} stress wave factor are described. Frequency spectra of the stress waves are {{analyzed}} in order to clarify the nature of the wave phenomena involved. The stress wave factor was measured with simple contact probes requiring only one-side access to a part. This is beneficial in <b>nondestructive</b> <b>evaluations</b> because the waves can run parallel to fiber directions and thus measure material properties in directions assumed by actual loads. The technique can be applied where conventional through transmission techniques are impractical or where more quantitative data are required. The stress wave factor was measured for a series of graphite/polyimide composite panels, and results obtained are compared with through transmission immersion ultrasonic scans...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are of increasing {{interest to the}} aerospace industry {{as a result of}} their weight versus performance characteristics. One of the disadvantages of composites is the high cost of fabrication and post inspection with conventional ultrasonic scanning systems. The high cost of inspection is driven by the need for scanning systems which can follow large curve surfaces. Additionally, either large water tanks or water squirters are required to couple the ultrasonics into the part. Thermographic techniques offer significant advantages over conventional ultrasonics by not requiring physical coupling between the part and sensor. The thermographic system can easily inspect large curved surface without requiring a surface following scanner. However, implementation of Thermal <b>Nondestructive</b> <b>Evaluations</b> (TNDE) for flaw detection in composite materials and structures requires determining its limit...|$|R

Finite-element modeling based on classical lamination theory is conducted for the corresponding materials and geometries to reproduce the experimental results analytically. The type of compressive failure is found to be a function of hole size, with fiber buckling/kinking at the hole being the dominant failure mechanism for hole diam/plate width ratios exceeding 0. 062. The results of the finite-element analysis supported the experimental data for these failure mechanisms and for those corresponding to smaller hole sizes...|$|R
