The domesticated population showed lower chemical variation and higher biomass and essential oil yields, allowing for the registration of a <b>new</b> <b>plant</b> <b>variety.</b> The observed variations in oil composition (HD, VP) between the two populations were mostly quantitative. The oils were characterized by the presence of cis-epoxyocimene, (-) -. cis-chrysanthenol, chrysanthenyl acetate, linalool and trans-caryophyllene. The insect antifeedant (. Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Spodoptera littoralis, Myzus persicae and Rhopalosiphum padi) and antifungal (. Fusarium spp. and Botrytis cinerea) effects of their oils were also tested.

40|$|Public {{and private}} {{investments}} in plant breeding have a {{proven track record}} of increasing agricultural productivity, significantly contributing to economic well-being or social welfare. Substantial investments {{in research and development}} are required before a <b>new</b> <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> can be developed and released, which the private sector can only recoup through commercial sales coupled with property rights. We previously published outcomes from economic modeling implementing different categories and hypothetical variants of intellectual property protection (IPP) in the field of plant breeding and biotechnology. Our goal here is to portray these outcomes using examples that will be more immediately familiar to the plant-breeding and policy-making communities. In so doing, we do not add to the analyses and arguments already presented. Our objective here is to make more accessible to a broader audience subject matter already presented in a more formal economic format by Lence et al. (2015). We found that plant variety protection (PVP) and utility patents played important and complementary roles in promoting and adopting innovation. Voluntary licensing under patents had a major contribution to social welfare. Periods of protection longer than the current life span of a utility patent did not contribute maximally to the stock of social welfare. We performed a reality check comparing different types of innovation and assessment of time and risk to commercialization. We hope that this information can contribute to more effective implementation of IPP to further promote genetic gain and thus enable commercially funded plant breeders to maximally contribute to the benefit of society on a global basis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In all countries, {{members of}} the UPOV (Union Internationale pour la Protection des Obtentions Végétales), of which Brazil is a signatory, to protect a <b>new</b> <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> is {{necessary}} to carry out DUS (Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability) tests. DUS testing forCapsicum spp. is based on 48 descriptors, which involve qualitative and quantitative traits, observed from germination to fruit harvest. This paper describes the performance of DUS tests on lines of chili peppers, which are candidates for protection; we discuss the main aspects related to operational difficulties, the relevance of some descriptors for the protection process and highlight the importance of protecting new plant varieties as national intellectual property. Four C. annuum var. annuum recombinant inbred lines were tested. The Capsicum Breeding Program of the Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro developed the lines, which are resistant to bacterial spot. They were tested under greenhouse conditions from June to November 2013; and from January to July 2014 in Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The 'Jalapeño M' commercial genotype was used as control and treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with seven plants per plot with five replications. Besides the 48 descriptors, stipulated by legislation for Capsicum DUS testing, we included a descriptor for bacterial spot resistance. The descriptors that enabled distinction varied with each line. Although being distinctive for some descriptors, L 1 and L 2 lines were neither homogeneous nor stable. L 6 and L 8 recombined lines were characterized by homogeneity and stability. Fruit shape, capsaicin presence, number of days for flowering and bacterial spot resistance were descriptors that allowed for differentiation between treatments. In conclusion, the L 6 and L 8 recombined lines met the DUS test requirements; therefore, they may be subjected to the protection process with the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply...|$|E

HutchinsonPrecipitation impacts hydrologic structures, {{agricultural}} production, {{water resources}} management, and recreational activities, {{all of which}} significantly affect a state’s economy. Water control structure design {{is based on the}} maximum runoff rate resulting from storms with a specific return period and duration. The Rainfall Frequency Atlas (National Weather Service Technical Paper 40, 1961) (TP- 40) provided statistical rainfall analysis as the basis for hydrologic structure design until the information was updated for Kansas in February 2013 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlas 14, volume 8) (Atlas- 14). With growing concern about the effects of global climate change and predictions of more precipitation and extreme weather events, it is necessary to explore rainfall distribution patterns using the most current and complete data available. In this work, the changes in rainfall patterns were studied using the daily rainfall data from 23 stations in Kansas and 15 stations from adjacent states with daily rainfall data of 1890 through 2012. Analysis showed an increase in extreme precipitation events in Kansas with increase in magnitude from the northwest to southeast part of the state. A comparison of results of the TP- 40 analysis to period 1980 – 2009, showed that approximately 84 % of the state had an increase in short-term rainfall event magnitudes. In addition, trend analyzes on the total annual rainfall indicated a gradual increase at 21 out of 23 stations, including eight statistically significant trends. A change-point analysis detected a significant sudden change at twelve stations as early as 1940 and as recently as 1980. The increasing trend, particularly after the significant change-points, is useful in updating water management plans and can assist with agricultural production decisions such as crop selection and <b>new</b> <b>plant</b> <b>variety</b> development. A comparison between 10 -yr, 24 -hr storms from TP- 40 and Atlas- 14 indicated a change of - 12 % to 5 % in Kansas. However, the number of exceedances from the 10 -yr, 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, 7 -, and 10 -day storms demonstrated a tendency towards more exceedances, particularly in the last five decades. Results of this study are useful for hydrologic structure design and water resources management in order to prevent accepting additional risk of failure because of the current changing climate...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} legal {{framework for the}} protection of plant varieties is controversial. This thesis traces the historical development and the nature of plant variety protection. It argues that the United States’ legal system protects plant varieties either by the patent system or by the certificate of protection. The European Union’s legal system excludes individual plant varieties from the patent system. The UPOV system grants individual plant breeder who breeds or discovers and develops a <b>new</b> <b>plant</b> <b>variety,</b> special regime of protection, namely, plant variety protection or plant breeders’ rights. As a result of the latest revision of the UPOV Convention, the patent and plant variety protection systems are no longer mutually exclusive. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture focuses on farmers’ rights. The Convention on Biological Diversity provides that States are responsible for conserving their biological diversity and for using their biological resources in a sustainable manner. The Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights requires member States to protect plant varieties either by patents or by an effective sui generis system or by any combination thereof. The African Model Legislation provides {{for the protection of}} the rights of local communities, farmers’ rights and plant breeders’ rights. The thesis argues that although the subject matter under plant variety protection system is the plant variety itself the definition of the term “plant variety” under the various legal systems examined in this research is controversial. Furthermore, it examines novelty, distinctiveness, uniformity and stability, as they comprise the four substantive conditions for the grant of protection. Further the thesis considers the persons entitled to protection and concludes that the breeder is the person who bred or discovered and developed the variety. The Indian law considers the farmer, group of farmers or any xiii village or local community who contribute in the evolution of a variety as breeders. The thesis argues that the international legislators restrict the scope of plant breeders’ rights by reference to the commercial propagation of the variety. The thesis examines acts relating to the production or propagation of the variety for non-commercial purposes as limitations to the rights conferred. Also the thesis discusses the implementation and enforcement of the international intellectual property obligations relating to plant variety protection and the institutional mechanisms for their implementation and enforcement. It concludes that the implementation and enforcement of these obligations shall take into consideration the particular needs of the country. Finally the thesis suggests the issuance a sui generis legislation on plant variety protection that incorporates plant breeders’ rights, farmers’ rights, and the intellectual property rights of local communities...|$|E
