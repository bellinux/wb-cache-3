The Yule–Nielsen {{modified}} spectral Neugebauer model (YNSN) enhanced for {{accounting for}} ink spreading {{in the different}} ink superposition conditions requires a spectrophotometer to measure the reflectances of halftone calibration patches in order to compute the ink spreading curves mapping <b>nominal</b> ink <b>surface</b> coverage to effective ink surface coverage.

We then establish the ink spreading curves mapping <b>nominal</b> dot <b>surface</b> coverages to effective dot surface coverages. By weighting the contributions of the different ink spreading curves according to the ratios of colorant surface coverages, we predict according to the YNSN model the reflectance spectra of the test patches. We compare the prediction accuracy of the YNSN model calibrated by digitized RGB intensities of the calibration patches with the prediction accuracy of the same model calibrated by the spectral reflectances of these calibration patches.

40|$|We {{report on}} normal contact and {{friction}} measurements of model multicontact interfaces formed between smooth surfaces and substrates textured with a statistical distribution of spherical micro-asperities. Contacts are either formed between a rigid textured lens and a smooth rubber, or a flat textured rubber and a smooth rigid lens. Measurements {{of the real}} area of contact A versus normal load P are performed by imaging the light transmitted at the microcontacts. For both interfaces, A(P) {{is found to be}} sub-linear with a power law behavior. Comparison to two multi-asperity contact models, which extend Greenwood-Williamson (J. Greenwood, J. Williamson, Proc. Royal Soc. London Ser. A 295, 300 (1966)) model by taking into account the elastic interaction between asperities at different length scales, is performed, and allows their validation for the first time. We find that long range elastic interactions arising from the curvature of the <b>nominal</b> <b>surfaces</b> are the main source of the non-linearity of A(P). At a shorter range, and except for very low pressures, the pressure dependence of both density and area of micro-contacts remains well described by Greenwood-Williamson's model, which neglects any interaction between asperities. In addition, in steady sliding, friction measurements reveal that the mean shear stress at the scale of the asperities is systematically larger than that found for a macroscopic contact between a smooth lens and a rubber. This suggests that frictional stresses measured at macroscopic length scales may not be simply transposed to microscopic multicontact interfaces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the {{representation}} of vectorial tolerances in the parametric CAD-model using surface-type specific attribute containers, which {{are attached to the}} desired <b>nominal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Since CAD-systems can only evaluate linear, one–dimensional tolerance chains, currently additional CAx-systems are used for tolerance representation, analysis and synthesis. In this paper the representation of vectorial tolerance parameters in the CAD-model is explained. A major motivation for their integration into the CAD-model is the similarity of the vectorial tolerance representation to the B-Rep (Boundary representation) description in current CAD-systems. Furthermore, most engineers think in the standardized tolerance system. So for the user input, a user-controlled translation between the ISO and vectorial tolerances is necessary. The presented approach was realized in a software prototype using the CAD programming interface of SolidWorks. A main focus of the paper is the handling of partially closed tolerance-loops. Most of the CAT-systems only handle open tolerance chains. In contrast, a real system, even if the overall tolerance chain can be considered as an open chain, consists of partially closed tolerance-loops just in the joints or base frames. The developed approach is based on the statically determined placement of a rigid body on three points, where the resulting line of action of the force - even for several parts – goes through the support triangle. Assuming ideal rigid but deviation-affected components the new placement-triangle can be determined. This is a departure from the classical component mates in 3 D-CAD that assume geometrically ideal elements. The concept is demonstrated in the article by examples...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTolerances for {{freeform}} {{surfaces are}} specified using profile tolerance that controls form or combination of size, form, orientation {{and location of}} a feature(s) relative to a true profile. Freeform surfaces are generally inspected by using fixtures on a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The combination of fixtures and the CMM enables the establishment of correspondence between points on the machined and <b>nominal</b> <b>surface</b> for tolerance verification. To respond to the market quickly, it has become inevitable to use 3 D scanners that can scan an object rapidly and provide dense unorganized points as an output without maintaining any correspondence with the nominal CAD model. Current state of art uses the shortest distance criterion to establish correspondence and verify the profile tolerances. This results in acceptance of parts {{that ought to be}} rejected and vice versa. A novel, alternative approach is proposed to overcome this deficiency and verify tolerances specified on a free-form surface. The technique establishes the correct one to one correspondence between the machined surface and CAD model using the Medial axis transform (MAT). The MAT of both the <b>nominal</b> <b>surface</b> and the measured points respectively, are discretised to obtain grids. Corresponding points on the two grids are then used to verify the deviation of the machined surface from the <b>nominal</b> <b>surface.</b> Results of preliminary experiments with simulated data are presented...|$|E

Innovative systems often need high-quality and high-volume optics. Injection moulded polymer optics represents a cost-efficient solution. However, it has to be ensured that the tight requirements with respect to the system s performance are met by the replicated freeform optics. To reach this goal, it is not sufficient to only characterise the manufactured optics by peak-to-valley or rms data describing a deviation from the <b>nominal</b> <b>surface.</b> Instead, optical performance of the manufactured freeform optics has to be analysed and compared with the performance of the <b>nominal</b> <b>surface.</b> This can be done by integrating the measured surface data of the manufactured freeform optics into the optical simulation model.

40|$|Dimensional {{inspection}} of a manufactured surface {{by means of}} a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) produces a set of Cartesian coordinates. The coordinates are processed to yield the geometric tolerance of the surface. This paper presents a new approach to the evaluation of flatness, cylindricity and sphericity tolerance based on surface invariance with regard to the rigid motions. The proposed algorithm transforms, through homogeneous transformation matrices, the coordinates measured to best fit the reference element of the surface class from which the actual measurements were sampled. The transformation matrix is simplified taking into account the invariance of the sum of the squared normal distances of the measured points from the <b>nominal</b> <b>surface</b> as regards some rigid motions. This invariance is a consequence of the invariance as regards some displacements of the <b>nominal</b> <b>surface</b> from which the data points were sampled. In this way, the number of parameters to be optimised is reduced in comparison with the six parameters characterizing the general homogeneous transform matrix. The methodology was computer implemented and numerical simulations were performed for planes, cylinders, and spheres in order to validate the effectiveness of the approach.
