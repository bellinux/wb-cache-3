50|$|ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness {{of all types}} of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI/) and, , is maintained by the ITU. <b>Noise</b> <b>measurements</b> using this weighting typically also use a quasi-peak detector law rather than slow averaging. This also helps to quantify the audibility of bursty noise, ticks and pops that might go undetected with a slow rms measurement.|$|E
50|$|Originally, the A-frequency-weighting {{was only}} meant for quiet {{sounds in the}} region of 40 dB sound {{pressure}} level (SPL), but is now mandated for all levels. C-frequency weighting is however still used in the measurement of the peak value of a noise in some legislation, but B-frequency weighting - a halfway house between 'A' and 'C' has almost no practical use. D-frequency-weighting was designed for use in measuring aircraft noise when non-bypass jets were being measured and after the demise of Concord, these are all military types.

The theory was that ideally the integrator should be a predictor designed to match the signal spectrum. A nearly perfect Shindler Compander replaced the modified version. It was found the modified compander resulted in a less than perfect step size at most signal levels and the fast gain error recovery increased the noise as determined by actual listening tests as compared to simple signal to <b>noise</b> <b>measurements.</b> The final compander achieved a very mild gain error recovery due to the natural truncation rounding error caused by twelve bit arithmetic.|$|E

Three electrochemical methods have been {{examined in this study}} for their applicability to conservation problems. Corrosion Potential Measurement is simple but provides only minimal information on the corrosion processes occurring in an electrochemical system. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy provides both mechanistic and predictive information on coating performance, but the data are complex to interpret and measurements require equipment that is at present too bulky for effective on-site use and beyond the budget of most conservation laboratories. Electrochemical <b>Noise</b> <b>Measurement</b> can be performed using cheap, portable instrumentation and theoretically requires relatively simple statistical processing and interpretation, making it attractive for conservation applications.

5000|$|Soot is {{composed}} of a complex mixture of organic compounds which are weakly absorbing in the visible spectral region and a highly absorbing black component which is variously called “elemental”, “graphitic” or “black carbon”.

[...] The term black carbon is used to imply that this soot component is primarily responsible for the absorption of visible light. [...] The term black carbon is used as a synonym for both the elemental and graphitic component of soot.
