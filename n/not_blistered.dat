Package backs featured fifteen illustrations (not photos) of other vehicles in the 300 series with their accompanying numbers. Each package was the same for each model, with little gold stickers on the plastic blisters labeling the number and type of vehicle (in French). Into the eighties, 200 series blister packs were a simple, even austere, red and white with the Majorette logo in gold. For a time, there were no illustrations.

40|$|The bli- 4 (I) gene of Caenorhabditis elegans {{had been}} {{previously}} defined by a single recessive mutation, e 937, which disrupts the structure of adult-stage cuticle causing the formation of fluid-filled separations of the cuticle layers, or blisters. We report the identification of 11 new alleles of bli- 4, all early larval lethals, including an allele induced by transposon mutagenesis. Nine of the lethal alleles failed to complement the blistered phenotype of e 937; two alleles, s 90 and h 754, complement e 937. The complementing alleles arrested development somewhat later than the noncomplementing alleles, which blocked just prior to hatching. We conclude that bli- 4 is a complex locus with an essential function late in embryogenesis. We investigated the blistered phenotype of e 937 through interactions with other mutations that alter worm morphology or cuticle structure. Recessive and dominant epistasis of several dumpy mutations over the blistered phenotype was observed. Using two heterochronic mutations that alter the developmental stage at which adult cuticle is expressed, we observed that adult worms that lack an adult-stage cuticle could <b>not</b> express <b>blisters.</b> However, late larval worms that expressed the adult cuticle did <b>not</b> express <b>blisters</b> either. It {{seems likely that the}} presence of the adult cuticle is necessary, but <b>not</b> sufficient, for <b>blister</b> expression. Blistering resulting from e 937 is more severe in trans to null alleles, indicating that e 937 is hypomorphic. We postulate that the adult-specific blistering is due to an altered or reduced function of bli- 4 gene product in the adult cuticle. In addition to its essential role in development, the bli- 4 gene product is involved {{in the structure of the}} cuticle, possibly in a function required for the processing or assembly of structural components...|$|R
40|$|Bullous pemphigoid is an {{autoimmune}} blistering {{skin disease}} associated with autoantibodies against the dermal-epidermal junction. Passive transfer of antibodies against BP 180 /collagen (C) XVII, a major hemidesmosomal pemphigoid antigen, into neonatal mice results in dermal-epidermal separation upon applying gentle pressure to their skin, {{but not in}} spontaneous skin blistering. In addition, this neonatal mouse model precludes treatment and observation of diseased animals beyond 2 – 3 days. Therefore, {{in the present study}} we have developed a new disease model in mice reproducing the spontaneous blistering and the chronic course characteristic of the human condition. Adult mice were pre-immunized with rabbit IgG followed by injection of BP 180 /CXVII rabbit IgG. Mice pre-immunized against rabbit IgG and injected 6 times every second day with the BP 180 /CXVII-specific antibodies (n = 35) developed spontaneous sustained blistering of the skin, while mice pre-immunized and then treated with normal rabbit IgG (n = 5) did <b>not.</b> <b>Blistering</b> was associated with IgG and complement C 3 deposits at the epidermal basement membrane and recruitment of inflammatory cells, and was partly dependent on Ly- 6 G-positive cells.

Other studies, however, have shown that downregulation of plasminogen activator does <b>not</b> inhibit <b>blisters</b> induced by pemphigus immunoglobulin G. To eliminate the possibility that small amounts of urokinase plasminogen activator might be sufficient for blister formation, we passively transferred pemphigus immunoglobulin G to urokinase plasminogen activator knockout neonatal mice. Pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris immunoglobulin G caused gross blisters and acantholysis in the superficial and suprabasal epidermis, respectively, to the same degree in knockout and control mice, demonstrating that urokinase plasminogen activator is not absolutely required for antibody-induced blisters. Some studies have shown elevated tissue-type plasminogen activator in pemphigus lesions. Tissue-type plasminogen activator, however, is <b>not</b> necessary for <b>blister</b> formation, because pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris immunoglobulin G caused blisters to the same degree in tissue-type plasminogen activator knockout and control mice.

After passive transfer of pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris immunoglobulin G these mice blistered to the same degree as the single knockout and control mice, and histology indicated blisters at the expected level of the epidermis.

40|$|Thermally sprayed {{aluminium}} (TSA) {{is widely}} used for corrosion protection on offshore installations. Rapid degradation of the TSA has earlier been discovered, if organic coating is applied {{on top of the}} TSA. In case of coating damages on the TSA, a duplex corrosion mechanism may occur. Due to access limitations with coating equipment or hot work limitations offshore, application of new TSA may be difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a repair coating for TSA in connection with damage. The repair coating must provide corrosion protection without triggering the duplex corrosion mechanism and shall be applied without removing the intact TSA. Eight repair coatings were tested on steel coated with TSA to determine the corrosion behavior in marine environment. Four possible protection mechanisms were considered: (1) cathodic polarization, (2) buffering capacity, (3) ability to release an aggressive environment formed under the coating and (4) electrical conductive coatings. The coatings contained anodic elements such as aluminium, zinc or magnesium, except for an inorganic copolymer coating and an MgO pigmented coating. A cyclic coating test was conducted for 20 cycles according to ISO 20340. Highest amount of corrosion creep for the TSA was seen for the Zn epoxy, the inorganic copolymer coating, the high Zn primer and the modified Zn epoxy. An average corrosion creep of approximately 5. 1 mm was seen for the Zn epoxy. Due to corrosion products, blistering or cracking of the repair coat were seen for these coatings. The Zn-, MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed promising results without blistering after the same test. The Zn silicate showed an average corrosion creep of approximately 0. 6 mm, while the MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed negligible corrosion creep. Coating resistivity was measured by obtaining several electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) over a period of time, and the open circuit potential (OCP) was measured. The zinc containing coatings were exposed for 134 days, while the MgO-, Mg-, Al-silicate and the inorganic copolymer coating were exposed for 81 days. All coatings showed an OCP more negative than - 800 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, except for the inorganic copolymer coating. This coating had an initial potential of - 430 mV vs. Ag/AgCl with decreasing development towards a more negative potential. The coatings that revealed blistering or cracking of the repair coating during the cyclic coating test showed generally higher impedance, compared to the silicate coatings that did <b>not</b> <b>blister.</b> An open coating structure was considered as the most important protection mechanism for a TSA repair coat. The protection mechanisms regarding cathodic polarization, electrical conductive coatings and the buffering effect were assumed less important compared to the open coating structure.

Based on a descriptive study of 2, 500 cases with documented exposure to various chemical warfare agents, 665 patients had documented exposure to mustard gas. We screened the latter using the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) test and performed further cytochemical studies on cases with positive results. From among the 665 cases with documented exposure to mustard gas, 9 cases had LAP scores < 20; 2 of these 9 cases had CML and a score of zero (0. 3 %). We detected cytogenetic abnormalities in 7 patients with low LAP scores and atypical lymphocytes of 5 – 11 % in 40 patients. The risk ratio of CML developing in victims exposed to mustard gas (cutaneous or respiratory) may be higher in comparison with the normal population, although confounding factors (e. g., the possibility of exposure to combined chemical agents, excluding patients who did <b>not</b> manifest <b>blisters)</b> limited our results.

Pretreatment with clobetasol- 17 -propionate, applied {{three times a}} day for 4 days, did not affect the activity of galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase (GGT) in fresh blisters but post-blistering treatment for 3 days with the steroid markedly inhibited the increase of this enzyme activity during the initial phases of re-epithelialization. The GGT activity was over 50 % lower in steroid-treated blisters compared with control values. Protein concentrations and blister fluid volumes were also significantly decreased in healing 3 -day blisters after steroid treatment.

The protein encoded by the ET-like gene showed 40, 59, and 68 % amino acid sequence identities with exfoliative toxin A (ETA), exfoliative toxin B (ETB), and Staphylococcus hyicus ETB (ShETB), respectively. When injected into neonatal mice, the recombinant protein derived from the ET-like gene induced exfoliation of the skin with loss of cell-to-cell adhesion in {{the upper part of}} the epidermis as observed in histological examinations, just as was found in neonatal mice injected with ETA or ETB. Western blot analysis indicated that the recombinant protein is serologically distinct from ETA and ETB. Therefore, the product encoded by this new ORF is a new ET member produced by S. aureus and is termed ETD. ETD did <b>not</b> induce <b>blisters</b> in 1 -day-old chickens. In the skins of mice injected with ETD, cell surface staining of desmoglein 1 (Dsg 1), a cadherin type cell-to-cell adhesion molecule in desmosomes, was abolished without affecting that of desmoglein 3 (Dsg 3). Furthermore, in vitro incubation of the recombinant extracellular domains of Dsg 1 and Dsg 3 with the recombinant protein demonstrated that both mouse and human Dsg 1, but not Dsg 3, were directly cleaved in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that ETD and ETA induce blister formation by identical pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical strains positive for edin-B were suggested to be clonally associated, and all edin-B-positive strains tested were positive for etd. Among 18 etd-positive strains, 12 produced ETD extracellularly. Interestingly, these strains are mainly isolated from other sources of infections and not from patients with bullous impetigo or staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. This strongly suggests that ETD might play a pathogenic role in a broader spectrum of bacterial infections than previously considered...|$|R
