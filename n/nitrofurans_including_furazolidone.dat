40|$|It is {{accepted}} {{that the success}} of Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment using standard triple therapy is declining. Resistance, particularly to clarithromycin, has been shown in numerous countries to be rising to a level where the use of standard triple therapy in its current form may no longer be justified. The two major factors influencing resistance are prior exposure to the antibiotic and compliance with therapy. Regimes based on bismuth and levofloxacin, which had previously been mainly second-line options, are now emerging as superior first-line options. Trials of sequential and concomitant therapies are also showing the usefulness of these treatments in different populations. Options for third and subsequent line therapies <b>include</b> <b>furazolidone</b> and rifabutin-based regimes. Susceptibility testing should be performed to maintain accurate data on resistance levels, and has also clinical utility in difficult to eradicate cases. None of these, however, will be successful unless compliance is improved upon. If compliance is assured and eradication confirmation pursued, it has been repeatedly illustrated that near full eradication is achievable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{resistance}} to clarithromycin and nitroimidazole {{is the main}} cause of failure in the Helicobacter pylori eradication. The ideal retreatment regimen remains unclear, especially in developing countries, where the infection presents high prevalence and {{resistance to}} antibiotics. The study aimed at determining the efficacy, compliance and adverse effects of a regimen that <b>included</b> <b>furazolidone,</b> levofloxacin and lansoprazole in patients with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection, who had failed to respond to at least one prior eradication treatment regimen. Methods This study included 48 patients with peptic ulcer disease. Helicobacter pylori infection was confirmed by a rapid urease test and histological examination of samples obtained from the antrum and corpus during endoscopy. The eradication therapy consisted of a 7 -day twice daily oral administration of lansoprazole 30 mg, furazolidone 200 mg and levofloxacin 250 mg. Therapeutic success was confirmed by a negative rapid urease test, histological examination and 14 C- urea breath test, performed 12 weeks after treatment completion. The Chi-square method was used for comparisons among eradication rates, previous treatments and previous furazolidone use. Results Only one of the 48 patients failed to take all medications, which was due to adverse effects (vomiting). Per-protocol and intention-to-treat eradication rates were 89 % (95 % CI- 89 %– 99 %) and 88 % (88 – 92 %), respectively. Mild and moderate adverse effects were reported by 41 patients (85 %). For patients with one previous treatment failure, the eradication rate was 100 %. Compared to furazolidone-naïve patients, eradication rates were lower in those who had failed prior furazolidone-containing regimen(s) (74 % vs. 100 %, p = 0. 002). Conclusion An empiric salvage-regimen <b>including</b> levofloxacin, <b>furazolidone</b> and lansoprazole is very effective in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, particularly in patients that have failed one prior eradication therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of an assay to measure the sensitivity of drugs against Blastocystis hominis using the incorporation of 3 H-hypoxanthine is described. The activity of 42 compounds have been measured. Four of the 5 -nitroimidazoles tested (satranida-zole, S 75 0400 A, flunidazole and ronidazole) {{were found to be}} more active than metronidazole, the drug commonly used to treat infections caused by B. hominis in humans. Other potentially useful compounds <b>include</b> emetine, <b>furazolidone</b> and quinacrine. Ketoconazole and iodoquinol reported to have therapeutic activity in infections caused by this parasite were found to be significantly less active than metronidazole...|$|R

These <b>include</b> <b>nitrofurans</b> derivatives {{as well as}} 2 and 5 -nitroimidazoles. Most work has been performed with misonidazole for which it appears that, at 37 degree C, the concentration of drug required to produce a given level of cell killing is inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} exposure time.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{described}} for monitoring four <b>nitrofuran</b> metabolites <b>including</b> 5 -methylmorpholino- 3 amino- 2 -oxazolidinone (AMOZ), 3 -amino- 2 -oxazolidone (ADZ), 1 -amino-hydantoin (AHD) and semicarbazide (SEM) in aquatic products. The analytes were quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry operating in positive ion multiple monitoring mode (MRM) after 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde derivatization. The matrix calibration curve was established with correlation coefficient (R- 2 > 0. 99) {{in the range}} of 1 - 100 ng ml(- 1). Limit of detection and limit of quantification for all analytes were 0. 5 and 1. 5 pg kg- 1, respectively. Recovery rates and relative standard deviations ranged from 88 % to 112 % and 2 % to 4 %, respectively. The validated method was successfully applied to detect nitrofuran metabolites in 120 fish samples. The analytes were detected in 6 / 16 species of fish samples, with a total detection rate of 6. 5 %. AOZ was most frequently detected (8. 3 %), followed by AMOZ (7. 5 %), AHD (5. 0 %) and SEM (5. 0 %). The method is proposed for monitoring nitrofuran metabolites in aquatic products.

40|$|The {{effect of}} fresh whole milk without {{pasteurization}} or other pretreatment on in vitro antibacterial activity of selected compounds was determined in broth dilution. The milk was collected by hand directly from dairy goats, or by syringe or cannula from bovine quarters showing low bacterial counts. Antibacterial activity was determined in 50 % (v/v) milk-broth medium against sensitive mastitis-etiologic strains of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. The indicator salt 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride was {{incorporated in the}} milk broth medium to determine inoculum growth. Contaminant interference was circumvented through early as well as late readings and comparisons with uninoculated control tubes, with and without the test compounds. Application of the method with more than 75 compounds, <b>including</b> <b>nitrofurans,</b> antibiotics, and other chemicals uncovered marked degrees of milk interference. The method warrants routine use among preliminary screens to relate in vitro with in vivo observations of antimicrobial activity. Similar procedures may be used with serum, skim milk, or mastitis-milk media for separating effects due to protein, lipid, or other elements in product evaluation...|$|R
2500|$|Residues {{from the}} {{breakdown}} of <b>nitrofuran</b> veterinary antibiotics, <b>including</b> nitrofurantoin, {{have been found in}} chicken in Vietnam, China, Brazil, and Thailand. The European Union banned the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in ANNEX IV (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has prohibited furaltadone since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a [...] "zero tolerance or no residue standard". In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-two {{different}} types of anaerobic bacteria isolated from chickens have been tested for anti-salmonella activity in vitro. Under {{the conditions of the}} test only Bacteroides hypermegas and a Bifidobacterium sp. were shown to inhibit the salmonellas and this was attributed to the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA's) coupled with a low pH. When these organisms were tested in newly hatched chicks no inhibition of S. typhimurium occurred. Possible explanations for this observation are considered. The pH value and concentration of VFA's in the caecal material were determined in chicks from 0 - 84 days. In vitro tests with S. typhimurium indicated that, whilst the organism would be able to multiply at the pH and concentration of VFA's found during the first few days after hatching, the rapid increase in VFA concentration during the first 21 days would make this increasingly difficult. The significance of the developing caecal flora in relation to VFA production and pH is discussed. Because certain feed additives are known to influence the carriage of salmonellas, the sensitivity of various caecal anaerobes to these compounds was determined in vitro, generally at 1, 10 and 100 microgram/ml. The additives tested <b>included</b> flavomycin, <b>furazolidone,</b> nitrovin, tetracyline, tylosin, sulphaquinoxaline, virginiamycin and zinc bacitracin. All the organisms tested were inhibited by 100 microgram/ml furazolidone; none were inhibited by 500 microgram/ml sulphaquinoxaline. Changes occurring in the VFA concentration, pH value and microflora of the caeca of chicks fed for 49 days or longer on a normal starter diet or the same diet containing 10 or 100 mg/kg nitrovin have been compared. When the chicks were fed on the diet containing 100 mg/kg nitrovin, the Gram-negative non-sporing anaerobes were eliminated as {{a significant part of the}} caecal flora. However, the VFA concentration combined with a low pH in chicks from 2 weeks onwards was still sufficient to inhibit salmonella multiplication. Other possibly interrelated factors which might lead to an increased salmonella carrier rate in the nitrovin-treated chickens are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Initial {{resistance}} to antibiotics {{is the main reason}} for the failure of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in children. Objectives: As we commonly face high antibiotic resistance rates in children, we aimed to determine the susceptibility of H. pylori to common antibiotics. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional in vitro study, 169 children younger than 14 years with clinical diagnosis of peptic ulcer underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Biopsy specimens from stomach and duodenum were cultured. In isolated colonies, tests of catalase, urease, and oxidase as well as gram staining were performed. After confirming the colonies as H. pylori, the antibiogram was obtained using disk diffusion method. Results: Culture for H. pylori was positive in 12. 3 % of the specimens, urease test in 21. 3 %, serological test in 18. 9 % and stool antigen test was positive in 21. 9 %. We could show high specificity but moderate sensitivity of both histological and H. pylori stool antigen tests to detect H. pylori. The overall susceptibility to metronidazole was 42. 9 %, amoxicillin 95. 2 %, clarithromycin 85. 7 %, furazolidone 61. 9 %, azithromycin 81. 0 %, and tetracycline 76. 2 % with the highest {{resistance to}} metronidazole and the lowest to clarithromycin. Conclusions: In our region, there is high resistance of H. pylori to some antibiotics <b>including</b> metronidazole and <b>furazolidone</b> among affected children. To reduce the prevalence of this antibiotic resistance, more controlled use of antibiotics should be considered i...|$|R
40|$|Nitrofurans are {{synthetic}} broad-spectrum antimicobial {{agents that}} are often used in commercial animal production because of their excellent antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties. However, nitrofurans and their metabolites {{have been shown to}} have potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic characteristics which has led to a ban on the use of nitrofurans in preventive and therapeutic treatment of animals used for food production. Metabolites of nitrofurans that can be determined after their application are: a metabolite of furazolidone, furaltadone metabolite, a metabolite of nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone metabolite. The presence of residues of nitrofuran antibiotics in meat, fish and shrimps, and milk and eggs originating from countries outside the European Union is monitored and recorded by the RASFF system of the European Union. Furthermore, since nitrofurans are used in some countries as prophylactic agents and growth promoters, it is necessary to carry out constant control of various types of food of animal origin, in order to reduce to the minimum potential carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of these supstances for the health of consumers. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is no permanent control of nitrofurans in food of animal origin. The provisions of the „Regulation on the maximum allowable amounts of veterinary drugs and pesticides in products of animal origin", published in the Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina state the prohibiting of the use of certain veterinary drugs in animals intended for human consumption, <b>including</b> <b>nitrofurans.</b> The European Union has established the minimum required limit (MRLP) for performance which is 1 μg/kg of nitrofurans for edible tissues of animal origin. Taking all this into account, methods for nitrofurans detection should be accreditated and validated, both for screening and confirmatory methods, and further research into the presence of nitrofurans in food of animal origin in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be performed...|$|R
