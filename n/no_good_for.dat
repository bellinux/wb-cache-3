Any ungifted child of the Lord Rahl must die. A stranger convinces her that running will do her <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> wherever she goes, Lord Rahl's soldiers will find her; it is time for her to stop fleeing and fight back. If she wants to live, she must kill Lord Rahl.|$|E
500|$|The war had a {{significant}} influence on Moore's life - he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because [...] "there {{was no one else}} for me... second best is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> me... I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be." [...] In his autobiography he said that after sixty years he still thought about her, and because of her death [...] "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down." [...] In May 2012 he said to the Radio Times magazine, [...] "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance". He also said, in the same interview, that [...] "The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut." [...] However, some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, as researchers have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.|$|E
500|$|The {{visit of}} Manchester United on 28 March 2004 {{provided}} a stern test for Arsenal; {{it was both}} clubs' first meeting since the fiasco at Old Trafford. Cole, injured in the midweek Champions League game against Chelsea, was replaced by Clichy in the starting line-up, while Bergkamp was dropped for Reyes. Henry gave Arsenal the lead, with a long range shot that swerved past goalkeeper Roy Carroll. With five minutes of the game left, Louis Saha evaded the Arsenal defence and scored the equaliser for Manchester United. Arsenal came close to a winner in injury time, only for Lauren to have his shot saved. The draw was <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager of Manchester United, who afterwards conceded his team's chances: [...] "They'll (Arsenal) go {{on to win the}} league now – I'm sure of that. They are playing with great determination … a very strong team, so should win the league really". In avoiding defeat, Arsenal set a new all-time league record of 30 matches unbeaten {{from the start of the}} season, originally held by Leeds and Liverpool. They remained in first position at the end of March and were seven points in front of Chelsea, with eight matches remaining.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were {{positive}} {{and focused on the}} novel methods used to attract the audience to the theater. The Moving Picture World stated, [...] "A burlesque picture which becomes more thrilling as it proceeds. The convict is supposed to have escaped and the way he is chased and surrounded bodes <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> him. But somehow he manages to elude the steadily increasing army of pursuers until they are gathered around him, when he calmly shows a motion picture announcement, and the reason for all this melee, in which the whole countryside took part, becomes apparent." [...] The requirement that the fleeing [...] "convict" [...] be continually assisted {{as a part of the}} plot may have been lost on The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer. The reviewer writes, [...] "Perhaps, in real life, things might not happen so luckily for the convict unless the carriage, the boat and the automobile were previously arranged for him. Even then, Fate might conceivably have some disagreeable card up her sleeve. In the film, at any rate, everybody bit nicely. They pursued the escaped convict in increasing crowds until he led them to the theatre he was advertising. There they all obligingly bought tickets to the show and, no doubt, enjoyed it hugely. They did if it was as good as the film is. The least interesting sections of the film are the telephone messages exchanged by agitated police officials; but they set off the livelier adventures of the convict with agreeable contrast." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News identified the set up and assistance to [...] "the convict" [...] and states,"In spite of the Thanhouser folk joining in the racket and the peculiar readiness of carriage and automobile and boat to help the gentleman in a costume, not used in this state for some two years, the audience did not 'catch on.' When the revelation came, at the door of the New Rochelle picture show, the theatre rang with laughter. We were all 'stung' and we enjoyed it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{least two}} {{variants}} {{of a conspiracy}} theory about the massacre have been promoted.

If all the evidence was heard, then maybe it would have provided some closure and stopped the proliferation of conspiracy theories that sprang up over the years." ...|$|E

2500|$|These contractions {{are either}} {{independent}} words or (in {{the cases of}} con-, com-, dis-, -self) affixes, as in [...] oneself. They cannot be treated as simple letters. For example, while the letter [...] stands for the pronoun it, it cannot substitute for the sequence it in the word bite. They cannot be pluralized: * is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> [...] "(tin) cans". This is true even of [...] child not being usable for *grandchild, nor [...] out in *without. (These must be spelled g-r-and-ch-i-l-d and with-ou-t.) However, a following apostrophe is acceptable: [...] people's, [...] can't, [...] it'll; as are hyphenated words like so-and-so. This behavior is distinct from ligatures such as [...] and [...] , which are used when the equivalent sequences are found in printed English, as in [...] red and [...] need.|$|E
2500|$|Not all of {{the local}} farmers were {{grateful}} for his efforts, with some sneering at the city-slicker playing the farmer, and others expressing disappointed that the fertilizers Kenji introduced were not having the desired effects. He advocated natural fertilizers, while many preferred a Western chemical 'fix', which, when it failed, did not stop many from blaming Kenji. [...] It may also have mattered that reservations persisted about him because he hadn't broken wholly with his economic dependence on his father, to whom farmers were often indebted when their crops failed, while his defection to the Lotus Sect soured their view, since farmers in his area were, like his own father, adherents of the Pure Land Sect. Kenji in turn did not hold an ideal view of the farmers; {{in one of his}} poems he describes how a farmer bluntly tells him that all his efforts have done <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> anyone.|$|E

If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It’s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say “Subtract income tax from pay” instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.”“ ...|$|E
