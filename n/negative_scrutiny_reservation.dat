Copernicus himself had communicated to Osiander his [...] "own fears that his work would be scrutinized and criticized by the 'peripatetics and theologians'," [...] and he had already been in trouble with his bishop, Johannes Dantiscus, on account of his former relationship with his mistress and friendship with Dantiscus's enemy and suspected heretic, Alexander Scultetus. It was also possible that Protestant Nurnberg could fall to the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and since [...] "the books of hostile theologians could be burned...why not scientific works with the names of hated theologians affixed to them?"

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Currently, the {{predominant}} view in research ethics maintains that physicians can morally justify offering randomized clinical trial enrollment to their patients only if {{some form of}} equipoise is present. Thus, the physician must experience (either individually or communally) a state of reasoned uncertainty concerning {{the relative merits of}} two or more competing treatments for a given disease before she may recommend that her patient participate in a clinical trial. Increasingly, however, this position has been subject to critical attention and considerable <b>negative</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> My argument engages this trend by turning to the history of philosophy; here I claim that {{the use of the term}} “equipoise” in the medical research context is extremely similar to terms and concepts from the philosophical tradition of skepticism, and as a result of this similarity it is possible to understand the principle of equipoise’s vulnerability to already published criticisms. A comparison of the criticisms of equipoise within the medical research literature to criticisms of philosophical skepticism reveals a potentially grim future for equipoise as a legitimate guiding principle for the ethical conduct of clinical research...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Parents' {{experience}} considerable anxiety concerning when to {{seek help}} for a sick child. This paper explores findings, from a doctoral research project, which contribute {{to the understanding of}} parents' decision making at these times. Method: This grounded theory study used 24 in-depth interviews in 4 rounds of data collection to explore psychosocial processes in 15 families when children are acutely ill at home. Analysis followed the tenets of Glaserian grounded theory methodology until theoretical saturation was reached. Results: Families strive to 'do the right thing' for their child, and to 'contain acute childhood illness within family life' - the core category of the grounded theory. Informal social rules regarding expected behaviour are learnt through 'felt or enacted criticism' during parent's encounters with others, when their children are ill. Consequently parents take action to avoid exposure to such <b>negative</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> sometimes resulting in late consultation for more serious illness. Conclusions: The findings indicate a need to develop professionals' skills in facilitating family care through positive learning experiences rather than felt or enacted criticism. Take home message: Health care professionals need to identify and reduce felt or enacted criticism experienced by families when seeking help for a sick child so that families help seeking behaviour can be positively enhance...|$|R
50|$|Social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD; {{also known as}} social phobia) describes an intense fear and avoidance of <b>negative</b> public <b>scrutiny,</b> public embarrassment, humiliation, or social interaction. This fear can be specific to particular social situations (such as public speaking) or, more typically, is experienced in most (or all) social interactions. Social anxiety often manifests specific physical symptoms, including blushing, sweating, and difficulty speaking.

40|$|Objective: To {{present the}} {{grounded}} theory of ‘containing acute childhood illness within family life’ and discuss {{its implications for}} family care. Methods: Glaserian grounded theory qualitative study comprised of 24 in-depth family interviews with 15 families. QRS NVivo software was used to facilitate constant comparative analysis and the generation of the grounded theory. Results: This doctoral qualitative study shows that acute childhood illness at home is often distressing for children and their families. Families strive to ‘do the right thing’ for their child, and, in response to perceived informal social rules, to ‘contain acute childhood illness within family life’ – the core category. Illnesses which {{they are expected to}} contain are those defined as minor or normal, whilst illness the family defines as ‘real’ are those for which medical help should be sought. Informal social rules are learnt through ‘felt or enacted criticism’ during parent’s encounters with others, in childcare, education and health services, when their children are ill - perceived as a threat to parents’ moral status. Consequently parents take action to avoid exposure to such <b>negative</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> sometimes resulting in late consultation. Families appear to be responding to the pervading culture of individualism within society, containing their difficulties – in this case their child’s illness – within the immediate family group. Conclusions: The findings indicate a need to develop professionals’ skills in facilitating family care, reducing the incidence of felt or enacted criticism, and the ‘hidden anxiety’ for families when seeking help for a sick child...|$|R

40|$|David Strang, Richard Swedberg, Michael LounsburyThis paper {{examines}} the forces driving {{the adoption of}} an accounting practice, stock option expensing (SOE), among the Fortune 500 {{in the wake of}} the recent corporate scandals. I argue that in the ensuing debates and challenges to the legitimacy of existing institutional frameworks governing corporate behavior, SOE became a symbol of normative legitimacy and a way for organizations to defend against threats to their own legitimacy. In analyzing the effects of different types of legitimacy threats, the results indicate that organizations in industries that were under intensive levels of investigation were more likely to adopt SOE, but that <b>negative</b> media <b>scrutiny</b> and shareholder activism did not influence SOE adoption. The results also suggest that as the Financial Accounting Standards Board threatened to require SOE, the significance of the practice as a symbol of normative legitimacy began to diminish. The findings broaden and deepen our understanding of how organizations engage in symbolic practice adoption to defend their legitimacy as well as the processes shaping the social construction of accounting practices. This paper also provides empirical support for recent theoretical claims regarding legitimacy defense and expands upon recent work that has made links between the impression management literature and neoinstitutional theory...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{facilitate}} the clinical implementation of genomic medicine by next-generation sequencing, {{it will be}} critically important to obtain accurate and consistent variant calls on personal genomes. Multiple software tools for variant calling are available, but {{it is unclear how}} comparable these tools are or what their relative merits in real-world scenarios might be. METHODS: We sequenced 15 exomes from four families using commercial kits (Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and Agilent SureSelect version 2 capture kit), with approximately 120 X mean coverage. We analyzed the raw data using near-default parameters with five different alignment and variant-calling pipelines (SOAP, BWA-GATK, BWA-SNVer, GNUMAP, and BWA-SAMtools). We additionally sequenced a single whole genome using the sequencing and analysis pipeline from Complete Genomics (CG), with 95 % of the exome region being covered by 20 or more reads per base. Finally, we validated 919 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 841 insertions and deletions (indels), including similar fractions of GATK-only, SOAP-only, and shared calls, on the MiSeq platform by amplicon sequencing with approximately 5000 X mean coverage. RESULTS: SNV concordance between five Illumina pipelines across all 15 exomes was 57. 4 %, while 0. 5 to 5. 1 % of variants were called as unique to each pipeline. Indel concordance was only 26. 8 % between three indel-calling pipelines, even after left-normalizing and intervalizing genomic coordinates by 20 base pairs. There were 11 % of CG variants falling within targeted regions in exome sequencing that were not called by any of the Illumina-based exome analysis pipelines. Based on targeted amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform, 97. 1 %, 60. 2 %, and 99. 1 % of the GATK-only, SOAP-only and shared SNVs could be validated, but only 54. 0 %, 44. 6 %, and 78. 1 % of the GATK-only, SOAP-only and shared indels could be validated. Additionally, our analysis of two families (one with four individuals and the other with seven), demonstrated additional accuracy gained in variant discovery by having access to genetic data from a multi-generational family. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that more caution should be exercised in genomic medicine settings when analyzing individual genomes, including interpreting positive and <b>negative</b> findings with <b>scrutiny,</b> especially for indels. We advocate for renewed collection and sequencing of multi-generational families to increase the overall accuracy of whole genomes...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of one of Australia’s most prestigious and influential literary prizes: the Children’s Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Award. It aims to clarify the reasons the award {{was part of the}} brief when the Children’s Book Council was created in 1945, and {{to determine the extent to}} which the award’s subsequent development has continued to meet its stated objectives. The study focuses on a single category: that of Older Readers. To be eligible for judging in this category, entries must be: 'outstanding books of fiction, drama or poetry which require of the reader a degree of maturity to appreciate the topics, themes and scope of emotional involvement. Generally, books in this category will be appropriate in style and content for readers in their secondary years of schooling'. (CBCA 2009, p. 4) For the first ten years of the award’s history, there was just one category, Book of the Year, and definition by the age of a book’s implied readers only began in 1982, when Junior Book of the Year was introduced. In 1987, the two non-picture book categories were renamed Book of the Year: Older Readers and Book of the Year: Younger Readers. Leaving aside the erratic development of the Picture Book of the Year category, which will be outlined in chapter 2, effectively for most of its history, the Older Readers category is the Book of the Year. The two remain practically synonymous today in media coverage of the awards and for those reasons alone, the restricting of this study to the Older Readers category would be valid. This is the Children’s Book Council’s flagship award. But because since the 1960 s this category has been a highly contested site for defining ‘childhood’ and ‘literature’, {{an examination of}} its development yields significant findings about the function of the Children’s Book Council (‘the CBC’) overall. This study interrogates the CBC’s claim that the role of the Book of the Year is simply to uphold standards of literary excellence. The clear implication is that its judges have no agenda other than adherence to these standards and that they are universally agreed. By considering the evolution of the awards in both historical and cultural contexts, the study aims to define the agenda of the Book of the Year in greater detail. It then tests that agenda in individual case studies of six winning novels in the Older Readers category. Each of the texts for case study is by a writer who has been acknowledged in the awards more than once – in some cases many times. So the study aims to determine the ways in which the text in question and its writer’s work as a whole are aligned with the criteria the awards are based on. The case studies cover a 20 -year period of rapid growth in the Australian publishing industry and in the influence of the CBC. They focus on the following winners: Bread and Honey by Ivan Southall (1971) The Ice is Coming by Patricia Wrightson (1978) So Much to Tell You by John Marsden (1988) Beyond the Labyrinth by Gillian Rubinstein (1989) Strange Objects by Gary Crew (1991) Looking for Alibrandi by Melina Marchetta (1993) The awards given to these novels represent significant moments in the ongoing conversation between the CBC and its constituents and within the organisation itself about the process of choosing books for young readers. Should a winning book focus on Australian subject matter? Should it demonstrate inclusiveness of gender, sexuality, race, other physical differences and social class? Are city dwellers still interested in the bush and the outback? Will boys read novels about girls? Are young readers today interested in history? Do young Australians prefer realist narratives? Do they – or their adult carers – demand narrative closure? Should the language of a Book of the Year be high-end literary, or accessible to readers with a wider range of abilities? How frank can it be in its treatment of sex, drugs and violence? What effect does using books in the classroom have on young people’s enthusiasm for reading? This study pursues such questions in order to clarify the CBC’s role in directing the conversation and its objectives in doing so. There is, of course, a parallel conversation about the kinds of book young readers themselves choose, but the CBC has never regarded this as its main concern. It is only due to public pressure in recent years that the Book of the Year awards handbook advises judges to ‘ensure that their evaluation takes into account the responses of children who have read the books’ (CBCA 2009, p. 9) and somewhat perfunctorily at that, so that the CBC cannot be accused of indifference to the issue of popularity. The organisation has generally left this conversation to the state-based children’s choice awards and to the growing number of websites that invite young readers to blog or post reviews. An endorsement from the Children’s Book Council can have a direct influence on the income of all those involved in the production and distribution of a book, as well as a less tangible, but potentially more important, influence on the reading experience of thousands of children. And because the influence is frequently negative, there have been objections to it throughout the organ-isation’s history. There has been little sustained and reasoned analysis of that influence, however, perhaps due to a fear of diminishing its positive aspects while exposing the <b>negative.</b> Close <b>scrutiny</b> may also have been delayed by the fact that the CBC’s members are an enthusiastic band of volunteers who have had to fight against the subordination of children’s literature – unless the delay itself is further proof of that subordination. And although aspects of this study will not please the CBC, it is not intended as an attack. Indeed it should be read as an acknowledgment that the CBC has been extraordinarily successful in achieving the aims set out in its constitution. On the other hand, the study argues that one of its undisclosed concerns has been the shoring up of a narrowly defined and reactionary set of literary and cultural values and its own power to ensure that they are maintained. The aim of this study is not to invalidate the considerable pleasure many have derived from the work of the CBC. Nor is it intended to fuel the resentment of the many producers and distributors who feel they have been burned over the years by the CBC judges’ decisions. Ironically by constructing itself as the last bastion of universally accepted values in the assessment of literature, the CBC may be undermining its ability to promote the enjoyment of books by children and threatening its own continued growth. So if the present writer may be allowed a personal wish, it is that the study may be read not just as a critical history of a remarkable cultural phenomenon, but also read by those who care about children and books and the Children’s Book Council as a wake-up call...|$|R
