5000|$|The {{contract}} was simple and straightforward. The company, CIC, promised {{to maintain and}} provide the specified accommodation type (a studio, one bedroom, or two bedroom unit) {{for use by the}} [...] "license owner" [...] for a period of 25 years (until 1999 from 1974, for example) in the specified season and number of weeks agreed upon, with only two extra charges: a $15.00 per diem (per <b>night)</b> <b>rate,</b> frozen at that cost {{for the life of the}} contract. The contract had a $25.00 switching fee, should the licensee decide to use their time at one of the other resorts. The {{contract was}} based on the fact that the cost of the license, and the small per diem, compared with the projected increase in the cost of hotel rates over 25 years to over $100.00 per night, would save the license owner many vacation dollars over the span of the license agreement. Between 1974 and 1999, in the United States, inflation boosted the current cost of the per diem to $52.00, validating the cost savings assumption. The license owner was allowed to rent, or give their week away as a gift in any particular year. The only stipulation was that the $15.00 per diem must be paid every year whether the unit was occupied or not. This [...] "must be paid yearly fee" [...] would become the roots of what is known today as [...] "maintenance fees", once the Florida Department of Real Estate became involved in regulating timeshares.|$|E

40|$|We {{report an}} {{indication}} that the elastic scattering rate of solar ^ 8 B neutrinos with electrons in the Super-Kamiokande detector is larger when the neutrinos pass through the Earth during nighttime. We determine the day/night asymmetry, defined as the difference of the average day rate and average <b>night</b> <b>rate</b> divided by the average of those two rates, to be (- 3. 2 ± 1. 1 (stat) ± 0. 5 (syst)) %, which deviates from zero by 2. 7 σ. Since the elastic scattering process is mostly sensitive to electron-flavored solar neutrinos, a non-zero day/night asymmetry implies that the flavor oscillations of solar neutrinos are affected by the presence of matter within the neutrinos' flight path. Super-Kamiokande's day/night asymmetry is consistent with neutrino oscillations for 4 × 10 ^- 5 eV^ 2 ≤Δ m^ 2 _ 21 ≤ 7 × 10 ^- 5 eV^ 2 and large mixing values of θ_ 12, at the 68 % C. L.

Parallel records of water temperature, air temperature, windspccd, and solar irradiance permitted calculation of gross and net primary production and photosynthesis-irradiance relationships. Nighttime respiration rates generally matched oxygen de-pletion rates in pond water, indicating that incubation-based rates were representative of a quickly darkened pond community throughout the day. Daytime rates averaged nearly 2 times the mean <b>night</b> <b>rate</b> and 58 % higher than the mean day rate determined by a typical interpolation used in free-water production calculations.

40|$|BACKGROUND. <b>Rates</b> of <b>night</b> visiting {{by general}} {{practitioners}} have increased steadily {{over the last}} 30 years and vary widely between general practices. AIM. An ecological study was carried out to examine <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> by general practices in one family health services authority, and {{to determine the extent}} to which differences in <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> between practices could be explained by patient and practice characteristics. METHOD. The study examined the variation in annual <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates,</b> based on <b>night</b> visit fees claimed between April 1993 and March 1994, among 129 general practices in Merton, Sutton and Wandsworth Family Health Services Authority, London. RESULTS. Practices' annual <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> varied from three per 1000 to 75 per 1000 patients. The percentages of the practice population aged under five years and aged five to 14 years were both positively correlated with <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> (r = 0. 38 and r = 0. 35, respectively), as were variables associated with social deprivation such as the estimated percentage of the practice population living in one-parent households (r = 0. 24) and in households where the head of household was classified as unskilled (r = 0. 20). The percentage of the practice population reporting chronic illness was also positively associated with <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> (r = 0. 26). The percentages of the practice population aged 35 to 44 years and 45 to 54 years were both negatively associated with <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> (r = - 0. 34 and r = - 0. 31, respectively) as was the estimated list inflation for a practice (r = - 0. 31). There was no significant correlation between <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> and the distance of the main practice surgery from the nearest hospital accident and emergency department. There was also no association between <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> and permission to use a deputizing service. In a stepwise multiple regression model, the multiple correlation coefficient was 0. 56 with four factors (percentage of the practice population aged under five years, percentage aged 35 - 44 years, percentage who were chronically ill and estimated list inflation) explaining 32 % of the variation in <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates.</b> CONCLUSION. Only about one third of the variation in <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> between practices could be explained by patient and practice variables derived from routine data. Population-based research using data collected on individual patients and practices is required to improve current understanding of the patient and practice characteristics that influence the demand for night visits and of why <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> vary so widely between practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary energy}} costs of {{building}} materials and structures are discussed and comparisons are made between typical dwelling types. The economics of alternative wall, roof and floor constructions, providing {{various levels of}} insulationy are examined. Costs are assessed {{for a number of}} periods from 1970 to early 1980 for heating by gas and <b>night</b> <b>rate</b> electricity. The effect of price changes-on the economic attractiveness of insulation is investigated and the likely effects of future price rises are considered. It is concluded that, in certain circumstances, higher levels of insulation than those normally used in the UK have been economically attractive {{for the last few years}} and may possibly become more so. A survey of over fifty local authority houses with central heating, carried out by the author in Spring 1978, is described. Three types of houses of similar size were involved, having gas-fired 'wet' systems, and ducted warm air heating from electric storage and gas-fired units respectively. The survey was designed to determine certain aspects of occupant behaviour relevant to fuel consumption. Using regression techniques, relationships are obtained which explain more than two thirds of the variance of mean useful energy input rate between the houses of a given type in cold weather in terms of hours of use of central heating window opening habits, and for warm air heating, the closing of outlet registers. It was also revealed that for the house types with gas-fired heating the number of hours of use of the central heating was strongly influenced by household size and occupancy patterns. The implications for building design of the effects of occupant behaviour and of financial and energy costs are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the time–of–night variation of solar neutrino rate {{which will be}} of relevance to Super–Kamioka and Sudbury neutrino detectors {{in the framework of}} oscillations among the three flavors. An analytical method of computing the regeneration in the earth is presented. If day-night effect is seen, we show how the study of the time–of–night variation will allow the determination of the neutrino parameters. 1 It has been known for quite some time that an asymmetry between <b>night</b> <b>rate</b> and day rate for the real time solar neutrino detectors is an unambiguous signal for neutrino mixing and oscillations. Conversely the absence of such an effect can put constraints on the neutrino masses and mixing angles. Although no day–night asymmetry outside the error–bars was seen at the Kamioka detector [1, 2] the high statistics detectors like Super-Kamioka [3], SNO [4]and Borexino [5] will be much more effective in investigating this effect. If there is a day-night asymmetry, then the profile of the asymmetry {{as a function of the}} time during night is a very sensitive function of the neutrino parameters. The counting rates in these detectors are expected to be high enough for the study of this time–of–night variation. The aim of this note is to focus attention on this aspect of the day–night effect [6], in view of the fact that Super–Kamioka has already started functioning and SNO is expected to do so soon. The neutrino samples different amounts of matter in the earth during a single night and also during a year. The distance d travelled by the neutrino inside the earth during night, as a function of time t, is given by where d = 2 R(sin φl sin δ + cosφl cosδ cos (2 π...|$|E
