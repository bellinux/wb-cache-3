25|$|For example, in 1768, {{when asked}} by the {{authorities}} in Copenhagen whether there still lived old nobility in the districts Senja and Troms in Northern Norway, a Danish-rooted official wrote: ‘Of old nobility I know <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> in the north, but here is far too much farmer nobility or Benkestok nobility!’ As an immigrant to the region, he was unfamiliar with the strong feeling of pride among the so-called page nobility (see below) and the farmers of aristocratic origin.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E

500|$|The four {{movements}} (2,3,5 and 6) placed symmetrically {{around the}} central New Testament {{passage in the}} fourth movement, are all settings of Madrigal-style verse. The second movement is a setting of a lengthy text beginning [...] "" [...] (The Lord provides: He pours his riches down on us; without this <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> on earth would flourish). Bach set it as an unadorned secco recitative, without arioso episodes, accompanied by bare sustained notes in the continuo. The bass soloist proclaims that God's abundant gifts should be shared with the poor and lowly; and that consideration for the needy, not wealth used for tributes, will find favour with God.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{nominated}} for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Musical Direction, but the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) neglected to include the title on the ballots for Emmy nominations in 2002. NATAS attempted to remedy this by mailing a postcard informing its voters {{that it should be}} included, but the episode did not win. NATAS' oversight, according to the Washington Post, was [...] "another example of the lack of industry respect afforded one of television's most consistently clever shows". Ogle in The Miami Herald vigorously protests this omission, writing, [...] "he most astonishing, entertaining hour (hour plus, actually) of TV in the past year slips by virtually unnoticed. <b>Nothing</b> <b>here</b> is real; <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> is right. Buffy the Vampire Slayers musical episode, 'Once More, with Feeling', registers a paltry outstanding music direction nomination. Nice for the musical directors. A stake through the aspirations of writer/director Joss Whedon, the beating creative heart of Buffy, the only TV writer brave and clever enough to use horror as one great big wonderful metaphor for growing up 'Once More, with Feeling' is TV of a different sort, something that comes along once in a lifetime and should not be buried but celebrated and rewarded." [...] The episode was also nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation Hugo Award and a Best Script Nebula Award, both given for excellence in science fiction and fantasy writing. In 2009 TV Guide ranked the episode #14 on its list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time".|$|E

Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: [...] "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal." [...] The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. [...] "More and more", she wrote, [...] "we {{have come to the conclusion}} that we can do <b>nothing</b> <b>here.</b> And as we can not keep up a life of inactivity much longer we have decided to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast. Rowat said, [...] "In his previous films, Marshall made {{something out of}} <b>nothing.</b> <b>Here</b> he does the opposite". The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there {{has to be something}} more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director he knows how to extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers." ...|$|E

Coleman described [...] "Rockestra Theme" [...] and [...] "So Glad to See You Here" [...] as [...] "creditable, rolling, raunchy and at least efficient, with Paul's voice at its rocking best on the last named track", but concluded: [...] "This album gets Wings nowhere..." [...] Billboards reviewer gave Back to the Egg [...] "Spotlight" [...] status (meaning [...] "the most outstanding new product of the week's releases and that with the greatest potential for top of the chart placement") and commented: [...] "The music features typical McCartney fare of late with <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> that will distinguish it as one of his classics.

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling it a [...] "tragedy," [...] but [...] "funnier than [...] expected." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club noted that there are [...] "funny lines tucked {{around the edges of}} every episode [...] but there's <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> that justifies the needlessly {{elaborate}} plots." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad gave the episode a more positive review, stating that Peter's attempts to bond with his children [...] "brought some of the most hilarious visuals." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a much more negative review, noting that it did not [...] "have many redeeming qualities," [...] and the jokes were [...] "mediocre." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as being [...] "full of the lowest of the lowest-common-denominator 'jokes', with heavy reliance on toilet humor and the characteristic cutaway gags that have steadily gotten more random and less funny." ...|$|E

She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> about love or happiness.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Falk and Yacoub, co-produced by Tuinfort and Ilya, with vocal production being done by Ilya, Kotecha and Yacoub. [...] "One Last Time" [...] is a dance-pop and EDM-light song, with a total length of three minutes and seventeen seconds (3:17). Its instrumentations consist in [...] "pummeling drums and a three-note synth line". [...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6. Lyrically, the song is about asking a former lover to spend one last time with you, although he has already moved on and is with someone new. As noted by Jason Lipshut of Billboard, [...] "the downbeat admission of 'I know/that you got everything/But I got <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> without you' is the pained sound of a narrator racked with guilt, the chorus sets aside that humiliation and scoops up a sense of hope," [...] with the singer pleading, [...] "One last time/I need {{to be the one}} who takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go". Rob Copsey of The Official Charts Company noted that the song [...] " [...] reminded him of Swedish's recording artist, Loreen's 2012 Eurovision winning song [...] "Euphoria".|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film {{three out of four}} stars. He praised the [...] "convincing" [...] acting and [...] "realistic {{locations}} and terse dialogue" [...] but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, [...] "Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible." [...] Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable," [...] he writes, [...] "but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention." [...] Lou Lumenick in the New York Post writes that, [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> we haven't seen in many other movies" [...] and Lisa Kennedy in the Denver Post summarised: [...] "Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club {{calling the}} storyline [...] "disappointing." [...] He {{wrote of the}} episode, [...] "At this juncture, disappointment is an expectation, something I have to fight against whenever I sit down to watch the show {{in an attempt to}} give each episode a fair shake." [...] He continued, [...] "This week, I was at a bit of a loss, because despite a return to an older, more successful formula, with a clearly plotted path, Family Guy didn't muster up enough material to fill out the A-plot of a half hour." [...] McFarland also stated that the episode did not live up to the 1967 drama film Cool Hand Luke, that the title of the episode was named after. He concluded his review of the episode by giving the episode a grade of C. Terren R. Moore of Ology also found the episode to be unimpressive, noting, [...] "It's good fun while it's on, but <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> really sticks or adds to anything new to love about Family Guy." [...] Moore also commented, [...] "it's a pretty weak episode of Family Guy, where the most memorable joke of the night involves a thought bubble where Quagmire pulls a string of beads out of a woman's vagina." [...] In the conclusion of the review, Moore gave the episode a 6/10 score.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{hailed the}} episode as {{successful}} in telling a complex story {{about all the}} characters in a unique way, while retaining the series' effective elements of writing and character development. Throughout the show—as {{in the rest of}} the series—the characters self-consciously address their own dialogue and actions. Anya describes her own duet [...] "I'll Never Tell" [...] as [...] "a retro pastiche that's never gonna be a breakaway pop hit". With a characteristic dry demeanor, Giles explains that he overheard the information about Sunnydale residents spontaneously combusting as he was eavesdropping upon the police taking [...] "witness arias". In her opening number, [...] "Going Through the Motions", Buffy sings that she feels as though she is playing a part: [...] "nothing here is real, <b>nothing</b> <b>here</b> is right". The song introduces the character's emotional state but also removes the barrier between the actor and the audience, as Gellar the actor portrays Buffy, who feels she is merely playing the part of the Slayer. This hints to the audience that the episode's musical format is strange to the actors and characters. According to Buffy essayist Richard Albright, the lack of polish among cast members' singing voices added to the authenticity of their breaking out into song for the first time in the series. Whedon included self-conscious dialogue and references about the characters being in a musical and showed their reluctance toward song and dance, so that the audience would feel more comfortable with the improbability of such a thing happening on the show.|$|E
