Overall, the 2012 Olympic field had 39 <b>NBA</b> <b>players</b> and 18 former <b>NBA</b> <b>players</b> were on team rosters, while rosters in 1992 had 17 <b>NBA</b> <b>players</b> and three other former players—more than half of those <b>NBA</b> <b>players</b> were on the Dream Team.|$|R

5|$|An <b>NBA</b> <b>player</b> {{playing in}} Europe could earn {{as little as}} $50,000–$75,000 per month, while the average NBA annual salary was $5.8 million with the minimum around $500,000. The large {{contracts}} signed by Williams and Martin were extreme exceptions. In October after the cancellation of regular season games, it was not anticipated that many additional NBA players would be signed overseas; leagues had started playing, their rosters were full, and new players could disrupt the teams.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Howard {{has become}} a seven-time All-Star and All-NBA selection, and a three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. He also had the {{distinction}} as the only <b>NBA</b> <b>player</b> straight {{out of high school}} to start all 82 games as a rookie. There are also four other players that would be named All-Stars {{at some point in their}} careers, and Al Jefferson would be named to an All-NBA team. The draft is also notable for many high schoolers being drafted within a few picks from each other.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the regular}} season, {{speculation}} surrounded whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head coaching position. He {{was identified as}} a candidate at two schools: Syracuse and Auburn. In neither case was Gill hired; Syracuse opted for New Orleans Saints offensive coordinator Doug Marrone, while Auburn passed him over in favor of Iowa State head coach Gene Chizik, a move that prominent former National Basketball Association (<b>NBA)</b> <b>player,</b> Basketball Hall-of-Famer, and Auburn alumnus Charles Barkley claimed was due to racism. Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.|$|E

The distance of the race was three and one half full lengths of the court (or 329feet). Bavetta lost the race despite a last-second dive and Barkley running the last portion of the race backwards. The dive resulted in an abrasion injury to Bavetta's right knee.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Yi {{was listed}} as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese {{officials}} {{said that it was}} probably a typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of The Houston Chronicle reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former <b>NBA</b> <b>player</b> Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age.|$|E
