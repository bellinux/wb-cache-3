25|$|The nanocellulose fibrils may be {{isolated}} from the wood-based fibers using mechanical methods which expose the pulp to high shear forces, ripping the larger wood-fibres apart into nanofibers. For this purpose, high-pressure homogenizers, ultrasonic homogenizers, grinders or microfluidizers can be used. The homogenizers are used to delaminate the cell walls of the fibers and liberate the <b>nanosized</b> fibrils. This process consumes very large amounts of energy and values over 30 MWh/tonne are not uncommon.|$|E
25|$|CNF is a {{material}} composed of <b>nanosized</b> cellulose fibrils {{with a high}} aspect ratio (length to width ratio). Typical fibril widths are 5–20 nanometers {{with a wide range}} of lengths, typically several micrometers. It is pseudo-plastic and exhibits thixotropy, the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but become less viscous when shaken or agitated. When the shearing forces are removed the gel regains much of its original state. The fibrils are isolated from any cellulose containing source including wood-based fibers (pulp fibers) through high-pressure, high temperature and high velocity impact homogenization, grinding or microfluidization (see manufacture below).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the most}} common and {{effective}} catalyst, platinum, is extremely expensive, alternative processing is necessary to maximize surface area and minimize loading. Deposition of <b>nanosized</b> Pt particles onto carbon powder (Pt/C) provides a large Pt surface area while the carbon allows for electrical connection between the catalyst {{and the rest of the}} cell. Platinum is so effective because it has high activity and bonds to the hydrogen just strongly enough to facilitate electron transfer but not inhibit the hydrogen from continuing to move around the cell. However, platinum is less active in the cathode oxygen reduction reaction. This necessitates the use of more platinum, increasing the cell’s expense and thus feasibility. Many potential catalyst choices are ruled out because of the extreme acidity of the cell.|$|E

25|$|Considerable efforts {{has been}} devoted towards {{controlling}} the particle formation process of magnetite nanoparticles due to the challenging and complex chemistry reactions involved in the phase transformations prior {{to the formation of}} the magnetite spinel structure. Magnetite particles are of interests in bioscience applications such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since iron oxide magnetite nanoparticles represent a non-toxic alternative to currently employed gadolinium-based contrast agents. However, due to lack of control over the specific transformations involved {{in the formation of the}} particles, truly superparamagnetic particles have not yet been prepared from magnetite, i.e. magnetite nanoparticles that completely lose their permanent magnetic characteristic in the absence of an external magnetic field (which by definition show a coercivity of 0 A/m).

25|$|Human skin {{has a low}} permeability; that is, most foreign {{substances}} {{are unable}} to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is an effective barrier to most inorganic <b>nanosized</b> particles. This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to {{come into contact with}} internal tissues. However, in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in nanomedicine and biology to increase skin permeability. One application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where nanoparticles can interact directly with cells that have lost their growth-control mechanisms (cancer cells). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.|$|E

50|$|Through a mechanochemical {{reaction}} process, β-C3N4 can be synthesized. This {{method is}} achieved by ball milling high purity graphite powders down to an amorphous nanoscale size while under an argon atmosphere, then the argon is purged and the graphite powders are introduced to an NH3 gas atmosphere, which after high energy ball milling, {{has been found to}} form a <b>nanosized</b> flake-like structure of β-C3N4. During milling, fracture and welding of the reactants and graphite powder particles occur repeatedly from ball/powder collisions. Plastic deformation of the graphite powder particles occur due to the shear bands decomposing into sub-grains that are separated by low-angle grain boundaries, further milling decreases the sub-grain size until nanosize sub-grains form. The high pressure and intense motion promotes catalytic dissociation of NH3 molecules into monatomic nitrogen on the fractured surface of the carbon. <b>Nanosized</b> carbon powders act substantially different from its bulk material as a result of particle dimension and surface area, causing the <b>nanosized</b> carbon to easily react with the free nitrogen atoms, forming β-C3N4 powder.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the compaction process is to produce a dense green-state compact from a <b>nanosize</b> powder that subsequently can be sintered at high temperatures to form a dense ceramic piece. High density in the green-state after pressing is of primary importance for achieving high densities after sintering. Investigation of the compaction behavior of ceramic powders, therefore, {{is an important part}} of characterization of raw ceramic powders and evaluation of their compaction behavior, analysis of interaction between particles, and the study of microstructure of green body (unsintered) during pressure-forming processes. The compaction of <b>nanosize</b> ceramic particles into high density green bodies is very difficult. For the <b>nanosize</b> materials used in this study (amorphous Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } and {gamma} Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }), there is no evidence by TEM of partial sintering after synthesis. Nevertheless, strong aggregation forces, such as the van der Waals surface forces of attraction, exist and result in moderate precursor particle agglomeration. More importantly, these attractive surface forces, which increase in magnitude with decreasing particle size, inhibit interparticle sliding necessary for particle rearrangement to denser bodies during subsequent compaction. Attempts to produce high density green body compacts of <b>nanosize</b> particles, therefore, generally have been focused on overcoming these surface forces of attraction by using either dispersive fluids or high pressures with or without lubricating liquids.
