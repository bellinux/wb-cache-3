[...] "I didn't feel the pressure to try and outdo anything," [...] Dion said of her time in the studio. [...] "I proved myself before, so <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> enjoy.

500|$|During World WarII, {{the palace}} was bombed nine times, {{the most serious}} and publicised of which {{resulted}} in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King GeorgeVI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed. War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: [...] "I'm glad we have been bombed. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> look the East End in the face".

Dr. Fred plans {{to resolve the issue}} by killing Purple Tentacle and his harmless, friendly brother Green Tentacle, but Green Tentacle sends a plea of help to his old friend, the nerd Bernard Bernoulli. Bernard travels to the Edison family motel with his two housemates, deranged medical student Laverne and roadie Hoagie, and frees the tentacles.

[...] He made his debut on 11 August 2001 in a 0–0 draw at Braga. Mendes played regularly under the management of José Mourinho prior to his departure to Porto, but fell out of favour under his replacement, Vítor Pontes. He made 16 league appearances for Leiria, helping the club finish 7th in the Primeira Liga, before returning to Strasbourg. Upon his departure, Mendes was critical of the club's president João Bartolomeu, who he believed created instability at the club. [...] "The Union of Leiria is a complicated club at senior management level, especially the president, who sees things where they do not exist and it creates instability in the squad," [...] said Mendes who [...] "leaves great friends in Leiria".|$|E

At the end of 2008, Donna's younger brother and sister, Simon (Mauricio Merino, Jr.) and Tegan (Chelsea Jones) {{were introduced to the}} show. Merino and Jones won three-month contracts with the show through a competition with Dolly magazine. It was announced that the siblings would be [...] "Donna's worst nightmare" [...] and they were described as being [...] "cheeky" [...] and [...] "pesky".

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mixed reviews from critics, with some arguing that Spears' body was digitally altered. The Daily Telegraph commented [...] "Britney – presumably {{with the help}} of some serious digital remastering – has turned back the clock, looking every part the young starlet that gave us 'Oops'". Dose said [...] "shockingly, it's not that bad. Well, not that bad for everyone's favourite panty protesting, deposition skipping, weave wearing pop-tard". On August 17, 2008, it was announced that the video was nominated for Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. The ceremony was held on September 7, 2008, and Spears won all three categories.

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album, Unknown Pleasures in April 1979 at Strawberry Studios, Stockport. Producer Martin Hannett significantly altered their live sound, {{a fact that}} greatly displeased the band at the time. Hook said in 2006 that the album [...] "definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see that Martin {{did a good job}} on it There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound". The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who would go on to provide artwork for future Joy Division releases. Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Tony Wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a [...] "revolutionary force" [...] that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage described the album as an [...] "opaque manifesto" [...] and declared [...] "eaving the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgise. Oh boy. Joy Division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future—perhaps you can't ask for much more. Indeed, Unknown Pleasures may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year".|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
