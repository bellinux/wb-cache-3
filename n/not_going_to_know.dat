Robinson {{attempted}} to enter the Daytona 500, but failed to qualify after finishing 26th in the first Gatorade Twin 125s event. Robinson secured two top-20 finishes in the Busch Series in the team's No. 36 car, but retired from racing after four events {{to start a family}} with her husband Jeff Clark. She declined an offer to test at Daytona International Speedway while {{in the early stages of}} pregnancy. Shortly before the birth of her two children, Robinson started her interior-decorating business from her home, and painted murals for homes and businesses. She said of her decision to have children: [...] "Racing is part of who I am, If I became a different person because I had kids, then the kids were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who I was my whole life before them." ...|$|E

Now and then he tried to brush off the snow and wiped his lips. The salt taste was plainer; but he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> admit he <b>knew</b> what it meant and was glad {{he could not see}} his mittens when he took them from his mouth. Speed was important and he labored on. He could not remember afterwards how long he stumbled forward, but at length he stopped and stood swaying dizzily when an indistinct object loomed through the snow. It was like a man and came towards him.|$|R

Daniel insists he is not just her kid brother anymore and she cannot push him around, but Alexis tells him they are in this 50/50. So Daniel agrees and instructs her to have her [...] "letter from the editor" [...] ready by noon tomorrow, so they can print them side by side. When he leaves, she calls in her new assistant, Nick, and orders him to cancel his plans for tonight because they have to get their work completed by midnight, informing him Daniel is crazy if he thinks she is going to share anything with him. Alexis has a major photo shoot and sends her pictures in to be on the next cover of MODE. Wilhelmina is pleased with this scheme, saying this is too easy. Alexis tells them Daniel is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what hit him and rushes out the door.|$|E

So every stakeholder like BPJS (Social Security Administrative Bodies), Health Departement, and Health facility must give information to participant about the regulation. The advantages are: the new rules are immediate to implement, Puskesmas has adequate facility, P-care program, Identity card can use to get treatment in Puskesmas. The disadvantages are priority, lack of information, system information, lack information between health facility, and the 40 % of capitation fund...|$|R

In an interview with BoxingScene website, Top Rank president Bob Arum said: [...] "Well we gotta see. If he will fight this year, then he will fight next year. We are thinking about him fighting in October if he wants to fight. Once I get the opponent that I am working on - we are working on opponents and once I get that, I will fly over to the Philippines and he will see if his schedule in the senate allows him to train for a fight and participate in a fight. I <b>know</b> he wants <b>to</b> continue fighting but the impediment is how labor intensive his work as a Filipino senator is and he is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> really <b>know</b> that for another week or so. He was just sworn in as a senator yesterday," [...] According to Yahoo! Sports, Arum reserved Mandalay Bay for October 15, just in case Pacquiao decides to continue fighting in the ring. Arum said: [...] "Im not sure Manny is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> return, but I believe he wants to return. The question is, can he return and yet fulfill his duties as a senator in the Philippines? I don't think even he knows that answer yet, because he's just taken office." ...|$|R
5000|$|Domestic Palestinian {{controversy}} arose, however, as Abbas {{received some}} flak for his intransigence. On {{the visit to}} India he stated that the country's [...] "growing relationship with Israel {{is not a matter}} of concern for the Palestinians" [...] as New Delhi's support for Palestinian independence remained clear. He was condemned for making an [...] "utterly irresponsible, gratuitous statement" [...] as [...] "shameful" [...] as it was [...] "politically futile" [...] and stood no chance to win the PA anything in return. Without an apparatus of Palestinian democratic accountability by the representatives of the people the flood of official Palestinian concessions was [...] "guaranteed to continue unabated" [...] as it would cause further damage to the struggle for [...] "inalienable rights." [...] While talking about India's growing engagement with Israel, particularly in the field of defence, Abbas said, [...] "India's relations with Israel is its sovereign decision. We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> interfere. We <b>know</b> very well that India is supportive of the Palestinian struggle for achieving its own independence." [...] His controversial comments were in stark contrast to report than India became Israel's second largest trading partner, while India became Israel's largest arm's market and the latter became the former's largest arms supplier. However, it was also said that the Palestinian economy has [...] "incredible potential" [...] which could be unleashed if the Israeli restrictions on Palestinian movement were lifted, this was accorded by the regional World Bank chief just after a high-level World Bank delegation inaugurated a sewage storage facility on a rare trip to the Hamas-ruled Gaza.|$|R

The downside of this however is that information that is not digital becomes less accessed, and is liable to be lost to us and to future generations. Whereas there are many scanning projects underway, such as Google books and the Open Library Alliance, these projects are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about, much less find, the specialized scientific literature within various fields.

6000|$|Although Clarence was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Deadman's Gulch, <b>knew</b> {{nothing of}} it, {{and had a}} faint {{suspicion}} that Jim was equally ignorant, yet as {{one or two of}} the passengers glanced anxiously at the demure, gray-eyed boy who seemed booked for such a baleful destination, he really felt the half-delighted, half-frightened consciousness that he was starting in life under fascinating immoral pretenses. But the forward spring of the fine-spirited horses, the quickened motion, the glittering sunlight, and the thought that he really was leaving behind him all the shackles of dependence and custom, and plunging into a life of freedom, drove all else from his mind. He turned at last from this hopeful, blissful future, and began to examine his fellow passengers with boyish curiosity. Wedged in between two silent men on the front seat, one of whom seemed a farmer, and the other, by his black attire, a professional man, Clarence was finally attracted by a black-mantled, dark-haired, bonnetless woman on the back seat, whose attention seemed to be monopolized by the jocular gallantries of her companions and the two men before her in the middle seat. From her position he could see little more than her dark eyes, which occasionally seemed to meet his frank curiosity in an amused sort of way, but he was chiefly struck by the pretty foreign sound of her musical voice, which was unlike anything he had ever heard before, and--alas for the inconstancy of youth--much finer than Mrs. Peyton's. Presently his farmer companion, casting a patronizing glance on Clarence's pea-jacket and brass buttons, said cheerily-- ...|$|R

60|$|Four blocks {{farther down}} she stopped. The man {{was no longer}} {{following}} her. She had been almost self-convinced of an intention to go to Eda's--not quite. Of late her conscience had reproached her about Eda, Janet had neglected her. She told herself {{she was afraid of}} Eda's uncanny and somewhat nauseating flair for romance; and to show Eda the new suit, though she would relish her friend's praise, would be the equivalent of announcing an affair of the heart which she, Janet, would have indignantly to deny. She was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Eda's. She <b>knew</b> now where she was going. A prepared but hitherto undisclosed decree of fate had bade her put money in her bag that evening, directed her to the shop to buy the dress, and would presently impel her to go to West Street--nay, was even now so impelling her. Ahead of her were the lights of the Chippering Mill, in her ears was the rhythmic sound of the looms working of nights on the Bradlaugh order. She reached the canal. The white arc above the end of the bridge cast sharp, black shadows of the branches of the trees on the granite, the thousand windows of the mill shone yellow, reflected in the black water. Twice she started to go, twice she paused, held by the presage of a coming event, a presage that robbed her of complete surprise when she heard footsteps on the bridge, saw the figure of a man halting at the crown of the arch to look back at the building he had left, his shoulders squared, his hand firmly clasping the rail. Her heart was throbbing with the looms, and yet she stood motionless, until he turned and came rapidly down the slope of the arch and stopped in front of her. Under the arc lamp it was almost as bright as day.|$|R
