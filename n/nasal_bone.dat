5|$|In 1975, Peter Dodson, {{examining}} {{why there}} should be so many species and genera of lambeosaurine duckbills within such a short geological time frame and small area, published {{the results of a}} morphometric study in which he measured dozens of skulls. He found that many of the species had been based on remains that were better interpreted as juveniles or different sexes. For Lambeosaurus, he found that L. clavinitialis was probably the female of L. lambei, and Corythosaurus frontalis and Procheneosaurus praeceps were probably its juveniles. L. magnicristatus was different enough to warrant its own species. He interpreted Procheneosaurus cranibrevis and P. erectofrons as juvenile corythosaurs. However, restudy of the Procheneosaurus/Tetragonosaurus remains indicates that within species, assignments had become confused, and the type specimen of P. cranibrevis was a Lambeosaurus juvenile, whereas others were Corythosaurus, based on the distinctive form of the contact of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|The holotype of S. angustirostris is a {{skull and}} postcrania, so the cranium {{of the species}} is well-described. Bell et al. re-evaluated the entire species in a 2011 {{publication}} with Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Their description found the skull to be generalized among hadrosaurines, and are much larger than any skulls of S. osborni. The most unusual feature for a hadrosaurine is the long, protruding, solid crest that extends upwards diagonally {{from the back of}} the skull roof. Unlike lambeosaurines, the crests are made up completely of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone.</b> The premaxilla bones make up almost 50% of the entire skull length, and both sides are filled with small holes. Only in adult individuals has the front of the premaxillary contact been fused. Longer than the premaxilla, the nasal bones are the longest in the skull. They make up the entire length of the crest, and are never preserved as fused.|$|E
5|$|The nasal {{openings}} {{were large}} and faced frontwards. The <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> was thick, heavily sculpted, {{and had a}} convex profile. It formed a boss (shield) on the middle top of the skull together with the frontal bone. The lower front of the premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) was rugose and thickened. A small foramen (hole) was present in the suture between the premaxillae, leading into the nasal cavity, and possibly connected to the Jacobson's organ (an olfactory sense organ). The maxilla was short and deep, and probably contained a sinus. The maxilla {{had a series of}} foramina that corresponded with each tooth position there, and these functioned as passages for erupting replacement teeth. The mandible articulated with the skull below the back of the orbit. The tooth-bearing part of the lower jaw was long, with the part behind being rather short. Though not preserved, the presence of a predentary bone is indicated by facets {{at the front of the}} lower jaw. Like other pachycephalosaurs, it would have had a small beak.|$|E

50|$|Allodelphis {{has a very}} {{elongated}} rostrum and a polydont, heterodont dentition. It {{differs from}} Ninjadelphis and Zarhinocetus in the following characters: wider dorsal opening of mesorostral canal anterior to dorsal nares, posterior part of rostrum anterior to dorsal nares not depressed, posterior ends of premaxillae less irregular and digitated, posterior ends of premaxillae extending posteriorly beyond level of posterior margins of corresponding <b>nasal</b> <b>bones,</b> <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> elevated anteriorly rather than tilting anteroventrally into posterior part of dorsal nares, <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> expanded in width anteriorly rather than narrow anteriorly, <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> not fused to each other at midline or to underlying frontal bones, instead having margins defined clearly by sutures, <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> and dorsal exposures of frontal bones at cranial vertex symmetrical, with mid-line sutures on mid-sagittal plane rather than skewed asymmetrically to left side, right and left halves of nuchal crest symmetrical and having approximately equal widths and curvatures, and nuchal crest nearly straight transversely rather than curved anteriorly near cranial vertex; tympanic bulla with less inﬂated outer lip, and smaller and more posteriorly directed sigmoid process; atlas vertebra having dorsal transverse process tapered and not expanded dorsoventrally.|$|R
50|$|Miller also {{suggested}} a pug-like nose. Aside from the pug and similar dogs, no modern carnivore exhibits a pug nose due to it being an unnaturally created trait originating from selective breeding. The relatively low {{distribution of the}} pug nose has resulted in it being generally ignored. Miller's rationale {{is based on the}} retraction of Smilodon <b>nasal</b> <b>bones.</b> Criticism of Miller's theory compares the <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> of lions and tigers. Lions, when compared to tigers, also have strongly retracted <b>nasal</b> <b>bones,</b> but a lion's rhinarium, or external nose, is no more retracted than the tiger's. Thus, the pug nose of Smilodon proposed by Miller has little evidence in the physical structures of comparable animals. According to Antón, García-Perea and Turner (1998), the nostrils of living felids always extend to a similar position, independently of the length of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bones,</b> which in Smilodon falls within the range observed in modern species.|$|R
5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone.</b> Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Acrocanthosaurus, {{like most other}} allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening {{in front of the}} eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, {{more than a quarter of}} the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they {{continued}} onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the front edge, as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.|$|E
25|$|The wombat's incisors {{resemble}} those of rodents, and its molars are widely spaced by the palate. The teeth keep growing for {{the entirety of the}} animal’s life, which is likely an adaptation to its harsh diet. Compared to the common wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat has a larger temporalis muscle and a smaller masseter muscle. Also, unlike the northern hairy-nosed wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat’s <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> is longer than the frontal bone.|$|E

25|$|Healing by {{secondary}} intention (re-epithelialisation) occurs {{even when the}} wound extends to the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone.</b> Although the rate of healing depends upon the patient's wound-healing capacity, nasal wounds measuring up to 10mm in diameter usually heal in at 4-weeks post-operative. Nonetheless, one potential, but rare, complication of this nasal correction approach is {{the formation of a}} medial canthal web, which can be corrected with two (2) opposing Z-plasties, technique which relieves the disfiguring tensions exerted by the scar tissue's contracture, its shape, and location on the nose.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} neck length, the known {{osteology}} of Miragaia resembles that of other stegosaurids, differing in small details. The tip of the beak was toothless, as in Stegosaurus. The upper beak, formed by the praemaxilla, was pendant. The notch in the snout tip was, seen from above, shaped like a W, whereas in Stegosaurus the notch is U-shaped, with a little bulbous projection in the middle. The upper surface of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> was ornamented. A ridge formed the contact with the maxilla. The maxilla had sixteen teeth. The postorbital was a small and triradiate element.|$|E

25|$|Basal Ichthyopterygia {{already had}} an {{elongated}} triangular skull. With ichthyosaurs {{in the narrow}} sense, the snout became very pointy. The snout is formed by the premaxilla. The maxilla behind it is usually shorter and sometimes excluded from the external nostril by the rear branch of the premaxilla. Accordingly, the number of premaxillary teeth is high, while the maxillary teeth are fewer in number or even completely absent. The rear top of the snout is formed by the nasal bones. Derived species have a foramen internasale, a midline opening separating {{the rear of the}} nasal bones. The <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> usually forms the top and front rim of the bony nostril, itself often placed {{just in front of the}} eye socket. However, with some Triassic species, the premaxilla is so strongly extended at its back that it even excludes the nasal from the nostril.|$|E
500|$|The type {{specimen}} was collected by Prentiss and Frederick True, a biologist, in 1897 in Brooklin, Maine, {{the remains of}} which consist of a maxilla, parts of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone,</b> and the palate.

The specimen is apparently larger than the Alaskan mink, as the average distance between the last incisor to the first molar is [...] in the Alaskan mink, whereas that distance is [...] in the {{type specimen}}. The <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> has an abrupter ascension, and the carnassial teeth make a more acute angle with the gums than those of the common mink.|$|E

5000|$|The Campolina breed {{is a young}} breed {{relative}} to other established horse lines (Akhal Teke, Arabian, Lippizan) and breed standards are still evolving. Current trends have suggested a {{move away from the}} square mouth and retilineo or straight region of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> as in image presented below. In the new ideal, male <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> are prominent, retain the height of the earlier ideals but are now expected to generate a smooth 'curved and continuous' appearance (see The desired head shape of a Campolina). The ideal for the profile of the female head is more dynamic with a narrowing between the <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> to refine the lower face. The curvature of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bones</b> should appear to extend naturally from the intersection of the orbit and maxillary and lead gently into the muzzle. Both male and female head profile ideals are moving towards refined, narrow curvature in the lips, especially the upper lip. In the case of the female Campolina, certain breeders now seek to develop the curvature of the croup and buttocks to balance the nasal profile (i.e. an [...] "egua" [...] (female horse) with a strongly curved profile must present a full, developed curvature of the rear).|$|R
500|$|The cranium of the {{dromedary}} {{consists of}} a postorbital bar, a tympanic bulla filled with spongiosa, a well-defined sagittal crest, a long facial part and an indented <b>nasal</b> <b>bone.</b> Typically, there are eight sternal and four non-sternal pairs of ribs. The spinal cord is nearly [...] long; it terminates {{in the second and}} third sacral vertebra. The fibula is reduced to a malleolar bone.

500|$|Adult Achelousaurus skulls had a rugose, heavily pitted boss on {{the snout}} or nasal region, where many other ceratopsids had a horn. Such a boss {{is often called}} [...] "pachyostotic", i.e. {{consisting}} of thickened bone. But describing it as a thick [...] "boss" [...] can be misleading: in fact it forms a wide depression with a thin bone floor and irregular excavations, though it is less depressed than with Pachyrhinosaurus. The nasal boss covered {{about two-thirds of the}} top surface of the nasal bones. The boss was similar to that seen in the related genus Pachyrhinosaurus, though narrower, shorter, and less high. It covered 27% of the total skull length, was 30% longer than the nostril-eye socket distance and was about twice as long as the eye socket. Its rear edge did not reach the level of the eye socket. The nasal boss extended forward, where it fused onto the nasal and premaxilla bones (of the upper jaw) {{at the front of the}} snout, though the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> itself did not fuse with the premaxilla. The boss of specimen MOR 485 furthermore had an excavation (or cavity) at its front end. The horn core that formed the boss may have developed by either becoming procurved (i.e. bent forward) during growth, like the horn of the related Einiosaurus, until it fused onto the nasal bone; or from a simple, erect horn, which later extended its base forward over the snout region, as in Pachyrhinosaurus. The <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> formed the top of a large bony nostril. From the rear edge of that nostril a sharp process stuck out to the front. The snout was – compared to that of Einiosaurus – relatively wide at the level of the rear nostrils. The lacrimal bone, in front of the eye socket, was thickened, mainly on the inner surface while the outer surface was featureless apart from a crater-like excavation.|$|E
500|$|Though incompletely known, {{the skull}} of Giganotosaurus {{appears to have been}} low. The maxilla of the upper jaw had a [...] long tooth row, was deep from top to bottom, and its upper and lower edges were almost parallel. The maxilla had a {{pronounced}} process (projection) under the nostril, and a small, ellipse-shaped fenestra (opening), as in Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. The <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> was very rugose (rough and wrinkled), and these rugosities continued backwards, covering the entire upper surface of this bone. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye had a prominent, rugose crest (or horn) that pointed up at a backwards angle. The crest was ridge-like, and had deep grooves. The postorbital bone behind the eye had a down and backwards directed jugal process that projected into the orbit (eye opening), as seen in Tyrannosaurus, Abelisaurus, and Carnotaurus. The supraorbital bone above the eye that contacted between the lacrimal and postorbital bones was eave-like, and similar to that of Abelisaurus. The quadrate bone {{at the back of the}} skull was [...] long, and had two pneumatic (air-filled) foramina (holes) on the inner side.|$|E

The nostrils were turned upwards, and the <b>nasal</b> <b>bone</b> was a narrow strap that extended up above the eye sockets. The outer diameter of the sclerotic rings in the eyes was small, , compared to the size of the skull. The lower temporal fenestrae, openings behind the eyes, were partially closed off by the jugal bones, similar to Gallimimus. The jaws were toothless and down-turned, and the lower jaw was very massive and deep compared to the slender and low upper jaw. The relative size of the lower jaw was closer to that of tyrannosaurids than to other ornithomimosaurs. The snout was spatulate (flared outwards to the sides) and [...] wide, which is wider than the skull roof. This shape is similar to the snout of duck-billed hadrosaurids.|$|E
500|$|The Rodrigues rail was a flightless rail {{with bright}} grey plumage, perhaps flecked with white. Its beak and legs were red, {{and it had}} a red, naked area (or wattle) around its eyes.
