40|$|Abstract The current {{definition}} of food security neglects to explicitly {{account for the}} fact that most staple foods in many developing countries need to be cooked before they are edible. Because of this deficiency, household access and availability to cooking energy is not considered in many food security projects and programmes. In this paper we synthesize existing documents to promote explicit inclusion of cooking energy as a fundamental component in a food security equation. The synthesis showed that as fuelwood becomes scarce households adapt their cooking styles by omitting or substituting some essential energy-demanding dishes (e. g. dry beans) in order to save cooking energy. As a consequence, household members are denied essential nutrients supplied by the ingestion of such dishes, thereby compromising their <b>nutritional</b> <b>well-being.</b> We argue that when food is sufficiently available, fuelwood shortage may prevent households in poor countries from bringing about important improvements in their <b>nutritional</b> <b>well-being.</b> We therefore recommend to explicitly add cooking energy as a fundamental component of any food security project or programme...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} cooking and selected indicators of diet quality, mental well-being, and family relationships. Design Data were collected as part of Youth’ 12, a nationally representative health and well-being survey. Setting Secondary schools in New Zealand. Participants A total of 8, 500 students. Main Outcome Measures Cooking ability and frequency of cooking, <b>nutritional</b> behaviors, mental <b>well-being,</b> depressive symptoms, and family connections. Analysis Multiple regression {{analyses were conducted to}} examine the relationships between cooking ability/frequency and indicators of health and well-being, controlling for the sociodemographic characteristics of students. Results Approximately 80 % of students reported that they can cook a meal from basic ingredients either fairly or very easily. Reported cooking ability was positively associated with better nutritional indicators, better mental health indicators, and stronger family connections (p =. 01). For example, adolescents reporting the greatest cooking abilities were approximately twice as likely to meet the recommendations for fruits and vegetables (odds ratio, 2. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 6 – 2. 8).

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} community well-being based on an index of marginalization and growth status of indigenous rural school children in Oaxaca. Methods Heights and weights of a cross-sectional sample of 11, 454 children, 6 - 14 years, from schools for indigenous rural children (escuelas albergue) in 158 municipios in Oaxaca were measured in 2007. Tertiles of an index of marginalization were used to classify the 158 municipios into three categories of community well-being: lowest (highest marginalization), low, and moderate (lowest marginalization). Multivariate analysis of covariance, controlling for age, relative isolation and population size, {{was used to compare}} body size of children by category of community well-being. Contributions of marginalization, isolation and population size to variation in body size were estimated with sex-specific linear regression. Results Children from municipios lowest in well-being were shorter and lighter than children from municipios low and moderate in well-being. Marginalization and relative isolation accounted for 23 % (boys) and 21 % (girls) of the variance in height and for 21 % of the variance in weight of girls. Marginalization was the predictor of weight in boys (23 %). Conclusion Community well-being was reflected in the growth status of rural indigenous school children.

40|$|Food {{fortification}} {{is likely}} to have {{played an important role in}} the current <b>nutritional</b> health and <b>well-being</b> of populations in industrialized countries. Starting in the early part of the 20 th century, fortification was used to target specific health conditions: goitre with iodized salt; rickets with vitamin D-fortified milk; beriberi, pellagra and anaemia with B-vitamins and Fe-enriched cereals; more recently, in the USA, risk of pregnancy affected by neural-tube defects with folic acid-fortified cereals. A relative lack of appropriate centrally-processed food vehicles, less-developed commercial markets and relatively low consumer awareness and demand, means it has taken about another 50 years for fortification to be seen as a viable option for the less-developed countries. The present paper reviews selected fortification initiatives in developing countries to identify different factors that contributed to their successful implementation, as well as the challenges that continually threaten the future of the se programmes. Ultimately, the long-term sustainability of fortification programmes is ensured when consumers are willing and able to bear the additional cost of fortified foods. There has been an enormous increase in fortification programmes over the last couple of decades in developing countries. Considerable progress has been made in reducing vitamin A and I deficiencies, although less so with Fe, even as Zn and folic acid deficiencies are emerging as important public health problems.

40|$|Malnutrition is a {{significant}} cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly among older people. Attention {{has focused on the}} inadequacies of food provision in institutions, yet the majority suffering from malnutrition live in the community. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore barriers and facilitators to food provision for older people receiving home care. It was a qualitative exploratory study using semi-structured interviews with nine home-care workers in June 2013 employed by independent agencies in a large city in northern England. Data were analysed thematically, based on the principles of grounded theory. Findings showed that significant time pressures limited home-care workers in their ability to socially engage with service users at mealtimes, or provide them with anything other than ready meals. Enabling choice was considered more important than providing a healthy diet, but choice was limited by food availability and reliance on families for shopping. Despite their knowledge of service users and their central role in providing food, home-care workers received little nutritional training and were not involved by healthcare professionals in the management of malnutrition. Despite the rhetoric of individual choice and importance of social engagement and nutrition for health and <b>well-being,</b> <b>nutritional</b> care has been significantly compromised by cuts to social care budgets. The potential role for home-care workers in promoting good nutrition in older people is undervalued and undermined by the lack of recognition, training and time dedicated to food-related care. This has led to a situation whereby good quality food and enjoyable mealtimes are denied to many older people on the basis that they are unaffordable luxuries rather than an integral component of fundamental care. {çopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Height {{measurements}} {{taken in}} a mixed longitudinal manner on 1084 German-born boys aged 7 to 21 + at the Carlschule Academy in Stuttgart during the period 1771 - 93 have been examined. The boys {{can be divided into}} upper (aristocrat), middle and lower (artisan, servant) classes, nearly all housed and fed in this boarding school. Preece-Baines curves have been fitted to a subsample of 155 boys whose measurements cover at least the period 12 - 16 years at a density of two or three per year. In addition, the whole data, totalling 11, 040 observations, have been examined as if purely cross-sectional; and the height-at-entry measurement for each of 670 students has been examined. The results of the longitudinal subsample and the cross-sectional analyses agree reasonably well. Social class differences existed both in tempo of growth as signified by age at peak height velocity, and in adult height. The longitudinal analysis gives adult differences of about 2 cm between upper and middle classes and a further 2 cm between middle and lower, even amongst these boys all resident in the same, very privileged, school. Tempo differences between upper and middle class were minor, amounting to only 0. 3 year, but lower-class boys had their maximum growth increment about a year later than the others. Amongst middle classes a secular trend of about 2 cm averaged over all ages was found between those born before 1770 and those born later. This mainly represents a trend in tempo rather than in adult height. The heights of these boys are compared with those of contemporary Austrian upper and lower classes, English upper and lower classes, American Army cadets, and American slaves. The increase in German middle-class heights during the 18 th century indicates that this group was improving its <b>nutritional</b> status and <b>well-being,</b> {{at a time when the}} heights of the remainder of the population were constant or declining.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings of}} a survey that was primarily intended as (1) an assessment of coping capacity in drought and food insecure conditions and (2) a microfinance program outcome study. A three group cross-sectional survey of 819 households was conducted in May 2003 in two predominantly rural sites in Ethiopia. Established clients of the WISDOM Microfinance Institution were compared with similar incoming clients and community controls. No overall pattern of enhanced prevalence of coping mechanisms was observed in any participant group, suggesting that participation in the lending program did not affect coping capacity at the household level. No significant differences in mean mid-upper arm circumference or prevalence of acute malnutrition were found in males or females when the total sample was assessed. In the primary survey site, Sodo, female clients and their children had significantly better nutritional status than other comparison groups: the odds of malnourishment in female community controls compared to established female clients was 3. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 1 - 9. 8) and the odds of acute malnutrition in children 6 - 59 months of age were 1. 6 times greater in children of both male clients and community controls (95 % CI:. 78 - 3. 32). Household food security among female client households in Sodo was significantly better than in other comparison groups according {{to a variety of}} indicators. As compared to female clients, male clients and community controls, respectively, were 1. 94 (95 % CI: 1. 05 - 3. 66) and 2. 08 (95 % CI: 1. 10 - 4. 00) {{times more likely to have}} received food aid during the past year.

40|$|The {{scavenging}} village {{chicken is}} important to millions of smallholders in Ethiopia, as in other less-economically developed countries, for its contribution to the economic, <b>nutritional</b> and social <b>well-being</b> of farmers, especially women and children. Infectious diseases are frequently cited as the greatest constraint to village chicken production, and in Ethiopia, most mortality is attributed to seasonal outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND). This study conducted four cross-sectional surveys over an 18 -month period in two geographically distinct regions of Ethiopia, to examine a range of bacterial, viral and parasitic infections in randomly-selected village chickens, and {{to look at their}} 6 -month survival rate. The two chicken populations of the different regions were found to be different in terms of their population dynamics and phenotypic characteristics, and these may be driven by farmer demands, which are dictated by the local economic and cultural value placed on specific qualities in the chickens. Over the course of the study, no large outbreaks were observed in the eight villages which took part in the study, and only 9 out of 1280 birds (0. 7 %) were found to be serologically positive for ND. However, {{even in the absence of}} large outbreaks, around 20 % of the birds in the study were reported to have died of disease within the 6 -month follow-up period, and a further 13 % lost to predation. Both location and seasonal variation influenced a bird’s fate, as did farmer decisions, such as choosing birds with specific characteristics to sell or eat. Rather than large outbreaks, the rainy season appeared to be associated with increased small-scale losses, and a variety of signs were described, suggesting several pathogens may be involved. No single infection measured at the time of sampling was a good predictor of subsequent death from disease; instead different pathogens appeared to be important in each region, and reduced the probability of survival through a variety of mechanisms. Positive correlations between Pasteurella and Salmonella, and between Marek’s disease and parasitic diseases were identified, but fewer birds than expected were identified with pathogens from both these groups, perhaps suggesting a decreased chance of survival for co-infected birds. Strong seasonal variation in prevalence was not observed for any of the infections in the study, suggesting that seasonal rises in disease mortality are unlikely to be attributable to a single infection, but other factors may play a role, including an increased probability of co-infection. This makes it difficult to prioritise control strategies for individual diseases; instead development programmes may find broad-based strategies, such as improving hygiene and chick management may be more beneficial to minimise the small-scale losses. Programmes also need to be tailored to local needs rather than assuming a blanket strategy will work equally well for all farmers or regions. Any development strategies to control single diseases should consider potential impacts on non-target infections, due to the existence of multiple interactions between pathogens in this system...|$|R
