40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> {{and quality of life}} in oncology patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Nutrition related symptoms, such as anorexia and weight loss, reflect impaired nutritional status, which is often associated with reduced quality of life. Malnutrition can be related to reduced response or tolerance to cancer treatment. Early <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> may positively impact on quality of life and enhance clinical response in oncology patients. SUMMARY: <b>Nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> should be considered as a supportive measure within the global oncology strategy. In curative oncology care, it contributes to reduced postoperative infection rate, better control of cancer-related symptoms, shortened length of hospital stay and improved tolerance to treatment. In palliative care, the <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> focuses on controlling symptoms, thus improving quality of life. The evaluation of nutritional status should include an assessment of quality of life in order to optimize nutritional treatment for patients' individual requirements. Because of the potentially clinically relevant impact of <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> on quality of life, nutritional care should be included in any antineoplastic strategy. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of {{nutritional}} supplementation on dietary intake and on pressure ulcer development in critically ill older patients. The multi-center trial involved 19 wards stratified according to specialty and recruitment for critically ill older patients; 9 wards were randomly selected for <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> (<b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> group), consisting of the daily distribution of two oral supplements, with each supplement containg 200 kcal, for 15 d. Pressure ulcer incidence was prospectively recorded for grades I (erythema), II (superficial broken skin), and III (subcutaneous lesion) for 15 d. Nutritional intake was monitored by using estimates in units of quarters validated by comparison with weight measurement. There were 672 subjects older than 65 y, and 295 were in the <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> group versus 377 in the control group. The patients were similar for age, sex ratio, and C-reactive protein. In comparison with the control group, the <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> group included more patients with stroke, heart failure, and dyspnea and fewer with antecedent falls, delirium, lower limb fractures, and digestive disease. The <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> group had a lower risk of pressure ulcers according to the Norton score but was less dependent (Kuntzman score) and had a lower serum albumin level. During the trial, energy and protein intakes were higher in the <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> group (day 2 : 1081 +/- 595 kcal versus 957 +/- 530 kcal, P = 0. 006; 45. 9 +/- 27. 8 g protein versus 38. 3 +/- 23. 8 g protein in the control group, P 14 : 1. 28 (1. 01 to 1. 62, P = 0. 04); and belonging to the control group: 1. 57 (1. 03 to 2. 38, P = 0. 04).

Participants: 6. 701 LTC residents aged 65 and older; mean age 84; 70 % female. Prevalence measurements of nutritional status and activity, and a 30 days incidence measurement of falls. ResultsOf all participating residents, 9. 8 % sustained at least one fall, and 22. 8 % was malnourished.

Generally income of industrial workers is low. The low income may cause nutritional deficiency anemia, thereby decrease productivity.

This study was a one group pretest and posttest experiment. The study was carried out in a batik industry, in Masaran subdistrict, Sragen, from October to December 2007. A sample of 40 female workers was taken for study. The dependent variable was productivity as indicated by time required to accomplish a task. The independent variable was a <b>nutritional</b> <b>intervention</b> taking the form of food supplement. The data was analyzed by t test and linear regression, using SPSS v. 15 and Stata Intercooled v. 7 programs.
