500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and she obviously felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E

McElderry also told BBC Newcastle: [...] "I just <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and explore on my own and fend for myself a bit instead of being in this huge kind of establishment that kind of protected us.

Most {{residents}} of the town did not own a horse; when they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of town, they rented a horse {{from one of the}} liveries or corrals. The corral and livery also cared for transient stock, and provided buggies, carriages, and wagons with teams of horses. As of 1886, they also rented an 11-passenger excursion coach.|$|R

And in this posture things stood when the pacification was agreed on by both parties, which, like a short truce, only gave both sides breath {{to prepare for a}} new war more ridiculously managed than the former. When the treaty was so near a {{conclusion}} as that conversation was admitted on both sides, I went over to the Scotch camp to satisfy my curiosity, as many of our English officers did also.|$|E

She remembered that the sister of her interlocutress was the proverbially rich Mrs. Bray, a bankeress or a breweress or a builderess, who had so big a house that she couldn't fill it unless she opened her doors, or her mouth, very wide. Rose had learnt more about London society during these lonely months with her mother {{than she had ever}} picked up in Hill Street. The younger Mrs. Tramore was a mine of commerages, and she had no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to bring home the latest intelligence.

60|$|Take common sense. Does {{not common}} sense {{tell us that}} if God made this world, and governs it by righteous and God-like laws, {{this must be a}} world in which evil-doing cannot thrive? God made the world better than that, surely! He would be a bad law-giver who made such laws, that it was as well to break them as to keep them. You would call them bad laws, surely! No, God made the world, and not the devil; and the world works by God's laws, and not the devil's; and it {{inclines}} towards good, and not towards evil; and he who sins, even in the least, breaks God's laws, acts contrary to the rule and constitution of the world, and will surely find that God's laws will go on in spite of him, and grind him to powder, if he by sinning {{gets in the way of}} them. God has no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of His way to punish our evil deeds. Let them alone, and they will punish themselves. Is it not so in every thing? If a tradesman trades badly, or a farmer farms badly, there is no need of lawyers to punish him; he will punish himself. Every mistake he makes will take money out of his pocket; every time he offends against the established rules of trade or agriculture, which are God's laws, he injures himself; and so, be sure, it is in the world at large,--in the world in which men and the souls of men live, and move, and have their being.|$|E
