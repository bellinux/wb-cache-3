5|$|Rose and Slash reunited for the <b>Not</b> <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Lifetime... Tour, {{one of the}} most-anticipated reunion {{tours in}} rock history. Alongside Dizzy Reed and {{returning}} member Duff McKagan, who had previously made guest appearances with the band, they comprised two-thirds of the band's Use Your Illusion-era line-up, with Chinese Democracy-era members Richard Fortus and Frank Ferrer joining new member Melissa Reese {{to fill out the}} rest of the lineup. Rose shared a stage with Slash for the first time in nearly 23 years during the group's surprise performance at The Troubadour in April 2016, ahead of its headlining shows at Coachella. He additionally joined Australian hard rock band AC/DC to perform as lead singer for the remainder of the band's Rock or Bust World Tour, after long-time lead vocalist Brian Johnson had to stop touring due to hearing problems. Subsequent reports indicated that guitarist Angus Young will continue the band with Rose as its official lead singer.|$|E
5|$|In the new {{commercial}} climate glam metal bands like Europe, Ratt, White Lion and Cinderella broke up, Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991, and {{while many of}} these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s, they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s. Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands' commercial viability during the decade. In 1995 Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Guns N' Roses' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band. Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident? Guitarist Slash left in 1996, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997. Axl Rose, the only original member, worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete. Slash and McKagan eventually rejoined the band in 2016 and went on the <b>Not</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> Lifetime... Tour with them.|$|E

25|$|After {{more than}} a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses {{released}} the long-awaited album Chinese Democracy (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, is the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Former members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016, embarking on the <b>Not</b> <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Lifetime... Tour. The tour is currently the fifth highest-grossing concert tour of all-time, grossing over $430 Million by November 2017.|$|E

25|$|In 1932 Laake opposed vague {{instructions}} from Quisling that units from paramilitary organization should be mobilized {{in times of}} crisis, and requested direct and clear orders as to which units this would include, and from which organizations. The implication was that Quisling wanted the conservative Samfundsvernet to be given an open, contra-revolutionary role as units separate from the army. Laake instead suggested that those members of voluntary organizations who had a military background would be mobilized, while those without formal ties to the military would <b>not.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> case, Laake was overruled by Quisling and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
25|$|On December 29, 2015, {{several days}} after a Guns N' Roses-related teaser was {{released}} to movie theaters, Billboard reported that Slash would rejoin the band to headline Coachella 2016, filling the lead guitarist spot vacated when DJ Ashba left the band. Guns N' Roses were officially announced as headliners of Coachella on January 4, 2016, with KROQ reporting Slash and Duff McKagan would rejoin the band. Slash performed with Guns N' Roses {{for the first time}} in 23 years during the band's secret warmup gig at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on April 1, 2016.

The band also announced that they had hired bassist Grant Fitzpatrick as the replacement for Chris Wyse.

25|$|The {{sound from}} a Category I whistle is {{primarily}} a byproduct of source motion. In every case, there is a back reaction of the medium on the source (resistive and reactive impedance). One example of a weak back reaction is a vibrating iron body in air. The densities are so different the back reaction is often ignored. Back reactions of air on an air source or water on a water source can be different. In many cases, say turbulent jets, the sound created is random and it is convenient to consider the sound to be merely a byproduct of the flow. In this category the back reaction is insufficient to strongly control source motion, so whistles are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> category.|$|E
25|$|Perseus then {{returned}} his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a votive gift to Athena, who {{set it on}} Zeus' shield (which she carried), as the Gorgoneion (see also: Aegis). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In Pausanias he {{did not return to}} Argos, but went instead to Larissa, where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the quoit and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: Thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did <b>not,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> variant, cause his death.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{measured}} {{radiated power}} with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He {{was concerned with}} selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Helmholtz reciprocity principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium {{in which they had}} been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.|$|E
