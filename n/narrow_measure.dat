60|$|But {{you will}} say, Is it not {{impossible}} to admit of the making {{anything out of}} nothing, SINCE WE CANNOT POSSIBLY CONCEIVE IT? I answer, No. Because it is not reasonable to deny the power of an infinite being, because we cannot comprehend its operations. We do not deny other effects upon this ground, because we cannot possibly conceive the manner of their production. We cannot conceive how anything but impulse of body can move body; and yet {{that is not a}} reason sufficient to make us deny it possible, against the constant experience we have of it in ourselves, in all our voluntary motions; which are produced in us only by the free action or thought of our own minds, and are not, nor can be, the effects of the impulse or determination of the motion of blind matter in or upon our own bodies; for then it could not be in our power or choice to alter it. For example: my right hand writes, whilst my left hand is still: What causes rest in one, and motion in the other? Nothing but my will,--a thought of my mind; my thought only changing, the right hand rests, and the left hand moves. This is matter of fact, which cannot be denied: explain this and make it intelligible, and then the next step will be to understand creation. [For the giving a new determination to the motion of the animal spirits (which some make use of to explain voluntary motion) clears not the difficulty one jot. To alter the determination of motion, being in this case no easier nor less, than to give motion itself: since the new determination given to the animal spirits must be either immediately by thought, or by some other body put in their way by thought which was not in their way before, and so must owe ITS motion to thought: either of which leaves VOLUNTARY motion as unintelligible as it was before.] In the meantime, it is an over-valuing ourselves to reduce all to the <b>narrow</b> <b>measure</b> of our capacities; and to conclude all things impossible to be done, whose manner of doing exceeds our comprehension. This is to make our comprehension infinite, or God finite, when what He can do is limited to what we can conceive of it. If you do not understand the operations of your own finite mind, that thinking thing within you, do not deem it strange that you cannot comprehend the operations of that eternal infinite Mind, who made and governs all things, and whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain.|$|E

30|$|The other control {{variables}} which explain variation in <b>narrow</b> <b>measure</b> of liquidity creation include the following: bank size, capital ratio, and interbank offered rate. The {{negative relationship between}} bank size and liquidity creation suggests that larger banks create relatively less liquidity compared with their smaller counterparts. This negative sign of relationship between bank size and liquidity creation support the findings of Hackethal et al. (2010), Lei and Song (2013), and Horvath et al. (2014). The relationship between bank capital and <b>narrow</b> <b>measure</b> of liquidity creation is also negative, providing support {{to the findings of}} Lei and Song (2013). Unlike broad measure of liquidity creation, <b>narrow</b> <b>measure</b> depends on the availability of the funds in the interbank market. A higher interest rate in the interbank market results in lower liquidity creation by on-balance-sheet activities. It means that when the liquidity in the interbank market shrinks, the banks reduce lending and vice versa. Using IBR as a proxy for monetary policy, the results imply that tight monetary policy result in lower on-balance-sheet liquidity creation by the Chinese banks.|$|E
