40|$|I find <b>non-investment</b> <b>graded</b> {{companies}} {{motives for}} issuing convertible bonds in the Norwegian market by evaluating logistic regression {{results from a}} two-step security choice model from samples of 28 convertible bond-, 102 bond- and 229 equity issuances from 2005 to 2011. The findings indicate that companies in the Norwegian market substitute convertibles for bonds if they have valuable investment opportunities at hand and are associated with risk and uncertainty. This paper argues that the issuers of convertible bonds substitute convertibles for bonds to mitigate the asset substitution problem and mitigate debt-related financing costs under the asymmetric information theory. I further deduce that convertibles are used as a debt-instrument in the Norwegian market, different from the US market and more similar to the Western European market. Finding the issuers motives for issuing convertibles in Norway extend current academic research, and can be a fundament for investors when evaluating different convertible bond investment opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Mexico was {{upgraded}} from <b>non-investment</b> {{to investment}} <b>grade</b> in March of 2000. This paper examines {{the impact of}} this event on the properties of the transmission of shocks between Argentina and Mexico. The paper shows that there is a statistically significant change in the propagation of shocks the day the upgrade was announced. Furthermore, it is found that the parameters that shifted are those explaining the diffusion of shocks through the means, while the transmission through the variances remained stable. Moreover, the change in the estimated coefficients can explain more than a third in the unconditional comovement that these assets experienced before the upgrade. From the methodological point of view, the paper offers an identification procedure based on conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) that solves the problem of estimation in a linear simultaneous equations model {{that can be used in}} other Macro and Finance applications. ...|$|R

50|$|The second {{determinant}} of value {{is the quality}} of the credit tenant. This is generally determined by the tenant’s current credit rating and past financial reports. Future financial projections are also an important indication of financial strength. Most investors use the Standard and Poor's credit ratings. In order to qualify as an investment grade tenant, the company must be rated at lease BBB- by Standard and Poor's. Properties leased by credit tenants are in the highest demand and therefore command a lower capitalization rate than <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> tenants.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, European banks handled <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> {{lending and}} capital {{structures}} that were fairly straightforward. Nicknamed the [...] "London Approach" [...] in the UK, restructurings focused on avoiding debt write-offs rather than providing distressed companies with an appropriately sized balance sheet. This approach became impractical in the 1990s with private equity increasing demand for highly leveraged capital structures {{that created the}} market in high-yield and mezzanine debt. Increased volume of distressed debt drew in hedge funds and credit derivatives deepened the market—trends outside the control of both the regulator and the leading commercial banks.|$|E

50|$|Corporate {{bonds are}} divided into two main {{categories}} High Grade (also called Investment Grade) and High Yield (also called <b>Non-Investment</b> <b>Grade,</b> Speculative Grade, or Junk Bonds) according to their credit rating. Bonds rated AAA, AA, A, and BBB are High Grade, while bonds rated BB and below are High Yield. This is a significant distinction as High Grade and High Yield bonds are traded by different trading desks and held by different investors. For example, many pension funds and insurance companies are prohibited from holding more than a token amount of High Yield bonds (by internal rules or government regulation). The distinction between High Grade and High Yield is also common to most corporate bond markets.|$|E

50|$|CLOs are {{special-purpose}} vehicles {{set up to}} {{hold and}} manage pools of leveraged loans. The special-purpose vehicle is financed with several tranches of debt (typically a ‘AAA’ rated tranche, a ‘AA’ tranche, a ‘BBB’ tranche, and a mezzanine tranche with a <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> rating) that have rights to the collateral and payment stream in descending order. In addition, there is an equity tranche, but the equity tranche is usually not rated. CLOs are created as arbitrage vehicles that generate equity returns through leverage, by issuing debt 10 to 11 times their equity contribution. There are also market-value CLOs that are less leveraged—typically three to five times—and allow managers more flexibility than more tightly structured arbitrage deals. CLOs are usually rated {{by two of the}} three major ratings agencies and impose a series of covenant tests on collateral managers, including minimum rating, industry diversification, and maximum default basket.|$|E
50|$|Puerto Rico was {{effectively}} downgraded to <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> on February 4, 2014 by Standard & Poor's when it downgraded Puerto Rico's general obligation debt (GO) from BBB- status to BB+, one level below investment grade.

Moody's would follow {{three days later}} by downgrading Puerto Rico's GO debt on February 7, 2014 from Baa3 to Ba2, two levels below investment grade. Moody's, however, cited lack of economic growth for its downgrade while assigning a negative outlook to the government's ratings. Fitch Ratings {{would be the last}} to downgrade on February 11, 2014 by downgrading Puerto Rico's GO debt from BBB- to BB, two levels below investment grade.

5000|$|It was {{not until}} Puerto Rico {{enlarged}} its outstanding debt to $71 billion—an amount approximately equal to 68% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product (GDP)—that Puerto Rican bonds were downgraded to <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> (better known as [...] "junk status" [...] or speculative grade) by three bond credit rating agencies between February 4 and 11, 2014. This downgrade triggered bond acceleration clauses that required Puerto Rico to repay certain debt instruments within months rather than years. Investors were concerned that Puerto Rico would eventually default on its debt. Such a default would reduce Puerto Rico's ability to issue bonds in the future. Puerto Rico currently states that it is unable to maintain its current operations unless it takes drastic measures {{that may lead to}} civil unrest. There have already been protests over the austerity measures. These events, along with a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, have led to Puerto Rico's current debt crisis.|$|E

40|$|Credit spread is {{the extra}} risk-reward that an {{investor}} is bearing for investing in corporate bonds instead of government bonds. Structural models, which are simple in their framework, fail {{to explain the}} occurring credit spread and underestimate the predicted credit spread. Hence, {{the need for new}} models and exploration of systematic and idiosyncratic variables arose. The present paper aims to investigate if the predictability of lower-medium investment grade bonds and <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> bonds credit spread can be improved by incorporating systematic and idiosyncratic variables into a fixed effect panel data regression model, and whether the selected variables’ significance has high influence on credit spread or not. Initial results showed that fixed effect panel data regression model underperforms the structural models and under predicts the actual credit spread. The applied model explained 13. 5 % of the lower-medium investment grade bonds credit spread and 8. 5 % of <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> bonds. Further, systematic variables have higher influence on lower-medium investment grade bonds and idiosyncratic variables have higher influence on <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> bonds. The predictability of credit spread can be improved by employing correct explanatory variables which are selected based on the characteristics of the sample size...|$|E
40|$|We use {{revisions}} in analysts 2 ̆ 7 earnings forecasts {{to examine}} how the bad news associated with a bond rating downgrade gets transferred from the downgraded company to its rivals. In general, we find that stock analysts revise their earnings expectations downward for rivals of companies with downgraded debt. However, {{the significance of the}} revision is limited to rivals of downgraded companies with <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> debt only. For the rivals of companies with investment grade debt, we find no significant forecast revisions. We hypothesize that this differential impact is due to differing levels of market visibility. This is consistent with our finding that downgraded companies with <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> debt are followed by significantly fewer stock analysts.

40|$|We use data {{comprising}} over 100, 000 {{loans from}} 115 countries during 1995 - 2009 to examine {{factors that affect}} the extent of loan tranching, {{and the range of}} tranche spreads. The data show five factors that drive them: asymmetric information, borrower risk, transaction costs, the presence of institutional investors, and the legal system. Tranching is more extensive and generates greater differences in spreads between tranches of a same loan when asymmetric information and risk are more pronounced. Economic and institutional factors driving tranching are more directly applicable to <b>non-investment</b> <b>grade</b> loans. For developing countries, the data highlight factors that affect the extent of tranching but such factors show little sensitivity to the pricing of the relative spreads. ...|$|E
