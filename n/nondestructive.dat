5|$|Air-Cobot (Aircraft Inspection {{enhanced}} by smaRt & Collaborative rOBOT) is a French {{research and development}} project of a wheeled collaborative mobile robot able to inspect aircraft during maintenance operations. This multi-partner project involves research laboratories and industry. Research around this prototype was developed in three domains: autonomous navigation, <b>nondestructive</b> testing and human-robot collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Launched in January 2013, {{the project}} {{is part of the}} Interministerial Fund program of Aerospace Valley, a {{business}} cluster in southwestern France. With a budget of over one million euros, Air-Cobot aims to develop an innovative collaborative mobile robot, autonomous in its movements and able to perform the inspection of an aircraft with <b>nondestructive</b> testing sensors during preflight or during maintenance operations in a hangar. Testing has been performed at the premises of Airbus and Air France Industries.|$|E
5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} <b>nondestructive</b> testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, in an {{interview}} given to the French weekly magazine Air et Cosmos, Jean-Charles Marcos, CEO of Akka Research, explained that once developed and marketed the Air-Cobot should cost between 100,000 and 200,000 euros. He could meet civilian needs in <b>nondestructive</b> testing and also military ones. A possible continuation of the project could be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same mobile platform for the lower parts, and a drone for the upper parts. If funding is allocated then this second phase would take place during the period 2017–2020.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or <b>nondestructive</b> testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Iridium has two {{naturally}} occurring, stable isotopes, 191Ir and 193Ir, {{with natural}} abundances of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively. At least 34 radioisotopes {{have also been}} synthesized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 199. 192Ir, which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 73.827days, and finds application in brachytherapy and in industrial radiography, particularly for <b>nondestructive</b> testing of welds in steel in {{the oil and gas}} industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives of at least a day—188Ir, 189Ir, and 190Ir. Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by some combination of β+ decay, α decay, and (rare) proton emission, with the exceptions of 189Ir, which decays by electron capture. Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by β− decay, although 192Ir also has a minor electron capture decay path. All known isotopes of iridium were discovered between 1934 and 2001; the most recent is 171Ir.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 1994, {{the first}} 777, line number WA001, was rolled {{out in a}} series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to {{accommodate}} the 100,000 invited guests. The first flight took place on June 12, 1994, under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman. This marked the start of an 11-month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model. Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at Edwards Air Force Base in California to frigid conditions in Alaska, mainly Fairbanks International Airport. To satisfy ETOPS requirements, eight 180-minute single-engine test flights were performed. The first aircraft built was used by Boeing's <b>nondestructive</b> testing campaign from 1994 to 1996, and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs. At the successful conclusion of flight testing, the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) on April 19, 1995.|$|E

25|$|Bujold is the {{daughter}} of Robert Charles McMaster and attributes her early interest in science fiction, as well as certain aspects of the Vorkosigan Saga, to his influence. He was editor of the monumental <b>Nondestructive</b> Testing Handbook generally referred to as McMaster on Materials.|$|E
25|$|Engineers {{typically}} {{attempt to}} predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: prototypes, scale models, simulations, destructive tests, <b>nondestructive</b> tests, and stress tests. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.|$|E
25|$|In {{some types}} of <b>nondestructive</b> testing UV stimulates {{fluorescent}} dyes to highlight defects in {{a broad range of}} materials.

25|$|The largest ASME standard, both in {{size and}} {{in the number of}} volunteers {{involved}} in its preparation, is the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC). The BPVC provides rules for the design, fabrication, installation, inspection, care, and use of boilers, pressure vessels, and nuclear components. The code also includes standards on materials, welding and brazing procedures and qualifications, <b>nondestructive</b> examination, and nuclear in-service inspection.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{electronics}} {{were applied}} to fluoroscopy {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, when Frederick G. Weighart and James F. McNulty (1929-2014) at Automation Industries, Inc., then, in El Segundo, California produced on a fluoroscope the world’s first image to be digitally generated in real-time, while developing a later commercialized portable apparatus for the onboard <b>nondestructive</b> testing of naval aircraft. Square wave signals were detected on a fluorescent screen to create the image.|$|E
25|$|UV {{detectors}} {{are sensitive}} to most fires, including hydrocarbons, metals, sulfur, hydrogen, hydrazine, and ammonia. Arc welding, electrical arcs, lightning, X-rays used in <b>nondestructive</b> metal testing equipment (though this is highly unlikely), and radioactive materials can produce levels that will activate a UV detection system. The presence of UV-absorbing gases and vapors will attenuate the UV radiation from a fire, adversely affecting {{the ability of the}} detector to detect flames. Likewise, the presence of an oil mist in the air or an oil film on the detector window will have the same effect.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{does not}} require special sample {{preparation}} and is typically performed under ambient conditions. It uses an AFM operated in noncontact mode that is intrinsically <b>nondestructive</b> and sufficiently gentle to be suitable for soft-matter and biological sample investigations. Nano-FTIR can be utilized from THz to visible spectral range(and not only in infrared as its name suggests) depending on the application requirements and availability of broadband sources. Nano-FTIR is complementary to Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), SNOM, AFM-IR and other scanning probe methods {{that are capable of}} performing vibrational analysis.|$|E
25|$|Membrane filters used in {{production}} processes are commonly made from {{materials such as}} mixed cellulose ester or polyethersulfone (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The <b>nondestructive</b> integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a regulatory requirement. Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile filtration is performed inside of a cleanroom to prevent contamination.|$|E
500|$|Forensic chemists {{rely on a}} {{multitude}} of instruments to identify unknown substances found at a scene. [...] Different methods {{can be used to}} determine the identity of the same substance, and {{it is up to the}} examiner to determine which method will produce the best results. [...] Factors that forensic chemists might consider when performing an examination are the length of time a specific instrument will take to examine a substance and the destructive nature of that instrument. They prefer using <b>nondestructive</b> methods first, to preserve the evidence for further examination. [...] <b>Nondestructive</b> techniques can also be used to narrow down the possibilities, making it more likely that the correct method will be used the first time when a destructive method is used.|$|E
500|$|The {{histopathology}} of endometrial cancers {{is highly}} diverse. The most common finding is a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which {{is composed of}} numerous, small, crowded glands {{with varying degrees of}} nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. This often appears on a background of endometrial hyperplasia. Frank adenocarcinoma may be distinguished from atypical hyperplasia by the finding of clear stromal invasion, or [...] "back-to-back" [...] glands which represent <b>nondestructive</b> replacement of the endometrial stroma by the cancer. With progression of the disease, the myometrium is infiltrated.|$|E
500|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} is {{the application of}} chemistry and its subfield, forensic toxicology, in a legal setting. [...] A forensic chemist can assist {{in the identification of}} unknown materials found at a crime scene. [...] Specialists in this field have a wide array of methods and instruments to help identify unknown substances. [...] These include high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thin layer chromatography. [...] The range of different methods is important due to the destructive nature of some instruments and the number of possible unknown substances that can be found at a scene. Forensic chemists prefer using <b>nondestructive</b> methods first, to preserve evidence and to determine which destructive methods will produce the best results.|$|E
500|$|One other {{implement}} to {{the career}} of a forensic archaeologist is teaching and research. Educating law enforcement, crime scene technicians and investigators, as well as undergraduate and graduate students is {{a critical part of}} a forensic archaeologist’s career in order to spread knowledge of proper excavation techniques to other forensic personnel and to increase awareness of the field in general. Crime scene evidence in the past has been compromised due to improper excavation and recovery by untrained personnel. Forensic anthropologists are then unable to provide meaningful analyses on retrieved skeletal remains due to damage or contamination. Research conducted to improve archaeological field methods, particularly to advance <b>nondestructive</b> methods of search and recovery are also important for the advancement [...] and recognition of the field.|$|E
500|$|Serial numbers became commonplace {{after the}} United States passed the Gun Control Act of 1968. [...] This law {{mandated}} that all guns manufactured or imported {{into the country}} have a serial number. Prior to 1968, many firearms either {{did not have a}} serial number or the serial numbers were not unique and were reused by a manufacturer on multiple firearms. [...] If a recovered weapon has had the serial numbers altered or destroyed, examiners can attempt to recover the original numbers. [...] The two main methods for the restoration of serial numbers are magnetic particle inspection and chemical restoration. [...] It is recommended that magnetic particle inspection be performed first due to the <b>nondestructive</b> nature of the method. [...] If magnetic particle inspection fails, chemical restoration is {{the next step in the}} forensic analysis.|$|E
500|$|The {{two main}} {{standalone}} spectroscopy techniques for forensic chemistry are FTIR and AA spectroscopy. [...] FTIR is a <b>nondestructive</b> process that uses infrared light {{to identify a}} substance. [...] The attenuated total reflectance sampling technique {{eliminates the need for}} substances to be prepared before analysis. [...] The combination of nondestructiveness and zero preparation makes ATR FTIR analysis a quick and easy first step in the analysis of unknown substances. [...] To facilitate the positive identification of the substance, FTIR instruments are loaded with databases that can be searched for known spectra that match the unknown's spectra. [...] FTIR analysis of mixtures, while not impossible, presents specific difficulties due to the cumulative nature of the response. [...] When analyzing an unknown that contains more than one substance, the resulting spectra will be a combination of the individual spectra of each component. [...] While common mixtures have known spectra on file, novel mixtures can be difficult to resolve, making FTIR an unacceptable means of identification. [...] However, the instrument can be used to determine the general chemical structures present, allowing forensic chemists to determine the best method for analysis with other instruments. [...] For example, a methoxy group will result in a peak between 3,030 and 2,950 wavenumbers (cm−1).|$|E
500|$|Modern {{forensic}} chemists rely {{on numerous}} instruments to identify unknown materials {{found at a}} crime scene. [...] The 20th century saw many advancements in technology that allowed chemists to detect smaller amounts of material more accurately. [...] The first major advancement in this century came during the 1930s with the invention of a spectrometer that could measure the signal produced with infrared (IR) light. [...] Early IR spectrometers used a monochromator and could only measure light absorption in a very narrow wavelength band. [...] It {{was not until the}} coupling of an interferometer with an IR spectrometer in 1949 by Peter Fellgett that the complete infrared spectrum could be measured at once. [...] Fellgett also used the Fourier transform, a mathematical method that can break down a signal into its individual frequencies, {{to make sense of the}} enormous amount of data received from the complete infrared analysis of a material. [...] Since then, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments have become critical in the forensic analysis of unknown material because they are <b>nondestructive</b> [...] and extremely quick to use. [...] Spectroscopy was further advanced in 1955 with the invention of the modern atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer by Alan Walsh. [...] AA analysis can detect specific elements that make up a sample along with their concentrations, allowing for the easy detection of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium.|$|E

The shock was named for Îles des Saintes [...] "Island of the Saints", a small island {{to the south of}} Guadeloupe, which is an overseas department of France. Although it occurred near the Lesser Antilles subduction zone, this was an intraplate, normal fault event. It resulted in one death, thirteen injuries, and forty people being made homeless, but the overall damage was considered moderate. A small, <b>nondestructive</b> tsunami was reported, but runup and inundation distances were difficult to measure due to a storm that occurred {{on the day of the}} event. Unusual effects at a volcanic lake on Dominica were also documented, and an aftershock caused additional damage three months later.|$|E
2500|$|The use of X-rays, {{a form of}} {{ionizing}} radiation, {{requires the}} potential risks from a procedure to be carefully balanced with {{the benefits of the}} procedure to the patient. [...] Because the patient must be exposed to a continuous source of X-rays instead of a momentary pulse, a fluoroscopy procedure generally subjects a patient to a higher absorbed dose of radiation than an ordinary (still) radiograph. [...] Only important applications such as health care, bodily safety, food safety, <b>nondestructive</b> testing, and scientific research meet the risk-benefit threshold for use. [...] In {{the first half of the}} 20th century shoe-fitting fluoroscopes were used in shoe stores, but their use was discontinued because it is no longer considered acceptable to use radiation exposure, however small the dose, for nonessential purposes. [...] Much research has been directed toward reducing radiation exposure, and recent advances in fluoroscopy technology such as digital image processing and flat panel detectors, have resulted in much lower radiation doses than former procedures.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, FSW is {{associated}} with a number of unique defects, if it isn't done properly. Insufficient weld temperatures, due to low rotational speeds or high traverse speeds, for example, mean that the weld material is unable to accommodate the extensive deformation during welding. This may result in long, tunnel-like defects running along the weld which may occur on the surface or subsurface. Low temperatures may also limit the forging action of the tool and so reduce the continuity of the bond between the material from each side of the weld. The light contact between the material has given rise to the name [...] "kissing-bond". This defect is particularly worrying since {{it is very difficult to}} detect using <b>nondestructive</b> methods such as X-ray or ultrasonic testing. If the pin is not long enough or the tool rises out of the plate then the interface at the bottom of the weld may not be disrupted and forged by the tool, resulting in a lack-of-penetration defect. This is essentially a notch in the material which can be a potential source of fatigue cracks.|$|E
