6000|$|As for the inn, yes, it {{was very}} bad. It had been quite good under the {{previous}} proprietors. But now--they shrugged their shoulders. The dirty-breast and the shawled girl were not the owners. They were merely conductors of the hotel: here a sarcastic curl of the lip. The owner {{was a man in}} the village--a young man. A week or two back, at Christmas time, there had been a roomful of men sitting drinking and roistering at this very table. When in had come the proprietor, mad-drunk, swinging a litre bottle round his head and yelling: [...] "Out! Out! Out, all of you! Out every one of you! I am proprietor here. And when I want to clear my house I clear my house. Every man obeys--who doesn't obey has his brains knocked out with this bottle. Out, out, I say--Out, everyone!" [...] And the men all cleared out.

5000|$|Cooper {{verbally}} {{committed to}} attend the U.S. Naval Academy but transferred closer to home at the University of Maine to try and earn a scholarship. In an interview with Tom Shanahan, Cooper said his decision was a family one. [...] "We weren't really thinking about professional football," [...] Cooper said, [...] "We were thinking about a job after college, {{and if you go}} to the Naval Academy, you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get <b>turned</b> away for a job." [...] Because his high school coach and Maine Black Bears football head coach Jack Cosgrove played together in college, Cooper was offered a scholarship and became an instant star. [...] Cooper earned Maine’s Roger Ellis Rookie of Year Award his freshman year in 1999. As a junior, Cooper earned Atlantic-10 Co-Defensive Player of Year. During his senior year, Cooper racked up Atlantic-10 Conference Defensive Player of Year in 2002, the George H. “Bulger” Lowe award from the Gridiron Club of Greater Boston as the top defensive football player in New England, and was named a 1st Team Defense 2002 Associated Press NCAA Division I-AA Football All-American. [...] He was also an American Football Coaches Association and Sports Network All-American as well.|$|R
5000|$|Signing that {{contract}} did bother me a lot. I've been {{turning it over}} in my mind, but now I've {{come to terms with}} it. I've realised that all it boils down to is perhaps two-year's security ... Before, all I could think about was my stomach ... Now I feel free to think—and free to write down what I'm thinking about ... And look—I've been fucked about for so long I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> suddenly <b>turn</b> into Rod Stewart just because I get £25.00 a week. I'm much too far gone for that, I tell you. —Joe Strummer, March 1977 By the turn of the year, punk had become a major media phenomenon in the UK. On 25 January 1977, the Clash signed to CBS Records for £100,000, a remarkable amount for a band that had played a total of about thirty gigs and almost none as a headliner. As Clash historian Marcus Gray describes, the [...] "band members found themselves having to justify deal to both the music press and to fans who picked up on the critics' muttered asides about the Clash having 'sold out' to the establishment." [...] Mark Perry, founder of the leading London punk periodical, Sniffin' Glue, let loose with what he would later call his [...] "big quote": [...] "Punk died the day the Clash signed to CBS." [...] As one band associate described it, the deal [...] "was later used as a classic example of the kind of contract that no group should ever sign—the group had to pay for their own tours, recordings, remixes, artwork, expenses ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's me" [...] {{said the}} stranger; {{and who was}} me but Harry, who had thus metamorphosed himself? I asked him the reason; and in a faltering voice, which I tried to make humorous, {{expressed}} a hope that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> gentleman forger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on, of course. I've {{put my hand}} to the plough and I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back.

"We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> brigands," [...] Beric said; [...] "there is {{game on the}} hills, {{and we are all}} hunters, and I {{have money}} enough to pay for all else we require did we live there for years.

6000|$|Perhaps {{the weakest}} of all are those {{helpless}} persons whom I {{have called the}} Endeavourers. The prize specimen of them was another M.P. who defended the same Bill as [...] "an honest attempt" [...] {{to deal with a}} great evil: as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one's fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment; in a state of reverent agnosticism about what would come of it. But with this fatuous notion that one can deliberately establish the Inquisition or the Terror, and then faintly trust the larger hope, I shall have to deal more seriously in a subsequent chapter. It is enough to say here that the best thing the honest Endeavourer could do would be to make an honest attempt to know what he is doing. And not to do anything else until he has found out. Lastly, there is a class of controversialists so hopeless and futile that I have really failed to find a name for them. But whenever anyone attempts to argue rationally for or against any existent and recognisable thing, such as the Eugenic class of legislation, there are always people who begin to chop hay about Socialism and Individualism; and say [...] "You object to all State interference; I am in favour of State interference. You are an Individualist; I, on the other hand," [...] etc. To which I can only answer, with heart-broken patience, that I am not an Individualist, but a poor fallen but baptised journalist who is trying {{to write a book about}} Eugenists, several of whom he has met; whereas he never met an Individualist, and is by no means certain he would recognise him if he did. In short, I do not deny, but strongly affirm, the right of the State to interfere to cure a great evil. I say that in this case it would interfere to create a great evil; and I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> from the discussion of that direct issue to bottomless botherations about Socialism and Individualism, or the relative advantages of always <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the right and always <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the left.|$|R

She was {{convinced}} that America sought desperately to keep its poor out of sight {{so as not to}} be reminded of the social policies she believed exacerbated poverty.
