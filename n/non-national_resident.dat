50|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{migrants}} from neighbouring Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia, {{as well as}} from Nepal and India, have pushed the total number of <b>non-national</b> <b>residents</b> to around 3.5 million , up from an estimated 2 million in 2008, and about 1.3 million in 2000. Some 41,000 Britons live in Thailand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the democratically fundamental {{question of the}} inclusiveness of electorates and of its impact on citizens' representation. While the literature has focussed on the congruence between voters and representatives, it has neglected congruence issues between citizens and representatives. The paper investigates comparatively this bias and source of newly disenfranchised citizens in a globalised society with increasing mobility. On the one hand, electoral laws vary in their inclusion or exclusion of expatriates (emigrants) and in {{the right to vote}} to <b>non-national</b> <b>residents</b> (immigrants). On the other hand, naturalisation laws vary in the maintenance of nationality for expatriates and in their inclusion of <b>non-national</b> <b>residents.</b> We illustrate levels of "discrepancy" between electorate and citizenship in 22 OECD countries qualitatively, by presenting differences of electoral and nationality laws, and quantitatively, by comparing the size of citizenship with that of the electorate, and the national and resident populations. We show that shifts between political and national communities are primarily due to naturalisation laws and that electoral laws have so far been unable to correct for the discrepancy. ...|$|R

Additionally, {{long-term}} <b>resident</b> <b>non-nationals</b> over 18 (<b>resident</b> over 10 years) have the right to vote in regional and local elections (Article 64).

2500|$|... (EU member) In 2002, <b>non-national</b> {{permanent}} <b>residents</b> {{were granted}} local voting rights. In {{order to achieve}} this, {{an amendment to the}} constitution was adopted in June 2002 and an amendment of the Law on elections to municipal councils was adopted in September 2002. A Law on elections to the European Parliament was adopted by the parliament in November 2003.|$|R
30|$|Adding to the {{linguistic}} diversity stipulated by a trilingual national curriculum, {{the country has}} the highest density of <b>non-national</b> <b>residents</b> in Europe. Most of these nationalities are European, the highest percentage being from Portugal or having a Portuguese-immigrant background. Luxembourg’s super-diversity (term borrowed from Vertovec 2007) is reflected in its public schools. Almost half {{of the student population}} (43 %) holds a nationality from a country other than Luxembourg (MENJE 2017). The diversity is such that students speaking language(s) other than Luxembourgish at home are the majority. In primary school, for example, the latest data available indicates that 63 % of children have languages other than Luxembourgish as a first language (MENJE 2017). This means that an extremely high proportion of students learn science through a second or third language, and thus a language that is not spoken at home, a trend that continues through secondary school. This linguistic and cultural diversity has been at the root of our research regarding the use of language, communicative resources, and voice in science classroom contexts. It has led to our realization of the value of video analysis to research interactions and learning in these environments. Further, this diversity has led us to question our assumptions regarding language and voice in classrooms, and through this questioning, to in turn question how we conduct video analysis.|$|R
40|$|Perception {{of migrant}} inflows as a {{negative}} phenomenon in Europe is generally attached with native populations. For some time, however, in particular {{with the rise of}} immigrants/asylum-seekers, patterns of similar anxiety have here become increasingly observable amongst the <b>resident</b> <b>non-nationals.</b> This paper provides evidence along these lines from a number of EU members. Accordingly, the non-nationals express today minimum as much concern about the expansion of immigrant size as the nationals are believed to have traditionally voiced...|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{critical}} {{assessment of the}} interpretative positions adopted by the European Court of Human Rights as to the applicability of Convention rights and freedoms to the deportation of “aliens” resident in the territory of a Contracting State. The article considers inconsistencies in the Court's jurisprudence and argues that these inconsistencies {{are a result of}} the characterisation of deportation proceedings as administrative events. The authors also explore the nature of Contracting States' deportation procedures and examine key features of the procedural guarantees afforded to non-nationals under the Convention and its Protocols. In addition, the authors consider the extent to which Convention notions of due process and natural justice are deemed germane to deportation proceedings. The article contends that disparities in the procedural protections accorded to nationals when compared with <b>resident</b> <b>non-nationals</b> conflict with the purpose of the European Convention on Human Rights are an avertable consequence of the primacy of State sovereignty...|$|R
40|$|Updating {{our earlier}} work on Brussels as the {{paradigm}} of a multi-level, multi-cultural, multi-national city, and {{in the context of}} Brussels’s recent troubled emergence as the epicentre of violent conflict between radical political Islam and the West, this paper sets out the paradoxical intersection of national (i. e. Flemish and Francophone), non-national and ethnic minority politics in a city placed as a multicultural and multi-national ‘urban anomaly’ at the heart of linguistic struggle of the two dominant Belgian communities. Brussels is one of the three Regions of the Belgian federal model alongside Flanders and Wallonia. It is also an extraordinarily diverse and cosmopolitan city, in which a mixed language Belgian population lives alongside very high numbers of <b>resident</b> <b>non-nationals,</b> including European elites, other European immigrant workers, and immigrants from Africa and Asia. After laying out the complex distribution of power and competences within the Belgian federal structure, we explore whether these structures have worked over the years to include or exclude disadvantaged ethnic groups. To better understand these processes, we introduce our view of the multi-level governance perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{elections}} of the European Parliament {{will be held}} in June 1994; these elections are the first direct elections to be held in the framework of the European Union. For the first time the citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals will have the right to vote and stand as candidates in those elections in the Member States in which they reside. Furthermore, the creation of political parties at supranational level will enable Union citizens to express freely their ideas and undertake political action. Granting voting rights in the elections to the European Parliament to Union citizens who reside in another Member State tackles not only a theoretical problem but also a very practical one, as the number of Union citizens who have benefited from the freedom of movement and establishment provided for by the EEC Treaty are estimated at five million. The number of <b>resident</b> <b>non-nationals</b> who are citizens of other Member States is approximately 1. 3 million in Germany and France, 880, 000 in the United Kingdom, 541, 000 in Belgium, 240, 000 in Spain, 163, 000 in The Netherlands, 150, 000 in Italy, 105, 000 in Luxembourg, 62, 000 in Ireland, 50, 000 in Greece, 29, 000 in Portugal and 27, 000 in Denmark. 1 Approximately 1. 2 million Italians, 840, 000 Portuguese, 630, 000 Irish, 470, 000 Spaniards, 400, 000 Britons, 360, 000 Greeks, 300, 00 French, 290, 000 Germans, 240, 000 Dutch, 130, 000 Belgians, 40, 000 Danes and 11, 000 Luxemburgers are established outside their home Member States. Before the Maastricht Treaty came into effect, residents who were nationals of other Member States could also vote in the Member States of residence only if they were residing in Belgium, Ireland and The Netherlands, subject to certain conditions. Furthermore, all Irish nationals and Commonwealth citizens have the right to vote in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, the right to stand as a candidate is reserved in ten Member States for nationals only. In Italy, nationals of other Member States may stand for election, even if they do not live in Italy, while the same applies in the United Kingdom to Irish nationals and Commonwealth citizens...|$|R
