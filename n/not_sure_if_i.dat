2500|$|In 2012, Tom Perrotta of The Wall Street Journal called Radwańska [...] "the most tactically sound, subtle {{tennis player}} in the world." [...] Over the years she has been given the nicknames [...] "The Magician", [...] "Ninja" [...] and [...] "The Professor", {{due to the fact}} that she can pull off the most {{difficult}} shots in the game with ease. Radwańska's game is founded on variety, mobility, and a tendency to anticipate her opponent's actions. She often uses this style to construct rallies—either opening the court up for a winner, or prompting a surprised opponent to hit a misplaced return. Her primary weapons include a mixture of slices and lobs, along with her ability to hit the ball at a variety of angles. She also makes use of a disguised drop shot, often swung with the same motion as a normal stroke during a rally. She is also noted for her crouching shots, during which she quickly drops in place to return or redirect a low ball, along with her use of an overhead backhand while on defense. In fact, she is known for having invented her distinctive squat position shot, where she sits so low on her haunches that she can play half-volleys with a horizontal racket. “I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> invented it,” says Radwanska, “but I was definitely one of the first ones. When I watch TV, I can hear commentators say that was my shot, even if someone else is playing, so it’s nice to hear I can put something new into tennis”.|$|E

Sansovino, with a caution very {{frequent}} among Venetian historians, when {{alluding to}} events {{connected with the}} Serrar del Consiglio, does not specially mention the cause for the requirement of the new chamber; but the Sivos Chronicle {{is a little more}} distinct in expression. [...] "In 1301, it was determined to build a great saloon for the assembling of the Great Council, and the room was built which is now called the Sala del Scrutinio."

60|$|XVIII. I imagine I {{have given}} {{instances}} enough, though I could multiply them indefinitely, {{to prove that}} these variations are not mere blunders, nor carelessnesses, but {{the result of a}} fixed scorn, if not dislike, of accuracy in measurements; and, in most cases, I believe, of a determined resolution to work out an effective symmetry by variations as subtle as those of Nature. To what lengths this principle was sometimes carried, we shall see by the very singular management of the towers of Abbeville. I do not say it is right, still less that it is wrong, but it is a wonderful proof of the fearlessness of a living architecture; for, say what we will of it, that Flamboyant of France, however morbid, was as vivid and intense in its animation as ever any phase of mortal mind; and it would have lived till now, if it had not taken to telling lies. I have before noticed the general difficulty of managing even lateral division, when it is into two equal parts, unless there be some third reconciling member. I shall give, hereafter, more examples of the modes in which this reconciliation is effected in towers with double lights: the Abbeville architect put his sword to the knot perhaps rather too sharply. Vexed by the want of unity between his two windows he literally laid their heads together, and so distorted their ogee curves, as to leave only one of the trefoiled panels above, on the inner side, and three on the outer side of each arch. The arrangement is given in Plate XII. fig. 3. Associated with the various undulation of flamboyant curves below, it is in the real tower hardly observed, while it binds it into one mass in general effect. Granting it, however, to be ugly and wrong, I like sins of the kind, {{for the sake of the}} courage it requires to commit them. In plate II. (part of a small chapel attached to the West front of the Cathedral of St. Lo), the reader will see an instance, from the same architecture, of a violation of its own principles, for the sake of a peculiar meaning. If there be any one feature which the flamboyant architect loved to decorate richly, it was the niche--it was what the capital is to the Corinthian order; yet in the case before us there is an ugly beehive put in the place of the principal niche of the arch. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am right in my interpretation of its meaning, but I have little doubt that two figures below, now broken away, once represented an Annunciation; and on another part of the same cathedral, I find the descent of the Spirit, encompassed by rays of light, represented very nearly in the form of the niche in question; which appears, therefore, to be intended for a representation of this effulgence, while at the same time it was made a canopy for the delicate figures below. Whether this was its meaning or not, it is remarkable as a daring departure from the common habits of the time.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was twofold. First, it aimed to test the {{recently}} developed personality assessment, Role Profiles, for its validity in the form of convergent validity analysis and cross structure analysis guided by role theory in which Role Profiles is grounded. Second, this study explored Role Profiles 2 ̆ 7 clinical implications by capturing participants 2 ̆ 7 subjective experiences of this assessment.;Twenty couples recruited from the community completed the assessments, which included the Demographic Information form, the Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Esteem scale, the Dyadic Adjustment scale, and the Role Balance scale. Upon completion of the assessments, participants were asked to complete the Role Profiles by placing seventy-one cards of roles in one of four groups that best described how they felt about themselves at that moment. Four groups included 2 ̆ 2 This Is Who I Am 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 This Is Who I Am Not 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 <b>I</b> Am <b>Not</b> <b>Sure</b> <b>If</b> This <b>Is</b> Who I Am 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 This Is Who I Want To Be 2 ̆ 2. After the assessments, the couples were asked to answer two sets of open-ended questions about their subjective experiences of the Role Profiles.;Findings of this study were consistent with previous studies on couples similarity and marital satisfaction: couples who shared many identical roles in their roles profiles were more likely to report higher satisfaction in their marriage. Furthermore, this study found a negative relationship between role confusion and self-esteem. Additionally, the results of this study indicated a statistically significant negative relationship between role confusion and marital satisfaction for husbands but not wives. The utility of the Role Profiles as a clinical assessment in couples therapy are discussed and suggested are made for future research...|$|R
