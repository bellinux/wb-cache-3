5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not blunt, and the teeth were <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of the snout. These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.|$|E

The Attorney-General is required to assist the Tribunal in the hearing of the reference, and the President may be represented by such legal counsel as the Tribunal may appoint, after consulting the President. The parties appearing before the Tribunal are <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> President and the Attorney-General. The Tribunal may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, {{to one or more}} representatives of the class. If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, the Tribunal may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.|$|E

5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he {{said had}} been {{thinking}} along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my own opinions, which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius is <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps {{of a different kind}} to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E
5|$|Most Stylidium {{species are}} endemic to Australia. In Western Australia alone, {{there are more}} than 150 species, at least 50 of which are in the area {{immediately}} around Perth. There are at least four species of Stylidium that are <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian continent: S. tenellum is found in Myanmar, Melaka, and Tonkin; S. kunthii in Bengal and Myanmar; S. uliginosum in Queensland, Sri Lanka, and the south coast of China; and S. alsinoides in Queensland and the Philippines. The cladistic group Stylidium contains more than 230 individual species (more than 300 species exist, but many specimens have not yet been formally described), making it the fifth largest genus in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The castle was garrisoned by parliamentarians {{during the}} English Civil War {{during which time}} it was badly damaged. At {{the time it was}} {{estimated}} that the damaged to the castle and surrounding area would take £1,000 to repair. Wressle Castle was slighted (partially demolished) on several occasions in 1646–50. The 1648 demolition work was focused on the castle’s battlements, with a contemporary letter noting that “ agents would show no care in preserving any of the materials, but pitched of the stones from the battlements to the ground” Destruction was more extensive two years later, when Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, was ordered to demolish everything that remain except the south range of the castle. The earl would be allowed to use the surviving range as a manor house. The damage was <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle buildings, and probably affected the ornamental landscape.|$|E

25|$|By the 1960s {{critics of}} the Bahá'í Faith {{increasingly}} used charges of spying, and of connections to foreign powers rather than simply labelling Bahá'ís as heretics. These new charges helped define a new 'other' and reaffirmed a threatened Shi'i self. This new attitude towards the Bahá'ís was now <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clerics, but was also rampant among the secular Iranian middle-class. In the 1970s accusations of Bahá'ís being numerous in the Shah's regime surfaced, as well as there being a perception that Bahá'ís were generally better off {{than the rest of}} the population.|$|E
25|$|Dada was <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{visual and}} {{literary}} arts; its influence reached into sound and music. Kurt Schwitters developed {{what he called}} sound poems, while Francis Picabia and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920. Other composers such as Erwin Schulhoff, Hans Heusser and Alberto Savinio all wrote Dada music, while members of Les Six collaborated {{with members of the}} Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings. Erik Satie also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career, although he is primarily associated with musical Impressionism.|$|E
25|$|Employment status {{effects are}} <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual. Being {{unemployed}} can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective well-being, {{compared to being}} employed or not working (and not looking for work). Partner life satisfaction is inversely related {{to the number of}} hours their partner is underemployed. When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women. However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective well-being of an individual. On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective well-being of the employed.|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had nocturnal habits, but was <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> darkness. She had unearthly beauty, {{and was able to}} change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in Dracula. She did, however, sleep in a coffin. Carmilla works as a Gothic horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.|$|E
25|$|After the eruptions of the Birker Fell Formation the {{composition}} of the erupting magma changed from andesitic to dacitic, and as a result the nature of the volcanism became more explosive. A large caldera volcano was built in the area where Scafell and the Langdale Pikes stand today. The caldera was at least 15km across, and as the caldera collapsed, much more than 400 cubic kilometres of magma were erupted. At the close of this volcanic activity, the caldera was filled with sedimentary deposits, represented today by the Seathwaite Fell Sandstone Formation, a sequence of bedded volcaniclastic sandstone and siltstone strata. However, deposition was <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old caldera, and to the east of Thirlmere this formation rests directly on the Birker Fell andesites.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} {{continuing}} unrest in the camp. The voyageurs, {{led by the}} two interpreters Pierre St Germain and Jean Baptiste Adam, again rebelled. This time Franklin's threats were ineffective, St Germian and Adam insisting that as continuing into the wilderness would mean certain death, the threat of execution for mutiny was laughable. Negotiation by Willard Wentzel, the North West Company's representative, eventually restored an uneasy truce. The discord was <b>not</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> voyageurs; Back and Hood had fallen out over their rivalry for the affections of an first nations girl nicknamed Greenstockings, and would have fought a duel with pistold over her had John Hepburn not removed the gunpowder from their weapons. The situation was defused when Back was dispatched south. Hood subsequently fathered a child with Greenstockings.|$|E
