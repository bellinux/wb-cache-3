40|$|Robotic ecologies are systems {{made out}} of several robotic devices, {{including}} mobile robots, wireless sensors and effectors embedded in everyday environments, where they cooperate to achieve complex tasks. This paper demonstrates how endowing robotic ecologies with information processing algorithms such as perception, learning, planning, and novelty detection can make these systems able to deliver modular, flexible, manageable and dependable Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions. Specifically, we show how the integrated and self-organising cognitive solutions implemented within the EU project RUBICON (Robotic UBIquitous Cognitive Network) can reduce the need of costly pre-programming and maintenance of robotic ecologies. We illustrate how these solutions can be harnessed to (i) deliver a range of assistive services by coordinating the sensing & acting capabilities of heterogeneous devices, (ii) adapt and tune the overall behaviour of the ecology to the preferences and behaviour of its inhabitants, and also (iii) deal with novel events, due to the occurrence of new user 2 ̆ 7 s activities and changing user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>habits...</b>|$|R

40|$|Scholars in rhetoric have {{recently}} sought {{to expand their}} understanding of social movements and the public sphere by integrating studies of visual rhetoric. For scholars exploring the rhetoric of social movements and the public sphere, the environmental movement provides a fruitful avenue of research by which to consider the role of visual rhetoric in changing social consciousness. Drawing on a methodology that views social movements through a rhetorical lens, I explore how the visual rhetoric of the environmental justice movement challenges corporate practices and discourses that shape public perceptions of sustainable development and industry 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to open communication. In its efforts to redefine public understanding of sustainability, the environmental justice movement employs visual rhetoric to contend that industry 2 ̆ 7 s concerns for economic growth and profitability far outweigh its concerns for environmental stewardship. In its efforts to redefine public understanding of industry 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to open communication, the environmental justice movement employs visual rhetoric to illustrate how industry 2 ̆ 7 s notion of open communication constructs a public that is rhetorically ill-equipped to question industry 2 ̆ 7 s practices and successfully participate in public policy discussions. While the visual rhetoric of the environmental justice movement may redefine public consciousness with respect to sustainability and open communcation, the movement 2 ̆ 7 s visual rhetoric is nonetheless limited {{in its ability to}} fully promote public action to change these practices because the visual rhetoric examined in this study differs from the images of a culture accustomed to what Szasz refers to as 2 ̆ 2 images of disorder. 2 ̆ 2 Therefore, an analysis of the effectiveness of a movement 2 ̆ 7 s visual rhetoric must take into account the ways in which various institutional practices and discourses shape a culture 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>habits</b> of vision, habits which can erode the effectiveness of certain visual rhetoric.

Thirteen fish species were identified (%F= 86. 6), the most significant families were Sciaenidae (32 %), Trichiuridae (26 %) e Ariidae (16 %), and four crustaceans species (%F= 26). <b>S.</b> fluviatilis feeding <b>habits</b> did not differ by gender and in general, calves had higher prey diversity than juveniles and adults.
