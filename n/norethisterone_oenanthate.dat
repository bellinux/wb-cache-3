40|$|<b>Norethisterone</b> <b>oenanthate</b> (NET-OEN) {{was given}} as an {{injectable}} contraceptive to 295 healthy women over 1606 woman-months. A modified injection schedule was used. There were no pregnancies, and the 12 -month, life-table, use-related discontinuation rate was 39. 1 / 100 users. Menstrual disturbance (10. 8 / 100 women), minor side effects (13. 5 / 100 women), and personal reasons (12. 0 / 100 women) {{were the main}} causes of use-related discontinuation. There {{was no difference in}} use-related discontinuation rates between women receiving their first injection during a normal menstrual period and those receiving it immediately after a pregnancy. There were no serious side effects. The use of NET-OEN in certain groups of women is recommended, particularly in those in need of highly effective contraception, who cannot or do not wish to take oral contraceptives, who are lactating, or who are awaiting hospital admission for sterilisation...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. [Background] Two {{injectable}} progestogen-only contraceptives (IPCs) depot {{medroxyprogesterone acetate}} (DMPA) and <b>norethisterone</b> <b>oenanthate</b> (NET-EN) {{continue to be}} extensively used in some countries, forming {{a large proportion of}} the health system's expenditure on contraception. Both these highly effective contraceptives receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years. They differ in cost and frequently of administration. A systematic comparison was undertaken to investiage their rational use. [Objectives] To determine if there are differences between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every three months and norethisterone oenathate given at a dose of 200 mg IM every two months, in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and discontinuation patterns, and adverse clinical effects. [Study Design] A Cochrane systematic review was used to answer the question posed in the research objective. This included a systematic search for all available literature comapring DMPA and NET-EN, followed by appraisal of all studies for inclusion in the review. Meta-analysis was then applied to the included study...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} efficacy {{and the influence of}} progestogen-only contraceptives (POCs) in postpartum lactating mothers over a period of 18 -months. 250 mothers were randomised to either the study groups or the control group. In the study groups, 100 mothers were given an oral progestogen pill; lynestrenol and another 100 mothers were assigned to injectable progestogens; depot medroxy-progesterone acetate (DMPA) and <b>norethisterone</b> <b>oenanthate</b> (NET EN), 50 each. The control group (n= 50) was given nonhormonal methods. There was no contraceptive failure or negative influence on lactation among the medication groups. There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups with respect to the continuation rates and to the adverse effects that led to premature discontinuation. In conclusion, POCs can be used by lactating mothers effectively and safely for at least 18 months. Therefore, the wide use of these methods should be recommended if the international targets to protect, promote and support breast-feeding as well as family planning are to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In South Africa, where {{health care}} {{resources}} are limited, {{it is important}} to ensure that drugs provision and use is rational. The Essential Drug List includes depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and <b>norethisterone</b> <b>oenanthate</b> (NET-EN) as injectable progestagen-only contraceptives (IPCs), and both products are extensively used. Objectives and Methods Utilisation patterns of the injectable contraceptive products DMPA and NET-EN are compared in the context of current knowledge of the safety and efficacy of these agents. Utilisation patterns were analysed by means of a Pareto (ABC) analysis of IPCs issued from 4 South African provincial pharmaceutical depots over 3 financial years. A case study from rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is used to examine utilisation patterns and self-reported side effects experienced by 187 women using IPCs. Results IPCs accounted for a substantial share of total state expenditure on drugs. While more DMPA than NET-EN was issued, NET-EN distribution from 2 depots increased over the 3 -year period. Since DMPA was cheaper, if all NET-EN clients in the 1999 / 2000 financial year (annualised) had used DMPA, the 4 depots could have saved 4. 95 million South African Rands on product acquisition costs alone. The KZN case study showed slightly more NET-EN (54 %) than DMPA (46 %) use; no significant differences in self-reported side effects; and that younger women were more likely to use NET-EN than DMPA (p = 0. 0001). Conclusions Providing IPCs on the basis of age is not appropriate or cost effective. Rational use of these products should include consideration of the cost of prescribing one over another. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the common {{experience}} of vaginal wetness amongst South African users of progestogen-only injectable contraceptives. The observations emerged {{in the course of}} a community-based cross-sectional household survey undertaken in a rural district of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The purpose of the survey was to elicit self-reporting on side effects of injectable contraceptive methods. Eight hundred and forty-eight women aged 15 - 49 were interviewed and 22. 1 % reported current use of an injectable contraceptive method, either depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-ProveraÂ®) or <b>norethisterone</b> <b>oenanthate</b> (Nur-IsterateÂ®). Other modern methods used were oral hormonal contraceptives (4. 5 %), male condoms (1. 3 %), the intrauterine device (0. 1 %), and tubal ligation (0. 1 %). Vaginal wetness was reported by 18. 4 % of users and was one of the most common side effects, second only to amenorrhoea (62. 5 %). It was also what 17. 5 % of the women liked least about using this method. According to almost half the respondents, men regard women who use the injectable contraceptive as "wet", "cold" and/or "tasteless". These survey findings were supported by participants of 14 focus group interviews held in the sub-district. Since some South African men may prefer dry sex the perception that the injectable contraceptive increases vaginal wetness may be problematic for women who use it. Whilst vaginal wetness can only be classified as a subjective side effect at this stage, further investigations are needed as many South African women opt to use this method.
