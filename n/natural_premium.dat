Basing the tariff on select mortality tables will result in healthy people continuously lapsing their contracts and demanding the issuing premium rate, according to their actual age. Setting an aggregated premium rate that is not loss-bringing is discussed, taking into consideration lapsing of contracts and including also a presumption regarding the force of entry as a function of age.

40|$|This {{research}} {{discusses the}} use of Delta in regulating the investment behaviour of the Trustees of Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) who use Exchange Traded Options (ETOs) in their investment strategies. An ETO represents a contract between two parties, giving the taker (the buyer) the right, but not the obligation, {{to buy or sell}} a parcel of shares at a predetermined price, on or before a predetermined date, to or from the writer (the seller). It is acceptable for SMSF Trustees to use ETO investments as part of their overall investment strategy, providing that leverage or mere speculation are not the reasons behind that investment. It {{is important to note that}} neither the Regulator, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), nor its predecessor, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA), actually state what constitutes 'speculation', or what the allowable uses for derivatives are. There are no practical guidelines. This is a key issue for this research, which aims, as practically as possible, to fill these crucial gaps. A Trustee must abide by their superannuation fund's overriding covenants and investment strategy, and inform its members, through Risk Management Statements, of the trust's derivative strategy. While ETOs can be used to manage risk, they also carry a level of risk themselves. Delta measures an ETO's value movement in correlation with a movement in the option's underlying share price. An ETO carrying a low Delta generally means a cheaper price (premium) per contract than an option carrying a higher Delta. The lower the Delta, however, the lower the chance there is of a positive result for the buyer. This research shows that an ETO Delta of less than 0. 2 gives results in favour of buyers in only 11 out of 100 occurrences. This figure rises to 42 out of 100 when Delta is greater than 0. 8. From the sampled data, there is an overall financial loss to the buyer of - 1. 91 %, with the financial return results being mixed at all levels of Delta. The overall return results have been compiled without preference to market direction, and clearly highlight the <b>natural</b> <b>premium</b> bias (which the buyer pays) to the seller. What this data does is reenforce the need for Trustees to have a solid view of market directions, or a set strategy in place, as buyers of ETOs. The conclusions drawn from the findings show that the chance of loss (when buying), or gain (when selling) ETOs with a Delta of; - less than 0. 20 is 89 %; - less than 0. 40 is 74 %; - less than 0. 60 is 66 %; - less than 0. 80 is 57 %; - greater than 0. 80 is 58 %; For example, a Trustee buying an ETO with a Delta of less than 0. 20, faces an 89 % chance of loss; a Trustee selling an ETO with a Delta of less than 0. 20, faces an 89 % chance of gain. The findings on overall financial returns (profit or loss) offer additional support to this critical review of Delta as a risk measurement tool. Whist it is impossible to know the motives or actual positions of portfolio managers of SMSF at any time, the aim of the thesis is to provide a measurement tool that can be used to assist the trustee at any given time by measuring the option risk element alone. When interpreting the findings, the reader must remember that ETO strategies are numerous, and a high-risk profile for one strategy may represent a low risk for another. Further to this, an ETO strategy's risk profile may change with the overlaying of another ETO. For example, where a Call option is bought, the risk involved in that purchase is represented by the premium paid. However, another Call option can then be sold against that position, with a later (or earlier) date to expiry, and with a higher strike price. This 'overlay' reduces the initial risk, but impacts on the maximum gain. It is vital that Trustees have a solid understanding of the basics of ETO strategies before considering using Delta as a measure of risk. The research proposes some guidelines Trustees can use when assessing an ETO strategy against their derivative/investment risk profile. For example, a Trustee buying an ETO with a Delta of less than 0. 20, faces an 89 % chance of loss; a Trustee selling an ETO with a Delta of less than 0. 20, faces an 89 % chance of gain. The findings on overall financial returns (profit or loss) offer additional support to this critical review of Delta as a risk measurement tool.

It is vital that Trustees have a solid understanding of the basics of ETO strategies before considering using Delta as a measure of risk. The research proposes some guidelines Trustees can use when assessing an ETO strategy against their derivative/investment risk profile. The findings from 2400 data samples show strong trends in support of the underlying premise (see Figure: Positive Results Versus Delta (ETO Buyers)). Given these findings, the research concludes that Delta can be used as a measure of risk by SMSF Trustees. Delta may not be suitable, however, for measuring multiple layers of combined ETO positions, a type of derivative strategy not suited to or usual in the context of measuring risk within a SMSF. There is a major difference between simple and simplistic solutions offering practical answers in an environment of increasing complexity. Often, simple solutions offer far more value to the less experienced, when compared to complex ones, especially given the growing number of SMSFs, and the increasing lack of expertise in the areas of superannuation and risk management that this growth implies...|$|E

Surprisingly, of the estimated twelve million American kosher consumers — individuals who specifically seek out kosher-certified foods — only 8 percent are religious Jews who eat exclusively kosher food. Most choose kosher food for reasons related to health, food safety, taste, vegetarianism, and lactose intolerance or to satisfy non-Jewish religious requirements such as halal.

At the same time that kosher certification illustrates the infiltration of traditional Jewish foodways into the American mainstream, the turbulent history of kosher certification in the United States demonstrates how quintessentially American legal and economic institutions have shaped Jewish communal self-governance.

40|$|The thesis {{which follows}} {{is an attempt}} to examine a complex {{organisational}} phenomenon corporate policy within a multinational resource based joint venture. It employs a multidisciplinary conceptual framework which draws on a range of disciplines including Business Policy/Strategy, Organisation Theory and Macroeconomics (see 1. 1). The central concern of the thesis is to "Explain how prevailing political and economic factors have influenced the policy decisions undertaken by the North West Shelf (NWS) joint venturers throughout critical periods or 'events' in the history of Australia's largest capital project. " This objective is accommodated within {{the main body of the}} thesis along with two other interrelated goals "Production of an original and comprehensive commentary on the history of the North West Shelf project from 1973 to 1986 and the design of a broad conceptual schema to describe the decision making environment of the NWS joint venturers. " (see Figure 3). This schema is ultimately developed into a model with general applications for the study of corporate policy and strategy within multinational resource based joint venture projects (see 8. 3). Policy, Strategy and Environment are the three keynote terms employed in the theoretical base of the study which attempts to highlight the essential connection between them (see 1. 1. 3). The topic of corporate policy and strategy relating to the North. West Shelf joint venture was chosen for a number of reasons, not least the sheer scale and significance of the project for the Australian and Western Australian economies. The NWS project has been given a high media profile since the Woodside joint venture participants (JVP) made their first commercial gas finds off North Western Australia in 1972 (see Introduction) It has also been the subject of extensive parliamentary debate at Federal and State level, with continuing political controversies over government control and high levels of foreign interest in Australia's <b>premium</b> <b>natural</b> gas fields. Federal and West Australian legislative frameworks and policy instruments relating to large scale petroleum and mineral developments are examined in some detail in the thesis (see Chapter 4). The essential interaction between corporate and public policies (host governments and multinational joint venturers), is also an important focal point of the study. To date no comprehensive historical commentary has been produced to describe the planning and development of Western Australia's largest resource project: in terms of capital invested (A 12 billion by 1995) (1987 dollars) and revenue from sales of hydrocarbons, piped natural gas and 1 iquified natural gas (LNG) to domestic and export markets. The thesis accommodates this goal through the use of published sources and interview material (see 1. 1 and 1. 2) within a unique theoretical framework. Interview respondents provided both general background on the NWS venture and a variety of perspectives on a series of 'critical events' in the history of the project. Analysis of these 'events', through comparison of interview responses and information from a range of published sources, provides an essential insight into the policy decisions taken by the NWS joint venturers during critical periods in planning and development of the project. The central reference point in the thesis is the 'Conceptual Map' which is comprised of a series of schematic diagrams outlining various sectors of the North West Shelf project organisation's internal and external environment. The map and relevant concepts are used to demonstrate how policy outputs from the NWS joint venture influence and are influenced by other organisations or interest groups within the project organisation's internal and external environment. The NWS project organisation is seen to be linked to a series of other influential organisations and government bodies through an interorganisational network. This follows Odell (1983) who developed the concept of an international petroleum network to highlight essential connections between corporate and governmental bodies operating at each level within the vertically integrated international petroleum industry (see 3. 1). The network concept is usefully employed in the thesis to illustrate the influence which World level (multinational), National and State level interests can hold in relation to corporate policy and strategy within a multinational joint venture project. The thesis is structured in a form which allows Chapters 3 to 8 to pursue and develop a series of discrete themes relating to the NWS project. These are bound together by the theoretical framework and conceptual schema set out in Chapters 1 and 2. In broad terms the content of the study breaks down as follows: Introduction - (i) Historical background to the NWS project; (ii) the structure of the NWS joint venture, (iii) chronology and overview of key events influencing the planning of the project. Chapters 1 and 2 cover the theoretical structure and methodological basis of the study. The contribution of various writers to the multidisciplinary conceptual framework of the thesis is discussed in detail. Chapter 3 covers the worldwide petroleum network, the structure of the Australian oil and gas industry, the position of the NWS project as an exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG) and the growing international trade in this product. Chapter 4 is primarily concerned with the legislative and public policy framework, which has been developed at Federal and State level to govern the development of large scale petroleum and minerals projects in Australia. Provisions with particular relevance to the NWS project are considered at length. Chapter 5 is a simple but detailed description of the Conceptual Map, highlighting the influence of a series of key external bodies on the corporate policies of the NWS joint venturers over specified periods of time. Chapters 6 and 7 provide a detailed analysis of three 'critical events' identified by interview respondents as having an important impact on the future development of the NWS project. Each event is set within a wider context of political and economic change within Western Australia and Australia. Major macroeconomic shifts in relevant international markets are also considered. In the final chapter information presented in Chapters 3, 6 and 7 is updated bringing important themes pursued in these sections through to the end of 1988. A simple model of 'Policy Making Environment' for multinational resource based joint ventures is presented incorporating major features drawn from the conceptual map employed throughout the thesis. Final conclusions are presented in order to draw together both the theoretical and thematic content of the work and identify key areas for future research...|$|R
