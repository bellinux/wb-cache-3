5|$|After {{the trade}} Chamberlain {{found himself on}} a {{promising}} Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer, a future Hall-of-Famer, and talented role players Larry Costello, Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson. Cherry remarks {{that there was a}} certain tension within the team: Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not willing to give up his authority, and Jackson, a talented center, was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot; however, as the season progressed, the three began to mesh better. Chamberlain did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the Sixers' coach, Dolph Schayes, because Schayes, according to him, had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat {{met up with}} the Ladybird, who also had a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> him. In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E
5|$|The {{apartment}} in which Rona {{and her mother}} were living was seized when the communists invaded Hungary in 1919. Owing to political instability and the persecution of those with communist sympathies during the countering White Terror, an increasing amount of work at the Institute fell to Rona. When offered a position in 1921 to return to Dahlem and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, by Otto Hahn, Rona resigned. She joined Hahn's staff in Berlin to separate ionium (now known as Th-230) from uranium. Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic forced her transfer to the Textile Fiber Institute of Kaiser Wilhelm, as practical research was the only work permitted at the time. Theoretical research with no essential application was not a priority. Her training allowed her {{to return to a}} more stable Hungary and accept a position in a textile factory there in 1923. She did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the work and soon left, joining the staff of the Institute for Radium Research of Vienna in 1924 at the request of Stefan Meyer. Her research there focused on measuring the absorption and range of hydrogen rays, as well as on developing polonium as an alternative radioactive material to radium.|$|E

Ironically, because the imperial kinsmen stabilized their military power and wished to gain political power, Emperor Wu was afraid they would have thoughts of usurping the throne. Thus, he also frequently killed his kinsmen.|$|E

25|$|California's death, however, did not {{mark the}} end of the {{emergence}} of Spirit material. Starting in 2000, there have been five collections of previously unreleased studio and live material, four of which were two-CD sets. California had also prepared an anthology of material from the group's first stint with Mercury Records entitled The Mercury Years. The two-CD set was released in early 1997, though it raised the ire of some fans who did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> {{the fact that some of}} the material had been re-edited or featured overdubbing that was not present on the original releases.|$|E

Nothing came of this plan. Representative Paul Barras did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the generals, but SÃ©rurier's actions had pleased him so he nominated him for promotion on 25 June.

25|$|About 1695 {{the castle}} changed hands once again {{becoming}} {{the property of}} the MÄ™ciÅ„ski family. Seven years later, in 1702, over a half of the castle had burnt down in the fire set by the Swedish troops of Charles XII. After the fire, it was never to be rebuilt. About 1784 the castle was purchased by Tomasz JakliÅ„ski, who did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> its condition. Consequently, the last tenants left the devastated castle about 1810. The next owner of the Ogrodzieniec Castle was Ludwik KozÅ‚owski, who used the remains of the castle as a source of building material and sold out the castle's equipment to the Jewish merchants.|$|E

The duo reunited with Gene Kelly for their most successful project, the classic Singin' in the Rain, about Hollywood {{in the final days of}} the silent film era. Comden and Green provided the story and screenplay; the songs were hits from the late 1920s and early 1930s by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, {{theatrical}} producer Martin Gabel {{was working}} on a stage adaptation of the James M. Cain novel Serenade, about an opera singer who comes to the realization he is homosexual, and he invited Laurents to write the book. Laurents accepted and suggested Bernstein and Robbins join the creative team. Robbins felt if the three were going to join forces, they should return to East Side Story, and Bernstein agreed. Laurents, however, was committed to Gabel, who introduced him to the young composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim auditioned by playing the score for Saturday Night, his musical that was scheduled to open in the fall. Laurents liked the lyrics but was not impressed with the music. Sondheim did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> Laurents' opinion. Serenade ultimately was shelved.|$|E
