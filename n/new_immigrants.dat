5|$|With the {{expansion}} of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse {{than the rest of}} the state.

40|$|Abstract: Drawing upon {{a sample}} of 296 <b>new</b> <b>immigrant</b> women in Hong Kong, this study {{investigated}} how social service utilization, family functioning, and sense of community influenced the depressive symptoms of <b>new</b> <b>immigrant</b> women. Results of the structural equation modeling suggested that family functioning and sense of community were both significantly and negatively associated with the depression of <b>new</b> <b>immigrant</b> women. Utilization of community services also influenced the depression of immigrant women indirectly through the mediating effect of sense of community. Implications of the research findings for mental health intervention were discussed...|$|R

The Canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the current level of immigration. In 2014, a total of 260,400 immigrants were admitted to Canada. The Canadian government anticipated between 280,000 and 305,000 new permanent residents in the following years. a similar number of immigrants as in recent years. <b>New</b> <b>immigrants</b> settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.

At this time, the majority of the Chinese population in Hong Kong had no political representation in the British colonial government. The British governors did rely, however, on a small number of Chinese elites, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung, who served as ambassadors and mediators between the government and local population.|$|E

But the Great Depression {{starting in}} 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.|$|E

Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups.

After {{the signing of the}} 1949 Armistice Agreements and division of Jerusalem, the western three-quarters of Mamilla were held by Israel and the eastern quarter became a no man's land of barbed-wire and concrete barricades between Israeli and Jordanian lines. The active and hostile border subjected Mamilla to Jordanian sniper and guerilla attacks, and even stones thrown by Arab Legionnaires from the Old City walls above. The neighbourhood was one of several border areas in the city to experience a sharp decline, and subsequently became home to families of <b>new</b> <b>immigrants</b> with many children and of weak financial abilities, as well as dirty light industry like auto repair.
