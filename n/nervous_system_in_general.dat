6000|$|In a {{modified}} form this principle holds with voluntary acts. Nervous excitation always tends to beget muscular motion; {{and when it}} rises to a certain intensity, always does beget it. Not only in reflex actions, whether with or without sensation, do we see that special nerves, when raised {{to a state of}} tension, discharge themselves on special muscles with which they are indirectly connected; but those external actions through which we read the feelings of others, show us that under any considerable tension, the <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> discharges itself on the muscular system in general: either with or without the guidance of the will. The shivering produced by cold, implies irregular muscular contractions, which, though at first only partly involuntary, become, when the cold is extreme, almost wholly involuntary. When you have severely burnt your finger, {{it is very difficult to}} preserve a dignified composure: contortion of face, or movement of limb, is pretty sure to follow. If a man receives good news with neither change of feature nor bodily motion, it is inferred that he is not much pleased, or that he has extraordinary self-control--either inference implying that joy almost universally produces contraction of the muscles; and so, alters the expression, or attitude, or both. And when we hear of the feats of strength which men have performed when their lives were at stake--when we read how, in the energy of despair, even paralytic patients have regained for a time the use of their limbs, we see still more clearly the relations between nervous and muscular excitements. It becomes manifest both that emotions and sensations tend to generate bodily movements and that the movements are vehement in proportion as the emotions or sensations are intense.[2] ...|$|E

The CST is a long descending central pathway, restricted to mammals, which is involved both in motor and sensory control. The rat CST is a very useful model in experimental research on the development of fibre <b>systems</b> <b>in</b> mammals because of its postnatal outgrowth throughout the spinal cord as well as its experimental accessibility.

In the developing nervous system, each CRMP displays a distinct expression pattern both in time and space.

However, CRMP-2 and CRMP-5 {{are found to be}} co-expressed in post-mitotic granular neurons. CRMP expression is highest when neurons and synaptic connections mature actively during the first postnatal week, suggesting CRMPs’ role in neuronal migration, differentiation and axonal growth. Indeed, CRMP-2 expression is induced by neuronal differentiation promoting factors such as noggin, chordin, GDNF, and FGF.|$|E

Studies of skin conductance and heart rate in adults have shown that those with avoidant attachment and anxious attachment will show markers of increased distress during attachment and non-attachment stressors compared to those securely attached.|$|E

Remarkably, 11 of 16 of the animals treated with the above combination were able to stand and walk at 21 days after injury, 4 of them almost normally.

While phrenology remained a fixture at fairs and carnivals, it did not enjoy wide acceptance within the scientific community. The major criticism of phrenology is that researchers were not able to test theories empirically.|$|E

In the present study we employed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a series of 29 CNPS tumors, including 20 gliomas (17 astrocytic and 3 oligodendroglial tumors), 4 schwannomas and 5 meningiomas to investigate whether RNAs were present or absent in the case of these CCKA, CCKB and CCKC receptors. The presence of the three CCK receptor subtypes was also assayed on three experimental models, i. e. the U 373 human glioma, the C 6 rat glioma and the 9 L rat gliosarcoma. The data show that 9 / 20 (45 %) of the gliomas exhibited RNAs for the CCKB receptor as did the C 6 rat glioma, 13 / 20 (65 %) RNAs for the CCKC receptor as did the U 373 human glioma and the 9 L rat gliosarcoma. Of the 20 gliomas, 17 (85 %) expressed RNAs for either the CCKB or the CCKC receptor (or both), a feature which was also observed in the experimental models. One schwannoma and one meningioma exhibited RNAs for the CCKB receptor, while 4 / 4 schwannomas and 4 / 5 meningiomas showed RNAs for the CCKC receptor. None of the gliomas, schwannomas or meningiomas exhibited RNAs for the CCKA receptor, which were found in the 9 L rat gliosarcoma model only.

40|$|Proper central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> (CNS) {{function}} <b>in</b> vertebrates and invertebrates alike {{requires the}} sufficient production of, and suitable interaction between, different classes of neurons and glial cells. Although a large heterogeneity exists between individual {{cells of the}} CNS, one can begin dissecting its construction, and ultimately function, based on developmental principles. One such principle is the lineage concept; accumulating evidence suggests that in the CNS of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, classes of cells can be defined based on their progenitor origin, or lineage. Neurons and/or glial cells which derive from an individual progenitor, {{of which there are}} approximately 100 per brain hemisphere, exhibit common structural properties. In this dissertation we describe the lineage relationship, and resultant characteristics, of Drosophila brain cells in two contexts: glial cells populating the neuropil-cortex interface (neuropil glia) and ensembles of neurons transmitting visual information to a higher-order brain region called the central complex (Anterior Visual Pathway). In the first context, we find that astrocyte-like glial cells (ALGs), a neuropil glia subtype reminiscent of vertebrate astrocytes, are generated in two distinct waves. The first wave results from the proliferation of embryonic progenitors in the basal brain, and produces the mature ALGs of the larval brain. ALGs of the adult brain, produced during the second wave, are generated from a completely separate population of progenitors in the larva. We also characterize the cytology of these glial populations. In the second context, we find that all ring neurons of the ellipsoid body, a subcompartment of the central complex, are generated from a single lineage called DALv 2. Ring neurons are a peculiar neuronal class which has been previously shown to respond to visual stimuli and are required for higher-order visually-guided behaviors. We identify two further lineages, DALcl 1 and 2, which generate parallel ensembles of neurons providing visual input to ring neurons. Importantly, neurons of DALcl 1 and 2 are not only developmentally-distinct, but also exhibit structural and functional differences, highlighting the rarely demonstrated principle that functional neuronal circuitry can be mapped to developmental cell lineage. Taken together, this thesis validates the utility of employing the lineage principle to formulate hypotheses of circuit function and <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> assembly <b>in</b> <b>general...</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{at present}} well {{established}} {{that there are}} physiological interactions between the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. This work focuses on the impact {{that the lack of}} a functional thymus has on neurotransmitter and neurotrophin concentrations in the spleen and in defined brain regions, using as a model homozygous Foxn 1 nu mice. This spontaneous mutation results in defective development of the thymus anlage, and therefore, in lack of mature T cells. The first part of this work shows that Foxn 1 nu mice have: 1) an increased splenic sympathetic innervation that is maintained during adult life; 2) alterations in noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters in defined brain regions comparable to those in the spleen; 3) increased density of noradrenergic fibers in the spleen and hypothalamus; 4) increased brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) concentrations, and BDNF signals in the spleen and hippocampus; 5) marked alterations in the anatomy of the hippocampus; and 6) increased corticosterone blood levels. All these alterations are abolished in Foxn 1 nu mice reconstituted by thymus transplantation at birth. The second part studied whether the alterations detected in nude mice reflect a more general condition that causally relates the catecholaminergic system with the expression of neurotrophins. The results demonstrate that destruction of noradrenergic neurons by administration of a neurotoxin, results in a permanent or transient denervation that is paralleled by increased or decreased neurotrophin concentrations in the spleen and in the brain and in corticosterone blood levels, depending on the age at which mice are denervated. Taken together, the results reported here indicate that the alterations in neurotransmitters and neurotrophins observed in homozygous Foxn 1 nu mice are not just an epiphenomenon fortuitously associated with the absence of a functional thymus, but that most likely mature T cells, by acting either directly or indirectly, exert an inhibitory influence on the development of splenic sympathetic innervation and of catecholaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms <b>in</b> the central <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> <b>In</b> more <b>general</b> terms, these results provide new evidence that the immune system can affect the <b>nervous</b> and endocrine <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Differential {{screening}} of a cDNA library from the PC 12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line previously revealed a clone, clone 73, whose corresponding mRNA is induced by nerve growth factor (NGF). Induction parallels NGF-stimulated PC 12 differentiation from a chromaffinlike phenotype to a sympathetic neuronlike phenotype. We report that DNA sequence analysis reveals that clone 73 mRNA encodes an intermediate filament (IF) protein whose predicted {{amino acid sequence}} is distinct from the known sequences of {{other members of the}} IF protein family. The sequence has highest homology with desmin and vimentin and includes the highly conserved central alpha-helical rod domain with the characteristic heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues, but has lower homology in the amino-terminal head and carboxyl-terminal tail domains. The head domain contains a large number of serine residues which are potential phosphorylation sites. The expression of clone 73 in vivo <b>in</b> the <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> of the adult rat was investigated by in situ hybridization of clone 73 probes to tissue sections. The mRNA is expressed at high levels in ganglia of the peripheral <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> including the superior cervical ganglion (sympathetic), ciliary ganglion (parasympathetic), and dorsal root ganglion (sensory). <b>In</b> the central <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> motor nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, V, VI, VII, X, and XII as well as ventral horn motor neurons and a restricted set of other central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> nuclei express the clone 73 mRNA. Tissues apart from those of the <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> did not <b>in</b> <b>general</b> express the mRNA, with only very low levels detected in adrenal gland. We discuss the implications of these results for the mechanism of NGF- induced PC 12 cell differentiation, the pathways of neuronal development in vivo, and the possible function of the clone 73 IF protein and its relationship to other IF proteins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract With the political, {{social and}} {{financial}} drives for cancer research, many advances {{have been made}} in the treatment of many different cancer types. For example, given the increase in awareness, early detection, and treatment of breast and prostate cancers, we have seen substantial increases in survival rates. Unfortunately there are some realms of cancer that have not seen these substantial advancements, largely due to their rapid progression and the inability to specifically target therapy. The hypothesis that cancers arise from a small population of cells, called cancer stem cells (CSCs), is gaining more popularity amongst researchers. There are, however, still many skeptics who bring into question the validity of this theory. Many skeptics believe that there is not a specific subset of cells that originate with these characteristics, but that they develop certain features over time making them more resistant to conventional therapy. It is theorized that many of the relapses occurring after remission are due to our inability to destroy the self-renewing CSCs. This central idea, that CSCs are biologically different from all other cancer cells, has directed research towards the development of therapy to target CSCs directly. The major dilemma in targeting therapy in myeloproliferative disorders, malignancies of the central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> or malignancies <b>in</b> <b>general,</b> is the inability to target CSCs as opposed to normal stem cells. However, with the recent advances in the identifications of unique molecular signatures for CSCs along with ongoing clinical trials targeting CSCs, it is possible to use targeted nanotechnology-based strategies in the management of different types of cancers. </p...|$|R
