5000|$|Nandrolone is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a large}} group of AAS. Notable examples include the non-17α-alkylated trenbolone and the 17α-alkylated ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol) and metribolone (R-1881), as well as the 17α-alkylated designer steroids <b>norboletone</b> and tetrahydrogestrinone (THG).

50|$|Ethyltestosterone, or 17α-ethyltestosterone, {{also known}} as 17α-ethylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one or 17α-pregn-4-en-17-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) of the 17α-alkylated group related to {{methyltestosterone}} which was never marketed. Like methyltestosterone, ethyltestosterone is the parent compound of many AAS. Derivatives of ethyltestosterone include norethandrolone (ethylnandrolone, ethylestrenolone), ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), <b>norboletone,</b> ethyldienolone, tetrahydrogestrinone, bolenol (ethylnorandrostenol), and propetandrol.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Norboletone</b> {{was found}} to have been brought to the market by the chemist Patrick Arnold, of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), an American {{nutritional}} supplement company. It is reputed to have been the active ingredient in the original formulation of the [...] "undetectable" [...] steroid formulation known as [...] "The Clear" [...] before being replaced by the more potent drug tetrahydrogestrinone.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Don Catlin, {{the founder}} and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab, {{identified}} <b>norboletone</b> {{for the first time}} in an athlete’s urine sample. In the same year, U.S. bicycle racer Tammy Thomas was caught using it and was banned from her sport. The following year, Catlin identified and developed a test for tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), the second reported designer anabolic sample—a key development in the BALCO Affair.|$|E
50|$|<b>Norboletone</b> (INN) (former {{proposed}} {{brand name}} Genabol), or norbolethone, is an anabolic steroid {{that was never}} marketed. It was first developed in 1966 by Wyeth Laboratories, and tested for use as an agent to encourage weight gain and {{for the treatment of}} short stature, but was never marketed commercially because of fears that it might be toxic. It subsequently showed up in urine tests on athletes in competition in the early 2000s.|$|E
50|$|THG, {{also known}} as 17α-ethyl-18-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethyl-18-methylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). It is a modification of gestrinone (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone) in which the ethynyl group has been hydrogenated into an ethyl group, thereby converting the steroid from a norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with weak AR activity into a norethandrolone (17α-ethyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with powerful AR activity. THG {{is closely related to}} trenbolone (δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), metribolone (17α-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), and <b>norboletone</b> (17α-ethyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone).|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between ultrasonication and microwave irradiation as tools {{to achieve a}} rapid sample treatment {{for the analysis of}} banned doping substances in human urine by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed. The following variables were studied and optimised: (i) time of treatment, (ii) temperature, (iii) microwave power and (iv) ultrasonic amplitude. The results were evaluated and compared with those achieved by the routine method used in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited Antidoping Laboratory of Rome. Only under the effect of the ultrasonic field was it possible to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction rate of conjugated compounds. Similar reaction yield to the routine method was achieved after 10 min for most compounds. Under microwave irradiation, denaturation of the enzyme occurs for high microwave power. The use of both ultrasonic or microwave energy to improve the reaction rate of the derivatisation of the target compounds with trimethyliodosilane/methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (TMSI/MSTFA/NH 4 I/ 2 -mercaptoethanol) was also evaluated. To test the use of the two systems in the acceleration of the reaction with TMSI, a pool of 55 banned substances and/or their metabolites were used. After 3 min of ultrasonication, 34 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to those obtained with the classic procedure that lasts for 30 min (Student's∈t test, n∈=∈ 5), 18 increased to higher silylation yields, and for the compounds 13 β, 17 α-diethyl- 3 α, 17 β-dihydroxy- 5 α-gonane (<b>norboletone</b> metabolite 1), metoprolol and metipranolol the same results were obtained increasing the ultrasonication time to 5 min. Similar results were obtained after 3 min of microwave irradiation at 1, 200 W. In this case, 30 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to the classic procedure (Student's t test, n∈=∈ 5) whilst 18 had higher silylation yields. For the compounds 3 α-hydroxy- 1 α-methyl- 5 α-androstan- 17 -one (mesterolone metabolite 1), 17 α-ethyl- 5 β-estrane- 3 α, 17 β, 21 -triol (norethandrolone metabolite 1), epioxandrolone, 4 -chloro- 6 β, 17 β- dihydroxy- 17 α-methyl- 1, 4 -androstadien- 3 -one (chlormetandienone metabolite 1), carphedon, esmolol and bambuterol the same results were obtained after 5 min under microwave irradiation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
