The two principal crops used are kenaf and ramie. Kenaf {{is a member of}} the hibiscus family, a relative to cotton and okra; ramie, commonly known as China grass, {{is a member of the}} <b>nettle</b> <b>family</b> and one of the strongest natural fibres, with a density and absorbency comparable to flax. Toyota says this is a particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the United Nations' International Year of Natural Fibres, which spotlights kenaf and ramie among others.|$|E

40|$|The Moraceae {{family is}} one of the most {{abundant}} and ecologically important families in Neotropical rainforests and is very well-represented in Amazonian fossil pollen records. However, difficulty in differentiating palynologically between the genera within this family, or between the Moraceae and Urticaceae families, has limited the amount of palaeoecological information that can be extracted from these records. The aim of this paper is to analyse the morphological properties of pollen from Amazonian species of Moraceae in order to determine whether the pollen taxonomy of this family can be improved. Descriptive and morphometric methods are used to identify and differentiate key pollen types of the Moraceae (mulberry) and Urticaceae (<b>nettle)</b> <b>families</b> which are represented in Amazonian rainforest communities of Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP), Northeast Bolivia. We demonstrate that Helicostylis, Brosimum, Pseudolmedia, Sorocea and Pourouma pollen can be identified in tropical pollen assemblages and present digital images of, and a taxonomic key to, the Moraceae pollen types of NKMNP. Indicator species, Maquira coriacea (riparian evergreen forest) and Brosimum gaudichaudii (open woodland and upland savanna communities), also exhibit unique pollen morphologies. The ability to recognise these ecologically important taxa in pollen records provides the potential for much more detailed and reliable Neotropical palaeovegetation reconstructions than have hitherto been possible. In particular, this improved taxonomic resolution holds promise for resolving long-standing controversies over the interpretation of key Amazonian Quaternary pollen records...|$|R
