50|$|The {{landings}} {{were scheduled}} for 20 October, and at 06:00, Tennessee opened <b>neutralization</b> <b>fire</b> on the beaches. Tennessee continued her work off the beachhead until her fire support {{was no longer}} required and the increasing tempo of Japanese air activity in the area required her to place herself where her antiaircraft guns could assist {{in the defense of}} the assembled transports and cargo ships.|$|E
5000|$|Up to the {{amphibious assault}} on {{southern}} France, Nields was employed on North African-Italian escort missions {{in support of}} Allied ground forces pushing north from Salerno, conducting patrol and escort duty off Anzio and Civitaveccia, Italy. On 15 August, in Operation Dragoon she was off St. Raphael blocking E-boat entry into the transport area and providing preliminary bombardment and <b>neutralization</b> <b>fire</b> of [...] "Red Beach." [...] During that period, incident to her covering the passageways between the islands of St. Honorat and St. Marguerite, Nields came under heavy and rapid fire from German shore batteries. She returned fire and opened the range, emerging from the encounter unscathed. Through the 30th, she patrolled along the French coast, {{then turned back to}} North Africa whence she sailed for the U.S., in the screen of Battleship Division 5, on 4 September.|$|E
40|$|The aim is the {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the potentially toxic microelement behaviour at burning of the coal mixtures and galvanic production waste with development of the waste neutralization process flow diagram. The thermodynamical analysis of the potentially toxic microelement quantitative distribution process at burning of coal mixtures and galvanic production waste has been performed. It has been established that the ash-slag products for <b>fire</b> <b>neutralization</b> of the galvanic production waste are the ecologically safe products {{and can be used}} in the building material production process (concrete, cement a. o.)

5000|$|The German shore batteries, having {{discovered}} the Allied invaders, began firing on the armada at 0530. At 0536, the group commander made the signal [...] "Commence counter battery bombardment.", 14 minutes ahead of schedule. Hobson {{and the other}} ships began counter-firing as spent 5" [...] and 8" [...] shell casings littered their decks. Only the heavy ships had planes to spot for them. The destroyers were {{close enough to see}} their targets which consisted mostly of [...] "strong points" [...] just back of the beaches. Hobson, at station 1, was assigned firing on targets 70 and 72. At 0629, Hobson observed shell splashes near [...] and at 0633, Corry appeared to be hit amidships. As smoke from the intense shore firing drifted offshore and temporarily concealed Corry, Hobson shifted her fire at 0638 to target 86 which appeared to have been firing on Corry. This battery temporarily ceased firing as soon as taken under fire by Hobson. At 0644, the destroyer shifted her fire back to targets 70 and 72 since the leading boat wave was close to shore and <b>neutralization</b> of German <b>firing</b> from those areas was vital. At 0656, the smoke was extremely heavy on the beach, making it difficult to see the targets, and Hobson, per her prior firing orders, estimated that the first troops were going ashore and shifted fire to target 74, which was in an excellent position to deliver deadly enfilade and strafing fire on the Allied landing troops. At 0700, the smoke cover was clearing from Corry and the men on Hobson could see she was [...] "in definite trouble with her back broken between the stacks" [...] as targets 13A and 86 fired on the stricken destroyer. Corry, the worst naval loss of the D-Day landings, was hit by the Crisbecq Battery, whose three 210-millimeter (8.25-inch) guns had a range of 17-21 mi.|$|R
