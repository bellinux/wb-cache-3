5|$|After the battle, Julian was {{acclaimed}} as Augustus (co-emperor) by his troops, but he vehemently {{refused the}} title, which could only legally be bestowed {{by the ruling}} Augustus, Constantius. Given the latter's murderous attitude against potential contenders, Julian's caution is understandable, although it bought him <b>no</b> <b>credit</b> with Constantius.|$|E
5|$|Rob Van Dam (RVD) and Bill Alfonso {{interrupted}} the promo, with RVD stating {{it had nothing}} to do with SmackDown!. RVD claimed that WWE deserved <b>no</b> <b>credit,</b> that the interview was a shoot with no scripts, and that missing One Night Stand was worse than missing WrestleMania. The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with recommendations {{made by the}} California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much fulfill a set of essential skills before {{they are allowed to}} pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade on assigned essays or tests. In classes like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a <b>No</b> <b>Credit</b> (NC); the class must then be repeated to get a passing grade. This plan attempts to prepare students for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are expected to pass prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to students during their second year. The test covers grade 6–10 language arts concepts, as well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics.|$|E

5|$|Phrynichus, {{fearing that}} Alcibiades if {{restored}} would avenge himself upon {{him for his}} opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, {{to tell him that}} Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation {{of the rest of the}} intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at Magnesia and communicated to them Phrynichus's letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained <b>no</b> <b>credit,</b> because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{cardholder}} of a {{secured credit}} card is still {{expected to make}} regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering {{the cost of the}} purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit. The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or <b>no</b> <b>credit</b> history is that most companies report regularly to the major credit bureaus. This allows building a positive credit history.|$|E

The NPRM specifically states this, and this information may be found in its entirety in the December 1951 Issue of QST. While the New RTTY Handbook gives ARRL <b>no</b> <b>credit,</b> it was published by CQ Magazine and its author was a CQ columnist (CQ generally opposed ARRL at that time).|$|E

25|$|Secured {{credit cards}} are an option to allow {{a person with a}} poor credit history or <b>no</b> <b>credit</b> history to have a credit card which might not {{otherwise}} be available. They are often offered as a means of rebuilding one's credit. Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards. For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.|$|E
25|$|Although all {{the four}} credit {{information}} companies have developed their individual credit scores, {{the most popular}} is CIBIL credit score. The CIBIL credit score is a three-digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with <b>no</b> <b>credit</b> history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. CIBIL credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.|$|E
25|$|Its {{publication}} by Adolf Fraenkel in 1922 is {{what makes}} modern set theory Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). The axiom was independently discovered and announced by Thoralf Skolem later {{in the same year}} (and published in 1923). Zermelo himself incorporated Fraenkel's axiom in his revised system he published in 1930, which also included as a new axiom von Neumann's axiom of foundation. Although it is Skolem's first order version of the axiom list that we use today, he usually gets <b>no</b> <b>credit</b> since each individual axiom was developed earlier by either Zermelo or Fraenkel. The phrase “Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory” was first used in print by von Neumann in 1928.|$|E

25|$|Early {{production}} of The Lion King began in late 1988, {{with the film}} originally being titled King of the Kalahari and later King of the Jungle. The treatment, inspired by Hamlet, was written by Thomas M. Disch (author of The Brave Little Toaster) as work-for-hire; Disch received <b>no</b> <b>credit</b> or royalties. Production {{took place at the}} Walt Disney Animation Studios in Glendale, California. Also, nearly 20 minutes of the film were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios. Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to The Lion King over its lengthy production schedule. More than one million drawings were created for the film, including 1,197 hand-painted backgrounds and 119,058 individually colored frames of film.|$|E
25|$|After {{purchasing}} the card, the cardholder loads the account with {{any amount of}} money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases {{the same way as}} a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is <b>no</b> <b>credit</b> line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the court's Marquette Bank decision, {{which held}} {{that under the}} National Banking Act of 1863 states could not enforce their anti-usury laws against nationally-chartered banks based in other states, {{opened the door to}} {{increased}} credit card spending by Americans. Other forms of consumer credit, such as title and payday loans, became available for those who could not get even the most restrictive credit cards available. Social activists criticized the banks and companies that engaged in those practices, calling them predatory lenders who targeted the poor with promises of <b>no</b> <b>credit</b> check and easy money that only came at extremely high interest rates, profiting when the loans were extended long beyond the original short term.|$|E
