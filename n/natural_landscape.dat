5|$|Environmental concerns. In {{addition}} to concerns about {{air and water}} pollution, Norwegian architectural design has also emphasized integration with the <b>natural</b> <b>landscape.</b> More recently, architects have also worked with engineers {{to make the most}} out of scarce resources, e.g., energy, water, etc.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the beauty of its rugged, <b>natural</b> <b>landscape,</b> Ikata {{has long been known}} for fishing and mikan orange farming. In recent years Ikata has also become a hotspot of modern energy production—the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant until 2012 produced much of Shikoku's electricity, and the town's windy mountains are dotted by dozens of windmills.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of planned-change context on evaluations of <b>natural</b> <b>landscapes</b> was examined in an experimental setting. Five landscape photographs, depicting one agrarian <b>landscape</b> and four <b>natural</b> <b>landscapes</b> {{with varying degrees}} of human influence, were either presented as `five existing Dutch landscapes', or as `one existing landscape and four plans for nature development from this landscape'. Respondents were asked to evaluate the landscapes from one of three perspectives that matched their own background and interests, i. e. the perspective of a rural resident, the perspective of a cyclist, or a neutral perspective. As predicted, planned-change context negatively affected the perceived beauty of <b>natural</b> <b>landscapes,</b> particularly if landscapes were judged from a user perspective, and if <b>natural</b> <b>landscapes</b> had a low degree of human influence. Planned-change context did not affect relative preferences for <b>natural</b> <b>landscapes</b> in pairwise comparisons with the agrarian landscape. It is concluded that {{at least part of the}} beauty perceived in <b>natural</b> <b>landscapes</b> is derived from the knowledge that people bring into their aesthetic judgments...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake {{was one of those who}} met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a <b>natural</b> <b>landscape,</b> a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E
5|$|Some {{licences}} {{have not}} been renewed; for example, the RMC Aggregates quarry at Eldon Hill was forced to close in 1999, and landscaping is ongoing. The proposals dating from 1999 from Stancliffe Stone Ltd to re-open dormant gritstone quarries at Stanton Moor {{have been seen as}} a test case. They are hotly contested by ecological protesters and local residents on grounds that the development would threaten nearby Bronze Age remains, in particular the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, as well as the <b>natural</b> <b>landscape</b> locally. As of 2007, negotiations are ongoing to shift the development to the nearby Dale View quarry, a less sensitive area.|$|E
5|$|The Reich Forestry Office under Göring {{enforced}} {{regulations that}} required foresters {{to plant a}} wide variety of trees to ensure suitable habitat for wildlife and a new Reich Animal Protection Act became law in 1933. The regime enacted the Reich Nature Protection Act in 1935 to protect the <b>natural</b> <b>landscape</b> from excessive economic development and it allowed for the expropriation of privately owned land to create nature preserves and aided in long-range planning. Perfunctory efforts were made to curb air pollution, but little enforcement of existing legislation was undertaken once the war began.|$|E

5|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} {{considered as a}} recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities – the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the <b>natural</b> <b>landscape</b> increased the frequency of human–animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered {{an integral part of}} the ecosystem.|$|E

Art projects for the Chiayi Station will respond to the <b>natural</b> <b>landscape</b> or the high-tech images of the medical science park that will be constructed close by in the near future.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts {{on the summit}} plateau to assist walkers {{attempting}} the descent in foggy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions. Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the <b>natural</b> <b>landscape,</b> which create {{a false sense of}} security and could lessen mountaineers' sense of responsibility for their own safety. Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play. A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track.|$|E

5|$|People {{have lived}} in the Everglades region for {{thousands}} of years. Within the past 100years however, they have changed the <b>natural</b> <b>landscape</b> dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.|$|E
5|$|When Crèvecœur {{offered his}} {{manuscript}} essays to the London publishers Davies & Davis in 1782, they were initially {{skeptical about the}} potential for the Letters to be successful. However, the work proved to be instantly popular in England for a variety of reasons. Proponents of political reform such as William Godwin and Thomas Paine approved of the radical anti-government implications of its message. Romantic writers admired, and were influenced by, its evocation of the <b>natural</b> <b>landscape</b> and the individual's relationship to it. More widely, in the final years of the Revolutionary War, the public was eager for the documentary detail Letters provided about America. The popularity of the book led to a second edition being called for only a year later.|$|E
