It depends {{on the type of}} coal being burned, but on average the efficiency of generating electrical power in U.S. coal plants has stalled at 27 percent since 1995, meaning that 73 percent of coal is wasted at the generator—and the journey from the power plant down the wires to the wall socket in your living room has not even begun yet.|$|E
50|$|Shipment Miles. These include Food miles, and {{transportation}} miles {{that are used}} consistently in industrial processes. As illustrated the peer-to-peer exchange site, swapexchange, distance is {{a significant factor in}} not only the costs of a product, but also its non-renewable (and gradual renewable) energy depletion impact. The concept of shipment Miles shows that globalized trade should be minimized for daily purchases(i.e.: daily food), and reduced as much as possible for infrequent purchases(i.e.: Electronics). In the past, the limited recycling infrastructure and value of transportation energy resources has limited recycling circuits. Because recycling materials required new infrastructure as well as transportation resources, there was limited cycle development. There were also worries that materials would be downcycled. Non-renewable miles will become inherently unsustainable as <b>non-renewable</b> <b>fuel</b> sources diminishes and becomes increasing controversial as an environmentally destructive resource. The need for fuel efficient transportation methods has been recognized by the EPA and implemented through their SmartWay program.|$|E

The United States is the world's second largest producer of pork with pig production centered {{in the state of}} Iowa. Conventional confinement facilities are typical of pork industry practice in the United States and are characterized by individual gestation stalls and 1200 head grow-finish buildings with slatted concrete floors and liquid manure systems. The hoop barn-based alternative uses group pens in bedded hoop barns for gestation and finishing. Both systems use climate controlled farrowing facilities with individual farrowing crates as well as climate controlled nursery facilities. Feed is the single largest operating resource in pig production systems and feed fed to grow-finish pigs accounts for 63 - 65 % of total energy use in raising pigs. The other stages of production are more reliant on non-renewable fuels and ignoring these stages of production misses 54 - 80 % of the <b>non-renewable</b> <b>fuel</b> use associated with pig production. Taking into account demonstrated performance differences, hoop barn-based pig production requires 2. 4 % more feed and similar total energy as conventional pig production.

40|$|Concerns about {{national}} energy security {{and climate change}} have recently increased interest in renewable bioenergy. Specifically, the market for perennial grasses and agricultural residue for combustion for heat and electricity {{in the form of}} biomass pellets is explored. We present a cost-benefit analysis of consuming pellets for residential home heating, using previously published data, that is applied to the Midwestern U. S., in order to find out if biomass pellet fuel is competitive with <b>non-renewable</b> <b>fuel.</b> We then compare the costs to the actual production and consumption cost data from the Dudley Smith Farm production in Illinois and show the effects of current and potential policies. Using the data from Dudley Smith we investigate the current production cost in Illinois and compare it to estimated production costs in the literature. Finally, we present the results of a survey of current members and non-members of a biomass feedstock production cooperative in Missouri. We show that the policies in place do substantially lower the cost of biomass pellets, making them competitive with natural gas, under our assumptions. Without the policies, natural gas is substantially less expensive than biomass pellets. Biomass fuel would be competitive without the policies only to consumers without access to natural gas, i. e. rural consumers. Carbon pricing has the effect of increasing the cost of <b>non-renewable</b> <b>fuel</b> at a much higher rate than non-renewable fuels, making biomass fuel increasingly competitive. Sensitivity analysis shows that substantial increases in production costs or decreases in yield will have noteworthy effects on the annual home heating cost. Our survey results show that almost half of the consumers switched from propane to biomass pellets, which allows us to propose {{that they did not have}} access to cheaper fuels such as natural gas and wood. Thus, biomass pellets may be more competitive in rural markets where choice is limited...|$|E

In this paper, wind speed data, load data, and sizing of pumped hydro system at Ramea, Newfoundland are presented. The dynamic model of wind turbine, pumped hydro system, and diesel generator are included in this paper. The dynamic model is simulated in SIMULINK/MATLAB to determine the system voltage and frequency variation and also to visualize different power outputs. Sizing of pumped hydro system indicates that a 150 -kW pumped hydro storage system can be installed in Ramea to increase the renewable energy fraction to 37 % which will reduce <b>non-renewable</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption on this island.

This is linked to a growth of economic activity, especially in the tertiary sectors, which require more and more offices, and thus commuting.
