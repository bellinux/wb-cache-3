The referee blew the whistle for time four minutes early, with the score 9–1, and did not realise until the players had reached the dressing room and the crowd had all left. He took them out for the remaining four minutes, during which Small Heath scored a tenth goal. <b>No</b> <b>joy</b> was to be had in the FA Cup yet again.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{reviewing}} the New York production generally gave it poor reviews. [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times applauded the creative team's [...] "honorable intentions" [...] in bringing back a work {{thought to be}} [...] "terminally out-of-date", but felt both the new Mei-li and the show in general lacked personality. [...] Howard Kissel of the New York Daily News termed it [...] "an entertaining, albeit vulgar revival", and Clive Barnes of the New York Post found it no more memorable than the earlier version. [...] The review in Talkin' Broadway is scathing, criticizing Hwang's use of the songs and characters, and the orchestrations, and commenting: [...] "Hwang's book lacks much of the charm, warmth, and wit of the original, and never takes the high road where the low road will do. ... Hwang {{felt it necessary to}} reduce the original, uniquely colorful story into just another backstager with a love triangle and lame jokes." [...] Michael Kuchwara commented about Harvard in his lukewarm review for Associated Press: [...] "Then there's Linda Low's gay confidante, Harvard. [...] Talk about stereotypes. [...] If you are going to perpetuate one at least give him better jokes." [...] On the other hand, both USA Today and Time magazine gave it positive reviews. [...] The CurtainUp review was mostly positive and observed that Hwang and Longbottom [...] "were able to keep numbers like 'Chop Suey' and milk it for its razzle-dazzle fun while using its condescending stereotyping as a springboard to satirize attitudes towards Asians." [...] Brantley disagreed, writing, [...] "because the show's satiric point of view is so muddled, there's no verve in such numbers, <b>no</b> <b>joy</b> in the performing of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dutugemunu's {{victory at}} Anuradhapura {{put him in}} the {{unprecedented}} position of ruling nearly the entire island of (Sri) Lanka. Despite this however his position was far from problem-free. Elara, despite being an invading Tamil from the Chola empire of south India, was renowned as having been a just and righteous leader, and Dutugemunu {{went out of his way}} to ensure the memory of the old king was revered as he cremated Elara and built a tomb for his ashes and made rules for travelers to get off and pay their respects to his tomb. Furthermore, 'looking back upon his glorious victory, great though it was, [...] knew <b>no</b> <b>joy,</b> remembering that thereby was wrought the destruction of thousands of both enemies and his soldiers.' This is attested to by the sheer number of religious foundations attributed to him by the chronicles (between 68 and 99), which include magnificent stupas, monasteries, and shrines.|$|E
2500|$|Vasudeva Krishna's {{words to}} Princess Krishna (alias Draupadi, Panchali):- Those sons of yours, {{are devoted to}} the study of the science of arms, are well-behaved and conduct {{themselves}} on the pattern of their righteous friends.

[...] Safely proceeding to the land of the Anartas, they take the greatest delight in the study of the science of arms. Your sons enter the town of the Vrishnis (Dwaraka) and take an immediate liking to the people there. And as you would direct them to conduct themselves, or as the respected Kunti would do, so does Subhadra (their stepmother) direct them in a watchful way. Perhaps, she is still more careful of them. As Pradyumna is the preceptor of Aniruddha, of Abhimanyu, of Sunitha, and of Bhanu; so he is the preceptor and the refuge of your sons also! And a good preceptor, would unceasingly give them lessons in the wielding of maces and swords and bucklers, in missiles and in the arts of driving cars and of riding horses, being valiant. And he, Pradyumna, the son of Rukmini, having bestowed a very good training upon them, and having taught them the art of using various weapons in a proper way, takes satisfaction at the valorous deeds of your sons, and of Abhimanyu. O daughter of Drupada! And when your son goes out, in pursuit of (out-door) sports, each one of them is followed thither by cars and horses and vehicles and elephants.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Botham {{made his}} Test début at Trent Bridge on 28 July 1977 {{in the third}} Test against Australia. His début was {{somewhat}} overshadowed by the return from self-imposed Test exile of Geoffrey Boycott. England went into the match with a 1–0 series lead having won the second Test after the first had been drawn. The series was played {{against the background of}} the so-called [...] "Packer Affair" [...] which resulted in the establishment of World Series Cricket in the next Australian season. Because of Tony Greig's involvement, he had been stripped of the England captaincy but remained in the team under new captain Mike Brearley. England had three all-rounders at Trent Bridge with Greig, Geoff Miller and Botham all playing. Australian captain Greg Chappell won the toss and decided to bat first. Australia scored 243 and were all out shortly before the close on day one. Botham, aged 21, made an immediate impact and took five for 74, the highlight being the wicket of Chappell, bowled for just 19. England batted all through day two and into day three as Boycott, in his first Test innings since 1974, and Knott both made centuries. Botham came in at number eight on day three and scored 25 before he was bowled by Max Walker. England were all out not long afterwards for 364, a first innings lead of 121. Botham had <b>no</b> <b>joy</b> in Australia's second innings with none for 60. A century by Rick McCosker enabled Australia to score 309 before they were all out in the evening session on day four. Bob Willis took five for 88. England needed 189 to win and completed the job, by seven wickets, well into the final day with Brearley scoring 81 and Boycott, who batted on all five days, 80 not out. Botham didn't get a second innings.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Simeon bar Abba in {{the name}} of Rabbi Johanan taught that every time Scripture uses the {{expression}} “and it was” (vayechi), it intimates the coming of either trouble or joy. [...] If it intimates trouble, there is no trouble to compare with it, and if it itimatres joy, there is <b>no</b> <b>joy</b> to compare with it. [...] Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman made a distinction: [...] In every instance where Scripture employs “and it was” (vayechi), it introduces trouble, while when Scripture employs “and it shall be” (vehayah), it introduces joy. [...] The Sages raised an objection to Rabbi Samuel’s view, noting that to introduce the offerings of the princes, [...] says, “And he that presented his offering [...] [...] [...] was (vayechi),” and surely that was a positive thing. [...] Rabbi Samuel replied that the occasion of the princes’ gifts did not indicate joy, because it was manifest to God that the princes would join with Korah in his dispute (as reported in [...] ). [...] Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon said {{in the name}} of Rabbi Levi ben Parta that the case could be compared to that of a member of the palace who committed a theft in the bathhouse, and the attendant, while afraid of disclosing his name, nevertheless made him known by describing him as a certain young man dressed in white. [...] Similarly, although [...] does not explicitly mention the names of the princes who sided with Korah in his dispute, [...] nevertheless refers to them when it says, “They were princes of the congregation, the elect men of the assembly, men of renown,” and this recalls [...] “These were the elect of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers [...] [...] [...] ,” where the text lists their names.
