5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the <b>nasal</b> <b>septum,</b> which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E

However, the expressions of local RAS components in nor-mal chondrocytes {{have not been}} revealed yet. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the expression of the local RAS components in chondrocytes in vivo and the conditions allow-ing the expression. We stained five major regions of 8 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 adult mice in which chondrocytes exist, including epiphy-seal plates and hyaline cartilages, with anti-bodies to local RAS components. We also exam-ined the expression of local RAS components in the cultured bovine’s articular cartilage chondrocytes using quantitative reverse tran-scription polymerase chain reaction and west-ern blot analysis. In result, hypertrophic chon-drocytes of epiphyseal plates included in the tibia and the lamina terminals expressed local RAS components. However, hyaline chondro-cytes, including the knee articular cartilages, the parenchyma of <b>nasal</b> <b>septums</b> and of the tracheal walls, did not express local RAS com-ponents. Cultured bovine’s articular cartilage chondrocytes also did not express local RAS components. However, inducing hypertrophy by administering interleukin- 1 or tumor necrosis factor-, the cultured articular chon-drocytes also expressed angiotensin II type 1 receptor and angiotensin II type 2 receptor. In conclusion, local RAS components express par-ticularly in chondrocytes which occur hypertro-phy and do not in hyaline chondrocytes. The results are in accord with our previous in vitro study.

Furthermore, the nasal vein vascularisation of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal vascularisation.

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{particularly}} in China, many Chinese medicines and prescriptions for treating allergic rhinitis {{have been evaluated}} for their clinical relevance. Studies have found that numerous herbs and their constituent compounds can significantly alleviate allergic symptoms and are effective treatments for allergic rhinitis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the modulatory effect of Tong Qiao nose drops on allergy symptoms and the expression of cytokines in the nasal mucosa of rats with ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis. Methods: Sixty healthy male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (n =  20) : negative, control, and experimental. Rats in the control or experimental groups were sensitized with ovalbumin to induce allergic rhinitis. The sensitized rats in the experimental group were subsequently exposed to Tong Qiao nose drops, whereas the sensitized control rats were given saline nose drops. Negative control rats were only treated with saline. Allergic symptoms and the pathologic features of the nasal mucosa were observed. The expression of eotaxin in the mucous membrane of rat <b>nasal</b> <b>septums</b> was detected by immunohistochemical staining, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL) - 5 and IL- 13 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The symptom scores for the experimental group were significantly lower than those of control rats (p <  0. 01). Histopathologic examination revealed pathologic changes of nasal mucosa edema in the experimental group was mild and the infiltration of eosinophils was insubstantial.

40|$|Purpose: The aim in {{this study}} is to compare the {{functional}} results of open septorhinoplasty with and without osteotomies performed with the aim of increasing respiratory functions and healing the deformations in patients with traumatic nasal deformations. Material and Methods: In this prospective and clinical study, 26 patients with traumatic nasal deformation, who applied between 2007 and 2009 were analyzed. The physical examination, medical photographies, the findings of periorbital edema and ecchymosis and changes in respiratory behaviors before and after the operation were recorded. Evident irregularities of <b>nasal</b> dorsum, <b>septum</b> deviation and respiratory distress were identified in all of the patients. Open septorhinoplasty with osteotomy (13 patients and ndash; 50 %) and without osteotomy (13 patients and ndash; 50 %) were applied to a total of 26 patients. Osteotomy decision was given according to nasal dorsal width and nasal height. All the patients were controlled in the in the first, third, sixth and twelfth months of the postoperative period to analyze the results. The data gathered through these cases were compared with the literature. Results: Functional improvements were observed after open septorhinoplasty operations in all patients. When the post-operative results of the open septorhinoplasty operations with and without osteotomy are compared, it was observed that among the group of patients on which osteotomies were not practiced respiratory complaints improved better, stricture in the nasal passage was not caused, edema and ecchymosis in the postoperative period was lesser.

40|$|A respiratory, {{resonator}} and articulatory organ, nose is {{an important}} organ for human health. During inhalation and exhalation, nose makes the weather humid, warms it and enables the sound to become peculiar to the person, aerating the ears. Nose is an organ which provides speech {{and the production of}} sound. Nasal cavity aids the resonation and amplification of the primary sound that forms in cricoarytenoid muscles. Nasal voices are the sounds in which oral cavity is completely blocked,and the air is allowed to go out through nasal cavity. /m/,/n/ letters are in that group (Altundağ, 2008; 11). The complaint about nasal obstruction {{is one of the reasons}} for application with which the doctors of ear, nose and throat are faced often times. Sound is negatively influenced by the nasal obstruction resulting fromanatomical problems (Ö. Koç, 2008; 6). In such cases as the obstructions in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx or abnormal structural situations, the obstruction of sound transmission leadsto deficit in the oral and nasal resonation in the course of the transmission of sound through nasal cavity (Kummer and Lee, 1996; 272). Rhinolalia (nasal dysfunction and rhinophonia) is a speechof pathology arising out of the breakdown of nasal resonation. (Ö. Koç, 2008; 14 - 15). They can be seen in three forms. Hyper nasality (rhinolalia aperture) is the breakdown of resonation resulting from the velopharyngeal insufficiency. Freezing can be detected especially in famous voices notably in hyper nasality because these voices are uttered for a long time (Kummer and Lee, 1996; 272). Hypo nasality (rhinolalia cause) is called the insufficiency of nasal resonation. The nasal obstruction leading to such an abnormality results from such pathologies as upper respiratory infection, nasal structural deficits and nasal tumours (Enver and Akan, 1995; 122). Rhinolaryngitis is the case in which hyper and hypo nasality can be seen together. Velopharyngeal insufficiency and nasal pathologies and the blockage of a mass to denture in nasopharynx cause the mixed type. Resonation cannot be seen in nasal sounds (Aktaran: Çağlar, 2006; 8). Since nose is a resonator organ, the structural deficits in it such as symptom deviation, concha hypertrophy, nasal valve narrowness, symptom perforation, symptom hematoma and abscess, nasoseptitis deformity and choanal atresia all lead to nasal obstruction and respiratory defection and resonation breakdown. Symptom deviation forms as a result of the breakage of the nose from the centre to the right or left. Deviation continues to form generally based on trauma and congenital (Yılmaz, 2002; 55). The most significant symptom of deviation is nasal obstruction. Due to nasal obstruction and the air not warming, not dampening or not being cleared, respiratory illnesses such as angina, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis…etc. come in to existence. Sinus nasal cavities could become blocked owing to deviation and for that reason, sinusitis might develop. Concha hypertrophy which can be seen with chronic hypertrophic rhino sinusitis, allergic rhinitis or symptom deviation is one of the most important reasons for obstruction (Köybaşıand Yılmaz, 2005; 115). The symptoms of the disease can be seen with general nose stiffening, respiratory difficulty, and the necessity to inhale and exhale through mouth, sleep deficits accompanying snoring. (Fethallah, 2005; 20). Nasal valve region is the region where respiratory passage is the narrowest and nasal resonation is the highest. Nasal valve iscalled the distance between septum and upper lateral cartilage. Patients complain about the nasal obstruction. Other symptoms are helminthiasis and bleeding. Septum perforation is the case in which mucoperichondrium and cartilage get exposed to inflammation. Nasal dryness, nasal stiffening, frequent crusting, action of creating whistle during respiration can be seen in the patients. Perforation affects the air passage in the <b>nasal</b> resonation. <b>Septum</b> hematom arises as a consequence of the bleeding in-between trauma and septum plates. If septum hematom is not treated, it will turn into abscess with infection. The symptomsof <b>septum</b> hematom are <b>nasal</b> stiffening, flix, nose ache and nasal weakness. Patients feel nasal swelling, headache and edema when abscess happens (Somdaş, 2005). Bilateral pleural involvement, which is most often seen in congenital nasal abnormality, can be encountered once in every 8000 living births. During the early period of development, noseis separated from pharynx with biconasal membrane. When this membrane does not disappear, it will cover posterior coanal bleeding. In the structural deficits of nose, acoustical Rhinometryis use in order to determine nasal cavity volume. As a result ofacoustical Rhinometry measurements, minimal cutting areas and selected point volume can be measured in that way. The parameters such as acoustical sound frequency, vibration and periodicity are analysed. 40 first class students who read Selcuk University education faculty fine arts music major branch have been included in the study. So as to obtain data from all the students, they were asked to fill in personal information form and nasal obstruction scala. Acoustical Rhinometry together with phonatory skills measurements were applied on these studentsby the interested experts. Descriptive statistical methods (average, standard deviation) and Mann-Whitney U test were used for the evaluation of these data. 40 first class students who read Selcuk University education faculty fine arts music major branch have been included in the study. In this study, it is aimed that the sound education can be modified in the faculty of music over the sentence “How are the sound features of the people with nasal structure deficits?” As a result of examination in ear, nose and throat major branches at the faculty of medicine at Selcuk University, septum deviation was detected in 12 students, concha hypertrophy 6 students, septum deviation and concha hypertrophy 7 students. Besides, 15 students were detected to be free of nasal defection. Because the students of BYBB have low points at NOSE, the diseases like septum deviation and conca hypertrophy narrow the nasal cavity volume, influencing phonatory talents negatively. It has been identified that the acoustic properties of the sound frequencies of the fundamental frequency F 0 and formant F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4, F 5 values did not differ significantly among the students of BYBS BYBB. When the arithmetic average related to the formant frequencies of the acoustical features of sound has beenanalysed in the students participating in the study, it is determined that (F 3) formant is for the singer. At the courses giving a professional music education, voice education methods should be developed, based on the anatomical features of the organs working in constitution of voice and the structural breakdowns in such organs with their effects. Ear nose throat doctors should maintain the studies with audiologists on the basis of the thought that voice education is disciplinary. Professional voice users must learn how to sustain their voice health and take precautions against illnesses, giving importanceto hygiene. It is thought that this study will be much more convenient for a larger group in terms of statistics...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Freer, in 1902, and Killian, in 1904, {{respectively}} pioneered the Submucous Resection septoplasty (SMR) procedure for correcting a deviated septum; they raised mucoperichondrial tissue flaps, and resected the cartilaginous and bony septum (including the vomer bone and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), maintaining septal support with a 1.0-cm margin at the dorsum and a 1.0-cm margin at the caudad, for which innovations the technique became the foundational, standard septoplastic procedure. In 1921, A. Rethi introduced the open rhinoplasty approach featuring an incision to the columella to facilitate modifying {{the tip of}} the nose. In 1929, Peer and Metzenbaum performed the first manipulation of the caudal septum, where it originates and projects from the forehead. In 1947, Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981) endonasally resolved a septal deviation with a minimalist hemitransfixion incision, which conserved the septum; thus, he advocated for the practical primacy of the closed rhinoplasty approach. In 1957, A. Sercer advocated the “decortication of the nose” (Dekortication des Nase) technique which featured a columellar-incision open rhinoplasty that allowed greater access to the nasal cavity and to the <b>nasal</b> <b>septum.</b>|$|E
