40|$|Stratospheric airship is {{a special}} near-space air vehicle, and has more {{advantages}} than other air vehicles, such as long endurance, strong survival ability, excellent resolution, low cost, and so on, which make it an ideal stratospheric platform. It is of great significance to choose a reasonable and effective way to launch a stratospheric airship to the space for both academic research and engineering applications. In this paper, the <b>non-forming</b> launch way is studied and the method of differential pressure gradient is used to study the change rules of the airship’s envelope shape during the ascent process. Numerical simulation {{results show that the}} head of the envelope will maintain the inflatable shape and the envelope under the zero-pressure level will be compressed into a wide range of wrinkles during the ascent process. The airship’s envelope will expand with the ascent of the airship and the position of the zero-pressure level will move downward constantly. At the same time, the envelope will gradually form a certain degree of stiffness under the action of the inner and external differential pressure. The experimental results agree well with the analytical results, which shows that the <b>non-forming</b> launch way is effective and reliable, and the analytical method has exactness and feasibility...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} the biofilm-forming related factors against MRSA bloodstream isolates and evaluates their clinical features and treatment outcomes by biofilm production. MethodsWe collected 126 consecutive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causing blood stream infections (BSIs) at 10 tertiary hospitals from 2007 to 2009. We investigated biofilm-forming ability using a microtiter plate assay, and molecular characteristics including multilocus sequence typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec and accessory gene regulator types. We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients infected with biofilm-forming and non-biofilm-forming MRSA isolates. ResultsOf the 126 samples, 86 (68. 3 %), including 5 strong level (OD 570 ≥ 1. 0) and 81 weak level (0. 2 ≤ OD 570 0. 05). ConclusionBiofilm-forming MRSA strains showed higher frequency of fnbB gene than biofilm <b>non-forming</b> ones and more incidence rates on particular genotypes. And, their patient's features {{were not significantly}} different between two groups in this study, except for several clinical factors...|$|E
40|$|Microgravity induces {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{growth in}} numerous cell types. Despite substantial efforts {{to clarify the}} underlying mechanisms for spheroid formation, the precise molecular pathways are still not known. The principal aim {{of this paper is}} to compare static 1 g-control cells with spheroid forming (MCS) and spheroid <b>non-forming</b> (AD) thyroid cancer cells cultured in the same flask under simulated microgravity conditions. We investigated the morphology and gene expression patterns in human follicular thyroid cancer cells (UCLA RO 82 -W- 1 cell line) after a 24 h-exposure on the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) and focused on 3 D growth signaling processes. After 24 h, spheroid formation was observed in RPM-cultures together with alterations in the F-actin cytoskeleton. qPCR indicated more changes in gene expression in MCS than in AD cells. Of the 24 genes analyzed VEGFA, VEGFD, MSN, and MMP 3 were upregulated in MCS compared to 1 g-controls, whereas ACTB, ACTA 2, KRT 8, TUBB, EZR, RDX, PRKCA, CAV 1, MMP 9, PAI 1, CTGF, MCP 1 were downregulated. A pathway analysis revealed that the upregulated genes code for proteins, which promote 3 D growth (angiogenesis) and prevent excessive accumulation of extracellular proteins, while genes coding for structural proteins are downregulated. Pathways regulating the strength/rigidity of cytoskeletal proteins, the amount of extracellular proteins, and 3 D growth may be involved in MCS formation...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{continental}} Carboniferous sequences crop out sparsely in {{the western}} Southern Alps (Alpe Logone, Mesenzana, Grantola, Bosco Valtravaglia-Fabiasco,Val Tresa, etc.) and are currently {{the subject of a}} detailed litho- and biostratigraphic revision, to reconsider their chronological position with respect to previously published age constraints. The age of these Upper Palaeozoic sedimentary successions, scattered over a wide area and strongly tectonized along major structural lineaments, has long been debated between Westphalian and Stephanian. The present work focuses mainly on the palynology of the Brezzo di Bèdero section (Luino, Lake Maggiore). The recovered palynoflora is assigned to 42 spore genera and 76 species of which one genus and 10 species are newly proposed. Fifty-seven spore species and 19 pollen species are described and illustrated. Qualitatively, the Bèdero palynoflora shows strong affinities to those ofWestern Europe. The most abundant palynomorphs are trilete spores known to be characteristics of the late Westphalian and early Stephanian assemblages. These are characterized by the remarkable presence of Florinites and subordinately Wilsonites species, low numbers of Potonieisporites, rare Limitisporites and Vesicaspora, and very rare Latensina-Cordaitina pollen. The occurrence of diverse monolete spores Laevigatosporites, Punctatosporites, Spinosporites, Thymospora and Torispora, with common Lundbladispora gigantea, L. simonii, Stenozonotriletes rubius n. sp. together with the absence of plicate and taeniate pollen grains suggests a strong resemblance to the late Westphalian–early Stephanian interval assigned to the OT Zone of Western Europe. Variations in the quantitative composition can be likely attributed to variations in the environmental setting with regards to <b>non-forming</b> peat deposits. The palynological suite is indicative of the existence of a well-established lowland Cordaiteans vegetation and well settled pterophytic, pteridosperm and subordinately sphenophytic and lycophytic, hygrophytic plant communities...|$|E
40|$|The biofilm {{life style}} helps {{bacteria}} resist oxidative stress, desiccation, antibiotic treatment, and starvation. Biofilm formation involves a complex regulatory gene network controlled by various environmental signals. It was previously shown that prophage insertions in mlrA and heterogeneous mutations in rpoS constituted major obstacles limiting biofilm formation and {{the expression of}} extracellular curli fibers in strains of Escherichia coli serotype O 157 :H 7. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test strains from other important serotypes of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) (O 26, O 45, O 103, O 111, O 113, O 121, and O 145) for similar regulatory restrictions. In a small but diverse collection of biofilm-forming and <b>non-forming</b> strains, mlrA prophage insertions were identified in only 4 of the 19 strains (serotypes O 103, O 113, and O 145). Only the STEC O 103 and O 113 strains could be complemented by a trans-copy of mlrA to restore curli production and Congo red (CR) dye affinity. RpoS mutations were found in 5 strains (4 serotypes), each with low CR affinity, and the defects were moderately restored by a wild-type copy of rpoS in 2 of the 3 strains attempted. Fourteen strains in this study showed no or weak biofilm formation, of which 9 could be explained by prophage insertions or rpoS mutations. However, each of the remaining five biofilm-deficient strains, as well as the two O 145 strains that could not be complemented by mlrA, showed complete or nearly complete lack of motility. This study indicates that mlrA prophage insertions and rpoS mutations do limit biofilm and curli expression i...|$|E
40|$|Collecting {{samples of}} Acinetobacter baumannii taken from {{different}} clinical cases of wounds, septicemia, and urinary tract infections. That {{was accomplished by}} taking (296) samples from Baghdad educational hospital and Ibn-al-Baladi hospital. Samples were cultured on solid media (McConkey and blood agars), and according to microscopical, cultural, and biochemical identification, in addition to using API 20 -E system, (21) isolates of A. baumannii were identified and in percentage of 47. 619, 9. 523, 14. 285, and 28. 571 for wound, blood, sputum, and urine samples, respectively. Methods: detection of fimbriated bacterial isolates among 21 isolates, and all those isolated were fimbriae forming isolates; isolate number (9) was selected as an effective isolate in formation of fimbriae. <b>Non-forming</b> fimbriae isolate of Shigella flexneri is used as negative control. Results and Conclusion: the average of adherence of fimbriated bacterial cell with human epithelial cells was reached (50) adherent bacterial cell per epithelial cell compared with the average of adherence of control isolate (12) adherent bacterial cell per epithelial cell, the inhibition processes are performed: Inhibition of bacterial adherence by specific antibodies of fimbriae antigen showed inhibition effect of adherence in respect to fimbriated isolate A. baumannii 9 also the subminimum inhibitory concentration for four antibiotics (Gentamicin, Tobramycin, Cefepime, and Amikacin) inhibit the adherence of fimbriated isolate. The isolates (used in the study) {{have the ability to}} agglutinate Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human red blood corpuscles (RBCs). The study of effect of different fimbriae extract concentrations (25, 50, 100 μg/ml) on immune cells; consequently, reached to the following results: Concentrations of (25, 50, 100) μg/ml showed a negative effect on lymphocyte and PMNs viability which increased significantly (P≤ 0. 05) with increasing of fimbriae extract concentration. On the other hand, concentrations of (25, 50) μg/ml of fimbriae extract caused a significant increase (P≤ 0. 05) noticed in the average of T-cells forming the active T-Rosette (41. 3, 54. 3) % and the total (62, 81) % compared with control which reached (28. 3, 40. 6) % respectively. The present study results revealed an increase in phagocytosis of killed yeast cells by phagocytes. To our knowledge this is the first preliminary report in Iraq showed the role of fimbriated A. baumannii in adherence on epithelial cell and inhibition of this adhesion by specific antibody, also this report investigated the role of fimbrial antigen on some immune cell...|$|E
