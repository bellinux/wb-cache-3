40|$|The {{theory of}} {{compensating}} <b>differentials</b> asserts that <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> workers should receive compensating wage differentials due to undesirable work conditions. In weak local economies, workers {{may have difficulty}} finding jobs; thus, these workers might {{be more likely to}} accept <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work and be less concerned with the size of the compensating <b>differential</b> for <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> Using CPS data from 2001, this paper employs maximum likelihood estimation of an endogenous switching regression model to analyze wages of day and <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> workers and shift choice. The findings indicate the presence of selection bias, thus emphasizing the importance of correcting for self-selection into <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> The average of the estimated wage <b>differentials</b> for <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work is negative for the overall sample, with differentials varying by worker characteristics. The <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> is found to be a statistically significant predictor of shift choice, indicating that shift premiums {{play an important role in}} motivating individuals to select <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work. Using two measures of local economic conditions and a new method of analyzing interaction effects in the context of an endogenous switching regression model, this paper finds limited evidence that weak local economic conditions lessen the impact of compensating <b>differentials</b> on <b>shift</b> choice...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 48) <b>Shift</b> <b>differentials</b> are {{a form of}} bonus typically paid {{to employees}} who work "premium" shifts such as evenings (3 PM- 11 PM) and nights (11 PM- 7 AM). This practice was introduced in hospitals when individual organizations began to {{find it difficult to}} recruit and place prospective employees for night and evening coverage, and now payment of <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> is commonplace in hospitals in the San Fernando Valley. An inflationary economy, rapid changes in technology, spiraling costs, and shortages in many allied health resources, have forced many hospitals to compete for declining employee resources by providing more attractive benefits, employment bonuses, and even larger <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> for employees working <b>night</b> and evening <b>shifts</b> in an attempt to attract and retain qualified personnel. Consequently, increased demand for allied health professionals has led to a gradual escalation of salary and incentive programs directed at employee recruitment and placement. Concern over the increasing use of <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> and bonuses inspired one local hospital to more closely review the uses and effects of <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> in an attempt to gain greater insight into the need for <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> and the effectiveness of dollar oriented bonuses in the placement and retention of night duty personnel. A study was implemented to survey prevailing administrative attitudes in area hospitals relative to the need for <b>shift</b> <b>differentials,</b> and a second survey of registered nurses in a local hospital was conducted to identify the effect <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> have on the recruitment, placement and longevity of night nursing personnel. Study results, although not conclusive, seem to indicate that payment of <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> is necessary due to the reduced supply of and increasing demand for qualified personnel in the labor market, as well as increased inter-institutional competition for available resources. This was observed even though night nurses ranked dollar oriented incentives secondary to job oriented motivators in the selection of night duty. Based on preliminary study, it was concluded that hospitals should not discontinue use of <b>shift</b> <b>differentials,</b> but should explore alternative incentives that will improve the quality of the job...|$|R

We have investigated the effect of chronotype and social demographics on sleepiness, fatigue, and <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> on the performance of nurses. This was a prospective observational cohort study which assessed the performance of 96 ICU <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> nurses during the day and <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> in a mixed medical-surgical ICU in the Netherlands. We determined chronotype and assessed sleeping behaviour for each nurse prior to starting shift work and before free days. The level of sleepiness and fatigue of nurses during the day and <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> was determined, as was the effect of these conditions on psychomotor vigilance and mathematical problem-solving. The majority of ICU nurses had a preference for early activity (morning chronotype).

40|$|Objectives: <b>Night</b> <b>shift</b> {{work has}} been linked to some chronic diseases. Modification of {{lifestyle}} by night work may partially {{contribute to the development of}} these diseases, nevertheless, so far epidemiological evidence is limited. The aim of the study was to explore association between <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work and lifestyle factors using data from a cross-sectional study among blue-collar workers employed in industrial plants in Łódź, Poland. Material and Methods: The anonymous questionnaire was self-administered among 605 employees (236 women and 369 men, aged 35 or more) - 434 individuals currently wor­king <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> Distribution of the selected lifestyle related factors such as smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), number of main meals and the hour of the last meal was compared between current, former, and never <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> workers. Adjusted ORs or predicted means were calculated, as a measure of the associations between <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work and lifestyle factors, with age, marital status and education included in the models as covariates. Results: Recreational inactivity (defined here as less than one hour per week of recreational physical activity) was associated with current <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work when compared to never <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> workers (OR = 2. 43, 95 % CI: 1. 13 - 5. 22) among men. Alcohol abstinence and later time of the last meal was associated with <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work among women. Statistically significant positive relationship between <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work duration and BMI was observed among men (p = 0. 029). Conclusions: This study confirms previous studies reporting lower exercising among <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> workers and tendency to increase body weight.

Methods The 2008 American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) Longitudinal Study of Emergency Physicians (LSEP) was administered by mail to 1003 ABEM diplomates. Results Among 819 participants in the 2008 LSEP Physician Survey, most participants responded that <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> work negatively influenced job satisfaction with a moderate or major negative influence (58 %; n = 467 / 800). Forty-three percent of participants indicated that <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> had caused them to think about leaving EM (n = 344 / 809).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Night</b> <b>shift</b> {{work is a}} well {{established}} risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction represents an early stage {{in the development of}} atherosclerosis. We investigated whether medical residents and fellows have reduced endothelial function immediately after two consecutive <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> and whether this dysfunction is prolonged. Method We evaluated endothelial function in 12 doctors at three different timings, after two consecutive <b>night</b> <b>shifts,</b> 3 - 5 days after the last <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> and on a regular work day with no <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> the previous 7 days. To assess the endothelial function we assessed the degree of reactive hyperemia by peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT). RH-PAT is a non-invasive method which measures the reactive hyperemia response in a finger after 5 minutes of forearm ischemia. The research subjects also filled out a questionnaire regarding other factors which might affect their endothelial function. Results The median RH-PAT ratio at baseline (PAT 1) was 2. 08 (25 -percentile 1. 60, 75 -percentile 2. 98), the morning after two consecutive <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> (PAT 2) 1. 64 (1. 39, 2. 19), and 3 - 5 days later (PAT 3) 1. 77 (1. 60, 2. 71). The PAT 2 was significantly reduced compared to the baseline ratio (p= 0. 041). There {{was no significant difference between}} PAT 2 and PAT 3 or between PAT 1 and PAT 3. However, the PAT 3 values appeared to be intermediate between values at baseline and immediately following the <b>night</b> <b>shift.</b> Weight and systolic blood pressure were inversely correlated to PAT 2 (r=- 0, 606 and r=- 0, 621). There was no significant correlation between PAT 2 and other variables. Conclusion Endothelial function as measured by RH-PAT is significantly reduced immediately after two consecutive <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> Although not significant, the RH-PAT ratio 3 - 5 days after the <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> tended to be lower than values at baseline.
