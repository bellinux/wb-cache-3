5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|C. diaphanus is {{the only}} species of fairy shrimp to occur <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> Great Britain; Tanymastix stagnalis is found in western Ireland, and Artemia salina {{formerly}} occurred in England. Within Great Britain, C. diaphanus is restricted to areas with a deficit of precipitation against evapotranspiration between April and September. This means {{that it is only}} found frequently in southern England, with scattered records as far north as Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Fructose, {{or fruit}} sugar, occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> fruits, some root vegetables, cane sugar and honey {{and is the}} sweetest of the sugars. It {{is one of the}} {{components}} of sucrose or table sugar. It is used as a high-fructose syrup, which is manufactured from hydrolyzed corn starch that has been processed to yield corn syrup, with enzymes then added to convert part of the glucose into fructose.|$|E

5|$|Glucose, {{dextrose}} or grape sugar, occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> {{fruits and}} plant juices {{and is the}} primary product of photosynthesis. Most ingested carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion {{and it is the}} form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream. It can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids. Glucose syrup is a liquid form of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|HIV can infect {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, {{but another}} route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN {{can also be}} used. DCs {{are one of the}} first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought {{to play an important role}} by transmitting HIV to T-cells when the virus is captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.|$|E
5|$|Heating {{oil shale}} to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis {{to yield a}} vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil—an unconventional oil—is separated from combustible oil-shale gas (the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> shales). Oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.|$|E

5|$|Osmium {{is found}} in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys; {{especially}} the iridium–osmium alloys, osmiridium (osmium rich), and iridosmium (iridium rich). In nickel and copper deposits, the platinum group metals occur as sulfides (i.e., (Pt,Pd)S)), tellurides (e.g., PtBiTe), antimonides (e.g., PdSb), and arsenides (e.g., PtAs2); in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by {{a small amount of}} iridium and osmium. As with all of the platinum group metals, osmium can be found <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> alloys with nickel or copper.|$|E
5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> humans.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|Selenium occurs <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> {{a number}} of {{inorganic}} forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of}} the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E

5|$|The alkali metals, due {{to their}} high reactivity, do not occur <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> pure form in nature. They are lithophiles and {{therefore}} remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements {{due to their}} large ionic radii.|$|E
5|$|The {{carotenoids}} are pigmented molecules found <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> plants, {{and some}} types of fungi, including S.scutellata. A 1965 study reported the carotenoid composition of this fungus, found to contain {{a high proportion of}} monocyclic carotenes—carotenes with only one cyclohexene ring, such as beta-carotene. Also present were minor amounts of xanthophyll, a molecule structurally related to the carotenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has {{not occurred}} <b>naturally</b> <b>in</b> the wild for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert. The domesticated dromedary is generally {{found in the}} semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden.|$|E
