40|$|Energy in {{stars is}} {{provided}} by nuclear reactions, which, in many cases, produce radioactive nuclei. When stable nuclei are irradiated by a flux of protons or <b>neutrons,</b> <b>capture</b> reactions push stable matter out of stability into the regime of unstable species. The ongoing production of radioactive nuclei in the deep interior of the Sun via proton-capture reactions is recorded by neutrinos emitted during radioactive decay and detected on Earth. Radioactive nuclei that have relatively long half lives may also be detected in stars via spectroscopic observations and in stardust recovered from primitive meteorites via laboratory analysis. The vast majority of these stardust grains originated from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. This is the final phase {{in the evolution of}} stars initially less massive than ~ 10 solar masses, during which nuclear energy is produced by alternate hydrogen and helium burning in shells above the core. The long-lived radioactive nucleus 26 Al is produced in massive AGB stars (> 4 : 5 solar masses), where the base of the convective envelope reaches high temperatures. Several other long-lived radioactive nuclei, including 60 Fe, 87 Rb, and 99 Tc, are produced in AGB stars when matter is exposed to a significant neutron flux leading to the synthesis of elements heavier than iron. Here, <b>neutron</b> <b>captures</b> occur on a timescale that is typically slower than beta-decay timescales, resulting slow <b>neutron</b> <b>captures</b> (the s-process). However, when radioactive nuclei with half lives greater than a few days are produced they may either decay or <b>capture</b> a <b>neutron,</b> thus branching up the path of <b>neutron</b> <b>captures</b> and defining the final s-process abundance distribution. This nucleosynthesis in AGB stars could produce some long-living radioactive nuclei in relative abundances that resemble those observed in the early solar system. Comment: 82 page...|$|R

50|$|The s-process {{contrasts}} with the r-process, in which successive <b>neutron</b> <b>captures</b> are rapid: they happen more quickly than the beta decay can occur.

5|$|Along {{with all}} {{elements}} having atomic weights {{higher than that}} of iron, it is only naturally formed in supernovae. Primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r-process (rapid <b>neutron</b> <b>capture),</b> because the s-process (slow <b>neutron</b> <b>capture)</b> is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth. Besides the two extant primordial uranium isotopes, 235U and 238U, the r-process also produced significant quantities of 236U, which has a shorter half-life and has long since decayed completely to 232Th, which was itself enriched by the decay of 244Pu, accounting for the observed higher-than-expected abundance of thorium and lower-than-expected abundance of uranium. While the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct 242Pu (half-life 0.375millionyears) and 247Cm (half-life 16millionyears), producing 238U and 235U respectively, this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half-lives of these parents and their lower production than 236U and 244Pu, the parents of thorium: the 247Cm:235U ratio at the formation of the Solar System was (7.0 ± 1.6) × 10−5.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a <b>neutron</b> <b>capture</b> cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a <b>neutron</b> <b>capture</b> cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is created}} by the {{long-lasting}} (up to thousands of years) s-process (slow <b>neutron</b> <b>capture)</b> in low-to-medium-mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 solar masses). When a silver-109 atom (the isotope that comprises approximately half of all silver in existence) catches a neutron, it undergoes a beta decay to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 by another beta decay. This explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one. The stable indium isotope, indium-113, {{is one of the}} p-nuclei, the origin of which is not fully understood; although indium-113 is known to be made directly in the s- and r-processes (rapid <b>neutron</b> <b>capture),</b> and also as the daughter of very long-lived cadmium-113, which has a half-life of about eight quadrillion years, this cannot account for all indium-113.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} complementary {{measurements of}} the neutrino oscillation parameter sin² 2 θ₁₃ made by observing the electron antineutrino flux from two nuclear reactors in Chooz, France. Antineutrinos are identified through both products of the inverse beta decay interaction, bar νₑ + p → e⁺ + n, in a high-precision liquid scintillator detector located approximately 1 km from the reactors. The most sensitive signal channel involves <b>neutron</b> <b>captures</b> by a gadolinium dopant, while a search for <b>neutron</b> <b>captures</b> on hydrogen provides a high-statistics validation. In both channels, the value of sin² 2 θ₁₃ is revealed by an energy- and reactor power-dependent deficit of antineutrino-like events, compared to a reactor simulation. All analyses produce results consistent {{with one another and}} with findings of other experiments. These datasets also expose features of the antineutrino spectrum not predicted in reactor flux models.

All other lanthanum isotopes are synthetic: with the exception of 137La with a half-life of about 60,000years, all of them have half-lives less than a day, and most have half-lives less than a minute.
