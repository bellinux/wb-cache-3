40|$|Hailstone {{impact is}} an actual threat for the {{integrity}} of aircraft structures such as leading edges, and forward sections. Though the analysis of weather conditions reduces the occurrence of intersections between flight routes andhailstorm regions, sometimes the passage through a hailstorm becomes inevitable and, in such a case, it is mandatory that the aircraft structures show an appropriate level of tolerance to damages caused by a hail impact. Therefore, as experimental tests are both expensive and troublesome, {{it is important to}} develop numerical models, which eventually support the design of high-efficient and hailproof structures. Accordingly, in the present research, using LSTC LS-Dyna, three numerical models of hailstone have been developed: finite element, arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics model. Initially, these three models had been validated referring to a documented experimental test and, subsequently, used to reproduce the impact of a hailstone with the nose-lip of a <b>nacelle</b> <b>intake.</b> Advantages and disadvantages of the three hail models have been evaluated and it has been concluded that the smoothed particle hydrodynamics model is the most efficient and effective for the analysis of the event...|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This {{was overcome by}} reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath the engine to the sides. The resulting flattened <b>nacelle</b> bottom and <b>intake</b> lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing737 with CFM56 engines.|$|R
40|$|Hail {{impact is}} an actual threat for {{aircraft}} {{structures such as}} the forward sections of the fuselage, the engine nacelles, and the leading edges of wings and tail planes. When flying through a hailstorms region cannot be avoided, these aircraft parts are called to maintain {{a certain level of}} functionality even after being impacted by a number of hailstones. In particular, with regard to <b>nacelle</b> <b>intake,</b> these parts have to be such to avoid hailstone penetrations, which could cause a failure of the control-system of the engine usually placed in {{the lower part of the}} intake airframe and then the loss of the engine. For these reasons, and also considering the difficulty in performing specific experimental tests, it is important to develop numerical models, which eventually might represent a tool to develop high-efficient and hail-proof structures. In particular, using LSTC LS-Dyna, an explicit Finite Element code, a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model of the hailstone has been developed. Initially, this model was validated referring to a laboratory test and, then, referring to the (documented) damages of an airlines aircraft. Subsequently, using the numerical model of an intake in a preliminary design phase, the impact with penetration of a single hailstone and subsequently the simultaneous impact of a number of hailstones were investigated. As a result, the numerical model developed has showed to be feasible and reliable for the analysis of the event investigated...|$|R
25|$|Work {{began on}} the Model 219 in 1944, as a {{replacement}} for the PB4Y Privateer long-range patrol bomber, optimised for long range minelaying missions, with the first flight being on 20 October 1946. A large and complicated aircraft, it was powered by two Pratt & Whitney R4360 Wasp Major 28-cylinder radial engines. To give a boost during takeoff and combat, two Allison J33 turbojets were fitted {{in the rear of the}} two enlarged engine <b>nacelles,</b> the <b>intakes</b> being beneath and behind the radial engines. The jets, like those on most other piston/jet hybrids, burned gasoline instead of jet fuel which eliminated the need for separate fuel tanks.|$|R
40|$|To reduce fuel {{consumption}} {{as well as}} noise and CO 2 emissions, the overall trend in civil aviation is to decrease exhaust velocities associated with an increase of the fan diameter, implying more weight and more drag because of the larger nacelle size. To compensate for the introduced weight increase, the concept of nacelles with short inlet, for which {{the interaction between the}} nacelle and the fan is higher than for current engines, is often considered. This paper proposes to design a short inlet geometry with a length over diameter ratio of l/D� 0. 35 that provides better or equal aerodynamic performances, predominantly for the fan, than conventional long inlet configurations with typical ratios of l/D� 0. 65. To obtain such a design, an optimization process with a flow field covering the entire fan, <b>intake</b> and <b>nacelle</b> system is used. The first step is to define the parameterization of the nacelle which finally contains the <b>nacelle</b> and the <b>intake</b> contour as basics parameters. The next step is to establish a robust and automatic meshing procedure of the entire calculation domain (far field, <b>nacelle,</b> <b>intake</b> and fan), which guarantees a high mesh quality independent of the parameter selected. AutoOpti, which is an optimization tool developed at DLR, is applied, providing an optimization framework based on an evolutionary algorithm with heavy surrogate model enhancements. For the calculations, which are realized with the DLR in-house solver TRACE, three operating conditions are considered: static take-off (OP 1), take-off (OP 2) and cruise (OP 3). The classification of the results is based on the assessment of the fan aerodynamic performances, considering fan total pressure ratio for OP 1 and OP 2 with the aim to increase the fan stability limit and on the isentropic efficiency for OP 3. Among the Paretofront, the best individual is selected and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, explaining the performance gain and corresponding geometric modifications of the intake and lip section. A new optimization process is realized to minimize the pressure peak observed at static take-off condition on the nacelle’s leading edge. Then, a full annulus nacelle geometry is created in order to study the influence of some asymmetric parameters such as the angle of the nacelle inlet face (droop angle), the thickness in circumferential direction and the inflow angl...|$|R
50|$|Early {{fans were}} {{designed}} by industrial designer Richard Ten Eyck., and were distinguished from ordinary fans by enclosure in a short duct shaped as aerodynamically contoured cylindrical ring, with an added concentric flared <b>intake</b> duct <b>ring,</b> sharply pitched blades, stationary vanes and aerodynamic grille, and rubber shock-mounting; the design was advertised as making the fan exceptionally quiet, efficient and effective, delivering a narrower, more-concentrated blast of air than normal fans.|$|R

In the cases investigated, the air pressure distributions were known, so the air pressure was applied directly to the <b>intake</b> <b>nacelle</b> wall. A sensitivity study was subsequently carried out to compare a real pressure distribution and different functions representing the pressure distribution. It was concluded that the results were not greatly affected by the different functions...|$|R
50|$|The SP1's {{design was}} very {{different}} from prototypes like the Audi R8, using many curved design elements including a large, rounded nose and footbox and sweeping fenders. The SP1 also featured a large air <b>intake</b> <b>nacelle</b> located {{on the side of the}} chassis, although this was later moved to a more tradition location on top near the rollover hoop. The design would also incorporate the use of multiple dive plans, including the first use of some on the nose. Later, vertical boards would be added to the rear tail in order to help increase downforce in conjunction with the rear wing.|$|R
50|$|The Ikarus 452 was an {{experimental}} jet aircraft built in Yugoslavia in 1953. It was a stubby mid-wing cantilever monoplane of pod-and-boom configuration, with twin jets mounted one atop {{the other at}} the rear of the fuselage <b>nacelle,</b> with separate <b>intakes</b> for the lower engine (in the wing roots) and the upper engine (on the sides of the rear fuselage). The twin tails and horizontal stabiliser were carried at the ends of booms that extended rearwards from the wings, with a short fin extending from the top of the rear fuselage to also meet the stabiliser. The flying surfaces were sharply swept, and construction throughout was of {{an experimental}} alloy.|$|R
50|$|One SST VCE {{concept is}} the Tandem Fan engine. The engine has two fans, both {{mounted on the}} {{low-pressure}} shaft, with a significant axial gap between the units. In normal flight, the engine is in the series mode, with the flow leaving the front fan passing directly into the second fan, the engine behaving much like a normal turbofan. However, for take-off, climb-out, final-descent and approach, the front fan is allowed to discharge directly through an auxiliary nozzle {{on the underside of}} the powerplant <b>nacelle.</b> Auxiliary <b>intakes</b> are opened on each side of the powerplant, allowing air to enter the rear fan and progress through the rest of the engine. Operating the fans in this parallel mode substantially increases the total airflow of the engine at a thrust, resulting in a lower jet velocity and a quieter engine. Back in the 1970s, Boeing modified a Pratt & Whitney JT8D to a Tandem Fan configuration and successfully demonstrated the switch from series to parallel operation (and vice versa) with the engine running, albeit at part power. In the Mid Tandem Fan concept, a high specific flow single stage fan is located between the high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) compressors of a turbojet core. Only bypass air is allowed to pass through the fan, the LP compressor exit flow passing through special passages within the fan disc, directly underneath the fan rotor blades. Some of the bypass air enters the engine via an auxiliary intake. During take-off and approach the engine behaves much like a normal civil turbofan, with an acceptable jet noise level (i.e., low specific thrust). However, for supersonic cruise, the fan variable inlet guide vanes and auxiliary intake close-off to minimize bypass flow and increase specific thrust. In this mode the engine acts more like a 'leaky' turbojet (e.g. the F404).|$|R
40|$|The {{different}} aspects of overall performance of three variable cycle engines (VCE) candidates for future supersonic civil transport are analysed in this work. These aspects concern the design and off-design points performance, the airframe engine integration and variable geometry compressor and turbine design and performance. The three engines are compared to a traditional turbojet. The variable compressor maps were obtained with their running lines for the whole mission profile including the transition mode from medium býpass ratio to a lower bypass ratio turbofan. The specific fuel consumption (SFC) of the VCEs showed a significant improvement, especially at subsonic cruise, relative to a Turbojet engine. The extent of the variable geometry on the compressor stator angles, mixing area and the nozzle throat and exit areas is evaluated. The Fuel bill is estimated for two standard mission profiles. The effect of installation is estimated on an isolated nacelle. A sizing calculation is carried out for the whole <b>nacelle</b> including the <b>intake</b> and the nozzle. The drag due to the friction, pre-entry, afterbody and the shock waves is calculated in order to estimated the installed performance of the three engines. In the search of improving the VCE performance at subsonic cruise, the use of variable geometry at the low pressure turbine for the Turbofan-Turbojet engine is investigated. The effects of varying the LP turbine guide vanes stagger angle on the engine performance and component parameters are analysed. The turbine efficiency and non-dimensional mass flow changes due {{to the use of}} variable geometry are estimated. An updated version of the Turbornatch program was corrected and tested in order to study variable cycle engines, especially to simulate the transition from one mode to another...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the liquid fuel in the <b>intake</b> manifold, the <b>ring</b> pack crevices and the oil film on the {{unburned}} hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of a spark-ignited, carbureted, air-cooled V-twin engine was studied. Tests were performed {{for a range of}} engine load, two engine speeds, various air-fuel ratio and with a fixed ignition timing. To isolate liquid fuel effects due to the poor atomization and vaporization of the fuel when using a carburetor, a specially conditioned homogeneous, pre-vaporized mixture system (HMS) was developed. The results from carburetor and HMS are compared. To verify the existence of liquid fuel in the manifold, and to obtain an estimate of its mass, a carburetor-mounted liquid fuel injection (CMLFI) system was also implemented. Stop-injection tests performed with the CMFLI system show that 60 - 80 cycles worth of liquid fuel is held in the intake manifold depending on operating condition. The results of the comparison show that the liquid fuel in the intake manifold does not have a statistically significant influence on the averaged HC emissions. In addition, the cycle-resolved HC emissions for both systems follow the same trends and are comparable in magnitude. Heat release analysis showed little difference between fuel mixture delivery system. These results suggest that under steady state operation the HC emissions for this engine are not sensitive to the presence of liquid fuel in the <b>intake</b> manifold. The <b>ring</b> pack contribution to the engine-out HC emissions was estimated using a simplified ring pack gas flow model; the model was tested against the experimentally measured blowby. The tests were performed using the homogeneous fuel mixture system. The integrated mass of HC leaving the crevices from the end of combustion (the crank angle that the cumulative burn fraction reached 90 %) to exhaust valve closing was taken to represent the potential contribution of the ring pack to the overall HC emissions; post-oxidation in the cylinder will consume some of this mass. Time-resolved exhaust HC concentration measurements were also performed, and the instantaneous HC mass flow rate was determined using the measured exhaust and cylinder pressure. At high load the model predicts that the ring pack returns approximately three times as much HC mass to the cylinder as is measured in the exhaust, indicating that the HC emissions are dominated by the ring pack contribution. At the lightest load condition tested, the ring pack model predicts less mass returning to the cylinder from the ring pack than is observed in the exhaust, clearly indicating that another HC mechanism is significantly contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. The integrated exhaust HC mass from the time-resolved HC measurement was found to correlate inversely with the IMEP on a cycle-by-cycle basis, which strongly suggest that incomplete combustion is materially contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. A statistical analysis showed that the correlation was significant. The intermediate load condition represents a combination of these two extremes. The ensemble-average ring pack model results indicate that the mass returned to the cylinder from the ring pack is slightly higher than the amount measured in the exhaust. But, a conditional sampling analysis indicates that there are sub-groups, i. e. late-burning cycles, for which this is not true. There is expected to be some in-cylinder post-oxidation of the ring pack HC mass at this condition, and the late burning cycles were not found to excessively contribute to the HC emissions, which both strongly suggests that there are other mechanisms besides the ring pack that are significantly contributing to the HC emissions at this condition. The most likely mechanism is incomplete combustion. The contribution of fuel adsorption in engine oil and its subsequent desorption following combustion to the engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions was studied by comparing steady state and cycle-resolved HC emission measurements from operation with a standard full-blend gasoline, and with propane, which has a low solubility in oil. Experiments were performed at two speeds and three loads, and for different mean crankcase pressures. The crankcase pressure was found to impact the HC emissions, presumably through the ringpack mechanism, which was largely unaltered by the different fuels. The average and cycle-resolved HC emissions were found to be in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the two fuels. Further, the two fuels showed the same response to changes in the crankcase pressure. The experiments were supported by a numerical analysis. The simulation of the liquid-gas phase equilibrium of the fuel-oil system showed the solubility of propane in the oil was approximately an order of magnitude lower than for gasoline. Further the numerical analysis of the adsorption-desorption of the fuel in the oil along the cycle showed that the oil layer contribution is very small compared with the ring pack contribution. This suggests that the effect of fuel adsorption in the oil is not significant for small air-cooled utility-type engines...|$|R
