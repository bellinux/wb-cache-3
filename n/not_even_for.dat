25|$|Plasma {{consists}} of a mixture of electrons, ions, radicals, neutrals and photons. Some of these species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, while others are <b>not.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>for</b> simple gases like argon this mixture can be complex. For plasmas of organic monomers, the complexity can rapidly increase as some components of the plasma fragment, while others interact and form larger species. Glow discharge is a technique in polymerization which forms free electrons which gain energy from an electric field, and then lose energy through collisions with neutral molecules in the gas phase. This leads to many chemically reactive species, which then lead to a plasma polymerization reaction. The electric discharge process for plasma polymerization is the “low-temperature plasma” method, because higher temperatures cause degradation. These plasmas are formed by a direct current, alternating current or radio frequency generator.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.|$|E

500|$|While {{some critics}} thought Mariah was {{trying too hard}} with [...] "Thirsty," [...] the song has {{garnered}} mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Christina Lee for Idolator was complimentary of the song, describing it as a single which her record label most probably wanted to release from the album in the first place. She {{went on to say}} that it is [...] "tailor-made" [...] for radio airplay [...] "right now." [...] Writing for the same publication, Mike Wass wrote that he thought the solo version was better than the alternate version featuring Rich Homie Quan's rap verse, writing [...] "It's an improvement on the original.

500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The comedy of the situation derives from Jenks' own attempts to manufacture some free time to enjoy himself, only to regret the action because of the resultant circumstances. Advertising for the film confirms this by stating, [...] "Jenk's day off was a day of woe instead of the day of joy he meant it to be. It taught him to never, never leave his wife's side - <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> a day!" [...] Jenks' swimming in a secluded spot, inferring swimming in the nude through {{the lack of a}} swimming suit, sets the stage for the comedy when his clothes are swapped for those of the cross-dressed convict. With no other option, Jenks dons the clothes and responds to the call for help. The lady identifies Jenks as the convict, wearing her clothes, and the film concludes with a chase that leads to the arrest and humiliation of Jenks. This comedy predates the well-known cross-dressing antics of Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin by a few years. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast is uncredited because their identities are unknown. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. Known and more prominent members of the cast to appear in productions include the leading ladies, Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming, and the leading man was Frank H. Crane.|$|E

2500|$|Two days later, New Zealand totalled 288 for 9 in {{the first}} ODI, which was enough to secure victory; Ramnaresh Sarwan top-scored with 56 but took 83 balls, more than below the {{required}} run rate, and West Indies were bowled out for 207. 76 from Wavell Hinds was {{the highlight of the}} second match for the West Indies, but the total of 200 for 9 was overcome by New Zealand in 42 overs, though they were 13 for 4 after two wickets each from Fidel Edwards and Ian Bradshaw. In the third match, Nathan Astle hit a century, and though Sarwan hit his second half-century on tour West Indies were bowled out for 255, with Jeetan Patel taking three wickets. The win secured the series for New Zealand, but they weren't done; 102 from Lou Vincent helped them make a total of 324 for 6 in 50 overs, and though Runako Morton scored a century, he took 155 balls to make 110. West Indies closed on 233 for 8, well short of the required total. However, Dwayne Smith helped turn the final match West Indies' way; he took five for 45 at Eden Park as New Zealand were bowled out for 233, and though West Indies made six runs from their first six overs (and still lost the wicket of Chris Gayle) they made it to the target with three wickets and two balls to spare. However, writer Vaneisa Baksh claimed [...] "the win did nothing for anyone, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> New Zealand." ...|$|E
