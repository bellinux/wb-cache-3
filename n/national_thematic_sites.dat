During several research trips, conducted between 2001 and 2006, I collected data on participatory budgeting and on participatory urban planning in the city of Salvador. I was therefore able to compare two <b>thematic</b> <b>sites</b> where local states interacted with society in general, and with civil society speci?cally. In both cases, I found a very wide gap between the de jure mandate of citizen participation and the de facto state of affairs. The examined empirical cases point to some of the conditionalities of democratic participation at the local level. The existence of this gap between law and reality can, in part, be explained by the continued importance of ‘Carlismo’ as a way of doing local politics in Bahia and therefore, to the persistence of local political regimes persisting despite changes in political leadership...|$|R

The ENCORA Portal was built upon existing technologies and software tools integrating three main different, interlinked database systems. The Integrated Marine Information System (IMIS) served as the searchable contact database of coastal professionals, institutes and projects.

The link and synchronization between the different relational database systems was established through an in-house developed system and will serve as link to any future systems that may need quality control or authorization.

This network is composed of many Spanish research groups that are dedicated to research to soils and environments affected by forest fires. Because of the worldwide relevance of this subject, there already exist considerable collaborations with many foreign research groups. Therefore, the goal of the present meeting is to offer a platform to exchange and discuss recent research efforts and ideas –both on a national and an international level– and to extract the research lines that needs to be followed in the future. A second goal of this meeting is to approach young scientists to become involved in and to contribute to this research area with their new ideas.

Interpreting broadly thematisation processes, it can be assumed that it results in all the spaces that are characterized by the accumulation of specific attributes and objects connected by a common theme, created in order to perform their specialized functions or to obtain an aesthetisation effect and the enhancement of the space value. Thematisation of space is also a form of response to the changing needs of todayʼs tourism industry and tourists themselves. Developing since World War II global tourism product leads on one hand to the unification of tourist services and forms of tourism development, on the other hand, undergoes a continuous counter-process of the offer differentiation contributes to innovation and specialization and leads to the emergence of new forms of tourism, mostly of a thematic and specialized nature.

The UN System Network on Rural Development and Food Security (RDFS) is based in the FAO and managed from the Rome headquarters. The network comprises 20 UN organisations, bringing together the key actors to achieve their shared goals of "food for all" and rural poverty reduction. It calls itself an inter-agency mechanism for follow-up to the World Food Summit (WFS) of 1996 and the WFS-Five Years Later event of 2002, and it supports the International Land Coalition. Part {{of the role of the}} RDFS network is to coordinate efforts by governments and UN agencies, but it is most useful for its explicit goal of reinforcing ties between UN system bodies and other stakeholders, notably NGOs and civil society organisations (CSOs). It does this at the international level, without any drift towards attempting to own its independent partners a welcome but rare hands-off attitude. And at national level, it promotes links between public and independent sector bodies through <b>national</b> <b>thematic</b> groups, of which there are 80, many in ACP countries. In practice, this means that any NGO or CSO in the field of rural development and food security, keen to develop links with parts of the UN system, can knock, by mail or electronic communication, on the door of the RDFS network and find the way. The RDFS Website is a gem. It has general articles and interviews on networking and agriculture, and then 16 thematic chapters, including agriculture, communication for development, gender, food and nutrition, governance, partnership, and HIV/AIDS.
