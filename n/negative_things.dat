5|$|J. Jonah Jameson is {{depicted}} as {{the publisher of the}} Daily Bugle and is Peter Parker's boss and as a harsh critic of Spider-Man, always saying <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> about the superhero in the newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson's publishing editor and confidant Robbie Robertson is always depicted as a supporter of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man.|$|E
25|$|Pessimism bias is {{an effect}} {{in which people}} exaggerate the {{likelihood}} that <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> will happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias. The difference {{is that we are}} in an improbable way worried about our society's future.|$|E
25|$|WWE {{released}} a DVD documentary, Macho Man: The Randy Savage Story, in November 2014. Despite a strained relationship {{over the years}} with the WWE, the documentary featured interviews with Savage's brother, Lanny Poffo and his mother, with Poffo giving insight {{to many of the}} rumors and denying some of the <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> other wrestlers said in the documentary about Savage, including his relationship with Elizabeth. Savage was never inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame during his lifetime and he was frequently described as being one of its most noticeably absent figures.|$|E
50|$|The dater {{would be}} sent back to the RV. Once back in the RV, the dater would usually say either a {{positive}} or <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> about the person to give the remaining daters an idea about the contestant.|$|R
50|$|Lee's sister Janine Zerger was {{critical}} of the Guatelmalan investigation: They did not investigate enough to know about his life. But the word gay conjures up images in their mind, so they thought of every <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> they could say to prove this case is not worthy of solving.|$|R
50|$|Bad {{taste is}} {{generally}} a title given to any object or idea {{that does not}} fall within the normal social standards of the time or area. Varying from society to society {{and from time to}} time, bad taste is generally thought of as a <b>negative</b> <b>thing,</b> but also changes with each individual.|$|R
25|$|After {{two years}} had passed and Tewodros had not {{received}} a reply, he imprisoned Cameron, together with all the British subjects in Ethiopia and various other Europeans, {{in an attempt to}} get the queen's attention. His prisoners included a missionary named Mr. Stern, who had previously published a book in Europe describing Tewodros as a barbaric, cruel, unstable usurper. When Tewodros saw this book, he became violently angry, pulled a gun on Stern, and had to be restrained from killing the missionary. Tewodros also received reports from abroad that foreign papers had quoted these European residents of Ethiopia as having said many <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> about him and his reign.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Van Halen {{would later}} explain (in {{regard to the}} MTV Video Music Awards appearance) that he had {{initially}} been embarrassed by Roth's antics while on camera behind Beck, who was giving an acceptance speech for the award that Van Halen had presented to him. Immediately following this, the band had been taken to a backstage press conference where press queries about a reunion tour were met with Eddie Van Halen saying that he needed a hip replacement {{and would have to}} record an entire new studio album before any tour. In private Roth told Eddie to avoid talking about <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> like his hip and the two almost came to blows, thereby shattering any chance of a full-scale reunion.|$|E
25|$|With Anna in chains, Ingrid asks Anna {{to recall}} {{the tale of a}} king who lost his only daughter, and as a result, used a mirror to cast a spell on his whole kingdom, making them see only the worst qualities in those around them, leading them to kill each other. Ingrid uses a small shard of the mirror to cast the same spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, on Anna, {{resulting}} in Anna becoming negative and resentful against Elsa for deserting her during their childhood. Elsa suspects a spell has been cast on her sister when Anna comes to the dining room carrying the urn and saying only <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> about her. Ingrid demands that Elsa freeze Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside of the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt her sister, crossing her arms to hold in her magic. Still under the spell, Anna traps Elsa inside the urn, even as Elsa tells her that no matter what she does, she will always love her. Anna realizes too late what she has done when Ingrid takes the urn from her, and Kristoff arrives to stop Ingrid. Unfortunately, Elsa's entrapment was not Ingrid's original plan, and in her anger, she uses her powers to freeze Anna, Kristoff, and the entire Kingdom of Arendelle. Rumplestiltskin appears in the dining room, finding Ingrid practicing her Rock Troll magic, pulling memories from Elsa, still inside the urn, over to a rock in her other hand. Rumplestiltskin asks her to give him the Sorcerer's Hat box; when she refuses, he magically takes and hides the urn and Anna's necklace, saying he will return them only in exchange for the box.|$|E
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{interesting}} response to my argument last week that videogames are not a young medium {{was the idea that}} youth, in this case, is not always intended as a <b>negative</b> <b>thing.</b> This interesting argument was explained by {{a number of people who}} responded to the post, on twitter, via email, and in the comment section...|$|R
50|$|The main <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> to be {{said about}} Bunter is that he seems to have no other {{interest}} in life than serving Lord Peter; he is even ready to give up marriage rather than leave (Thrones, Dominations). However, this attitude must be seen in the context of early 20th century society, not that of the 21st century.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson {{fears the}} legacy that {{discrimination}} leaves for youth. [...] "I am frightened to see {{young people who}} believe that a racist power structure is responsible for every <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> that happens to them," [...] she explained to the New York Times. [...] "After a point it does not matter whether these perceptions are true or false; it is the perceptions that matter." ...|$|R
500|$|The poem {{starts with}} a {{flattering}} question to the beloved—"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" [...] The beloved is [...] "more lovely and more temperate" [...] than a summer's day. The speaker lists some <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> about summer: it is short—"summer's lease hath all too short a date"—and sometimes the sun is too hot—"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines." [...] However, the beloved has beauty that will last forever, unlike the fleeting beauty of a summer's day. By putting his love's beauty into the form of poetry, the poet is preserving it forever. [...] "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee." [...] The lover's beauty will live on, through the poem which will {{last as long as}} it can be read.|$|E
500|$|By 1993, Pressman and St. Martin's Press had {{received}} approximately two dozen letters from Erhard's attorney Walter Maksym, though Erhard's representatives {{had yet to}} see the book itself. Maksym told the San Francisco Daily Journal in March 1993 {{that he wanted to}} [...] "fact check the book", because he believed that [...] "this is a first-time unknown author who apparently has interviewed only people who have <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> to say", and stated [...] "We have cautioned the publisher that they are responsible for the accuracy of the book." [...] Charlie Spicer, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, described the actions of Erhard's representatives with regard to the book as [...] "a desperate campaign by someone with something to hide". The author himself made specific reference to his legal support, mentioning [...] "the potential legal rapids that confront authors writing these days about controversial subjects".|$|E
500|$|DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire {{noted in}} a review that while the tenth season {{contains}} [...] "a lot of laughs", it is missing the emotional core of the earlier seasons. Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com has commented that around the time the tenth season aired, [...] "not only did the show start losing its status as untouchable—read: everyone stopped expecting every episode to be a masterpiece—it also developed the bad habit of building episodes around celebrity guests, who were practically never as amusing as {{they were meant to}} be." [...] Michael Passman of The Michigan Daily wrote in 2007 that [...] "in hindsight, the 10th season can now be seen as a tipping point of sorts for a number of the show's less attractive plot devices. Homer's get-rich-quick schemes start to become all too prevalent, and there are an inordinate amount of unnecessary celebrity cameos." [...] Passman did not only have <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> to say about the tenth season though. He commented that it [...] "is not the last great 'Simpsons' season ever. The last great season was the eighth. The last really good season was the ninth. But the tenth is just pretty good, nothing more, nothing less." ...|$|E
50|$|Impatience {{is usually}} {{viewed as a}} <b>negative</b> <b>thing.</b> Patience should not be {{confused}} with laziness, complacency or inaptitude. Laziness is lacking a desire to fix a certain problem or complete a job. Laziness means that one's desire to do other things than a given task outweighs the desire to do that particular task. This is not the same as being patient with a process.|$|R
25|$|This game {{offered a}} preview of what lay in store for Super Bowl XXV, as the Giants scored on drives of 75, 80, 49 and 51 yards, which lasted nine, 11, 11 and 16 plays. Overall, the Giants held the ball for 38:22, {{compared}} to Chicago's 21:38. The only <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> for New York was the loss of running back Rodney Hampton, who suffered a broken leg in the first half.|$|R
5000|$|In {{competitive}} debating, judges usually {{consider a}} squirrel a <b>negative</b> <b>thing.</b> There is, however, no clear standard on {{what constitutes a}} squirrel, and the judges have to decide this on their own. Sometimes the other side in the debate tries to notify the judges of the squirrel. A notable example is the so-called [...] "open motion" [...] debate, where debaters are expected {{to come up with}} their own far-fetched interpretation of an ambiguous motion.|$|R
2500|$|The {{characters}} have positive and <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> {{to say about}} {{both male and female}} characters, suggesting an equality between sexes. However, the problem {{is that many of the}} positive qualities of the female characters seem to be those by which they can rise above their femininity ... The superficial nature of stereotypical female interests is condemned.|$|E
2500|$|... 0 is the integer {{immediately}} preceding 1. Zero {{is an even}} number, {{because it}} is divisible by 2 with no remainder. 0 is neither positive nor negative. By most definitions 0 is a natural number, and then the only natural number not to be positive. Zero is a number which quantifies a count or an amount of null size. In most cultures, 0 was identified before the idea of <b>negative</b> <b>things,</b> or quantities less than zero, was accepted.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, the {{contract}} with YES was renewed despite the Cory Lidle controversy and some <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> that Russo said about the Yankee organization {{in the summer of}} 2006 (including a heated on-air discussion with Yankees general manager Brian Cashman). Francesa and Russo maintained that YES did not censor them on-air. Both they and YES officials have commented that the simulcast likely would have been canceled quickly if YES forced them to not criticize Yankees or Nets management. [...] MSG Network also expressed interest in moving the show from YES.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{very common}} Digitiser phrase was the {{expression}} [...] "". It {{was used to}} mean erring or failing, to rebuke or discredit a persons opinion ("You, sir, have messed up."), as an adjective meaning substandard or faulty ("messed-up animation"), and as a noun meaning any <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> ("there are several mess-ups"). The phrase, like many others, was embraced by the readers who often used it in their letters. The author Alex Garland was a Digitiser fan and named a chapter in his novel The Beach [...] "Messed Up" [...] in its honour.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{document}} of Gwar's 2000 tour. This video was sold at shows and through gwar.net, {{but was not}} an official Metal Blade release. It {{is one of the}} few concert videos that was not shot and edited by the band - most of this one is actually shot on real film, not just video tape. The only <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> about this DVD is that they cut out many of the skits between songs, and stuck them at the end as bonus features. This title is currently out of print.|$|R
5000|$|Interpreting proverbs {{is often}} complex, but is best {{done in a}} context. [...] Interpreting proverbs from other {{cultures}} {{is much more difficult}} than interpreting proverbs in one's own culture. Even within English-speaking cultures, there is difference of opinion on how to interpret the proverb A rolling stone gathers no moss. Some see it as condemning a person that keeps moving, seeing moss as a positive thing, such as profit; others see it the proverb as praising people that keep moving and developing, seeing moss as a <b>negative</b> <b>thing,</b> such as <b>negative</b> habits.|$|R
2500|$|Perkins-Graham {{told her}} that Churchill [...] "had indeed said unkind and {{inappropriate}} <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> about Cindy Waters" [...] and confirmed the complaints about the ward and the criticism of Davis. Davis decided to fire Churchill for what she considered continued insubordination, but {{did not do so}} until after she had consulted with Waters, Hopper and the hospital's personnel director. Churchill appealed to Hopper, her only recourse under the hospital's employee policy, but after a meeting with her and the personnel director he {{told her that}} the negative evaluation the month before counted as a second written warning and thus her termination had followed the proper process.|$|E
2500|$|Both Chatterji and Shapiro were {{suspended}} in July 2011 and dismissed in December 2011 after 14 and 25 {{years of service}} respectively, after the CIIS received student complaints against them. The CIIS Faculty Hearing Board found them guilty of failure to perform academic duties and violation of professional ethics. According to India Abroad, 39 Anthropology students from a Department of 50 retained legal counsel {{to take action against}} CIIS. As reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education in January 2012: [...] "A student worker in the dean of students' office, who had been supportive of Shapiro and Chatterji and at odds with her own boss, last fall issued a statement accusing Ms. Strong of being antagonistic toward the anthropology department and pressuring her to say <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> about the two professors.". The matter entered legal arbitration, and all allegations were retracted in January 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Hurt {{campaigned on}} his {{opposition}} to the Democratic-backed initiatives that Perriello supported, such as health-care reform, the economic stimulus package and clean energy legislation. On August 20, Hurt released his first television ad. Hurt's first television ad stated that he would fight tax increases, stop Washington’s spending and start creating jobs, however he never mentions his opponent. [...] "You definitely see that he’s running against Congress as a whole and Democrats as a whole," [...] Isaac Wood, an analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said. [...] "That was very clear. He spent just a few seconds introducing himself, then pivoted right away to attack the <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> happening in D.C. With voters, that can be effective." [...] Another ad from Hurt called Perriello a [...] "rubber stamp" [...] for the policies of President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Hurt won with 51percent of the vote.|$|E

30|$|For {{dealing with}} pseudo-symmetries of all kinds, {{it is also}} helpful when a {{computer}} program allows the user to overwrite an automatic (default) assignment of the reciprocal basis vectors in the amplitude map of a dFT of {{a more or less}} 2 D-periodic image. The CRISP program possesses this feature as well. The only <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> that could be said about this program is that, typically, error bars on the extracted unit cell angles are at least one order of magnitude larger than one would expect {{based on the assumption that}} the CRISP program output are significant numbers. (The other two programs provide even more non-significant numbers as outputs).|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was playing}} {{some of the}} records yesterday," [...] said Mott. [...] "They are amazing. They are so musical. They are like pop. I can't believe my parents said they were nothing but noise. Really, it is {{something}} you would want your own kids to be doing, it was so creative, instead of all this consumer stuff and video games. Punk was portrayed as this <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> but, in fact, it was a high point and a lasting part of British culture. And {{that is why we}} should be celebrating it. Punk marked the end of the postwar period. It gave birth to individualism and then the Thatcher era that followed." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{initially}} {{reluctant to}} reveal where she {{drew inspiration from}} to write the song, Lee decided to disclose during an interview in August 2006 and confirm the speculations. Her decision to publicly talk about the inspiration came shortly after Morgan had been admitted to a rehabilitation center to undergo treatment for [...] "combination of substances". The singer stated that when conceiving the song, she was aware that [...] "people would read between the lines", hence, she tried to [...] "be completely clear". With it, she {{felt the need to}} [...] "say exactly what I was feeling for so long" [...] and continued to describe her process of creating music as a form of a therapy which gave her a medium to express the <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> that had happened in her life and allow her to [...] "turn something bad into something beautiful". [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] helped her in the process of healing from a [...] "painful ending to a relationship". Lee further elaborated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Steven H Silver {{called the}} novel an [...] "action-filled {{adventure}} through a future {{reminiscent of the}} British Raj" [...] and described the characters as being [...] "sympathetic and realistic despite the alternate world which they inhabit." [...] Silver, however, found the amount of research that Stirling did to write the novel to have slowed down the plot and he also complained about the foreign terms throughout the novel that were devoid of translation or definition. In a second review of the novel, Silver had more <b>negative</b> <b>things</b> to say of the characters describing them to be [...] "more like archetypes than like individuals" [...] and also having [...] "lack of dimensions." [...] Don Harlow called it a fun story, but agreed with Silver that Stirling failed to tell the reader the meaning {{of some of the}} foreign words used and even corrected the author on the spelling of some words. In an interview, Stirling stated he got the vocabulary for the novel from dictionaries and a Hobson-Jobson that Harry Turtledove gave him as a Christmas present.|$|E

[...] Co-star and BAFTA- and Oscar-nominated director and producer Rob Reiner said, [...] "Working with her {{was one of the greatest}} experiences of my life." [...] Sally Struthers said, [...] "Jean lived so in the present. She was a Christian Scientist who didn't say or think a <b>negative</b> <b>thing</b> ... She was just a walking, living angel".|$|R
50|$|People {{learning}} {{a second language}} rarely reach {{the same level of}} competence as native speakers. In fact, by definition, they can never become a native speaker of another language. Very few L2 users are at a level where they can pass for a native speaker, but even their knowledge is not exactly {{the same as that of}} monolingual native speakers. Most L2 users are immediately identifiable by their foreign accent, and often by their syntax or choice of words. Cook argues that this is not a <b>negative</b> <b>thing,</b> and that L2 users should not be judged to the same standards as monolinguals. Rather, they should be held to the standard of successful L2 users.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{the word}} 'ignorance' has a {{negative}} tone to it, {{and for a long}} time scientific ignorance was viewed as a purely <b>negative</b> <b>thing.</b> Recently, however, people have started to abandon this idea, and instead try to find uses of deliberate ignorance.This has generally been called useful ignorance. A first step in finding uses of ignorance is realizing that ignorance is inevitable. As Matthias Gross says: [...] "new knowledge also means more ignorance".Gross also talks about the connection between ignorance and surprise. Surprise can reveal what scientists are ignorant of, which help them focus their research in order to gain knowledge. On the other hand, ignorance is what gives rise to surprise, making the two very connected.|$|R
