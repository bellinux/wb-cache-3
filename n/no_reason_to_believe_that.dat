5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott saw <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E
5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
50|$|Arguments {{involving}} underdetermination {{attempt to}} show that there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> some conclusion because it is underdetermined by the evidence. Then, if the evidence available at a particular time can be equally well explained by at least one other hypothesis, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it rather than the equally supported rival (although many other hypotheses may still be eliminated).|$|R

5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but {{if this was the}} norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E

25|$|Prostaglandin is a {{large family}} of lipids. Prostaglandin I2/PGI2/prostacyclin is just one member of it. Prostaglandins other than PGI2 (such as PGE2) also play {{important}} roles in vascular tone regulation. Prostacyclin/thromboxane are produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, and rofecoxib suppresses just COX-2 enzyme, so there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> prostacyclin levels are significantly reduced by the drug. And there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> only the balance between quantities of prostacyclin and thromboxane is the determinant factor for vascular tone. Indeed, Merck has stated {{that there was no}} effect on prostacyclin production in blood vessels in animal testing. Corey speculated that the cardiotoxicity may be associated with an organic acid anhydride formed when rofecoxib is exposed to air.|$|E

25|$|The atheistic {{conclusion}} is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient {{reason to believe that}} any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences say something about the human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a god exists.|$|E

They suggested that its powerful shoulder region was actually an adaptation for shaking prey, like some modern shark species do.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} that Arab immigration somehow {{made up a}} large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable.

25|$|Numerous other {{historical}} figures were reputed {{to have lived}} past 100. The sixth dynasty Egyptian ruler Pepi II is believed by some Egyptologists to have lived to 100 or more (c. 2278 – c. 2184 BC), as {{he is said to}} have reigned for 94 years. However this is disputed: others say he only reigned 64 years. Hosius of Córdoba, the man who convinced Constantine the Great to call the First Council of Nicaea, reportedly lived to age 102. The Chronicon of Bernold of Constance records the death in 1097 of Azzo marchio de Longobardia, pater Welfonis ducis de Baiowaria, commenting that he was iam maior centenario. Ultimately, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> centenarians did not exist in antiquity, even if they were not commonplace.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer term at Meadowbank School for Girls, the most prestigious prep school in England, Miss Bulstrode, the popular but aging headmistress, has <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the {{challenges}} facing her on parent's day will be more than the occasional irate or inebriated parent. She scarcely listens when Mrs Upjohn, a parent, who just happened to have worked in military intelligence, looks out of the window and notices on the school campus someone whom she recognises and whose presence at the school apparently surprises but does not alarm her. Mrs Upjohn is still talking but the crucial moment has passed. After Mrs Upjohn leaves, Miss Bulstrode has a sudden feeling that she has missed something to which she should have paid attention but then dismisses the notion.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, {{after the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler, {{who had been}} imprisoned for treason, {{appointed}} Rosenberg {{as the leader of}} the National Socialist movement, a position he held until Hitler's release. Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.|$|E

25|$|The {{underlying}} {{mutation rate}} {{used by the}} geneticists is more questionable. They often use different mutation rates and studies frequently arrive at vastly different conclusions. NRY and mtDNA may be so susceptible to drift that some ancient patterns may have become obscured. Another assumption is that population genealogies are approximated by allele genealogies. Guido Barbujani points out that this only holds if population groups develop from a genetically monomorphic set of founders. Barbujani argues that there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Europe was colonised by monomorphic populations. This would result in an overestimation of haplogroup age, thus falsely extending the demographic history of Europe into the Late Paleolithic rather than the Neolithic era. Greater certainty about chronology may be obtained from studies of ancient DNA (see below), but so far these have been comparatively few.|$|E
25|$|The Director General {{has advised}} {{me that he}} has found no {{evidence}} of any truth in the allegations. He has given me his personal assurance that the stories are false. In particular, he has advised me that all the Security Service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine or discredit Lord Wilson and his Government when he was Prime Minister. The then Director General has categorically denied the allegation that he confirmed the existence within the Security Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right wing views. He has further stated that he had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> any such faction existed. No evidence or indication has been found of any plot or conspiracy against Lord Wilson by or within the Security Service.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1903–1905 that the Barringer Crater was {{correctly}} identified as an impact crater, and it {{was not until}} as recently as 1963 that research by Eugene Merle Shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century space exploration and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the Solar System's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the Solar System was found to be cratered, and there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|Maps of {{the period}} {{generally}} depicted a large continent named Terra Australis Incognita of highly variable shape and extent. This land was posited by Ptolemy as a counterbalance to the extensive continental areas in the northern hemisphere; {{due to a lack}} of exploration and various misunderstandings, its existence was not fully abandoned until circumnavigation of the area during the second voyage of James Cook in the 1770s showed that if it existed, it was much smaller than imagined previously. The first confirmed landing on Antarctica was not until 1820, and the coastline of Queen Maud Land did not see significant exploration before Norwegian expeditions began in 1891. In 1513, Cape Horn had not yet been discovered, and indeed Ferdinand Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation was not to set sail for another six years. It is unclear whether the mapmaker saw South America itself as part of the unknown southern lands (as shown in the Atlas Miller), or whether (as Dutch thought) he drew what was then known of the coast with substantial distortion, but in any case, serious scholarship holds that there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast.|$|E

Horowitz stated, [...] "It is in fact inconceivable that Kahn wrote those words."
