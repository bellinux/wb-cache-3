The adsorbent was treated continuously in the presence of air, different O 2 /CO 2 /N 2 mixtures, concentrated CO 2, and steam, and then the remaining CO 2 adsorption capacity was measured. Elemental analysis, BET/BJH analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis were applied to characterize adsorbent properties. This material was found to be thermally and hydrothermally stable at high temperatures. However, significant oxidative degradation occurred already at moderate temperatures (above 70 °C). Temperatures above 120 °C lead to degradation in concentrated dry CO 2. Adding moisture to the concentrated CO 2 stream improves the CO 2 -induced stability.

40|$|In this work, {{a falling}} film micro reactor was {{investigated}} regarding {{its ability to}} continuously eliminate tetrahydrofuran (THF) out of a THF-water mixture via <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stripping.</b> Mass transfer measurements were performed at different temperatures and flow rates. The residual content of THF in the eluate was quantified with high precision (< 0. 1 %) via density measurements. Remarkably, complete elimination of THF could be achieved for liquid volume flow rates smaller than 2 ml/min and nitrogen volume flow rates larger than 400 ml/min at all three investigated temperatures (55 °C, 60 °C, and 65 °C). In order to assist future design processes of such binary microstripping systems, we further developed a mass transfer model for this separation process extending an existing model for evaporation of a pure liquid. The good agreement of experimental data and calculations in the overall investigated parameter range (≤ 20 %, for gas flow rates below 500 ml/min ≤ 11 %) shows {{the potential of the}} model for the prediction of alternative operational parameter settings, e. g. at different THF entrance concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{dissolved}} nitrogen {{and carbon dioxide}} {{on the performance of}} a pure oxygen packed column were evaluated with a multicomponent gas-transfer model. Simulation data indicated that the high solubility of carbon dioxide precludes significant desorption under typical column operating conditions. The control of carbon dioxide buildup in intensive culture systems will require use of conventional aeration equipment or chemical treatment. In contrast to the high solubility of carbon dioxide, the solubility of nitrogen (N 2) is low. Consequently, dissolved nitrogen can be stripped from solution during the oxygenation process. The transfer of nitrogen from the liquid phase into the gas phase within the contact enclosure substantially reduces oxygen absorption efficiency (mass oxygen absorbed/mass oxygen supplied) and transfer efficiency (mass oxygen absorbed/power input). <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>stripping</b> also acts to control the allowable change in dissolved oxygen across the absorber when regulated by criteria for contactor effluent total dissolved gas pressure. The extent of nitrogen desorption is determined by the concentration of dissolved gases in the influent, column height, oxygen flow rate, and column pressure...|$|E
40|$|The fluid {{catalytic}} cracking unit (FCCU), the major conversion unit in an oil refinery, uses a silica-alumina zeolite catalyst to convert heavy hydrocarbons to light hydrocarbons. A {{small fraction of the}} catalyst must be continually replaced with fresh catalyst to maintain activity. The most detrimental of the contaminant metals are nickel and vanadium, which are deposited from the hydrocarbon feed during the cracking process and affect the deactivation rates. The deactivation rate of the catalyst followed a first order expression at constant metal addition and constant partial pressure of water in the regenerator. FCCU catalyst demetallization processes remove contaminant metals from the equilibrium fluid cracking catalyst (ECAT), increasing the ECAT activity and reducing its deactivation rate. The purpose of catalyst demetallization is to reduce the FCCU fresh catalyst addition rate and reduce the FCCU operating cost. Three processes were evaluated and optimized, and one of these three processes, the DEMET process was selected for commercial development. In the DEMET process developed at Chalmers, the ECAT is first reacted with H 2 S at 840 O C, then reacted with Cl 2 at 340 O C, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stripped</b> and then washed with water to remove the metal chlorides. Maintaining the catalyst at 840 O C in the commercial unit was difficult due to severe corrosion of the alloy-steel sulfider shell. This problem was solved by heating the catalyst with microwaves, while keeping the shell cool with internal insulation. To understand the value of the DEMET it was necessary to predict the FCCU yields, and for this purpose a computer model (MOD) was developed to predict the commercial yields of an FCCU using demetallization or other catalyst reactivation technology. Catalytic cracking, catalyst demetallization and alternatives, pilot plant vanadium and nickel deposition studies, commercial DEMET results, FCCU computer modeling and fluid bed microwave heating are described and evaluated in this thesis...|$|R

Aerobic thermophilic batch treatment of swine waste inoculated with strain D 2 was studied in a 4 -liter fixed-bed reactor. Stabilization of the waste was achieved in less than 30 h when the original chemical oxygen demand (COD) was between 15 and 20 g/liter or in less than 48 h when the COD was around 35 g/liter. When the COD was higher than 30 g/liter, the pH of the waste reached 9. 2 to 9. 5 during the treatment, and periodic adjustment of the pH to 8. 5 was necessary to maintain {{the activity of the}} biofilm. In this reactor, ammoniacal nitrogen was completely eliminated by desorption in less than 72 h of incubation. The different packing materials used resulted in similar rates of degradation of organic matter. The thermophilic treatment was also efficient in the 75 -liter digestor, and stabilization was achieved in approximately 50 h. A bank of 22 thermophilic bacterial strains originating from different environments and adapted to the thermophilic treatment of swine waste was established.

40|$|Aqueous phase {{reforming}} of sorbitol {{was carried}} out in a 1 m long, 320 µm ID microchannel reactor with a 5 µm Pt-based washcoated catalyst layer, combined with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stripping.</b> The performance of this microchannel reactor is correlated to the mass transfer properties, reaction kinetics, hydrogen selectivity and product distribution. Mass transfer does not affect the rate of sorbitol consumption, which is limited by the kinetics of the reforming reaction. Mass transfer significantly affects the hydrogen selectivity and the product distribution. The rapid consumption of hydrogen in side reactions at the catalyst surface is prevented by a fast mass transfer of hydrogen from the catalyst site to the gas phase in the microchannel reactor. This results in a decrease of the concentration of hydrogen at the catalyst surface, which was found to enhance the desired reforming route {{at the expense of the}} undesired hydrogen consuming reactions. Compared to a fixed bed reactor, the selectivity to hydrogen in the microchannel reactor was increased by a factor of 2. The yield to side products (mainly C 3 and heavier hydrodeoxygenated species) was suppressed while the yield to hydrogen was increased from 1. 4 to 4 moles per mole of sorbitol fed...|$|E
40|$|Animal wastes from {{high-density}} farming {{have severe}} {{impacts on the}} nitrogen cycle. According to current regulations, the disposal of manure on cropland is constrained by nitrogen content in the agricultural soils. On the contrary, anaerobic digestion (AD) of these wastes can produce energy and a digestate, which is easier to handle than manure and can be applied for agronomic uses. When herbaceous crops are co-digested with manure {{to increase the efficiency}} of biogas production, the nitrogen content in the digestate further increases, unless these larger plants are equipped with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stripping</b> technologies. We propose a model to compare larger (cooperative) and smaller (single parcel) AD conversion plants. The whole process is modeled: from the collection of manures, to the cultivation of energy crops, to the disposal of the digestate. The model maximizes the energy produced on the basis of available biomass, road network, local heat demand and local availability of land for digestate disposal. Results are the optimal size and location of the plants, their technology and collection basins. The environmental performances of such plants are also evaluated.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{quantification}} of methane emissions from Arctic wetlands and lakes, an integrated modeling framework was developed. It includes a newly developed process-based lake biogeochemical model and a widely used 4 -D VAR inversion algorithm implemented with the nested grid high-resolution GEOS-Chem Adjoint model. ^ The new process-based lake biogeochemical model includes {{the processes of}} methane production, oxidation and transport within a one-dimensional sediment and water column. The model is validated using observational data from five lakes located in Siberia and Alaska, representing a large variety of environmental conditions in the Arctic. The modeled lake temperature, dissolved methane concentration and methane fluxes agree well with the observations. It is found that bubbling-rate-controlling <b>nitrogen</b> <b>stripping</b> {{is the most important}} factor in determining methane fraction in bubbles. Lake depth and ice cover thickness in shallow waters are also controlling factors. It demonstrates that the thawing of Pleistocene-aged organic-rich ice complex (yedoma) fuels sediment methanogenesis by supplying a large amount of labile organic carbon, resulting in high methane effluxes at thermokarst margins of yedoma lakes. ^ By using the developed process-based lake biogeochemical model with geographical datasets, it is estimated that the annual mean methane emissions from Arctic lakes are on average 11. 86 Tg yr- 1 during 2004 - 2009, which is in the range of the recent estimates of 7. 1 - 17. 3 Tg yr- 1 and is on the same order of the methane emissions from northern high-latitude wetlands. The methane emission rate varies spatially over high latitudes from 110. 8 mg CH 4 m- 2 day- 1 in Alaska to 12. 7 mg CH 4 m- 2 day- 1 in northern Europe. Under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2. 6 and 8. 5 future climate scenarios, when assuming the distribution of lakes unchanged, the methane emissions from Arctic lakes will increase by 10. 3 and 16. 2 Tg CH 4 yr- 1, respectively, by the end of the 21 st century. ^ By adapting a region-specific landscape evolution model to a pan-Arctic scale, the evolution of thaw lakes in the Arctic can be simulated. The simulations show that the extent of thaw lakes expands throughout the century in the northern areas of the pan-Arctic where the reworking of epigenetic ice in drained lake basins will continue. Coupling with the developed process-based lake biogeochemical model, it is projected that the methane emissions from Arctic lakes by 2100 are 28. 3 ± 4. 5 Tg CH 4 yr- 1 under RCP 2. 6 and 32. 7 ± 5. 2 Tg CH 4 yr- 1 under RCP 8. 5, which are about 2. 5 and 2. 9 times of the simulated present-day emissions. Most of the emitted CH 4 originates from non-permafrost carbon stock. For permafrost carbon, the cumulative amount mineralized via methanogenesis is projected to be 3. 4 ± 0. 8 Pg C under the weak warming condition and 3. 9 ± 0. 9 Pg C under the strong warming condition. Although the lost permafrost carbon represents a small fraction of the global soil carbon pool, the increased CH 4 emissions from pan-Arctic lakes could raise global atmospheric CH 4 concentrations as large as 69 ppb. ^ To constrain Arctic methane fluxes, a nested-grid high-resolution inverse model in the Arctic domain is used to assimilate both high-precision surface measurements and high-volume satellite measurements. The global inversions indicate that the total methane fluxes and individual wetland source are in the range of 496. 4 – 511. 5 Tg yr- 1 and of 130. 0 – 203. 3 Tg yr- 1, respectively, which are consistent with the other estimates. The estimated Arctic methane fluxes are in the range of 8. 8 – 20. 4 Tg yr- 1. The optimized methane fluxes from Arctic lakes are ∼ 7. 6 Tg yr- 1, a significant amount to the Arctic methane cycle. The global and Arctic inversions of methane mixing ratio in boundary layer and free troposphere are compared well with the observed data. ...|$|E
40|$|Single tank {{aeration}} systems {{operated in}} batch mode or sequential batch reactors based on intermittent aeration are generally applied for swine manure treatment {{in order to reduce}} nutrient content and odor. This study evaluated the feasibility of aerobic biological treatment conducted in a serial arrangement of continuously fed aerated tank reactors configuration with swine slurry on a pilot-scale. Compared to municipal wastewater treatment swine slurry rich in nutrients and solids requires different treatment standards for the applied methods to be economically and ecologically relevant. This study presents a sequential process scheme, in which biological treatment serves as a means of achieving a pH raise.

40|$|AbstractLiquid–air {{partition}} coefficients (Henry's law constants, HLCs) of eight flavour compounds (volatile organic compounds, VOCs) were determined in water, over a temperature range of 4 °C to 85 °C. The HLCs were derived by using <b>nitrogen</b> to <b>strip</b> a dilute solution of a VOC and then determining {{the decrease in}} concentration of the VOC in real-time in the stripped gas using proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). This approach provided HLCs of improved accuracy (small 95 % standard deviation) over a large temperature range, especially for low volatility VOCs (HLC> 2 mol/(m 3 Pa)). The outstanding features of this approach are: (i) it is applicable for VOCs over a large range of volatility; (ii) {{it can be used}} over a wide temperature range (4 °C to 85 °C); (iii) it is automated (high-throughput); (iv) it does not require calibration or knowledge of the initial concentration of the analyte; and (v) the experimental temperature can be controlled very precisely (ΔT better than ± 0. 1 °C). The eight flavour compounds analysed in water were: (E) -β-damascenone, 2, 3 -butanedione, 2 -ethyl- 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, 2 -methylfuran, 3 -methylbutanal, acetaldehyde, ethyl- 3 -methyl butanoate and guaiacol. Based on the measured HLCs at five fixed temperatures (4 °C, 25 °C, 45 °C, 65 °C and 85 °C), accurate non-linear analytical expressions for the temperature dependence of HLCs were derived, which were then used to calculate thermodynamic constants...|$|R
40|$|Using both {{experiments}} and modeling it is shown how an optimal reactor design is beneficial {{for the production}} of hydrogen via aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol. The experiments reveal an inhibiting effect of hydrogen pressure on the reforming rate, while the yield to side products slightly increases with increasing hydrogen pressure. Addition of nitrogen as inert gas results in a decrease of this inhibiting effect due to a decrease of the hydrogen pressure in the gas phase and to an increase of the liquid-gas mass transfer rate. We have developed a comprehensive reactor model that successfully predicts the experimental observation at lower residence times (and low hydrogen pressures) but overestimates the actual hydrogen yields at higher residence times. According to this model, a high mass transfer from the active sites to the gas phase aids hydrogen removal from the catalyst surface and results in a remarkable increase of the hydrogen yield. The addition of <b>nitrogen</b> as <b>stripping</b> gas is also beneficial. The model predicts a sharp decrease of the hydrogen yield as the pressure increases, while nitrogen co-feeding reduces such effect. The addition of nitrogen is an effective approach to reduce the inhibiting effect of hydrogen, even though the increase of TOFH 2 levels off as the gas to liquid ratio increases. From a reactor engineering point of view, the increase of the mass transfer rate is an even more attractive approach. This can be achieved, for example, in a microchannel reactor within the Taylor flow regime...|$|R

Improving the quality and diversity of possible searches is a prerequisite for the improvement of services provided by the CC to its user community. One of them concerns the scope of the databases and the metrics on the taxonomic diversity of the CC’s holdings; metadata that is needed to facilitate user searches. The search strings can be simple queries based on the type of strains, the name of the authors who described them or simply by, the isolator of the strain, the depositor, the year of description, the location of isolation, the substrate of isolation, etc. Notably, such simple search queries are rarely implemented in online databases. More complex searches could be used to mine metadata for interesting and novel properties from CC databases that cover temperature growth, ability to assimilate substrates like carbon sources (as found in API® <b>strips),</b> <b>nitrogen</b> sources, ability to ferment various substrates, or specific growth characteristics (thermophily, psychrophily, alcaliphily, aerobic/anaerobic growth, etc.) (Vasilenko et al. 2011).

40|$|Abstract To date, methane {{emissions}} from lakes in the pan-arctic region are poorly quantified. In order {{to investigate the}} response of methane {{emissions from}} this region to global warming, a process-based climate-sensitive lake biogeochemical model was developed. The processes of methane production, oxidation, and transport were modeled within a one-dimensional sediment and water column. The sizes of 14 C-enriched and 14 C-depleted carbon pools were explicitly parameterized. The model was validated using observational data from five lakes located in Siberia and Alaska, representing a large variety of environmen-tal conditions in the arctic. The model simulations agreed well with the measured water temperature and dissolved CH 4 concentration (mean error less than 1 C and 0. 2 lM, respectively). The modeled CH 4 fluxes were consistent with observations in these lakes. We found that bubbling-rate-controlling <b>nitrogen</b> (N 2) <b>stripping</b> {{was the most important}} factor in determining CH 4 fraction in bubbles. Lake depth and ice cover thickness in shallow waters were also controlling factors. This study demonstrated that the thawing of Pleistocene-aged organic-rich yedoma can fuel sediment methanogenesis by supplying a large quantity of labile organic carbon. Observations and modeling results both confirmed that methane emission rate at thermokarst margins of yedoma lakes was much larger (up to 538 mg CH 4 m 22 d 21) than that at nonther-mokarst zones in the same lakes and a nonyedoma, nonthermokarst lake (less than 42 mg CH 4 m 22 d 21). The seasonal variability of methane emissions can be explained primarily by energy input and organic carbon availability. 1...|$|R

Hillslope plots receiving granular inorganic fertilizer, liquid cattle slurry and solid cattle manure (FYM) were compared using rainfall simulation for 4 storms on consecutive days at 22 mm h- 1 and 35 minutes duration. The plots were hydrologically isolated in a randomized block layout of 4 treatments × 3 replicates and measured 30 × 5 m; the upper 20 m received either fertilizer, slurry or FYM, while the lower 10 m acted as an unfertilized grass buffer <b>strip.</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> and P export in surface runoff from grassland receiving inorganic fertilizer exceeded that from FYM or slurry treatments; concentrations up to 46 mgN 1 [...] 1 and 15 mgP 1 – 1 were recorded.

30|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is generally}} considered {{as one of the}} most sustainable technologies for the production of renewable energy. The main bottleneck of the digestion process is the rather low conversion efficiency of organic material which is partly due to the accumulation of ammonia/ammonium. This nitrogen issue can thus be avoided by removing the ammonium present in the digestate by means of a stripping and scrubbing process. In this study, a self-developed laboratory-scale setup for stripping and scrubbing was developed and applied on a thermophilic digestate from a potato processor. This easily built system can be used to study stripping and scrubbing of any digestate. Our digestion experiments have demonstrated that after 8  days of incubation, the biogas yield is 36 % higher after removal of the ammonium from the digestate compared to the untreated digestate. This proves the inhibitory effect of ammonium at a concentration of 2.3  g L− 1 NH 4 +–N for this particular digestate. In addition, the stripping and scrubbing process ensures that ammonium is removed from the digestate and recovered in the form of (NH 4) 2 SO 4, which can act as <b>nitrogen</b> fertilizer. The <b>stripping</b> and scrubbing process was investigated with three different combinations of two types of commonly used laboratory fractionating columns, namely a Vigreux column and a Dufton column for their gas–liquid partition potential. Without optimizing for ammonium removal, the column combination Vigreux (for the stripping part)—Dufton (for the scrubbing part) could remove 87 % of the ammonium from the supernatant (obtained after centrifugation of the digestate), while simultaneously 90 % of the stripped ammonium was recovered as (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The overall efficiency for the nitrogen recovery is thus almost 80 %.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the outcomes of}} the first of four phases of a research project which aims to investigate the optimal integration of novel, yet largely already demonstrated technologies, in water recycling process train options. The research project has a particular focus on the minimisation of environmental and economic costs in the implementation and operation of the overall recycling process. In the Phase 1 desktop study, novel carbon and nitrogen removal technologies were selected through multi-criteria analysis and incorporated into two concept stage integrated treatment train options. The first treatment train option includes a main-stream anaerobic membrane bioreactor, followed by soluble methane <b>stripping.</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> removal is then achieved with a nitritation/Anammox moving bed biofilm reactor. The second alternative treatment train utilises a high rate/solids contact activated sludge system, with the separated excess biomass treated in a two-stage high-rate anaerobic sludge digester. The digested biosolids stream is treated separately to recover nutrients (as struvite) and to remove nitrogen with a nitritation/Anammox process. Further mainstream nitrogen removal is achieved with a nitrification/denitrification process in a sequencing batch reactor configuration. The two alternative treatment trains were compared to a typical existing treatment train for economics and environmental footprint under Australian conditions at two scales; 10 and 100 ML/d average flow. Engineering analysis included high-level concept design and sizing, estimates of performance, assessment of environmental footprint and whole-of-life cost estimates (including capital and operating expenses). The results of the study indicated that the new treatment trains have the potential to significantly decrease the economic costs of wastewater treatment by between 10 and 46 % (based on Net Present Value estimates), and have a lower environmental impact.

40|$|The Aerospace Industry has {{endeavored}} {{for decades}} to develop hybrid materials that withstand the rigors of mechanized flight both within our atmosphere and beyond. The development of these high performance materials {{has led to the}} need for environmentally friendly technologies for material re-work and removal. The NitroJet(TM) is a fluid jet technology that represents an evolution of the widely used, large-scale water jet fluid jet technology. It involves the amalgamation of fluid jet technology and cryogenics technology to create a new capability that is applicable where water jet or abrasive jet (water jet plus entrained abrasive) are not suitable or acceptable because of technical constraints such as process or materials compatibility, environmental concerns and aesthetic or legal requirements. The NitroJet(TM) uses ultra high-pressure nitrogen to cut materials, strip numerous types of coatings such as paint or powder coating, clean surfaces and profile metals. Liquid nitrogen (LN 2) is used as the feed stream and is pressurized in two stages. The first stage pressurizes sub cooled LN 2 to an intermediate pressure of between 15, 000 and 20, 000 psi at which point the temperature of the LN 2 is about - 250 F. The discharge from this stage is then introduced as feed to a dual intensifier system, which boosts the pressure from 15, 000 - 20, 000 psi up to the maximum operating pressure of 55, 000 psi. A temperature of about - 220 F is achieved at which point the nitrogen is supercritical. In this condition the <b>nitrogen</b> cuts, <b>strips</b> and abrades much like ultra high-pressure water would but without any residual liquid to collect, remove or be contaminated. Once the nitrogen has performed its function it harmlessly flashes back into the atmosphere as pure nitrogen gas. The system uses heat exchangers to control and modify the temperature of the various intake and discharge nitrogen streams. Since the system is hydraulically operated, discharge pressures can be easily varied over a very wide range providing considerable flexibility for various operations. The NitroJet(TM) is an advance on the nitrogen fluid jet technology initially developed at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho. NitroCision(R) first introduced the NitroJet(TM) into a commercial setting in 2003 and there has been considerable interest from many diverse sectors of government and industry since then. While the current system is an industrial system with the size and mass normally associated with industrial applications, a smaller system that is much more compact is being contemplated for those applications that do not need the full capabilities of the larger system.

The excellent mass transfer of hydrogen in the microchannel reactor operated under the Taylor flow regime by co-feeding <b>nitrogen</b> gas as <b>stripping</b> agent is highly beneficial for the selectivity to hydrogen. Nevertheless, the overall reaction rate is kinetically limited. Thus, more reactive conditions are needed to increase the productivity of hydrogen. The Pt–Ru bimetallic catalyst increases the catalytic activity by a factor of 2 – 3. However, in a reference case (with no hydrogen stripping), the Pt–Ru bimetallic catalyst resulted in a decrease of the hydrogen selectivity by a factor of 3 with respect to the reference monometallic Pt, leading to a nearly neutral effect in the productivity of hydrogen. By operating the Pt–Ru-washcoated microchannel reactor under the Taylor flow regime with simultaneous hydrogen production and hydrogen stripping we were able to maintain the benefits in catalyst activity while the selectivity to hydrogen was greatly increased with respect to the reference case with no stripping. The combined effect of a more active catalyst with the benefits of this reactor configuration in terms of selectivity led to an overall increase of the hydrogen production rate from 0. 2 to 6. 6 min- 1. Increasing the reaction temperature from 220 to 240 °C in this reactor configuration resulted in a further increase in the conversion of sorbitol and a mild increase in the selectivity to hydrogen (from 30 to 70 % and from 35 to 39 % respectively). The use of hydrogen stripping was essential to combine high activities and high selectivities. Increasing the nitrogen flow ratio with constant liquid flow rate was beneficial for the sorbitol conversion and the selectivity to hydrogen. The increase in sorbitol conversion reaches a saturation point at a gas to liquid ratio of ca. 1 mN 23 /mliq 3, while the selectivity to hydrogen continuously increases in the range of 0 – 2 mN 23 /mliq 3. This reactor configuration allows operating under more reactive conditions (i. e. more reactive catalyst and higher reaction temperatures) without significant loss in hydrogen selectivity...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is {{a common}} method of treating sewage sludge; however the anaerobic digestate liquor (ADL) contains high nutrient levels {{that have to be}} treated. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether microalgae could be used to <b>strip</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (N) and phosphorous (P) from ADL produced at Bran Sands sewage treatment works (STW); whether the ADL contained toxins and/or missing nutrients; and identify the spatial and temporal parameters of a potential bioremediation system. ADL was collected from Bran Sands STW and Scenedesmus obliquus was grown on various dilutions of ADL at laboratory scale. It was found that microalgae grown on the ADL was dually inhibited by high ammonia (NH 3) concentrations and limited trace element availability. Trace element limitation decreased the microalgae biomass productivity to 1 / 3 of cultures with trace element supplementation. It was also found that NH 3 concentrations > 17 - 23 mg/l NH 3 -N completely inhibited growth. A long time lag observed in 10 % ADL solutions was found to be due to the pH decreasing in ADL flasks over time (from 9. 30 to 8. 60), leading to a decrease in NH 3 concentration until the toxicity threshold was crossed (approximately 20 mg/l NH 3 -N at pH 8. 80), after which exponential growth occurred. Using 17. 62 mg/l NH 3 -N as an inhibition threshold, it was calculated that the highest concentration of total ammonia nitrogen TAN that could be remediated at pH 7. 0 was 400 mg/l TAN (a 3. 75 × dilution of neat ADL). Based on observed growth and nutrient uptake rates, it was further calculated that a microalgae remediation system could strip 400 mg/l TAN from the ADL within 5. 66 days. If growth conditions were optimized and the growth rate could be increased to > 1. 0 d- 1 (reported by Ho et al. (2010)) the remediation time could be reduced to 3. 31 days (although this does not consider other growth-limiting factors such as light inhibition). Due to fluctuating N:P ratios it was not possible to calculate predicted P uptake...|$|R
40|$|The Team {{has been}} {{contracted}} by Mordor Oil to plan, design, {{and evaluate the}} feasibility of an early production facility (EPF) in Batman, Turkey that will produce 10, 000 barrels per day (BPD) of crude oil that meets industry standards. The 10, 000 BPD is split evenly between two types of crude: heavy and light. The heavy crude has the following inlet conditions: it will produce 1, 000 BPD of water, has an American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity of 16 degrees, a gas/oil ratio (GOR) of 150, a delivery temperature range of 20 - 30 degrees Celsius, a delivery pressure range of 250 to 450 psia, 13 % H 2 S in the gas phase, and a high salt content. The light crude has the following inlet conditions: it will produce 1, 000 BPD of water, has an API gravity of 37 degrees, a GOR of 600, a delivery temperature range of 18 to 40 degrees Celsius, a delivery pressure range of 250 to 700 psia, 23 % H 2 S in the gas phase, and a high salt content. Despite the differing inlet conditions, the product sales specifications are the same: a basic sediment and water (BS&W) content of less than 0. 5 weight percent, a relative vapor pressure (RVP) of less than 10 psia, an H 2 S concentration of less than 20 ppm, a salt concentration of less than 10 pounds per barrel (PTB), and an overall sulfur concentration of less than 2 weight percent. In order to achieve these specifications, the Team designed two processes that run in parallel, meaning that the light and heavy crudes remain separate. Within the process, the crude encounters a phase separator to extract the free flowing water and natural gas that enters from the well, two electrostatic coalescers (ECs) in series to remove emulsified water and salts, and a stripping tower to absorb hydrogen sulfide into nitrogen gas. Between these major pieces of equipment, additional features like heaters, mixers, valves, and flares are used to reduce the viscosity of the oil, mix in freshwater, control pressure drops, and burn excess gases, respectively. Wastewater is piped off site to a wastewater treatment facility and then returns to the facility as process water. The <b>nitrogen</b> used to <b>strip</b> hydrogen sulfide is produced via a nitrogen generation process. Because this is a grassroots plant, the Team also included designs for housing, office space and a cafeteria. Each piece of equipment is designed and optimized...|$|R
