5|$|Hugh Bradner (November 5, 1915 – May 5, 2008) was an American {{physicist}} at the University of California who {{is credited with}} inventing the <b>neoprene</b> wetsuit, which helped to revolutionize scuba diving.|$|E
5|$|Polonium and its {{compounds}} must {{be handled}} in a glove box, which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. <b>Neoprene</b> gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to <b>neoprene</b> rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E
5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the <b>neoprene</b> in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, several U.S. Navy {{submarines}} {{were forced}} back to base to repair {{damage caused by}} cookiecutter shark bites to the <b>neoprene</b> boots of their AN/BQR-19 sonar domes, which caused the sound-transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation. An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared, before this shark was identified as the culprit, and the problem was solved by installing fiberglass covers around the domes. In the 1980s, some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites, mostly to the rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones. Again, the solution was to apply a fiberglass coating. Oceanographic equipment and telecommunications cables have also been damaged by this species.|$|E
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and <b>neoprene</b> pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, particular the woofer. Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from <b>neoprene</b> to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{with high}} {{durometer}} <b>neoprene</b> pads. Sometimes both basket-weave and <b>neoprene</b> pads are used.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} is crushed or compressed foam <b>neoprene,</b> {{which is less}} susceptible to volume changes when under pressure. Crushed <b>neoprene</b> is foam <b>neoprene</b> which has been hydrostatically compressed {{so much that the}} gas bubbles have been mostly eliminated, this retains the elasticity of foamed <b>neoprene</b> which allows freedom of movement, but does not provide much insulation, and is functionally more like a membrane suit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neoprene</b> drysuits have {{a similar}} {{construction}} to wetsuits; these are often considerably thicker (7–8mm) and have sufficient inherent insulation to allow a lighter-weight undersuit (or none at all); however on deeper dives the <b>neoprene</b> can compress to as little as 2mm, losing some of its insulation. Compressed or crushed <b>neoprene</b> may also be used (where the <b>neoprene</b> is pre-compressed to 2–3mm) which avoids the variation of insulating properties with depth. These drysuits function more like a membrane suit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neoprene</b> {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} a foam-rubber sheet {{containing}} tiny air bubbles, which provide insulation by themselves, and can {{eliminate the need for}} an under-suit, or greatly reduce the thickness needed for the under-fabric, but the bubbles in the <b>neoprene</b> are compressed and the insulation of the suit decreases with depth {{in the same way as}} for a wetsuit. Crushed <b>neoprene</b> provides the flexibility of <b>neoprene</b> with the consistent buoyancy and insulation of membrane suits. A <b>neoprene</b> wet suit can also be worn under a membrane dry suit for extra protection against condensation and leaks, but it will compress with depth as will any closed cell suit.|$|E
25|$|The <b>neoprene</b> pads used in sprung floors may be {{described}} as having open cells or closed cells. A cell is a void inside the <b>neoprene,</b> which may be a single cell or a network of small ones.|$|E
25|$|In October 2015, DuPont {{sold the}} <b>Neoprene</b> {{chloroprene}} rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, {{a joint venture}} of Denka and Mitsui.|$|E
25|$|The {{main part}} of the dry suit is a {{waterproof}} shell made from a membrane type material, foamed <b>neoprene</b> or a hybrid of both.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the company}} {{pleaded guilty to}} fixing prices of {{chemicals}} and products that used <b>neoprene,</b> a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.|$|E
25|$|PCBs readily {{penetrate}} skin, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and latex (natural rubber). PCB-resistant materials include Viton, polyethylene, {{polyvinyl acetate}} (PVA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, and <b>Neoprene.</b>|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} mainly {{depend on}} the material of the shell. Most suit shells are currently assembled by stitching the seams, which {{in the case of}} <b>neoprene</b> suits are first butt-glued, and are then overlock stitched and waterproofed by glued seam tape. DUI use a liquid polyurethane sealing compound over the seams {{on the inside of the}} suit instead of tape, and the rubber-coated Viking suits are dipped and heat cured for a seamless waterproof layer. DUI crushed <b>neoprene</b> suit shells are assembled before crushing the bubbles by hydrostatic pressure, then adding seals, zippers and accessories.|$|E
25|$|The list of {{synthetic}} polymers includes synthetic rubber, phenol formaldehyde resin (or Bakelite), <b>neoprene,</b> nylon, polyvinyl chloride (PVC or vinyl), polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, PVB, silicone, and many more.|$|E
25|$|In rubber manufacture, salt {{is used to}} make buna, <b>neoprene</b> {{and white}} rubber types. Salt brine and sulfuric acid are used to {{coagulate}} an emulsified latex made from chlorinated butadiene.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commercial}} diving {{dry suits}} have heavy duty integral boots. Sport diving suits may have lightweight integral boots or soft <b>neoprene</b> booties. Rock boots or heavy working boots {{may also be}} worn over integral <b>neoprene</b> or latex socks. Boots which are stiff at the ankle make finning inefficient and are unsuitable for many diving applications where mobility is important. If the suit will be used by a diver who needs to fin efficiently on some dives and to walk on sharp surfaces on other dives, it is more effective to wear boots suited to the dive over a dry suit with integral socks.|$|E
25|$|Both {{fabric and}} <b>neoprene</b> drysuits have {{advantages}} and disadvantages: a fabric drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, {{they are quite}} bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. Additionally, if a fabric drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses nearly all of its insulating properties. <b>Neoprene</b> drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits, {{but in some cases}} do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction is that even it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a wetsuit and will still provide a degree of insulation.|$|E
25|$|Dry {{suits for}} {{recreational}} diving {{are made in}} both membrane and <b>neoprene,</b> and primarily differ from surface dry suits in that they have inflation and deflation air valves to maintain neutral buoyancy, and may be slightly more durable.|$|E
25|$|Wetsuits {{are limited}} {{in their ability to}} {{preserve}} warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating <b>neoprene</b> can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7mm, 5mm, 3mm, and 1mm. A 1mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of <b>neoprene,</b> to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of <b>neoprene</b> are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.|$|E
25|$|In general, butyl, polysulfide, polyurethane, {{and other}} {{inorganic}} or rubber-based sealants are reasonably compatible with copper. Acrylic, <b>neoprene,</b> and nitrile-based sealants actively corrode copper. Silicone sealants are somewhat successful with copper but their suitability should be verified before application.|$|E
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} used for windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, water skiing and other surface water sports where the user is {{frequently}} immersed in cold water. These suits are often made from very lightweight material for high flexibility. Membrane type suits are commonly used {{in the spring and}} autumn with moderate water temperatures, but <b>Neoprene</b> and hybrid dry suits for surface sports are preferred in cold water. These provide greater thermal protection {{in the event of a}} leak. The ability to swim for self-rescue in these types of suits is important to water sports users that do not use a boat. A <b>neoprene</b> bottom also is less likely to allow trapped air to collect in the legs, causing the wearer to tend to float head down in the water.|$|E
25|$|Automotive {{conductors}} require insulation that is {{resistant to}} elevated temperatures, petroleum products, humidity, fire, and chemicals. PVC, <b>neoprene,</b> and polyethylene {{are the most}} common insulators. Potentials range from 12 V for electrical systems to between 300 V - 15,000 V for instruments, lighting, and ignition systems.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, DuPont {{developed}} many polymers such as Vespel, <b>neoprene,</b> nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, {{and later}} more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.|$|E
25|$|A wetsuit is a garment, {{usually made}} of foamed <b>neoprene,</b> which {{provides}} thermal insulation, abrasion resistance and buoyancy. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce {{its ability to}} conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water.|$|E
25|$|THF is {{considered}} a relatively nontoxic solvent, with the median lethal dose (LD50) comparable to that for acetone. Reflecting its remarkable solvent properties, it penetrates the skin, causing rapid dehydration. THF readily dissolves latex and is typically handled with nitrile or <b>neoprene</b> rubber gloves. It is highly flammable.|$|E
25|$|Carothers was a {{group leader}} at the DuPont Experimental Station laboratory, near Wilmington, Delaware, where most polymer {{research}} was done. Carothers was an organic chemist who, in addition to first developing nylon, also helped {{lay the groundwork for}} <b>neoprene.</b> After receiving his Ph.D., he taught at several universities before he was hired by DuPont to work on fundamental research.|$|E
25|$|Because DMSO easily penetrates the skin, {{substances}} {{dissolved in}} DMSO may be quickly absorbed. Glove selection is important {{when working with}} DMSO. Butyl rubber, fluoroelastomer, <b>neoprene,</b> or thick (15 mil) latex gloves are recommended. Nitrile gloves, which are very commonly used in chemical laboratories, may protect from brief contact but {{have been found to}} degrade rapidly with exposure to DMSO.|$|E
25|$|Gloves {{are made}} of {{materials}} including cloth, knitted or felted wool, leather, rubber, latex, <b>neoprene,</b> and metal (as in mail). Gloves of kevlar protect the wearer from cuts. Gloves and gauntlets are integral components of pressure suits and spacesuits such as the Apollo/Skylab A7L which went to the moon. Spacesuit gloves combine toughness and environmental protection {{with a degree of}} sensitivity and flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Rio de Janeiro Designer Triya {{created a}} rigid metal bandeau top that looked {{a cast of}} the model's chest. Designer Laura Jane created bikinis made of <b>neoprene,</b> the rubber {{material}} used to make wetsuits, in 1989. Fernando Garcia, a bikini designer in South Beach, Miami, turns various exotic material into bikinis including blacklight paint, python skin, Mongolian lamb fringe and black fox material.|$|E
25|$|Seals at {{the wrists}} and neck prevent water {{entering}} the suit by a close contact fit against {{the skin around}} the wrists and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due to sweat and condensation. The seals are typically made from latex rubber or foam <b>neoprene,</b> but are also available in silicone rubber. Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. <b>Neoprene</b> seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter {{because they do not}} seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.|$|E
25|$|Historical uses of {{hydrogen}} chloride in the 20th century include hydrochlorinations of alkynes in producing the chlorinated monomers chloroprene and vinyl chloride, which are subsequently polymerized to make polychloroprene (<b>Neoprene)</b> and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), respectively. In {{the production of}} vinyl chloride, acetylene (C2H2) is hydrochlorinated by adding the HCl across the triple bond of the C2H2 molecule, turning the triple into a double bond, yielding vinyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|While rubber {{is still}} used in textile manufacturing, its low {{tenacity}} limits {{its use in}} lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned to <b>neoprene</b> (polymer of chloroprene), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, spandex (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.|$|E
