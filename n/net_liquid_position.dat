40|$|This paper applies Drift Flux {{theory for}} the first time to explore the {{relationship}} between the liquid and solids flow through fluidized beds in the context of desliming of dense minerals. At low solids fluxes the process is not flux curve constrained. Here continuity considerations indicate the <b>net</b> <b>liquid</b> flux through the lower bed is upwards, ideal for the removal of slimes from the underflow product. Moreover, the liquid split to the underflow is also lower, further reducing the slimes content of the underflow. At higher solids fluxes the <b>net</b> <b>liquid</b> flux becomes downwards and eventually the system becomes flux curve constrained. Under these circumstances slimes entrainment to the underflow increases significantly. In order to operate at these higher solids fluxes, and achieve efficient desliming, Split Fluidization should be used. Here additional fluidization liquid is added at a higher elevation, producing a <b>net</b> <b>liquid</b> flux in the upwards direction through the zone above the Split Fluidization entrance level. Desliming experiments covering a range of solids fluxes were conducted to investigate the effects of increasing solids flux and Split Fluidization. This study shows that a system of parallel inclined channels, a key feature of the Reflux Classifier, permits the introduction of this additional liquid while preventing the ultra fine product from being entrained to the overflow reject stream, thus permitting the efficient removal of slimes. Experiments were conducted using an iron ore feed with particles smaller than 0. 50 mm in diameter.

40|$|Private wealth {{holdings}} {{are likely}} to become an increasingly important determinant in the job exit decision of elderly workers. Net wealth may correlate with worker’s characteristics that also determine the exit out of a job. It is therefore important to include a rich set of observed characteristics in an empirical model for retirement in order to measure the (marginal) effect of wealth on the job exit rate. But even with a rich set of regressors, the question remains whether there are time-invariant unobservable worker’s characteristics that affect both net wealth and the job exit rate. We specify a simultaneous equations model for job exit transitions with multiple destinations, net wealth, and the initial labour market state. The job exit rates and the net wealth equation contain random effects. We allow for correlation between the random effects of job exit and net wealth, and the initial labour market state. As instruments for wealth, we use survey information that measures ‘shocks’, like shocks to the household’s financial situation during the previous year. Results show an upward bias in the effect of <b>net</b> <b>liquid</b> wealth on retirement, but a small bias and a positive causal effect if net total wealth (including housing equity and mortgage debt) is used.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This experimental study investigates the effects of inclination angle and fluid viscosity on zero <b>net</b> <b>liquid</b> flow (ZNLF). Predicting liquid holdup under ZNLF conditions is necessary in several types of petroleum industry operations. These include the estimation of bottomhole pressures in pumping oil wells, design and operation of gas-lifted wells, and the design of compact Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone (?GLCC) separators. The flow distribution coefficient, C[], draws special attention to the research because its behavior influences flow pattern transitions in multiphase flow and in ZNLF. Data was collected using a 2 -inch diameter, 10 -foot swiveling transparent pipe. A test matrix was constructed where a series of gas flow rates at low pressures were investigated for the following inclination angles: 90 ?, 70 ?, and 50 ?. These tests were repeated for all the angles for a fluid of 1, 40, and 124 cps. The results indicate a tendency of decreasing ZNLF liquid holdup as the inclination angle is lowered below 70 ? for higher viscosities. The trend suggests that the flow distribution coefficient, C[], varies with fluid viscosity and inclination angle, therefore affecting the liquid holdup in the pipe. A new model is proposed to take into account these factors and its performance estimates zero <b>net</b> <b>liquid</b> holdup with a 23 % maximum percentage error.

40|$|Unlike {{terrestrial}} applications where gravity <b>positions</b> <b>liquid</b> at the 'bottom' of the tank, {{the location}} of liquid propellant in spacecraft tanks is uncertain unless specific actions are taken or special features are built into the tank. Some mission events require knowledge of <b>liquid</b> <b>position</b> prior to a particular action: <b>liquid</b> must be <b>positioned</b> over the tank outlet prior to starting the main engines and must be {{moved away from the}} tank vent before vapor can be released overboard to reduce pressure. It may also be desirable to positively <b>position</b> <b>liquid</b> to improve propulsion system performance: moving liquid away from the tank walls will dramatically decrease the rate of heat transfer to the propellant, suppressing the boil-off rate, thereby reducing overall mission propellant requirements. The process of moving propellant to a desired position is referred to as propellant orientation or reorientation. Several techniques have been developed to positively position propellant in spacecraft tanks and each technique imposes additional requirements on vehicle design. Propulsive reorientation relies on small auxiliary thrusters to accelerate the tank. The inertia of the liquid causes it to collect in the aft-end of the tank if the acceleration is forward. This technique requires that additional thrusters be added to the vehicle, that additional propellant be carried in the vehicle, and that an additional operational maneuver be executed. Another technique uses Liquid Acquisition Devices (LAD's) to positively position propellants. These devices rely on surface tension to hold the liquid within special geometries (i. e. vanes, wire-mesh channels, start-baskets). While avoiding some of the penalties of propulsive orientation, this technique requires the addition of complicated hardware inside the propellant tank and performance for long duration missions is uncertain.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this work deals with the {{characterization}} of 12 commercially available sealing tapes for microtiter plates with regard to their oxygen and water vapor permeability. Special attention was given to the influence of the evaporation on the liquid temperature in the well. The results of the experimental analysis showed that three of the investigated sealing tapes do not permit oxygen transport and are therefore unsuitable for aerobic cultivation. With respect to water vapor permeability, the remaining sealing tapes exhibit vast differences. On average, the water loss was 40 % of the initial volume after 24 hours at 37 °C and 45 % humidity. This immense liquid loss led to differences of up to 3. 8 °C from to the desired temperature due to evaporative cooling. Accordingly, none of the 12 sealing tapes met the requirements of the user. To address this optimization potential, a mathematical model was developed. With the help of the model, it was shown that, contrary to oxygen supply, the evaporation rate is linearly dependent {{on the size of the}} diffusion area. A reduction of the diffusion area can therefore reduce evaporation without affecting oxygen transport. The second part focused on the development of a measurement technique for the quantitative, non-invasive detection of viscosity in shake flasks. The measurement technique is based on detecting the position of the rotating bulk liquid as it changes with respect to the direction of centrifugal acceleration dependent on the viscosity. It is possible to correlate this offset in the liquid motion with the viscosity. For non-invasive detection of the <b>liquid</b> <b>position,</b> a fluorescence as well as a transmission measurement were developed. To convert the information about the <b>liquid’s</b> <b>position</b> in the shake flask into a viscosity signal, a calibration was established using model fluids of known viscosity. The developed 8 -flask-device was validated by the cultivation of the bacteria Paenibacillus polymyxa and Xanthomonas campestris. The comparison of the online measurement technique with a conventional measurement on a rheometer showed that the viscosity can be measured with an accuracy of 3. 11 mPa·s ± 0. 6 mPa·s up to 120 mPa·s...|$|R
