5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Attack by the ant Crematogaster laeviuscula is {{different}} from attacks by birds. Rather than knocking down the nest, the ants swarm all over the <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> remove the brood from it. The ants destroy the entire brood but {{they are unable to}} kill the adults.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} {{are mostly}} silent but make high-pitched mewing or hissing notes at the <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> screeching noises when squabbling at a carcass. Young birds {{have been heard}} making a hissing croak in flight. They also hiss or growl when threatened or angry.|$|E

5|$|P. exclamans {{take several}} {{countermeasures}} against invasions. If the wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by. This will cause vibrations {{inside of the}} <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} parasite dance. This will continue for up to 10 hours after the moth has been detected. If the moth is found it will be eaten immediately. However, this is not likely to happen. The moth lays its eggs in the <b>nest,</b> <b>and</b> when they hatch, they will take over the nest. As a result, many wasp pupae are aborted. This is commonly seen in the late summer when the moth is most abundant.|$|E
5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{agree on}} a site for a <b>nest,</b> <b>and</b> both will defend the site. During this time, the male {{continues}} to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the common tern. It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.|$|E

5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest {{than it is in the}} primary <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|Vertebrate predators of bees include bee-eaters, shrikes and flycatchers, {{which make}} short sallies to catch insects in flight.

The greater honeyguide interacts with humans by guiding {{them to the}} nests of wild bees. The humans break open the <b>nests</b> <b>and</b> take the honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax.

5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, {{researchers found that}} mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E
5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the <b>nest,</b> <b>and</b> they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E

Using this result, <b>nested</b> <b>and</b> mutually recursive algorithms do no longer constitute a special problem and the existing methods for automated termination analysis can be extended to <b>nested</b> <b>and</b> mutual recursion in a straightforward way. We give some examples of algorithms whose termination can now be proved automatically (including well-known challenge problems such as McCarthy's f_ 91 function) ...|$|R

5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and for a similar period in {{artificial}} conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> overwinter to emerge the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Males {{tend to take}} tits, finches, sparrows and buntings; females {{often take}} thrushes and starlings. Larger quarry (such as doves and magpies) may not die {{immediately}} but succumb during feather plucking and eating. More than 120 bird species have been recorded as prey and individual Eurasian sparrowhawks may specialise in certain prey. The birds taken are usually adults or fledglings, though chicks in the <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> carrion are sometimes eaten. Small mammals, including bats, are sometimes caught but insects are eaten only very rarely.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a <b>nest</b> <b>and</b> fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E
