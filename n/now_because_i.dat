500|$|Larter {{appeared}} in Glamour along with fellow actresses Rachel Bilson and Diane Lane in 2007. When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get older, you get better.... Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

500|$|Although Belldandy {{was sent}} to grant Keiichi a wish and nothing more, Belldandy expresses many times that she has enjoyed her time with Keiichi and that her purpose is to make him happy. The {{contract}} really is an excuse for her to stay since her rival Marller, a first class demon, has stated that [...] "she can cancel a contract with a human anytime". Belldandy had then stated {{that she did not}} want to, because Keiichi was a special person in her heart. This was reinforced at the conclusion of chapter 39: with the [...] "System" [...] down, Belldandy's contract with Keiichi is effectively suspended, yet she chooses to stay because, as Fujishima has her explain in the manga, [...] "... I'm here <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> love you".|$|E
500|$|Fox Fisher (aka Raphael Fox) {{continued}} {{to work as a}} freelance screen printer and visual artist. In addition to their creative projects with Lewis and Sarah, Fox wrote a few pieces for The Huffington Post. Like Sarah, they felt a new creative freedom from transitioning: [...] "It's easier to make art <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel like I've got a huge chunk of my life out of the way." [...] In 2014, Fox spoke at TEDxBrighton, and was nominated for the alumnus award at the University of Brighton, where they were a Master of Arts student. Fox completed a Master's degree in Sequential Design and Illustration in 2015. In July 2017, the university granted them an honorary doctorate [...] "in recognition of their major contribution to raising the profile, both nationally and internationally, of issues affecting trans people and the promotion of arts in the media". Fox is active in the media as a trans spokesperson, consultant, actor, and filmmaker. He has spoken about trans issues on Good Morning Britain, Inside Out, and This Morning.|$|E
500|$|In February 1984, Genesis took a {{break in}} {{activity}} to allow each member to continue with their solo careers. Rutherford formed his group Mike + The Mechanics, Banks worked on his solo album Soundtracks, and Collins released No Jacket Required which achieved worldwide success and increased his popularity as a result. The music press took note that Collins' success as a solo artist made him more popular than Genesis. Before the release of No Jacket Required, Collins insisted {{that he would not}} leave the band. [...] "The next one to leave the band will finish it," [...] Collins told Rolling Stone magazine in May 1985. [...] "I feel happier with what we're doing <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel it's closer to me. I won't be the one." [...] Collins added, [...] "Poor old Genesis does get in the way sometimes. I still won't leave the group, but I imagine it will end by mutual consent." [...] In June, Collins spoke of the band's intention to start work on a new album that year, ending rumours to a false announcement that aired on BBC Radio 1 suggesting Genesis had split.|$|E

2500|$|To stay {{in shape}} {{to meet the demands}} of touring and public performing, Lightfoot works out in a gym six days per week, but {{declared}} in 2012 that he was [...] "fully prepared to go whenever I'm taken." [...] He calmly stated, [...] "I've been almost dead a couple times, once almost for real ...

2500|$|On December 19, Duty offered Wise some {{cigarettes}} {{in exchange for}} allowing himself to be tied up to make the guards think {{that he had been}} taken hostage, with the goal of having Duty transferred into administrative security. The prosecutor's report stated that after tying Wise's hands and feet behind his back, Duty strangled him to death with a shoelace. Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well {{by the time you get}} this letter you will already know that your son is dead. I know <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> just killed him an hour ago. Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 Strummer {{moved to}} Newport, Wales. He did not study at Newport College of Art but {{met up with}} college musicians in the Students' Union in Stow Hill and became vocalist for Flaming Youth, {{renaming}} the band the Vultures. b) The Vultures in time led to The 101ers, a group of West London-based squatters named after their squat address. The 101ers were eventually supported by a nascent Sex Pistols. [...] Mellor adopted the stage name of [...] "Joe Strummer". Impressed {{by the power of}} the Sex Pistols, the newly self-coined Strummer determined that the 101ers were [...] "yesterday's papers" [...] by comparison. It was time to strike out anew. And this led to the start of The Clash. [...] c) [...] "This is my Indian summer...I learnt that fame is an illusion & everything about it is just a joke. I'm far more dangerous <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't care at all." [...] – Joe Strummer to Chris Salewicz – 2000.|$|E

2500|$|A local admirer {{arranged}} {{for her to}} go to Nashville when she was 14 to audition for Capitol Records. In 1996, Capitol Records was preparing a contract for Underwood but canceled it when company management changed. Underwood said of the event, [...] "I honestly think it's a lot better that nothing came out of it <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't have been ready then. Everything has a way of working out." [...] While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball. Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian. She chose not to pursue singing after graduation.
