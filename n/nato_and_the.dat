This article discusses why Russia is reviving its conventional military power and argues these developments are not limited to the intention of preparing for offensive action. <b>NATO’s</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> West’s policy responses to recent changes in Russian defense policy need to be based on a realistic and nuanced understanding of Russian motivations because ill-considered responses could have serious unintended consequences...|$|R

The game is set during a fictional scenario in which the powers of <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw Pact engage in a conventional war throughout Europe, mostly centring in West and East Germany.|$|E
5|$|However, controversies over {{domestic}} reforms, Poland's 1999 {{entry into}} <b>NATO,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> accession process to the European Union, combined with AWS fights with its political allies (the Freedom Union—Unia Wolności) and infighting within AWS itself, {{as well as}} corruption, eventually resulted {{in the loss of}} much public support. AWS leader Marian Krzaklewski lost the 2000 presidential election, and in the 2001 parliamentary elections AWS failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament. After this debacle, Krzaklewski was replaced by Janusz Śniadek (in 2002) but the union decided to distance itself from politics.|$|E

5|$|The {{events leading}} up the {{stand-off}} between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw Pact are detailed in a pre-game text; Iran declares war on Iraq and subsequently invades the latter nation, whilst Egypt succumbs to a civil war and establishes Islamic law over the country, culminating in an Egyptian invasion of Israel. The events in the Middle East prompt the superpowers of the United States and the British Empire to intervene, leading up to a conventional war in Europe against the Eastern bloc. The game is set in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} by Russia was condemned by the United States, France, the {{secretary-general of the}} Council of Europe, {{the president of the}} Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the OSCE chairman, <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> G7 {{on the grounds that it}} violated Georgia's territorial integrity, United Nations Security Council resolutions and the ceasefire agreement.

In the early 1990s he proposed {{the creation of a}} sub-regional security system called NATO bis. The concept was supported by right-wing and populist movements in Poland but garnered little support abroad; Poland's neighbors, some of which (e.g. Lithuania), had recently regained independence and tended to see the proposal as Polish neo-imperialism.|$|E

5|$|After O'Grady {{was shot}} down, {{tensions}} increased greatly between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bosnian Serbs. A number of US commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes; however, the Serbs still held {{the majority of}} the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. The threat to the hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and the Serbs released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive for the next six days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending the calls for immediate offensive action. Shortly thereafter, the Serbs released the remaining hostages. As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).|$|E
5|$|As a {{case study}} of disinformation, the authors {{describe}} journalist , whose publication in France was secretly financed by Soviet intelligence. Its contents were biased against the Western world in favor of the Soviet agenda, and had considerable impact on public opinion. In another example, the authors bring forth an analysis of the World Peace Council, which operated as a front organization for Soviet intelligence. They discuss its operations negatively impacting both <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Shultz and Godson back up their analyses with interviews from two Soviet officials who had defected from their posts in Soviet intelligence, and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests.|$|E
5|$|British {{policy-makers}} regarded Portugal as {{a traditional}} friend—the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance dated back to 1386, and both countries were in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (<b>NATO)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Free Trade Association—but the combined strength of the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby in the United Nations forced the British to peel back {{their support for the}} pluricontinental Estado Novo ("New State") during the early 1960s. Portugal's Colonial War, starting in Angola in 1961, pitted it against a number of guerrilla factions in its African territories, most of which subscribed to communist political thinking. Britain opposed communist encroachment into southern Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly opposed general consensus at the UN, which roundly condemned colonialism in all forms and supported communist-backed insurgencies across the region, regarding them as racial liberation movements. It therefore attempted an awkward balancing act whereby it would appear to oppose Portugal without meaningfully doing so.|$|E

During his controversial tenure of ENI, Mattei had made many enemies. He tried to break the oligopoly of the 'Seven Sisters' (a term Mattei coined to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th century), and brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union {{in the middle of the}} Cold War over intense protests from <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> U.S. in 1959, while supporting independence movements against colonial powers such as Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{a rhetorical}} {{question}} – Is NATO losing and the Taliban winning? – Amrullah Saleh discusses the uncertainty among the Afghans about 2014 – when NATO ends its combat mission in Afghanistan. He then mentions Afghans’ {{perception that the}} US is funding {{both sides of the}} conflict because Pakistan remains the key country supporting the insurgency. Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns. He advocates for a surge in the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces. Amrullah Saleh highlights the importance of both training and equipment to ensure that cleared areas of Afghanistan are held, communication lines are kept open, and major population centers are defended.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutions of 1989 and the {{dissolution}} of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and their focus on the continent of Europe. This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after {{the dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in December 1991. At that time, European countries accounted for 34 percent of NATO's military spending; by 2012, this had fallen to 21 percent. NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Central and Eastern European nations, and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet leadership's {{policy towards}} the Eastern Bloc {{did not change}} much with Khrushchev's replacement, as the states of Eastern Europe were seen as a buffer zone {{essential}} to placing distance between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union's borders. The Brezhnev regime inherited a skeptical attitude towards reform policies which became more radical in tone following the Prague Spring in 1968. János Kádár, the leader of Hungary, initiated a couple of reforms similar to Alexei Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. The reform measures, named the New Economic Mechanism, were introduced in Hungary during Khrushchev's rule, and were protected by Kosygin in the post-Khrushchev era. Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalize the economy of Poland by borrowing money from the First World. The Soviet leadership approved both countries' respective economic experiments, since {{it was trying to}} reduce its large Eastern Bloc subsidy program in the form of cheap oil and gas exports.|$|E
5|$|The game is set {{during a}} fictional war in Europe between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw Pact, {{in which both}} sides use nuclear and {{chemical}} weapons against each other. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw Pact. The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces {{at the beginning of}} the game. The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark) whereas if the player sides with the Warsaw Pact, the game will begin in eastern Europe. The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions. Each side has a variety of units; infantry move at a slower pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units. The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.|$|E
