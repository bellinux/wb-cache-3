These polygons define a stratification of the space of polynomials of fixed degree. We determine the open stratum: we give the generic Newton polygon for polynomials of degree d≥ 2 when the characteristic p is greater than 3 d, and the Hasse polynomial, i. e. the equation defining the hypersurface complementary to the open stratum. Let k: = Fq be the finite field with q: = pm elements, and for any r ≥ 1, let kr denote its extension of degree r.

For sufficiently large p, we determine in both cases generic Newton polygons for these L-functions, which is a lower bound for the Newton polygons, and the set of polynomials of degree e for which this generic polygon is attained. In the case of twisted sums, we show that the lower polygon defined in [1] is tight when p ≡ 1 [de], and that it is the actual Newton polygon for any degree e polynomial.

40|$|Abstract. Usual {{segmentation}} {{techniques of}} grayscale images depend on supervised trial-and-error procedures. Moreover, in noisy images, local classi¯cation schemes fail {{due to the}} random °uctuations introduced by the noise. Recent proposals as the active contours may be robust enough to cope with some cases of noisy images without supervision (except for the initialization step), but still fail with images with <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> noise that are common in remote sensing, SAR images and other cases. In this work we propose a di®erent approach to noisy image segmentation, based on fractal dimension classi¯cation. Instead of detecting local changes in the image grey level, a previous step of local fractal (box counting) dimension is applied. Histogram classi¯cation of this attribute of the image allows an adequate threshold detection. Therefore, the complete segmentation procedure is fully automatic. The segmentation results obtained with this classi¯cation procedure are remarkably robust, even with images with <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> noise. ...|$|R

In particular, the Multi Attribute Decision problem will be translated into different optimization problems, depending on the way the uncertainty is represented and, more important, if the monotonicity constraints need to be included or not...|$|R

The highlights of the new entropy are that it is bounded by finite limits {{and that it is}} <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> in nature. The <b>non</b> <b>additive</b> property of the proposed entropy makes it useful for the representation of information content in the non-extensive systems containing some degree of regularity or correlation. The effectiveness of the proposed entropy in representing the correlated random variables is demonstrated by applying it for the texture classification problem since textures found in nature are random {{and at the same time}} contain some degree of correlation or regularity at some scale. The gray level co-occurrence probabilities (GLCP) are used for computing the entropy function. The experimental results indicate high degree of the classification accuracy. The performance of the new entropy function is found superior to other forms of entropy such as Shannon, Renyi, Tsallis and Pal and Pal entropies on comparison. Using the feature based polar interaction maps (FBIM) the proposed entropy is shown to be the best measure among the entropies compared for representing the correlated textures...|$|R
