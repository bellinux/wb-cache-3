In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers, These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, {{the first}} highway {{designation}} along the current M-247 was assigned. That first number was M-111, which lasted until 1937 {{when all of}} M-111 became part of M-47. In early 1961, the roadway changed numbers once more. This time M-47 was realigned to a former section of US Highway 10 (US10), and the connection to the state park was assigned the M-247 designation. This was the highest highway <b>number</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, excluding Interstates, until the 1998 designation of M-553 in the Upper Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the same}} year Henry Moseley {{provided}} additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory. These results refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (atomic) <b>number</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table. Until these experiments, atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.|$|E

The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation.|$|E
