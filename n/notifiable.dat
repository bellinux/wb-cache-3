25|$|Despite Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a <b>notifiable</b> {{disease in}} Scotland since January 1990 which should {{therefore}} be reported {{on the basis of}} clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010.|$|E
25|$|Areas near {{suitable}} mosquito breeding grounds—marshes, wetlands, waterways {{and farms}} with irrigation systems—are high risk areas for outbreaks. As such, {{the disease is}} more characteristic of rural and regional areas. Infection is most common in adults aged 25–44 years old, with males and females equally affected. Ross River Fever is on the Australian Department of Health and Ageing's list of <b>notifiable</b> diseases.|$|E
25|$|However, in 2007, human {{infection}} {{with a novel}} influenzavirus A became a nationally <b>notifiable</b> condition. Novel influenza A virus infections include all human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human influenza H1 and H3 viruses. These viruses include those that are subtyped as nonhuman in origin {{and those that are}} unsubtypable with standard methods and reagents. The new strain responsible for this outbreak was one such virus.|$|E
25|$|After the {{establishment}} in the 1880s {{that the disease}} was contagious, TB was made a <b>notifiable</b> disease in Britain; there were campaigns to stop spitting in public places, and the infected poor were pressured to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons; the sanatoria for {{the middle and upper}} classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention. Whatever the purported benefits of the fresh air and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered were dead within five years (1916).|$|E
25|$|In January 2004, the Ministry of Health {{implemented}} the world's largest internet-based communicable-disease reporting system. This system addressed the delays and incomplete reporting of communicable diseases, which were most evident during the SARS epidemic, when governmental authorities could not quickly assess {{the extent of}} the epidemic. At the end of 2005, 93% of 19 716 health facilities at and above the county-level and 66% of 38 518 township-level health facilities were reporting the country's 37 <b>notifiable</b> diseases through this system. The mean length of time to report from a county-level health facility to the central level has been reduced from 29 days to 1 day.|$|E
25|$|Kilkenny {{is unique}} among the 32 Irish county {{associations}} in not {{participating in the}} All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. They played in the Tommy Murphy Cup a second tier competition for weaker footballing counties for {{four of the five}} years it was played. However, even in this competition they lost every game they played. Kilkenny entered the National Football League {{for the first time in}} years in 2008, and have not had any success losing every game bar one up to, and including, the 2011 competition. Kilkenny compete in the Leinster Junior Football Championship, their most <b>notifiable</b> win came in 2011, defeating Wexford 3-5 to 0-13. There is an excellent underage and adult club football structure in Kilkenny. Glenmore, Mullinavat, Railyard and Muckalee are the football strongholds. However the lure of county and club hurling championships deprives Kilkenny of its best footballers.|$|E
500|$|These {{controls}} proved ineffectual as {{the beetle}} soon reached Europe. In 1877, L. decemlineata reached the United Kingdom and was first recorded from Liverpool docks, {{but it did}} not become established. There have been many further outbreaks: the species has been eradicated in the UK at least 163 times. The last major outbreak was in 1976. It remains as a <b>notifiable</b> quarantine pest in the United Kingdom and is monitored by DEFRA [...] to prevent it from becoming established. A cost-benefit analysis from 1981 suggested that the cost of the measures used to exclude L. decemlineata from the UK was less than the likely costs of control if it became established.|$|E
500|$|Tuberculosis caused {{widespread}} {{public concern}} in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the disease became common among the urban poor. In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to [...] "consumption". By 1918, one in six deaths in France was still caused by TB. After TB {{was determined to be}} contagious, in the 1880s, it was put on a <b>notifiable</b> disease list in Britain; campaigns were started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were [...] "encouraged" [...] to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons (the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention). Whatever the benefits of the [...] "fresh air" [...] and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered died within five years (c. 1916). When the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913, its initial focus was tuberculosis research.|$|E
2500|$|Designated <b>notifiable</b> {{diseases}} {{under the}} Diseases of Animals Act include anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, fowl pest, bovine tuberculosis, BSE, scrapie, swine vesicular disease, Aujeszky's disease, bovine leukemia virus, rabies and warble fly. [...] Under the Zoonoses Order conditions {{that can be}} transmitted to humans, such as brucellosis or salmonella, must also be notified.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998-2011, {{there were}} 111,117 cases of {{coccidioidomycosis}} in the U.S. that were logged into the National <b>Notifiable</b> Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Since many U.S. {{states do not}} require reporting of coccidioidomycosis, the actual numbers can be higher. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called the disease a [...] "silent epidemic" [...] and acknowledged {{that there is no}} proven anticoccidioidal vaccine available. Studies done in the past show that the cost benefit of a vaccine is most notable among infants, teens, and immigrant adults, with negative cost-benefit results among older age groups.|$|E
2500|$|Tuberculosis {{is one of}} China's {{major public}} health problems. According to the 2015 WHO estimates, China has the world's third largest number of {{tuberculosis}} cases, behind only India and Indonesia, comprising around 10% of the world total. Of the 37 <b>notifiable</b> communicable diseases in China, tuberculosis ranks first in terms of notified cases and deaths. Despite the serious nature of this disease, the country's progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s and {{early part of the}} new millennium. The estimated proportion of new cases of sputum smear-positive tuberculosis that were diagnosed and treated by the public health program - a key indicator of efforts to control tuberculosis - had stagnated at around 30%, far below [...] the 70% target set by the WHO.|$|E
2500|$|The Food and Health Bureau of Hong Kong issued travel {{advice for}} Mexico on 26 April 2009, which advised Hong Kong {{residents}} not {{to travel to}} Mexico unless absolutely necessary. The first case reported was a Mexican who flew in from Shanghai. The most recent case (the tenth) {{was found in a}} 56-year-old American who had flown in from San Francisco. The Bureau also escalated the alert level from [...] "alert" [...] to [...] "serious" [...] on the same day, which activated health protection measures in all ports of entry of Hong Kong. As such, temperature screening machines are used at all checkpoints to identify passengers with fever and respiratory symptoms. Any passenger who fails the temperature test and confirmed having a fever will be quarantined and sent to public hospital for further investigation. Hong Kong also {{became one of the first}} jurisdictions to declare swine flu as a <b>notifiable</b> disease, and much of the procedures against the spread of the swine flu were learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak, of which Hong Kong was the epicenter of the outbreak.|$|E

Metropark Hotel Wanchai, where the patient stayed, was quarantined. After the first case was confirmed, Hong Kong's response level was raised from [...] "serious" [...] to [...] "emergency".|$|E
60|$|The {{steamboat}} was, if anything, {{a little}} {{ahead of the}} steam engine in its earlier phases. There was a steamboat, the Charlotte Dundas, on the Firth of Clyde Canal in 1802, and in 1807 an American {358} named Fulton had a steamer, the Clermont, with British-built engines, upon the Hudson River above New York. The first steamship to put to sea was also an American, the Phoenix, which went from New York (Hoboken) to Philadelphia. So, too, was the first ship using steam (she also had sails) to cross the Atlantic, the Savannah (1819). All these were paddle-wheel boats and paddle-wheel boats are not adapted to work in heavy seas. The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then disabled. The screw steamship followed rather slowly. Many difficulties had to be surmounted before the screw was a practicable thing. Not until the middle of the century did the tonnage of steamships upon the sea begin to overhaul that of sailing ships. After that the evolution in sea transport was rapid. For the first time men began to cross the seas and oceans with some certainty as to the date of their arrival. The transatlantic crossing, which had been an uncertain adventure of several weeks--which might stretch to months--was accelerated, until in 1910 it was brought down, {{in the case of the}} fastest boats, to under five days, with a practically <b>notifiable</b> hour of arrival.|$|E
50|$|In the past, <b>notifiable</b> {{diseases}} in the United States varied {{according to the}} laws of individual states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) also produced a list of nationally <b>notifiable</b> diseases that health officials should report to the CDC's National <b>Notifiable</b> Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). A uniform criterion for reporting diseases to the NNDSS was introduced in 1990.|$|E
50|$|Mandatory {{documents}} for a CDM project, include project notification, pre-construction information, construction phase plan {{and health and}} safety plan. Pre-construction information is required for all projects, while some form of the other documents must be produced for both <b>notifiable</b> and non-notifiable projects. Project notification is only needed for <b>notifiable</b> projects. The Construction Phase Plan is required on <b>notifiable</b> projects, but something similar is required on other projects to provide for effective health and safety management. The Health and Safety File must be produced by the CDM coordinator on <b>notifiable</b> projects. Existing Health and Safety files must be modified files for structures undergoing modifications. The client must establish related procedures. Even when a Health and Safety File is not required, as-built and operational and maintenance information are required.|$|E

50|$|A {{health and}} safety file (HSF) is {{required}} only on <b>notifiable</b> projects. However, if a {{health and safety}} file exists for a structure involved in a non-notifiable project, this file must be updated. The health and safety file contains information needed to allow safe construction. Scope, structure and format must be agreed between the client and the CDM coordinator at the outset. The client takes charge of the file upon project completion. On <b>notifiable</b> projects, contractors must promptly provide relevant information to the principal contractor. The pre-construction information covers contents, timing and format.|$|E
50|$|Under the 2007 Regulations {{appointments}} {{for similar}} roles were required for <b>notifiable</b> projects. The {{duty to notify}} now lies with a client and the threshold for notification is raised.|$|E
