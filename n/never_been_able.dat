Yukko lost her young {{daughter}} Nanako in the last war, and since then has spent all her time researching how to make a homunculus in human form, though has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to produce one that looks human. After the incident with Shiraasan, Yukko is finally able to accept her daughter's death and ceases to make more homunculi. Yukko sacrificed her slumber for her magic.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E

5|$|Renji {{also finds}} {{out that it is}} her dream to write a fantasy novel, but due to her {{condition}} has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to get far. Renji loves to read novels, and after discussing it with Chihiro, he collaborates with her to see if he can finally make her dream come true. Through the process of writing the novel, the two eventually become very close and they fall in love with each other. As the story progresses and more of the novel is written, Renji soon discovers that the novel is an allegory for Chihiro's life and how she sees the world around her due to the state of her limited memory.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} crew is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E
5|$|With Brescia, Baggio scored 46 {{goals in}} 101 {{appearances}} in all competitions, scoring 45 goals in 95 Serie A appearances, and one goal in two European matches. Baggio also made four Coppa Italia appearances with Brescia. Baggio retired as Brescia's all-time leading goalscorer in Serie A. He ended {{his career with}} 205 goals in Serie A, making him the seventh-highest scorer of all time, behind Silvio Piola, Francesco Totti (who overtook him in 2011), Gunnar Nordahl, Giuseppe Meazza, José Altafini and Antonio Di Natale (who overtook him in 2015). Baggio's number 10 shirt was retired by Brescia in his honour, and he is considered the club's greatest ever player. Before Baggio had joined Brescia, they had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to avoid relegation after being newly promoted to Serie A, in over 40 years. During the four years under Baggio, Brescia recorded their best ever Serie A run and were never relegated.|$|E

5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, Wavell {{ordered a}} plan covertly to {{encourage}} a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, which the Italians had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> entirely to repress {{after the end of}} the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance, known as the Arbegnoch. In June 1940, Haile Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005, Salzgeber's then-current Grand Prix mount, Wall Street, was euthanized {{following}} {{an episode of}} colic. This, combined with the recent retirement of Rusty, left her with no Grand Prix-level horses. Wall Street, while a relatively successful dressage horse, had suffered health problems and had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to compete with Rusty as Salzgeber's top horse. In 2008, Salzgeber again began competing at the Grand Prix level on Herzruf's Erbe, who would develop into one of her top international horses. In that year, the pair won the Otto Lorke Prize, given each year to the best German Grand Prix horse under 10 years old. During 2008, Salzgeber and Herzruf's Erbe had won 10 Grand Prix competitions. In 2009, the pair were expected to compete at the European Dressage Championships, but were not chosen for the German team after Herzruf's Erbe sustained an injury at a competition in July. The immediate diagnosis was a severely pulled tendon, although a later diagnosis was that the horse had strained a suspensory muscle, expected to heal in about three months. By early 2010, the horse was again able to be ridden, but was still not in top condition.|$|E
