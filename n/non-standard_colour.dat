50|$|The car cost £230 in 1919, but {{was reduced}} to £139 by 1925. It could attain 45 mph and could return 45 miles per gallon (imperial).Optional extras included: <b>non-standard</b> <b>colour</b> £5, {{speedometer}} £7, side curtains to hood completely enclosing the body £3.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of routes have {{retained}} their historical, <b>non-standard</b> <b>colour,</b> notably at Les Gorges d'Apremont (La bleue outremer = marine blue) and La Dame Jouanne (La mauve = purple). All the boulders used along a given route are marked the same colour. The difficulty of each individual move {{can be found in}} guidebooks.|$|E
50|$|Early in {{her first}} commission, Exeter had a {{turquoise}} hull on and below the waterline; this was an experimental co-polymer paint which was only available in a few <b>non-standard</b> <b>colours</b> at the time. The light-blue 'boot topping' visible on the waterline was eventually repainted to standard brick red/black during her first docking period, after the Falklands War.|$|R
50|$|The company {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} 88 buses, of which 48 are articulated buses, 35 are full-sized non-articulated buses, 3 are midibuses and 3 are minibuses. All buses are low-floored and have particulate filters. The standard livery is blue and grey, but buses used on the Rapperswil-Jona city bus network carry a red and grey scheme. Some buses carry <b>non-standard</b> <b>colours.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the U.K., {{despite its}} {{relatively}} long-lasting set of major parties, colours worn by parties {{have not always}} been constant. In some areas, <b>non-standard</b> <b>colours</b> were worn up to around the 1970s as a local tradition. This may have been for a variety of reasons, such as association of colours with leading families of the area and then the political parties they supported. Major political parties have now standardised on the colours used nationally, a trend accelerated by the arrival of colour television.|$|R
5000|$|When filmed, Olton Hall {{carried a}} [...] "Hogwarts Express" [...] {{headboard}} on the smokebox, featuring the Hogwarts school crest. The same emblem is featured {{as part of}} the [...] "Hogwarts Railways" [...] sigil on the tender and carriages. It retains its GWR number of 5972, but with alternative nameplates fitted, naming the engine Hogwarts Castle. It is painted in a crimson livery — a <b>non-standard</b> <b>colour,</b> as Great Western Railway locomotives traditionally used green.|$|E
5000|$|The colours used in {{the icon}} are {{normally}} only stored as indices to the Amiga Workbench screen's current palette. Because of this, the icons' colour scheme is inherently tied to the chosen hues in the screen's palette, and choosing <b>non-standard</b> <b>colours</b> can give the icons an ugly appearance. This problem was partly solved by a third-party system called NewIcons, which adds additional features to the standard [...] files. Unlike normal Workbench icons, NewIcons include actual RGB colour information, and the system tries its best to match the icons' colour hues {{to those in the}} screen palette.|$|R
50|$|Trail {{flagging}} is {{the predominant}} method to mark a mountain hiking trail in Japan. Red ribbons usually indicate an ascent route while yellow ribbon indicate a descent route. On some mountains, a <b>non-standard</b> ribbon <b>colour</b> (white or blue) {{is used to}} identify a specific trail.|$|R
50|$|Duple Metsec bodied {{two of the}} {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} Dennis Trident chassis for Citybus. One was finished as a normal service bus while the other was finished as a prototype airport coach. Both had <b>non-standard</b> interior <b>colour</b> schemes for Citybus to consider for their future orders.|$|R
50|$|The Yorkshire Terrier is a tan {{dog with}} a blue saddle. Particolours exist, {{although}} they are not correct for the breed standard. The particolour coat is white with black/blue and tan. The white {{is caused by the}} recessive Piebald-gene. It is very rare to get a particolour, and if one is found, it tends to be very expensive. Some Yorkshire Terriers are solid golden, they only produce pheomelanin, others are liver or chocolate, a brown colour; they only produce brown eumelanin but are unable to produce black eumelanin. The breed is defined by its <b>colour,</b> and such <b>non-standard</b> <b>colours</b> may indicate health problems or cross-breeding with other breeds of other colours. The AKC registration form for Yorkshire Terriers allows for four choices: blue and tan, blue and gold, black and tan, black and gold. Colour alone will not affect whether or not a dog is a good companion and pet. Even though off-coloured Yorkshire Terriers are advertised at premium prices, being of an unusual or atypical colour is neither new, desirable, nor exotic.|$|R
5000|$|The colours of the Mastiff coat are {{differently}} {{described by}} various kennel clubs, but are essentially fawn or apricot, or those colours {{as a base}} for black brindle. A black mask should occur in all cases. The fawn is generally a light [...] "silver" [...] shade, but may range up to a golden yellow. The apricot may be a slightly reddish hue up to a deep, rich red. The brindle markings should ideally be heavy, even and clear stripes, but may actually be light, uneven, patchy, faint or muddled. Pied Mastiffs occur rarely. Other <b>non-standard</b> <b>colours</b> include black, blue brindle, and chocolate (brown) mask. Some Mastiffs have a heavy shading caused by dark hairs throughout the coat or primarily on the back and shoulders. This is not generally considered a fault. Brindle is dominant over solid colour. Apricot is dominant over fawn, though that dominance may be incomplete. Most of the colour faults are recessive, though black is so rare in the Mastiff that it cannot be certain if it is recessive, or a mutation that is dominant.|$|R
5000|$|In heraldry, a stain (sometimes termed stainand colour or staynard colour) {{is one of}} a few <b>non-standard</b> tinctures or <b>colours</b> (namely murrey, {{sanguine}} and tenné), {{which are}} only known to occur in post-medieval heraldry and are thought to denote a rebatement of honour. Almost none of these rebatements are found in fact of heraldic practice, however, and in British heraldry the stains find only exceptional use, other than for purposes of livery.|$|R
40|$|Thirkell's {{research}} into collotype has investigated {{a new area}} of image-making {{in the field of}} fine art print. Through adapting what has historically been a highly specialized reproductive medium, a fusion of old and new has been brought to the creation and output of digitally mediated print. Collotype is a unique medium in that it renders images in continuous tone rather than the ubiquitous and cruder halftone method. The Centre for Fine Print Research's work into this process for rendering digitally mediated artists prints generated two large AHRB research grants between September 2001 - March 2004. The project led to a number of innovations, namely the adaption of digital output to produce continuous tone pre-press negatives {{and the development of a}} digital method for creating the <b>non-standard,</b> extended <b>colour</b> separation method common to traditional analogue collotype. The paper outlined a number of the project's findings; these included the production of collotype compatible digital negatives, methods for making customized colour separations using digital technology and the production of traditional high quality collotype inks. The significance of collotype and the characteristics of its inks were discussed in an interview with Thirkell on Material World, BBC Radio 4, 13 June 2002.

5000|$|A further {{increase}} in traffic led the IMR {{to order a}} further locomotive in 1896, with No.9 being the last locomotive Gorton Foundry that year (Beyer, Peacock works number 3815). Last reboilered in 1912, [...] "Douglas" [...] is the primary example of an unmodified Isle of Man Railway fleet member. There are several modifications but, most significantly, {{she is the only}} locomotive on the line to retain her Salter safety valves although No. 14 Thornhill retains these but is in private ownership. Withdrawn in 1959 by which time she had been reduced to light duties, she was stored and cosmetically restored for the 1967 season but was ultimately sold in 1978 though fortunately has never left the railway. She was partially repainted in the 1980s into a non-standard brown livery (one which is thought to have been carried by some locomotives based on early colour photos) with black/orange livery. Later she was fully painted, again in a <b>non-standard</b> livery (the <b>colour</b> was previously used on the station building at Port Erin) with black/red lining which is the livery retained today. Her smokebox door went missing at some point and is now replaced with a wooden version. No. 9 is currently in store at Douglas and not directly available to the viewing public.|$|R
