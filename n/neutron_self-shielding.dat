40|$|AbstractThe main {{challenge}} in large sample {{neutron activation analysis}} (LSNAA) is the determination of <b>neutron</b> <b>self-shielding</b> and gamma ray self-attenuation corrections. After these corrections are determined, the analysis proceeds as in normal neutron activation analysis (NAA), as if the sample were infinitely small. In this paper, these corrections are calculated using the MCNP code for different standard sample geometries with different diameters. Modelling studies for LSNAA using an external neutron beam were performed. An analytical formula for the correction factors for <b>neutron</b> <b>self-shielding</b> and gamma ray self-attenuation is derived. The correction factors as well as flux parameters are calculated analytically. The analytical formula is verified using the MCNP code. All of the calculated parameters were tabulated and graphed.

40|$|Abstract- Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) is an {{established}} nuclear analytical technique with applications {{in a broad}} range of scientific and technological fields. Typically, conventional NAA involves analysis of small material portions of 10 to 100 �g in mass. However, analysis of samples of a larger mass implies a number of additional advantages such as (a) analysis of objects too precious to remove small parts from and (b) minimization of representative sampling problems of heterogeneous materials. In this work, a method to perform in depth, nondestructive, multi-element NAA of samples of large volume (up to 1 L) is presented. The Large Sample Neutron Activation Analysis (LSNAA) technique involves sample irradiation in the reactor’s thermal neutron column and subsequent measurement of the induced radioactivity in the sample employing a HPGe based spectrometry system. Correction algorithms, to compensate for the effects of (a) thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>self-shielding</b> within the sample, during sample irradiation and (b) source geometry and gamma ray attenuation by the sample material during gamma ray counting, have been developed. The correction methods were based on Monte Carlo simulations of both the irradiation and counting facilities using the MCNP computer code. Calculations of thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>self-shielding</b> and gamma-ray detector efficiency for large samples representing industrial and archaeological materials are presented. LSNAA compliments and significantly extends the analytical tools available for in-depth, non-destructive, multi-element analysis of materials too precious to damage for sampling purposes (whole object analysis), representative sampling of heterogeneous materials, or analysis of samples of arbitrary shape. Potential applications of the technique are environmental protection, industrial waste, advanced technological materials, as well as cultural heritage and authentication studies...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDouglas S. McGregorFission {{chambers}} {{are ideal}} neutron flux surveillance instruments to ensure nuclear reactor control and safety. They can provide online, in-core, real-time measurements covering the dynamic range of neutron flux including pulse, Campbell, and current mode over decades of reactor operation cycles. The first patented fission chamber {{was developed by}} Baer et al. in 1957. It was a cylindrical assembly thermal fission counter having sensitivity of 0. 7 count/neutron cm⁻² for a background measurement of 5 counts/second with ability to operate at a temperature range of 20 - 80 ºC [3]. Since then, fission chamber technology was developed {{to come up with}} miniature and sub-miniature dimensions withstanding high irradiation and high temperature environment making them suitable for in-core online diagnosis. Since the introduction of high temperature fission chamber technology starting in the 1970 ’s, the need of the advancement in modeling of the fission chambers to improve their performance has become important. The development of modeling depends upon the understanding and consideration of underlying physics of these detectors. The validation of modeling of fission chambers will need the quantification of uncertainty introduced at every stage from neutron-deposit interaction to signal shaping. Based on this objective, a detailed review was performed on fission chamber modeling and simulation covering <b>neutron</b> flux <b>self-shielding,</b> fissile deposit evolution, fission product emission, auto-absorption, electron-ion pair creation, charge recombination and avalanche, space charge effect, charge transport, propagation of electronic pulse and pulse shaping. The analytical methods, algorithmic treatments, simulation, and computation codes used so far in case of modeling different aspects of fission chambers were reviewed. Along with the numerical methods and computer codes for simulating electron drift and charge transport for the usual gas chamber detectors, the use of several fissile material evolution techniques and computation codes were observed in case of fission chamber modeling. The use higher order statistics to handle fluctuation mode and to treat noisy data were observed. In recent years, fission chamber modeling made reasonable improvement in detail physics modeling.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{accurate}} calculational tools for {{the determination of}} gamma heating in fast reactors has increased considerably in recent years following the planned modification of certain existing fast breeders into plutonium-burning configurations. The latter are characterized by a steel/sodium reflector (replacing the fertile blanket) {{and a large number}} of core diluting sodium/steel sub-assemblies, i. e. regions in which gammas account for about 90 % of total heating. In the current doctoral research, a new calculational scheme for the accurate determination of gamma heating in fast reactors has been implemented and its validation for Pu-burning configurations accomplished through comparisons with integral measurements in representative critical assemblies. The particularity of the new calculational methodology is that gamma production multiplicities for fission, capture and inelastic scattering are folded with the corresponding effective (<b>self-shielded)</b> <b>neutron</b> cross-sections and then summed up to yield the total gamma production matrices. This allows one {{to take advantage of the}} latest improvements in computing effective cross-sections at the cell level, in particular the consideration of spatially varying cross-sections in non-fuel regions such as reflectors. The new methodology requires gamma production multiplicities separately for fission, capture and inelastic scattering, and accordingly a special library containing these nuclear data was generated from the latest and most appropriate data evaluations, mainly JEF 2. 2 and ENDF/B-VI. Furthermore, the delayed emission through disintegration of fission and activation products was explicitly considered. In the course of creating the gamma production library, a careful check could be made on the quality of the basic data available. It was found that a major shortcoming in this context is the large uncertainty (~ 8 %) on the gamma production in fission, since total gamma fission emission values given by various authors differ significantly. The validation of the currently developed calculational tool was accomplished through comparisons with new gamma-heating measurements conducted in the framework of the CIRANO experimental programme at the MASURCA facility, as well as with reevaluated earlier measurements by Calamand et al. in the BALZAC 1 -DE 1 configuration of the same facility. The latter had a steel/sodium (diluent) zone at the center of the core region. In the current CIRANO measurements, absolute gamma-heating rates were determined in PuO 2 /UO 2 fueled cores surrounded by a steel/sodium reflector using TLD- 700 thermoluminescent dosimeters. Thereby, a considerable effort was undertaken to minimize systematic errors in the measurements and to reduce the statistical uncertainty, in order to ensure a total experimental error smaller than the target accuracy for the gamma-heating calculations. To achieve this goal, a highly reproducible measuring procedure was established (statistical error < 2 %), individual TLD calibration was carried out in a consistent way with respect to the reactor measurements and the various correction factors (determined using the latest calculational methods and data) were investigated in detail. The correction most in doubt, viz. the cavity relation, was derived by applying both Burlin cavity theory and MCNP coupled photon-electron calculations, with TLD irradiations in various surroundings providing a check on the latter. The total experimental error (1  σ) on the TLD measurements has been estimated to be less than 6 %. The calculation/experiment (C/E) values determined from the analysis of the critical experiments are 0. 90 for the PuO 2 /UO 2 core region, 0. 84 for the steel/sodium reflector and 0. 89 for the steel/sodium diluent zone. The most plausible causes for the observed differences have been identified to be data related, viz. too low fission gamma energies and too low capture cross-sections for the structural elements. Thereby, the data for Pu 239 and Fe 56 are the most suspect, since the former nuclide is the dominant contributor to the gamma production in the core while the latter is that for the reflector and diluent regions. The transferability of the current validation findings to the SUPER-PHENIX power plant (in its planned modified form as Pu-burner) and the 1500 MWe CAPRA 4 / 94 reference design has been demonstrated by comparing the experimental configurations with the full-scale power reactors in a quantitative manner with respect to gamma-heating characteristics. With the transferability established, a set of correction factors (fpower=E/C) can be defined for application to calculational results. This enables the prediction of gamma heating in the various regions of the considered power reactors to within the current target accuracy of ~ 7. 5 %...|$|R

While the phenomenon of neutron resonance self-shielding would be expected to produce such an effect, temperature effects on neutron flux distribution and neutron capture rates may also be involved. Experimental investigations of these phenomena have not been previously performed. The work presented in this thesis evaluates the factors that contribute to the decrease in 188 W yield from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. <b>Neutron</b> <b>self-shielding</b> and temperature effects were characterized to develop a strategy for target design that would optimize production yield, an important factor in minimizing health care costs. It was determined that decrease in yield due to <b>neutron</b> <b>self-shielding</b> can be attributed to depletion of epithermal neutrons at resonant energies, most significantly within the initial 0. 4 mm depth of the target. The results from these studies further show that 188 W yield in the interior of the target (beyond 0. 4 mm depth) does not decrease as would be expected due to neutron attenuation. This observation was explained by the fact elevated temperatures in the interior of the target result in an increase in the 188 W yield through Doppler broadening of cross sections, compensating for reduced yield due to neutron attenuation.

They include specific requirements on waste forms, packaging as well as limitations toactivities of individual radionuclides and limitations to masses of non-radioactive harmful substances. Theamount of chemically toxic elements in the waste is limited in order to avoid pollution of undergroundwater reserves. To comply with these requirements every waste package has to be characterised in itsradiological and chemical composition. This characterisation can be performed on the basis of existingdocumentation or, if the documentation is insufficient, on further analytical analysis. Segmented orintegral gamma-scanning as well as active or passive neutron counting are used worldwide as the standardmeasurement methods for the radiological characterisation and quality checking of radioactive waste.

STAYSL PNNL is provided {{as part of a}} comprehensive suite of programs [2], where additional tools in the suite are used for assembling a set of nuclear data libraries and determining all required corrections to the measured data to determine saturated activation rates. Neutron cross section and covariance data are taken from the International Reactor Dosimetry File (IRDF- 2002)  [3], which was sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), though work is planned to update to data from the IAEA's International Reactor Dosimetry and Fusion File (IRDFF)  [4]. The nuclear data and associated covariances are extracted from IRDF- 2002 using the third-party NJOY 99 computer code [5]. The NJpp translation code converts the extracted data into a library data array format suitable for use as input to STAYSL PNNL. The software suite also includes three utilities to calculate corrections to measured activation rates. <b>Neutron</b> <b>self-shielding</b> corrections are calculated as a function of neutron energy with the SHIELD code and are applied to the group cross sections prior to spectral adjustment, thus making the corrections independent of the neutron spectrum. The SigPhi Calculator is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet used for calculating saturated activation rates from raw gamma activities by applying corrections for gamma self-absorption, neutron burn-up, and the irradiation history. Gamma self-absorption and neutron burn-up corrections are calculated (iteratively {{in the case of the}} burn-up) within the SigPhi Calculator spreadsheet. The irradiation history corrections are calculated using the BCF computer code and are inserted into the SigPhi Calculator workbook for use in correcting the measured activities. Output from the SigPhi Calculator is automatically produced, and consists of a portion of the STAYSL PNNL input file data that is required to run the spectral adjustment calculations. Within STAYSL PNNL, the least-squares process is performed in one step, without iteration, and provides rapid results on PC platforms. STAYSL PNNL creates multiple output files with tabulated results, data suitable for plotting, and data formatted for use in subsequent radiation damage calculations using the SPECTER computer code (which is not included in the STAYSL PNNL suite). All components of the software suite have undergone extensive testing and validation prior to release and test cases are provided with the package...|$|E
40|$|The NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration) RERTR (Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors) program {{assigned}} INL (Idaho National Laboratory) {{the responsibility}} of developing and demonstrating high uranium density research reactor fuel forms to enable the use of low enriched uranium (LEU) in the research reactors around the world. A series of full-size fuel plate irradiation tests are proposed for the ATR (Advanced Test Reactor). Labeled the AFIP (ATR Full-size-plates In center flux trap Position) experiments, these tests will be conducted in the ATR center flux trap. The AFIP- 2 experiment will contain two full size fuel plates fabricated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory-Y- 12 (ORNL). The nominal fuel zone is rectangular in shape having a designed length of 21. 5 -in (54. 6 l-cm), width of 1. 6 -in (4. 064 -cm), and uniform thickness of 0. 014 -in (0. 03556 -cm). This gives a nominal fuel zone volume of 0. 482 in 3 (7. 89 cm 3) in each fuel plate. The test holder accommodates two independent test trains. Each test train is designed to hold 2 plates, {{for a total of}} 4 plates per test holder. AFIP- 2 test plates will be irradiated at a peak surface heat flux of about 350 W/cm 2 and discharged at a peak U- 235 burn-up of about 70 at. %. Based on limited irradiation testing of the monolithic (U 10 Mo) fuel form, it is desirable to keep the peak fuel temperature below 250 °C; to achieve this, {{it will be necessary to}} keep plate heat fluxes below 500 W/cm 2. Due to the heavy U- 235 loading and width of 1. 6 -in (4. 064 cm), the <b>neutron</b> <b>self-shielding</b> will increase the local-to-average-ratio fission power near the sides of the fuel plates. To assure the AFIP- 2 experiment will comply with the ATR safety requirements, a very detailed 2 dimensional (2 D) Y-Z fission power profile was evaluated to best predict the fuel plate temperature distribution. The ability to accurately predict fuel plate power and burnup are essential in the AFIP- 2 fuel test train design and the irradiated fuel performance evaluation. We obtained the required power and heat generation rates within test train for the thermal analyses. A detailed MCNP Y-Z mini-plate fuel model was developed. The Y-Z model divides each fuel mini-plate into 30 equal intervals in Y and Z directions. The MCNP-calculated results and the detailed Y-Z fission power mapping were used to help design the AFIP- 2 fuel test assembly to ensure that the capsule thermal-hydraulic limits will not exceed the ATR safety limit...|$|E
