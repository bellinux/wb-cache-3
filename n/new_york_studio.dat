5|$|This was {{the final}} film for {{director}} Edwards, who died the following year, {{and was one of}} the last produced at Fox Film's <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>studio.</b> Contemporary reviews were generally positive. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E

The show relocated from its original <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>studio</b> in late-1998 to NEP Studio 54 in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where it remained until 2005, when the studio was claimed by The Colbert Report. On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location.|$|E
5|$|While Mad Max {{was being}} {{developed}} by Avalanche's studio in Stockholm, the New York division was working on Just Cause 3. The development of Just Cause 3 also began in early 2012. While the previous Just Cause games were developed by the Swedish studio, the development of Just Cause 3 {{was transferred to the}} <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>studio</b> to give the title a fresh start. The game was the first title published by Square Enix after their acquisition of Eidos Interactive. Avalanche Studios sent a team to visit a jungle in Costa Rica to inspect the local landscapes and environments to help them create the game worlds for both Mad Max and Just Cause 3.|$|E

5|$|Curtis Benson {{wrote the}} film {{adaptation}} for It Is the Law; unlike the theatrical version, his screenplay presents the story entirely in chronological order. J. Gordon Edwards directed, {{the only time}} he did so in 1924, as he was primarily serving as Fox Film's director-general at the time. It was also his last time to direct; he retired from Fox after the film's completion, and although he expressed an interest to returning to the role, he died of pneumonia the following year. Filming took place at Fox's <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>studio,</b> although most production had by then moved to Hollywood. It Is the Law was one of only four films Fox made at its East Coast facility in 1924. Except for four Allan Dwan films in 1926, they were the last Fox produced in New York. The Film Daily reported that a trailer was produced to advertise the film.|$|E
5|$|Large and {{dangerous}} fires sometimes resulted. On 4 May 1897, {{one of the}} first major fires involving nitrate film began when a Lumière projector caught fire at the Bazar de la Charité in Paris; the resulting blaze caused 180 deaths. In the United States, a series of fires occurred at industry facilities. The Lubin Manufacturing Company's vault in Philadelphia exploded on 13 June 1914, followed on 9 December by a fire that destroyed Thomas Edison's laboratory complex in West Orange, New Jersey. The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>studio</b> of the Famous Players Film Company burned in September 1915; in July 1920, the shipping facility of its corporate successor, Famous Players-Lasky, was destroyed by a fire in Kansas City, Missouri, despite construction intended to minimize that risk. The United Film Ad Service vault, also in Kansas City, burned on 4 August 1928, and a fire was reported at Pathé Exchange nine days later. In October 1929, the Consolidated Film Industries facility was badly damaged by a nitrate fire. Spontaneous combustion was not proven to have occurred in any of these fires; {{it is possible that the}} potential of nitrate film to self-ignite was not even recognized before 1933.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Australian actor Rob Inglis read/performed an {{unabridged}} {{version for}} Recorded Books in their <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>studio.</b> While not strictly a dramatisation, Inglis created voices {{for all of}} the characters.

Griffith screen-tested {{her at the}} company's <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>studio</b> for {{a role in the}} nickelodeon film, Pippa Passes. The role went {{to someone}} else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford's single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week.|$|E

25|$|As the {{half-size}} {{models were}} nearing completion in 1933, the CFA suspended the project. By now, the United States {{was in the}} depths of the Great Depression. The bridge was finished and slightly over budget, and Congress was increasingly unwilling to appropriate money for any further construction except the most critical remaining construction items (such as roadways). Obtaining funds for the costly granite and expensive carving was politically impossible. Furthermore, what funds were available were impounded under the Economy Act of 1933. Nevertheless, the CFA wanted very much to proceed with the statues. With the full-size models already paid for, it asked the sculptors to finish their work. The Commission of Fine Arts visited Friedlander's White Plains, <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>studio</b> on October 14, 1933, and approved his models.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 Landfield {{presided over}} two public panel discussions at the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Studio</b> School and the Tenri Institute both in Manhattan called Cool and Collected or Too Hot to Handle. In 1995 he curated Seven Painters at the Nicholas/Alexander Gallery in SoHo, an {{exhibition}} that featured seven important abstract painters whose careers {{began in the}} mid to late 1960s, some of whom hadn't been shown for many years. In 1996 Landfield had a solo exhibition in Sapporo, Japan and lectured there on American art. In 1997 he aided colleague Ronald Davis's creation of an educational website highlighting abstract art from the 1960s. He was represented by the Salander/O'Reilly Gallery in New York from 1997 until 2007. In October 2005 he had a solo exhibition of his paintings accompanied by a solo show of sculpture by Peter Reginato at the Heidi Cho Gallery in Chelsea.|$|E
25|$|The {{sessions}} for the album in mid-1958, {{along with the}} Milestones sessions from earlier that year, were seen by many music writers as elemental in Miles Davis' transition from bebop to the modal style of jazz and were viewed as precursors to his best-known work, Kind of Blue. Following audio engineering and digital restoration by engineer Larry Keyes at Sony Music <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Studio,</b> the album was reissued on compact disc in 1991 as part of Columbia's Jazz Masterpieces Series. For later reissues, the album was retitled as 58 Sessions Featuring Stella by Starlight or 58 Miles Featuring Stella by Starlight. The complete 1958 {{sessions for}} Columbia were issued on the box set The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane, and Jazz at the Plaza was reissued in 2001. The first four tracks were also released as Bonus disc of the 50 Anniversary Collector's Edition of Kind of Blue.|$|E
50|$|The {{explosion}} {{of high quality}} home and project studio recording systems such as Digidesign's Pro Tools, along with declining album sales and skyrocketing Manhattan commercial leases helped contribute {{to the demise of}} a number of major <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>studios,</b> including Unique Recording Studios.|$|R
