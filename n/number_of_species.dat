25|$|As {{elsewhere}} in the world, vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented, so the recorded <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> are probably close to the true numbers.

40|$|In this oral {{presentation}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bird <b>species</b> recorded at Te Waihora/Lake Ellesmere are {{compared with the}} total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bird <b>species</b> in New Zealand. Using the PLOVER model the findings record that there are very high species diversity, comparatively large proportions <b>of</b> the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> some <b>species</b> using New Zealand wetlands as over-wintering sites during their migrations, comparatively large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> some <b>species</b> which rely on the lake for particular life stages, and very large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> some <b>species</b> groups.

5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E
5|$|While some {{agree on}} the number of genera, fewer {{agree on the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> Historically, up to 80 {{different}} taxa have been described by different researchers; most of these were incorrectly identified juvenile birds.|$|E

5|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> of cacti {{have been}} shown to contain psychoactive agents, {{chemical}} compounds that can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their effects on the brain.

5|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> {{of shrimp}} and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E
50|$|Gastropods {{have the}} {{greatest}} <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> named mollusc <b>species.</b> However, estimates <b>of</b> the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> gastropod <b>species</b> vary widely, depending on cited sources.

But an estimate <b>of</b> the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Mollusca, including undescribed species, is about 240,000 <b>species.</b> The estimate <b>of</b> 85,000 molluscs includes 24,000 described <b>species</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial gastropods.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} subgenera have been {{proposed}} over the years. For instance in the 1870s and 1880s John Gilbert Baker considerably reorganised Hippeastrum. In 1878 he described nine sections of the genus, but by 1888 he included seven subgenera, namely (<b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> in parentheses) Habranthus (10), Phycella (3), Rhodophiala (5), Macropododastrum (1), Omphalissa (6), Aschamia (10) and Lais (3), {{some of which have}} since been treated as separate genera (Habranthus, Rhodophiala). Baker both reduced the original <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> of Herbert, but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as Habranthus, Phycella, Rhodophiala and Rhodolirion (also called Rhodolirium, and subsequently moved to Rhodophilia), which he included as separate sections of Hippeastrum. In addition, he included many new species being discovered in South America, particularly Chile. His 1878 classification included 47 species, reduced to 38 by 1888.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|Current {{thinking}} {{divides the}} albatrosses into four genera. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> {{is a matter}} of debate.
