25|$|My name is Sam Tyler. I had an {{accident}} and I woke up in 1973. Am I mad, in a coma, or back in time? Whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet. <b>Now,</b> <b>maybe</b> if I can work out the reason, I can get home.|$|E
500|$|Historian Will Jacobs {{suggests}} the Silver Age ended in April 1970 {{when the man}} who had started it, Julius Schwartz, handed over Green Lantern — starring one of the first revived heroes of the era [...] — to the new-guard team of Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams in response to reduced sales. John Strausbaugh also connects the end of the Silver Age to Green Lantern. He observes that in 1960, the character embodied the can-do optimism of the era. [...] However, by 1972 Green Lantern had become world weary; [...] "Those days are gone – gone forever – the days I was confident, certain ... I was so young ... so sure I couldn't make a mistake! Young and cocky, that was Green Lantern. Well, I've changed. I'm older <b>now</b> ... <b>maybe</b> wiser, too ... and a lot less happy." [...] Strausbaugh writes that the Silver Age [...] "went out with that whimper." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{a midnight}} {{show the same}} month, four men rushed onto the stage in an {{apparent}} attack. Security men leapt to Presley's defense, and the singer's karate instinct took over as he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, he became obsessed {{with the idea that}} the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, [...] "There's too much pain in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, [...] "Aw hell, let's just leave it for <b>now.</b> <b>Maybe</b> it's a bit heavy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elvis and Priscilla {{separated}} on February 23, 1972, {{and filed}} for legal separation on July 26. To avoid Priscilla's {{having to make}} her home address available on the public records and therefore risking the security of both her and Lisa Marie, Elvis filed for divorce on January 8, 1973. Later that month, Elvis reportedly became paranoid about Stone and said: [...] "There's too much pain in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, even with large doses of medication. After another two days of raging, Elvis' friend and bodyguard, Red West, made enquiries to arrange a contract killing of Stone, but was relieved when Elvis said, [...] "Aw hell, let's just leave it for <b>now.</b> <b>Maybe</b> it's a bit heavy." [...] The divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1989 season, Newman {{was interviewed}} along with {{teammate}} Gary Gaetti about playing the [...] "hot corner" [...] (third base) for the Minnesota Twins. Newman recounted an experience playing the position when future Hall of Famer (and future Twin) Dave Winfield {{came to the}} plate, [...] "Dave Winfield hit one right at me last year. I had no chance to move. I looked and the ball was in my glove. I made like I knew what I was doing." [...] In 1990, Al Newman {{was a part of}} setting a major league record as the Minnesota Twins turned 2 triple plays in one game against the Boston Red Sox, making the final throw in both. Also during the 1990 season, teammate and future Hall of Famer, Kirby Puckett, was moved around the field from his normal centerfield position to play right field, third base, shortstop, and second base in a single game. Newman jokingly remarked to the press following the game, [...] "I'm glad Puck's one of us utility guys <b>now.</b> <b>Maybe</b> he'll raise the salary structure a little." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never mind <b>now,</b> Betty. <b>Maybe</b> I'll {{tell you}} some day. It's {{enough for you}} to know the Colonel don't like Miller and that I think he is a bad man. You don't care nothin' for Miller, do you Betty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Terence," [...] O'Grady said, in an insinuating way, [...] "I won't ask you any {{questions}} <b>now,</b> and <b>maybe</b> some {{day when you}} have marched away from this place, you will tell me {{the ins and outs}} of the business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So he wass, Taniel, {{when you}} left {{us to go to}} Rud Ruver, but my son Tuncan was never fond o' stickin' to his father. He left us, an' no wan knows where he iss <b>now.</b> Starvin', <b>maybe,</b> like the rest of us." ...|$|R

6000|$|Whenever {{a letter}} comes from you to Mrs. I carry it to her, and then I see Betty; {{she is a}} {{tolerable}} nice [...] "fellow" [...] <b>now.</b> <b>Maybe</b> I will write again when I get more time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! if I'd {{only been}} as thin when Kit carried me as I am <b>now,</b> <b>maybe</b> he wouldn't have died; but I was heavy, {{he was hurt}} worser than we knew, and so it killed him; and I didn't see him, to say good bye." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times Magazine published online on April 10, 2013, Weiner {{said he would like}} to [...] "ask people to give me a second chance" [...] and was considering a run for mayor. He added that, [...] "it's <b>now</b> or <b>maybe</b> never for me." ...|$|R

6000|$|At {{the foot}} of the cliff all was as dark and silent as a tomb. [...] "We go slow <b>now,</b> or <b>maybe</b> take a big tumble," [...] cautioned Cujo. [...] "Perhaps him better if me climb up first," [...] and he began the {{dangerous}} ascent of the cliff by means of the numerous vines already mentioned.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} me, if you know," [...] Stukeley said impatiently. [...] "You don't suppose as I {{am going to}} tell <b>now!</b> <b>Maybe</b> I shan't see any one to tell {{this side of the}} grave, for I doubt as I shall see the morning. Who wrote it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I did," [...] Josiah went on. [...] "I ran away." [...] He {{fumbled for}} his watch hurriedly. [...] "We've just {{time to catch}} the train for California.

6000|$|... "Why {{as near as}} I know, some {{relative}} o' his'n used to have {{an interest}} in the lumber company as run the mill," [...] replied the farmer. [...] "It was a man named Foxwell. He's dead <b>now.</b> <b>Maybe</b> he left his share o' the place to this man Crabtree. He was a teacher, wasn't he?" ...|$|E

You have done your work like men, {{and no doubt}} you thinks your cause is right, just as we does; but it's all over <b>now,</b> and <b>maybe</b> our turn will come next to see the inside of one of your prisons down south. So we are just {{soldiers}} together, and can feel for each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{explain that}} I {{will discuss the}} matter with my young friend when he arrives. The landlady says, [...] "Certainly, sir:" [...] she is used to {{what she calls the}} [...] "wandering Christian;" [...] and easing my {{conscience}} by slipping a shilling into the [...] "slavey's" [...] astonished, lukewarm hand, I pass out again into the long, dreary street, <b>now</b> echoing <b>maybe</b> to the sad cry of [...] "Muffins!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{brought the}} cart, maning {{to go right}} on to Castle Boterel afore ye landed,' said his father. '"Put in the horse," [...] says Martin. [...] "Ay," [...] says I, [...] "so we will;" [...] and did it straightway. <b>Now,</b> <b>maybe,</b> Martin had better go on wi' the cart for the things, and you and I walk home-along.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the same," [...] {{continued}} Nares, [...] "you {{went into}} the opium-smuggling with your head down; {{and a good deal}} of fussing I've listened to, that you hadn't more of it to smuggle. <b>Now,</b> <b>maybe</b> your partner's not quite fixed the same as you are; maybe he sees precious little difference between the one thing and the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{they say}} he had a hatful for Armande when he sailed for Tahiti," [...] the {{supercargo}} carried on the tale. [...] "That's fifteen years ago, and he's been adding to it ever since--stored the shell as well. Everybody's seen that--hundreds of tons of it. They say the lagoon's fished clean <b>now.</b> <b>Maybe</b> that's why he's announced the auction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, now," [...] said George, [...] "you don't fool this crew no more. You're a funny man, by your account; but you're over <b>now,</b> and you'll <b>maybe</b> {{step down}} off that barrel and help vote." ...|$|R

6000|$|And then, {{for an old}} {{man like}} me, it's not exactly right, [...] This kind o' playing soldier with no enemy in sight. [...] "The Union,"--that was well enough way up to '66; [...] But this [...] "Re-Union," [...] <b>maybe</b> <b>now</b> it's mixed with politics? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes. He {{came to me}} {{yesterday}} {{and said that he}} was sure you had something on your mind. <b>Now,</b> <b>maybe</b> it is none of our business, Dave. But if I and Roger can help you in any way, you know we’ll be only too glad to do it.” Phil spoke in a low but earnest voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "The road winds, as I have allowed," [...] {{returned}} the Minor Poet; [...] "the gradient is somewhat steep. Just <b>now,</b> <b>maybe,</b> we are traversing a backward curve.

6000|$|... "Watch for {{an attack}} <b>now</b> <b>maybe,</b> Captain," [...] Aaron Cochrane said to father. [...] "That man the boys seen has rid in for a purpose.

5000|$|Aehrenthal wanted {{full control}} of Bosnia-Herzogovina through {{annexation}} even though Austria-Hungary had administered the provinces since 1878. His reasons for this lay in the possible recovery of the [...] "sick man of Europe", Turkey. The [...] "Young Turk" [...] revolution of 1908, led in part by Enver Pasha, convinced some that the Ottoman Empire {{might be on the}} rise again. Thus, Aehrenthal reasoned, it was <b>now</b> or <b>maybe</b> never. He would discuss this matter with Izvolsky to ensure the Russians would not interfere with the annexation plans.|$|R
