2500|$|Nearly all {{independent}} commentators saw {{the agreement}} as a losing proposition for International Harvester. The company had incurred deep financial costs, lost market share, and achieved {{none of its}} key demands despite McCardell's assertions that the proposals were critical to the company's success. [...] "here is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> company is the big loser in this one," [...] one Wall Street analyst said.|$|E

The game is also reaching its best exposure through its TV deal with NBC Sports. That {{could be one of}} Bettman's crowning achievements. The remarkable thing about the NHL is that it remains incredibly strong, if not stronger coming out of two lockouts in the last decade. Gary Bettman…may not be perfect…but (he) is a good leader for the NHL and probably deserves some recognition for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, sisters {{at their}} Spokane, Washington, convent {{claimed to have}} a stopped a fire at a chapel in Fort Wright College by invoking Durocher through prayer. [...] The fire, which started in Spokane River gorge, was {{approaching}} the campus when the sisters tacked Durocher's picture to trees and prayed to her for help. [...] Flames were reportedly within 15 feet of the chapel, with smoke filling the interior, when the fire changed direction. [...] Similarly, in 1979, Frank Carr, {{the owner of a}} lake resort in Tonasket, Washington, observed an uncontrolled wildfire change direction after he tossed a picture of Durocher into the flames. [...] Said Carr, [...] "All I know is that we threw in the picture and the wind changed. [...] There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> fire would have taken the orchard, some farm houses and the resort if it hadn't turned." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Time Magazine {{reviewer}} {{wrote of}} the 2001 Broadway revival: [...] "Even in its more modest incarnation, Follies has, <b>no</b> <b>question,</b> <b>the</b> best score on Broadway." [...] He noted, though, that [...] "I'm sorry the cast was reduced from 52 to 38, the orchestra from 26 players to 14...To appreciate the revival, you must buy into James Goldman's book, which is peddling a panoramically bleak take on marriage." [...] Finally, he wrote:"But Follies never makes fun of the honorable musical tradition to which it belongs. The show and the score have a double vision: simultaneously squinting at the messes people make {{of their lives and}} wide-eyed at the lingering grace and lift of the music they want to hear. Sondheim's songs aren't parodies or deconstructions; they are evocations that recognize the power of a love song. In 1971 or 2001, Follies validates the legend that a Broadway show can be an event worth dressing up for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Don Nigro's satirical comedy Paganini (1995), {{the great}} violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, {{claiming}} that he unknowingly sold his soul to the Devil. [...] "Variation upon variation," [...] he cries at one point, [...] "but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question {{for which there is}} no answer." [...] Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is [...] "rescued" [...] by the Devil who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvation—administered by a god-like Clockmaker—turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. [...] "Do not pity him, my dear," [...] the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. [...] "He is alone with the answer for which there is <b>no</b> <b>question.</b> <b>The</b> saved and the damned are the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|The American {{productions}} {{met with}} mixed success. The demand for {{tickets for the}} first night {{was so great that}} the management of the Fifth Avenue Theatre sold them by public auction. A [...] "large and brilliant" [...] audience assembled for the New York premiere on 21 February 1887. [...] "After {{the first half of the}} first act there was a palpable diminution of interest on the part of the audience, and it must be admitted that there were times during the course of the evening when people were bored." [...] While the critic had praise for many members of the cast and felt the production would improve once the cast was more familiar with the work, the reviewer concluded that [...] "Gilbert and Sullivan have failed." [...] On the other hand, the American tour, beginning in Philadelphia six days later, met with a much more favourable audience reaction. [...] "That the opera is a great success here and another [...] "Mikado" [...] in prospective popularity there can be <b>no</b> <b>question....</b> <b>The</b> general verdict is that Sullivan never composed more brilliant music, while Gilbert's keen satire and pungent humor is [...] as brilliant as ever." [...] During the summer of 1886, Braham secretly married J. Duncan Young, previously a principal tenor with the company. [...] In early 1887, shortly into the run of Ruddigore, Braham informed Carte that she was pregnant with her second child, a daughter, who would be born on 6 May. [...] Geraldine Ulmar, the Rose in the New York cast, was summoned to London to take over the role.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a memorable}} one to little Miss Rivers, opening out to her, as did almost all her {{meetings}} with that family, a new scope for thought and for duty.

Good-nature occasioned much kindliness of manner and intercourse, and every luxury and indulgence was afforded freely; but where there was any want of accordance between the convenience of the two parties, there was <b>no</b> <b>question.</b> <b>The</b> master must be the first object, the servants' remedy was in their own hands.|$|E

I therefore confess that I think this last turn of the Victorian Age was an unfortunate turn; much on the other side can be said, and I hope will be said. But about the facts there can be <b>no</b> <b>question.</b> <b>The</b> Imperialism of Kipling was equally remote from the Victorian caution and the Victorian idealism: and our subject does quite seriously end here. The world was full of the trampling of totally new forces, gold was sighted from far in a sort of cynical romanticism: the guns opened across Africa; and the great queen died.|$|E

The Duchess knew all about her and vouchsafed to her the smallest possible recognition. Lady Chiltern had met her before, and as Lady Chiltern was always generous, she was gracious to Arabella. She was sorry to see Lady Drummond, because she connected Lady Drummond with the Foreign Office and feared that the conversation might be led to Patagonia and its new minister. She contrived to squeeze her uncle's hand and to utter a word of warm thanks,--which his grace did not perfectly understand. The girl was his niece and the Duke had an idea that he should be kind to the family of which he was the head. His brother's wife had become objectionable to him, but as to the girl, if she wanted a home for a week or two, he thought it to be his duty to give it to her.|$|E
