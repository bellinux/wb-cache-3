50|$|The Palm Zire and Palm Zire 21 were {{inexpensive}} and are differentiated {{from the rest}} of Palm's line by having monochrome screens without backlighting, having only two quickbuttons instead of four, and a traditional up/down <b>navigation</b> <b>button</b> instead of a 5-Way Navigator, though both of these entry-level models are lightweight (3.8oz or 108g), sporting a white front with a matte gray plastic back.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of the position of <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> on the intuitive operation of iPad applications for children in middle childhood. When using iPads for educational reasons it is important that applications are designed as intuitive as possible. Well-designed and intuitive applications make educational content more accessible and support children in their learning process. In a 2 by 2 factor between subject experiment with 84 children (Mage = 7. 7), I investigated how the vertical position (top vs. bottom) and the horizontal distance (close vs. distant) of <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> influence the (1) time children need to tab different <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> (next, back, home) and (2) the degree to which children perceive <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> as intuitive. In addition to the experiment, children were also asked both open and closed interview questions. Results show that children perceive <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> that are positioned at the bottom of the screen and distant from each other as most intuitive. Further research is required to investigate intuitive symbols for <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> for children in middle childhood. Keywords...|$|R

50|$|Treo 600 was a {{smartphone}} {{developed by}} Handspring, and offered under the palmOne brand (later Palm, Inc.) after {{the merger of}} the two companies.

50|$|Next {{to this is}} a small LCD {{screen with}} {{navigation}} buttons which allows you to get system-information without the need to access the CMC/management system of the enclosure. Basic status and configuration information is available via this display. To operate the display you can pull it towards you and tilt it for optimal view and access to the <b>navigation</b> <b>button.</b> For quick status checks, an indicator light sits alongside the LCD display and is always visible, with a blue LED indicating normal operation and an orange LED indicating a problem of some kind.|$|E
50|$|Since the F3 {{had only}} two lines of fixed icons {{on the top and}} bottom of the display, as well as one line of six 14-segment {{characters}} and another line of six 7-segment numbers available on its display, the user interface was very different from the usual menu structure normally found on mobile phones. The only thing resembling a (flat) menu was accessed by pressing left/right on the central button: It allowed writing an SMS, reading a saved SMS, call history, choosing the ringtone (out of seven melodies), setting date and time, and setting the alarm clock. The menu was visualized by fixed icons in the bottom row, following the left/right pattern of the <b>navigation</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Sony Ericsson K850i was a {{high-end}} mobile phone when released in October 2007. It {{was announced in}} June 2007 as the flagship product in Sony Ericsson's K ("Kamera") series, with a 5 megapixel CMOS camera sensor. The K850 was the first Sony Ericsson phone released outside of NTT DoCoMo to support microSD and microSDHC along with Sony's traditional M2. It also introduces the usage of three touch-sensitive softkeys right under the display and {{a new form of}} <b>navigation</b> <b>button,</b> omitting the classic joystick introduced with the Ericsson T68. The camera interface has been revamped to resemble the format of cybershot digital cameras. According to the manufacturer the UMTS talk time has been significantly increased to 3 hours 30 min over its predecessor, the K800 and K810. (K800 2 hrs 30 min). It was Sony Ericsson's first 3.5 HSDPA supporting mobile phone, and was also the first 3G [...] "global" [...] mobile with supporting all major operating network frequency in the world including GSM 850, GSM 900, GSM 1800, GSM 1900, HSDPA, UMTS 850, UMTS 1900, UMTS 2100.|$|E
40|$|Ideally, the SEP {{web pages}} should be rich in content, free of clutter, and quick to download. We suggest two basic types of web pages: table-of-contents pages that contain lists of {{annotated}} links, and content pages that contain mostly text and figures. The author of an SEP web page should attract search engines, maintain a consistent layout for related pages, {{and include a}} simple, universal <b>navigation</b> <b>button</b> that returns the reader to the SEP home page. Finally, the SEP source that corresponds to a web page should be equipped with a simple makefile target www that exports the software to the web site...|$|E
30|$|A <b>navigation</b> <b>button</b> {{located at}} the bottom-right of the screen offered ‘previous’ and ‘next’ arrows, enabled the {{learners}} to move between topics. This type of button also indicated the learners’ current location {{and the number of}} remaining topics. The instructional materials were always located on the white background area at {{the left side of the}} screen. The instructional materials were presented in dark text on a white background to facilitate ease of reading for learners who may have had colour perception deficiencies (McCracken and Wolfe 2004). To ensure that all information was seen in the one place, no scrolling of the screen was required. Therefore, to reduce extraneous cognitive load during learning, the instructional interface was designed consistently in terms of the usability and relating to the appearance, functionality and instructional ordering. Appearance meant using consistent ‘visual elements’ such as: layout; text style; colour and graphics throughout the instructional system. Functionality meant the same ‘(knowledge) navigation element’ such as ‘previous’ and ‘next’ arrows on each screen which allowed the learners to navigate through the topics. Instructional ordering meant the screen organisation remained consistent throughout the WMIS, for instance the navigational button located at bottom-right of each screen (Galitz 2007).|$|E
