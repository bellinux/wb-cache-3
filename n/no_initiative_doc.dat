50|$|<b>No</b> <b>initiative</b> {{from the}} {{government}} has been taken so far in preparing a comprehensive list of the victims of the massacre. The partial list includes the following names.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this article are twofold: (1) to consider the extent to which Dialogue of Civilisations (<b>DoC)</b> <b>initiatives,</b> as alternative visions of post-secular world order, are likely to address insecurities that they identify; and (2) to point to other insecurities that are likely to remain unidentified and unaddressed in the process. In their present conception, <b>DoC</b> <b>initiatives</b> risk falling short of addressing the very insecurities they prioritise (the stability of inter-state order) let alone attending to those experienced by non-state referents, which they overlook. The article advances three points in three steps. First, I point to how projects of civilisational dialogue have bracketed civilisation, thereby leaving intact the Huntingtonian notion of civilisations as religiously unified autochthonous entities. Second, I argue that while contributing to opening up space for communication, <b>DoC</b> <b>initiatives</b> have nevertheless failed to employ a dialogical approach to dialogue between civilisations. Third, I tease out the notion of security underpinning <b>DoC</b> <b>initiatives</b> and argue that the proponents DoC, in their haste to avert a clash, have defined security narrowly as the absence of war between states belonging to different civilisations. Theirs is also a shallow notion of security insofar as it fails to capture the derivative character of security and insecurity. Copyright © British International Studies Association 2012...|$|R
50|$|As of 2012, <b>no</b> <b>initiatives</b> {{were taken}} by the {{government}} to restore mass graves. Residential buildings have come up above two of the graves. The remaining four are also on the verge of destruction.|$|R
50|$|The house, {{which was}} already in a {{dilapidated}} condition, crumbled down to dust in 1897. <b>No</b> <b>initiative</b> could be taken {{at that time to}} restore the house. In the same year Vivekananda returned from the West.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly so," [...] Nevitt put in, with a satirical smile. [...] "I said so just now. You've <b>no</b> <b>initiative.</b> Cyril wouldn't be afraid. Knowing the {{interests}} at stake, he'd take a firm stand and act off-hand {{on his own}} discretion." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{inscription}} at Yad Vashem {{states that}} Pius XII's record during the Holocaust was controversial, {{and that he}} negotiated a concordat with the Nazis, maintained Vatican neutrality during the war and, formerly stated that he took <b>no</b> <b>initiatives</b> to save Jews.|$|R
50|$|The United States has <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> {{process at}} the {{national}} level, but the initiative is in use {{at the level of}} state government in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and is also in common use at the local government level.|$|R
5000|$|A {{system that}} has no input from {{employees}} minimises access {{to one of the}} most valuable resources that a business has; the ideas of the people who are working on the [...] "front line". As a result, employees will show <b>no</b> <b>initiative,</b> which can reduce productivity.|$|R
50|$|Every {{year the}} people of Muzaffarabad commemorate 3 May by paying respect to the victims. Lectures, {{seminars}} and cultural programmes are held throughout the day {{in memory of the}} victims. A new memorial structure has been built in 2010. <b>No</b> <b>initiative</b> has been taken to preserve the mass burial site.|$|R
25|$|The Indian {{government}} has <b>no</b> schemes/policy <b>initiatives</b> to encourage electric vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, some {{elements}} within the PGA have been promoting <b>No</b> Borders <b>initiatives.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{chair for}} Monsieur Jean Coulois, the great dancer," [...] Selingman ordered, [...] "a glass, and another bottle of wine. Monsieur Jean, my congratulations! But {{a word in}} your ear. Her steps do not match yours. It is you who make the dance. She has <b>no</b> <b>initiative.</b> She can do nothing but imitate," [...] he added.|$|R
25|$|The {{political}} outlook appeared encouraging at first, but {{the party}} displayed <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> to achieve anything, the Liberals and Gladstone having lost the election. Isaac Butt displayed lack of leadership, {{did not commit}} his party to anything. He made some excellent speeches but failed to persuade any of the major parties to support bills beneficial to Ireland, nothing worthwhile reaching the statute books.|$|R
6000|$|... "Clever chaps," [...] remarked Cossar, [...] "but <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> whatever. Cousin Jane indeed! I know her. Rot, these Cousin Janes! Country {{infested with}} 'em. I suppose I {{shall have to}} spend the whole blessed night, seeing they do what they know {{perfectly}} well they ought to do all along. I wonder if it's Research makes 'em like that or Cousin Jane or what?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Assisted {{suicide is}} illegal. [...] "At the current time, there are <b>no</b> <b>initiatives</b> in Iceland that seek {{the legalization of}} {{euthanasia}} or assisted suicide. The discussion on euthanasia has never received any interest in Iceland, and both lay people and health care professionals seem to have {{little interest in the}} topic. A few articles have appeared in newspapers but gained little attention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Christian Young {{has never}} had any {{experience}} with large boats. Besides, we can't afford to pay him what he's clearing on the Minerva. Sparrowhawk is a good man--to take orders. He has <b>no</b> <b>initiative.</b> He's an able sailor, but he can't command. I tell you I was nervous {{all the time he}} had charge of the Flibberty at Poonga-Poonga when I had to stay by the Martha." ...|$|R
50|$|The first vicar in the parish, Ulrik Koren, was not {{particularly}} enthusiastic about building a church at Mudtgulen, as this would imply crossing the Frøysjøen strait {{in all kinds of}} weather. The vicar on his part took <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> to build more churches in the parish. A new church was built on the island of Frøya in the 1860s, moving the parish church to a more central location.|$|R
50|$|Thirdly {{there is}} <b>no</b> {{political}} <b>initiative</b> {{to make it}} a tourist destination by developing it as an attractive gateway to nearby Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|After the {{election}} forty-six members assembled in Dublin and organised {{themselves into a}} separate Irish parliamentary party in the Commons. The political outlook appeared encouraging at first, but the party displayed <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> to achieve anything, the Liberals and Gladstone having lost {{the election}}. Butt displayed lack of leadership, did not commit his party to anything. He made some excellent speeches but failed to persuade any of the major parties to support bills beneficial to Ireland, nothing worthwhile reaching the statute books.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until the {{beginning}} of the Breakup of Yugoslavia there were <b>no</b> <b>initiatives</b> for special libraries for Serbs of Croatia since general libraries had an adequate number of titles from Serbian literature. In the years before, during and after the Croatian War of Independence inter-ethnic relations in Croatia were significantly disrupted. This, among other things, resulted in the mass removal and destruction of literature that conflicting sides considered inappropriate or subversive.|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} {{crisis of the}} NHS and availability and security of jobs for nurses was a major theme of congress 2006. Ms Hewitt’s hostile reception was the worst reaction seen from nurses {{in recent years and}} the media also jumped on the band wagon. Worryingly though, not only did Ms Hewitt state earlier in the week that this has been ‘the best year for the NHS’, but she had <b>no</b> <b>initiatives</b> to offer that might help with the day to day difficulties described by nurses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{taking of}} {{initiative}} has significance in spoken language dialogue systems and in human-computer interaction. A system that takes <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> {{may fail to}} seize opportunities that are important, but a system that always takes the initiative may not allow the user to take the actions he favours. We have implemented a mixed-initiative planning system that adapts its strategy to a nested belief model. In simulation, the planner’s performance was compared to two fixed strategies of always taking the initiative and always declining it, and it performed significantly better than both. ...|$|R
50|$|In March 1944, {{relations}} between Mountbatten and Giffard broke during a crisis {{at the start}} of the Battle of Imphal. Mountbatten acted decisively to obtain transport aircraft from the United States Army Air Force to fly reinforcements and supplies to the isolated Allied troops at Imphal. His Chief of Staff, General Henry Pownall, wrote that Giffard had shown <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> at all. Giffard was notified of his dismissal in May, but was asked to remain in post until his successor, General Oliver Leese, could relieve him. As a result, he remained until October.|$|R
50|$|Since 1974 the All Children Together (ACT) {{movement}} had been lobbying against the segregation in schools in Northern Ireland, however even by 1981 {{there had been}} virtually <b>no</b> <b>initiatives</b> from either the churches or {{the government in the}} direction of integration. Consequently, a small group of parents with children at the age of transfer from primary to secondary school decided to take the initiative with the support of ACT. They founded the school in September 1981 in temporary premises at Ardnavally Activity Centre beside the River Lagan in South Belfast.|$|R
50|$|Unsuccessful {{attempts}} to get initiatives have nevertheless occurred, but since the proposals were bills, not a constitutional amendments, <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> could probably have lawfully been voted on notwithstanding the bills' passage. The first attempt to get national ballot initiatives occurred in 1907 when House Joint Resolution 44 was introduced by Rep. Elmer Fulton of Oklahoma; the proposal was never put to a vote. In 1977, both the Abourezk-Hatfield National Voter Initiative and the Jagt Resolutions never got out of committee. Senator Mike Gravel {{was part of that}} effort.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} calls for Government of Ghana to give {{constitutional}} backing to the Chief Imams office; as of January 2016, <b>no</b> major <b>initiative</b> {{has begun to}} look into the process.|$|R
50|$|A further {{distinction}} {{between these two}} modes (and one not obvious from a modern perspective) is that ostracism was an automatic procedure that required <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> from any individual, with the vote simply occurring on the wish of the electorate — a diffuse exercise of power. By contrast, an Athenian trial needed the initiative of a particular citizen-prosecutor. While prosecution often led to a counterattack (or was a counterattack itself), no such response was possible {{in the case of}} ostracism as responsibility lay with the polity as a whole. In contrast to a trial, ostracism generally reduced political tension rather than increased it.|$|R
50|$|There is <b>no</b> OpenNet <b>Initiative</b> (ONI) country profile, but Hungary {{is shown}} as no {{evidence}} of filtering in all areas (political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools) on the ONI global Internet filtering maps.|$|R
50|$|In November 2010, Love Honor Cherish {{launched}} “Sign for Equality”, {{a social}} networking internet site {{to assist with}} signature gathering. <b>No</b> other <b>initiative</b> has ever sought to be qualified {{based in part on}} signatures gathered through internet-based social networking.|$|R
50|$|Works on {{the eastern}} premetro tunnel under the Carnotstraat and Turnhoutsebaan started in 1977, and were planned to open a few years later. After 5 years of {{tunneling}} and construction works, structural works on the tunnel and stations were largely finished, however, due to austerity measures imposed in the 1980s by the successive Martens governments, and the transfer of authority to the Flemish government after state reforms, construction on the premetro network was put to a halt. Although {{the extension of the}} central premetro axis to Linkeroever, and the construction of the northern premetro axis to the Sportpaleis were finished in the 1990s, <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> was taken to open the eastern premetro axis until recently.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} <b>no</b> statewide <b>initiative</b> or referenda, many {{municipalities}} {{have some form}} of it for issues of local concern. Additionally, five municipalities afford voters the right to recall local elected public officials, a practice that does not extend to state offices.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2013, Prime Minister Donald Tusk officially {{stated that}} a new project of civil unions bill will be {{presented}} to the parliament [...] "in two months time", i.e. it was expected in May 2013, but until present (April 2014) <b>no</b> such <b>initiatives</b> took place.|$|R
2500|$|With {{these figures}} Gleizes {{attempts}} to present, {{under the most}} simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), {{the creation of a}} spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> taken {{on the part of the}} artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is [...] "a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.|$|R
50|$|Free Actions {{take such}} little time {{that can be}} {{performed}} immediately and do not use up time, such as dropping an item, standing up, or calling to an ally. The character in a party with the highest Reflexes stat acts first, or they can hold the action and {{wait to see what}} someone else is doing. There are <b>no</b> <b>Initiative</b> checks unless the Referee decides to randomly see who goes first. In such a case, the Reflexes Stat can be added to the 3d6 die roll. Usually a party of several NPC's act on one Initiative. Initiative is rolled again for each combat Phase, or to save time, the GM can opt to use the same initiative {{for the rest of the}} combat scene.|$|R
40|$|For their unwavering {{support and}} patience, {{and for the}} sacrifices too {{numerous}} to mention, my gratitude goes first and foremost to my husband and son. For their sense of humor, love for life and for always stressing common sense and rational thinking, I also thank my entire family. For introducing me to pragmatic inquiry, critiquing my ideas about this project and for motivating me along the way, I appreciate the support I received from Dr. Patricia Shields. Finally, without the determination and commitment demonstrated by the City of Austin and African-American community representatives, there would be <b>no</b> <b>initiative</b> about which to write. Thank you all for striving to make a satisfying quality of life attainable for everyone in Austin, Texas...|$|R
