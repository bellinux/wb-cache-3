The design consisted of the logic of a Wang 500 calculator hooked up to an OEM-manufactured IBM Selectric typewriter for keying and printing, and dual cassette decks for storage. Harold Koplow, who had written the microcode for the Wang 700 (and its derivative, the Wang 500) rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of <b>number</b> <b>crunching.</b>|$|E

He had also read something about the recent phenomenon of computers, and from his experience as a radar technician, he knew that information could be analyzed and displayed on a screen. He envisioned intellectual workers sitting at display [...] "working stations", flying through information space, harnessing their collective intellectual capacity to solve important problems together in much more powerful ways. Harnessing collective intellect, facilitated by interactive computers, became his life's mission at a time when computers were viewed as <b>number</b> <b>crunching</b> tools.|$|E

Combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as [...] "boring" [...] until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed.

500|$|The Saturn's design {{elicited}} mixed commentary among game {{developers and}} journalists. Developers quoted by Next Generation in December 1995 described the Saturn as [...] "a real coder's machine" [...] for [...] "those {{who love to}} get their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware", with [...] "more flexibility" [...] and [...] "more calculating power than the PlayStation". The Saturn's sound board was also widely praised. By contrast, Lobotomy Software programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly slower than the PlayStation, whereas Kenji Eno of WARP observed little {{difference between the two}} systems. In particular, Dreisbach criticized the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals as its basic geometric primitive, in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. Ken Humphries of Time Warner Interactive remarked that compared to the PlayStation, the Saturn was markedly worse at generating polygons but markedly better at sprite-based graphics. Third-party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful software libraries and development tools, requiring developers to write in assembly language to achieve good performance. During early Saturn development, programming in assembly could offer a two-to-fivefold speed increase over higher-level languages like C.s <b>number</b> <b>crunching</b> was handled by four serial DSPs that were way too costly to be included in any home system. Sega's consequent development of the SH-2 meant that it could also produce a Saturn-compatible arcade system.}} The Saturn hardware is considered extremely difficult to emulate. Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier. Sega of America also purchased a United Kingdom-based development firm, Cross Products, to produce the Saturn's official development system. Despite these challenges, Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn. Traveller's Tales' Jon Burton opined that while the PlayStation was easier [...] "to get started on... you quickly reach [...] limits", whereas the Saturn's [...] "complicated" [...] hardware had the ability to [...] "improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly." [...] A major point of criticism was the Saturn's use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space. The PlayStation functioned in a similar manner, but also featured a dedicated [...] "Geometry Transfer Engine" [...] that rendered additional polygons. As a result, several analysts described the Saturn as an [...] "essentially" [...] 2D system.|$|E

2500|$|Engelbart had {{assembled}} {{a team of}} computer engineers and programmers at his Augmentation Research Center (ARC) located in Stanford University's Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the early 1960s. His idea was to free computing from merely being about <b>number</b> <b>crunching</b> and for it to become a tool for communications and information-retrieval. He wanted to turn Vannevar Bush's idea for a Memex machine into reality, where a machine used interactively by one person could [...] "Augment" [...] their intelligence. Over the course of six years, with the funding help of both NASA and ARPA, his team went about putting together all the elements that would make such a computer system a reality.

40|$|Wide angle {{celestial}} structures, such {{as bright}} comet tails and nearby galaxies and clusters of galaxies, rely on photographic methods for quantified morphology and photometry, primarily because electronic devices with comparable resolution and sky coverage are beyond current technological capability. The {{problem of the}} photometry of extended structures and of how this problem may be overcome through calibration by photometric standard stars is examined. The perfect properties of the ideal field of view are stated {{in the guise of}} a radiometric paraxial approximation, in the hope that fields of view of actual telescopes will conform. Fundamental radiometric concepts are worked through before the issue of atmospheric attenuation is addressed. The independence of observed atmospheric extinction and surface brightness leads off the quest for formal solutions to the problem of surface photometry. Methods and problems of solution are discussed. The spectre is confronted in the spirit of standard stars and shown to be chimerical in that light, provided certain rituals are adopted. After a brief discussion of Baker-Sampson polynomials and the vexing issue of saturation, a pursuit is made of actual numbers to be expected in real cases. While the <b>numbers</b> <b>crunched</b> are gathered ex nihilo, they demonstrate the feasibility of Newton's method in the solution of this overdetermined, nonlinear, least square, multiparametric, photometric problem...|$|R

30|$|There {{has been}} great deal of {{interest}} in understanding the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids [1, 2]. Examples of such rheological complex fluids are blood plasma, chocolate, mustard mayonnaise, tooth paste, shampoo, food stuffs, mud, polymer melts, clay coatings, oils and greases, paints etc. These kinds of fluids offer special challenges to the engineers, modelers, mathematicians, and physicists. The study of non-Newtonian fluids {{is very important in}} view of its applications in various branches of engineering and technology, therefore the flow analysis of these fluids is very important in theory and practice. From a theoretical point of view, flows of this type are fundamental in fluid mechanics. Practically speaking, these flows have applications in many manufacturing processes in industry. Due to the great diversity in the physical structures of non-Newtonian fluids, {{it is not possible to}} establish a single constitutive equation. Thus, many non-Newtonian fluid models have been proposed of which most are empirical or semi-empirical. The equations of motion for non-Newtonian fluids are much more complicated and are of higher order than the Navier-Stokes equations. The solutions of most of the problems in the real world are usually even numerical, on computers. However, analytical solutions, even if they may not be accurate, can provide some penetrating insight into the physics of a problem which manages a maze of <b>numbers</b> <b>crunched</b> on a computer. For that reason, researchers still look for analytical solutions of the known and unknown problems, particularly the former, as they can act as a bench mark for the latter. Various analytical and numerical approaches/methods by a number of people with and without slip condition [3 – 26] have been done.|$|R
