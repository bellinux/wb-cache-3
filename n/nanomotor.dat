40|$|We {{report a}} {{controllable}} and precision approach in manipulating catalytic <b>nanomotors</b> by strategically applied electric (E-) fields {{in three dimensions}} (3 -D). With the high controllability, the catalytic <b>nanomotors</b> have demonstrated new versa-tility in capturing, delivering, and releasing of cargos to designated locations as well as in-situ integration with nanome-chanical devices (NEMS) to chemically power the actuation. With combined AC and DC E-fields, catalytic <b>nanomotors</b> can be accurately aligned by the AC E-fields and instantly change their speeds by the DC E-fields. Within the 3 -D orthog-onal microelectrode sets, the in-plane transport of catalytic <b>nanomotors</b> can be swiftly turned on and off, and these cata-lytic <b>nanomotors</b> can also move in the vertical direction. The interplaying nanoforces that govern the propulsion and alignment are investigated. The modeling of catalytic <b>nanomotors</b> proposed in previous works has been confirmed quan-titatively here. Finally, the prowess of the precision manipulation of catalytic <b>nanomotors</b> by E-fields is demonstrated in two applications: the capture, transport, and release of cargos to pre-patterned microdocks, and the assembly of catalytic <b>nanomotors</b> on NEMS to power the continuous rotation. The innovative concepts and approaches reported in this work could further advance ideal applications of catalytic <b>nanomotors,</b> e. g. for assembling and powering nanomachines, nano-robots, and complex NEMS devices...|$|R
50|$|Since 2004, {{different}} types of nanotube and nanowire based motors have been developed. Most of these <b>nanomotors</b> use hygrogen peroxide as fuel, but some notable exceptions exist. These silver halide and silver-platinum <b>nanomotors</b> are powered by halide fuels, which can be regenerated by exposure to ambient light. Some <b>nanomotors</b> can even be propelled by multiple stimuli, with varying responses. These multi-functional nanowires move in different directions depending on the stimulus (e.g. chemical fuel or ultrasonic power) applied. In Dresdan Germany, rolled-up microtube <b>nanomotors</b> produced motion by harnessing the bubbles in catalytic reactions. The bubble-induced propulsion enables motor movement in relevant biological fluids, but typically requies toxic fuels such as hydrogen peroxide. This has limited their in vitro applications. Further research into catalytical <b>nanomotors</b> holds major promise for important cargo-towing applications, ranging from cell sorting microchip devices to directed drug delivery. Such in-vivo applications of microtube motors were described {{for the first time}} by Joseph Wang and Liangfang Zhang using gastric acid as fuel.|$|R
50|$|Nanomotors are broadly {{classified}} into biological, hybrid and non-biological ones. Biological nanomotors are typically the microscopic engines {{created by the}} nature like the bacterial flagella which can come into motion by using ATP synthase, produced within the cell. This motor allows the bacterial to move independently. The man made counterpart is called a non-biological <b>nanomotor</b> and mimics the function of natural or biological <b>nanomotor</b> to allow the devices to work. However, these man-made nanodevices are less efficient compared to the biological counterpart. They require certain functionalization to accelerate movement or to improve {{the functions of the}} artificial <b>nanomotor.</b> For instance incorporation of carbon nanotube into platinum component of asymmetric metal nanowire leads to its dramatically accelerated movement in hydrogen peroxide solution. The hybrid <b>nanomotor</b> uses the chemical principle which are regularly observed in the biological <b>nanomotor</b> and other principles like magnetic interactions to perform their functions.|$|E
50|$|As {{demonstrated}} {{in the works of}} various researchers, nanotechnology has a great ability to power and improve several natural biological devices by replacing those entities and mimicking natural processes within the living being. The primary concern behind such an approach is to provide an alternative source with higher ability under a controlled environment. One of the breakthrough discoveries among them is the <b>nanomotor,</b> a tiny device which has the ability to convert various forms of energy into motion using approaches observed in nature. The discovery in this field explains the use of wave and particle properties together to make the <b>nanomotor</b> work. This leads to observation of the so-called plasmonic <b>nanomotor</b> using the properties of plasmon to make the <b>nanomotor</b> work. Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California (UC) Berkeley have created the first nano-sized light mill motor whose rotational speed and direction can be controlled by tuning the frequency of the incident light waves.|$|E

5000|$|A {{nanoscale}} plasmonic motor (sometimes {{called a}} [...] "light mill") {{is a type}} of <b>nanomotor,</b> converting light energy to rotational motion at nanoscale. It is constructed from pieces of gold sheet in a gammadion shape, embedded within layers of silica. When irradiated with light from a laser, the gold pieces rotate. The functioning is explained by the quantum concept of the plasmon. This type of <b>nanomotor</b> is much smaller than other types, and its operation can be controlled by varying the frequency of the incident light.|$|E

In this particular case, the tubular <b>nanomotors</b> are fabricated using AAO membranes, obtaining tubular bimetallic <b>nanomotors.</b> Firstly, a sacrificial copper layer is deposited, followed by two more deposition steps: one of platinum and one of gold, resulting in a tubular nanometric motor with two defined sections (see Figure  4 AIII) [36].|$|R
50|$|Nanomotors are {{the focus}} of {{research}} for their ability to overcome microfluidic dynamics present at low Reynold's numbers. Scallop Theory is the basis for nanomotors to produce motion at low Reynold's numbers. The motion is achieved by breaking different symmetries. In addition, Brownian motion must be considered because particle interaction can dramatically impact the ability of a <b>nanomotor</b> to traverse through a liquid. This can pose a significant problem when designing new nanomotors. Current <b>nanomotor</b> research seeks to overcome these problems, and by doing so can improve current microfluidic devices or give rise to new technologies.|$|E

This relevant report pointed out that velocity, direction and rotation were strongly dependent on the nature of light (wavelength) impinging upon the motor.|$|E

He has also pioneered the use of body-worn printed flexible electrochemical sensors and biofuel cells (including textile and epidermal-tattoo devices), microneedle-based electrochemical biosensors for real-time, pain-free quantification of circulating metabolites and electrolytes, 'green' bismuth electrodes for sensing toxic metals and remote submersible devices for continuous environmental monitoring.|$|E
50|$|Micromotors and <b>nanomotors</b> {{can also}} move {{preferentially}} {{in the direction}} of externally applied chemical gradient, defined as chemotaxis. Chemotaxis has been observed in self-propelled Au-Pt nanorods, which diffuse towards the source of hydrogen peroxide, when placed in a gradient of the chemical. Silica microparticles with Grubbs catalyst tethered to them, also move towards higher monomer concentrations. Enzymes also behave as <b>nanomotors</b> and migrate towards regions of higher substrate concentration. Chemotaxis provides a way of directing motion at the microscale and can be used for drug delivery, sensing, lab-on-a-chip devices and other applications.|$|R

40|$|Controlled {{motion of}} {{artificial}} <b>nanomotors</b> in biological environments, such as blood, {{can lead to}} fascinating biomedical applications, ranging from targeted drug delivery to microsurgery and many more. In spite of the various strategies used in fabricating and actuating <b>nanomotors,</b> practical issues related to fuel requirement, corrosion, and liquid viscosity have limited the motion of <b>nanomotors</b> to model systems such as water, serum, or biofluids diluted with toxic chemical fuels, such as hydrogen peroxide. As we demonstrate here, integrating conformal ferrite coatings with magnetic nanohelices offer a promising combination of functionalities for having controlled motion in practical biological fluids, such as chemical stability, cytocompatibility, and the generated thrust. These coatings {{were found to be}} stable in various biofluids, including human blood, even after overnight incubation, and did not have significant influence on the propulsion efficiency of the magnetically driven nanohelices, thereby facilitating the first successful ``voyage'' of artificial <b>nanomotors</b> in human blood. The motion of the ``nanovoyager'' was found to show interesting stick-slip dynamics, an effect originating in the colloidal jamming of blood cells in the plasma. The system of magnetic ``nanovoyagers'' was found to be cytocompatible with C 2 C 12 mouse myoblast cells, as confirmed using MTT assay and fluorescence microscopy observations of cell morphology.

5000|$|While {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} utilized by artists for centuries, {{such as in}} the famous Lycurgus cup, actual research into nanotechnology did not come about until recently. In 1959, Richard Feynman gave a famous talk entitled [...] "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" [...] at the American Physical Society's conference hosted at Caltech. He went on to wage a scientific bet that no one person could design a motor smaller than 400 µm on any side. The purpose of the bet (as with most scientific bets) was to inspire scientists to develop new technologies, and anyone who could develop a <b>nanomotor</b> could claim the $1,000 USD prize. However, his purpose was thwarted by William McLellan, who fabricated a <b>nanomotor</b> without developing new methods.

40|$|International audienceWe report Au/Ru core–shell {{nanowire}} motors. These nanowires are fabricated {{using our}} previously developed electrodeposition-based technique, and their catalytic locomotion {{in the presence}} of H 2 O 2 is investigated. Unlike conventional bimetallic nanowires that are self-electroosmotically propelled, our open-ended Au/Ru core–shell nanowires show both a noticeable decrease in rotational diffusivity and increase in motor speed with increasing nanowire length. Numerical modeling based on self-electroosmosis attributes decreases in rotational diffusivity to the formation of toroidal vortices at the nanowire tail, but fails to explain the speed increase with length. To reconcile this inconsistency, we propose a combined mechanism of self-diffusiophoresis and electroosmosis based on the oxygen gradient produced by catalytic shells. This mechanism successfully explains not only the speed increase of Au/Ru core–shell <b>nanomotors</b> with increasing length, but also the large variation in speed among Au/Ru, Au/Rh, and Rh/Au core–shell <b>nanomotors.</b> The possible contribution of diffusiophoresis to an otherwise well-established electroosmotic mechanism sheds light on future designs of <b>nanomotors,</b> at the same time highlighting the complex nature of nanoscale propulsion...|$|R

If unchecked such mechanical replication could potentially consume whole ecoregions or the whole Earth (ecophagy), or it could simply outcompete natural lifeforms for necessary resources such as carbon, ATP, or UV light (which some <b>nanomotor</b> examples run on). However, the ecophagy and 'grey goo' scenarios, like synthetic molecular assemblers, are based upon still-hypothetical technologies that have not yet been demonstrated experimentally.|$|E

Crucial to the application of <b>nanomotors</b> in biosensing and biomedical applications is the ability to remotely control and steer them toward targets of interest, such as specific cells and tissues. We demonstrate in vitro magnetic steering of acoustically powered nanorod motors in a biologically compatible environment. Steering was accomplished by incorporating (40 ± 5) nm thick nickel stripes into the electrochemically grown nanowires. An external magnetic field of 40 − 45 mT was used to orient the motors, which were acoustically propelled along their long axes. In the absence of a magnetic field, (300 ± 30) nm diameter, (4. 3 ± 0. 2) μm long nanowires with (40 ± 5) nm thick magnetic stripes exhibit the same self-acoustophoretic behavior, including pattern formation into concentric nanowire circles, aligned spinning chains, and autonomous axial motion, as their non-magnetic counterparts. In a magnetic field, these wires and their paths are oriented as evidenced by their relatively linear trajectories.
