40|$|It is {{twenty years}} since the last {{thorough}} review of the <b>National</b> <b>Classification</b> <b>System,</b> and those twenty years have witnessed the burgeoning {{of the internet and}} the impact of convergence on {{what used to be the}} separate spheres of media, telecommunications and information and communication technologies. Over that time there has been an increasing emphasis placed on children: the need to promote their opportunities in the digital world, and the responsibility of parents, policy makers, content providers and other adults to help protect them from risks. This paper examines the recommendations of the <b>National</b> <b>Classification</b> <b>System</b> Review bearing in mind the findings of AU Kids Online, a research project with 400 Australian children aged 9 – 16 and the parent most involved in their internet use. The AU Kids Online research was commissioned by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation and parallels the activities of the € 2. 5 million EU Kids Online research network, which was funded by the European Commission to ensure a robust evidence base for policy development in this critical area. Protecting children from harm while promoting confidence, competence and enjoyment, in terms of their digital skills and activities, is clearly a core concern of a revised <b>National</b> <b>Classification</b> <b>System...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{framework}} for a <b>national</b> <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> for agricultural cropland anomalies utilizing remote sensing information is presented. Cropland anomalies in Midwest USA {{have been identified}} in field crops of corn (Zea mays), soybeans (Glycine max), wheat (Triticum), and miscellaneous hay crops such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa). By identifying cropland anomalies through ground observations and describing the characteristics associated with them, it is possible to group them according to common casual properties such as water, nutrition, weeds, insects, disease, and management, leading {{to the development of a}} Cropland Anomaly Classification System. This system advances understanding of specific anomalies and provides an environment for standardization of anomaly characteristics while allowing the possibility for producers and managers to make sound economic decisions. The introductions of new technologies in remote sensing such as increased spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution will cause continual development and improvement of the proposed Anomaly Classification System...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} English- and Spanish-speaking psychologists’ and psychiatrists’ opinions regarding problematic, absent and stigmatizing diagnoses in current mental disorders classifications (ICD- 10 and DSM-IV), and their perceived {{need for a}} national classification of mental disorders. Answers to open-ended questions included in WHO-WPA and WHO-IUPsyS surveys were examined using an inductive content-analysis method. A total of 3, 222 participants from 35 countries were included. The most problematic diagnostic group was personality disorders, especially among psychiatrists, because of poor validity and lack of specificity. Complex posttraumatic stress disorder was the most frequent diagnosis suggested for inclusion, mainly by psychologists, to better account for the distinct processes and consequences of complex trauma. Schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently identified as stigmatizing, particularly by psychiatrists, {{due to lack of}} public understanding or knowledge about the diagnosis. Of the 14. 4 % of participants who perceived a need for a <b>national</b> <b>classification</b> <b>system,</b> two-thirds were from Africa or Latin America. The rationales provided were that mental disorders classifications should consider cultural and socio-historical diversity in the expression of psychopathology, differences in the perception of what is and is not pathological in different nations, and the existence of culture-bound syndromes.

Prevention and management of {{cardiovascular diseases}} necessitate the existence of a comprehensive system for recording data. Patient medical document {{is one of the most}} important data which should be classified so to facilitate and expedite the treatment process. A comparison of cardiovascular disease classification systems could assist health care policy makers to battle cardiovascular diseases. Materials and Methods : This descriptive-comparative study conducted during years 2007 - 2008. The cardiovascular diseases classification systems in USA, Australia, England and Canada were reviewed. Data collecting was done through literature review, Internet and e-mail. Results : The cardiovascular disease classification systems of all the developed countries are national. The developed countries, with the exception of England, utilize a multiracial classification model, especially designed to reflect the individual requirements of every single one of them. This model employs health care standards, e-learning, annual educational programs, and consultation with experts. Iran lacks such a <b>national</b> <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> for cardiovascular diseases. Discussion and Conclusion : In order to improve the management and prevention of cardiovascular diseases in Iran, it is essential that the cardiovascular disease classification system in the country be national...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Workbook {{is to provide a}} screening-level method for prioritizing {{petroleum}} exploration and production sites for remediation that is based on readily available information, but which does not require a full characterization of the sites being evaluated. The process draws heavily from the Canadian <b>National</b> <b>Classification</b> <b>System</b> for Contaminated Sites, and fits into the framework for ecological risk assessment provided in guidance from the US Environmental Protection Agency. Using this approach, scoring guidelines are provided for a number of Evaluation Factors relating to: (1) the contaminants present at the site; (2) the potential exposure pathways for these contaminants; and (3) the potential receptors of those contaminants. The process therefore incorporates a risk-based corrective action (RBCA) framework to estimate the relative threat posed by a site to human health and to ecological systems. Physical (non-toxic) disturbance factors have also been incorporated into the process. It {{should also be noted that}} the process described in this Workbook has not yet been field tested at petroleum E and P sites. The first logical step in the field testing of this process is to apply the method at a small number of sites to assess the availability of the information that is needed to score each evaluation factor. Following this evaluation, the Workbook process should be applied at a series of sites to determine the effectiveness of the process at ranking sites according to their relative need for remediation. Upon completion of these tests, the Workbook should be revised to reflect the findings of the field tests...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND. The large {{data bases}} of the Dutch {{cervical}} screening {{program can be}} exploited to establish the relation between urbanization and the incidence of abnormalities of the squamous and glandular epithelium, including mild or greater changes of the squamous and glandular epithelium of the cervix. METHODS. Six cytology laboratories {{in the context of}} the Dutch cervical screening program screened over 190, 000 cervical smears. Urbanization (place of residence) data were derived from postal codes. All smears were coded with the Dutch national coding system, the Dutch <b>national</b> <b>classification</b> <b>system</b> KOPAC, in which squamous abnormalities are coded S 4 -S 9, and glandular cell changes are coded G 4 -G 9. From the scores per 1000 screened women, the relative risk (1111) of living in a large city compared with living in rural areas was calculated. To investigate a trend in incidence in relation to urbanization, the Schaafsma method was used. RESULTS. Of the smears with positive cytology, mild squamous dysplasia (S 4) had the highest incidence per 1000 screened women (4. 32), and the lowest incidence was found for adenocarcinoma (in situ; G 7 /G 9; RR, 0. 07). The RR for urban women ranged from 1. 73 for moderate squamous dysplasia (S 5) to 7. 55 for adenocarcinoma (in situ; G 7 /G 9). For smears with positive cytology for both squamous and glandular abnormalities, the Schaafsma method indicated a significant positive trend. CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of squamous and glandular abnormalities are maximal in women who live in a large city, which, in The Netherlands, is where there also is a population at high risk for human papillomavirus and bacterial vaginosis.

40|$|Express {{roads are}} a rather {{miscellaneous}} road category hierarchically situated between motorways and ordinary single carriageway interurban roads. In general, the safety record of express roads is bad, in particular {{when compared to}} motorways. Nevertheless, they exist, and {{they will continue to}} exist. For example, express roads will form {{an integral part of the}} Trans European Road Network (TERN). The current report reports on part of the work carried out in the framework of SAFESTAR Working Package 3 : (i) an inventory in a number of EU Member States on the current status and characteristics of road which could be classified as express roads; (ii) an inventory of the decision making process and an interview on a Dutch case; and (iii) an expert workshop on express roads identifying the main design elements affecting their safety level. It is concluded that express-type roads exist in most EU countries. However, they are often named differently and can often be found in more than one road category of the <b>national</b> <b>classification</b> <b>system.</b> Cross sectional design and intersection design differ widely as well, both between countries and within countries. This makes it impossible to define an express road in terms of geometric design characteristics. However, it was possible to define an express road in terms of its functional characteristics: a medium to high capacity road for long distance traffic with limited access and closed for non-motorised traffic. The main elements affecting the safety level of express roads were identified as cross section design (in particular separating opposing traffic streams), intersection design, and road side design. The decision on the type of road appears to be mainly based on (expected) traffic volumes and financial resources. Occasionally, environmental considerations play a role as well. Safety arguments hardly play a role at all. (A...|$|E
40|$|Readily {{accessible}} {{information of}} up-to-data geo-referenced land resources {{is being requested}} with increasing frequency. This demand comes {{not only from the}} traditional group of researchers on land resources, but also from others such as the environmentalists using land resource data for their modeling (e. g. global change). Increased data storage capacity, faster processing speeds, improved database management and the use of geographical information systems have made it possible to provide more information in a shorter time, at lower costs and in formats suited to the need of the user. In many cases traditional soil survey reports with maps, as common in the past, have been replaced by tailor made databases, which stores profile information linking it only to the polygons of the soil map. A more comprehensive approach is making use of a relational database management system and geographic information system (GIS) linking the soil and land attributes to its spatial distribution. This has resulted {{in the development of the}} SOTER methodology (Soil and Terrain digital database) for storage of land resources attribute data in a database system, which is linked to `mapping units`, the SOTER units. These units are defined on their unique combination of terrain and soil characteristics. Once the SOTER units are defined and described in the database the information can serve for all kind of interpretations and assessments such as land evaluation, erosion risk assessment and, for production assessments and modeling. The SOTER methodology is standardized; it describes most attributes according to the Guidelines for Soil Profile Description (FAO, 1990) and the legend of the Soil Map of the World (FAO, 1988). The present SOTER database has the possibility for soil classification inputs, not only according to the FAO- 1988 version and WRB (1998), but also for a <b>national</b> <b>classification</b> <b>system.</b> The link of the database to geo-referenced SOTER units makes it possible to produce thematic maps in formats suited for different users...|$|E
