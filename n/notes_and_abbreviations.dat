40|$|After a methodological {{foreword}} to the sources'acquisition, {{the author}} describes {{the history of}} the National Library of Medecine (NLM), whose aim was (and is) to gather, to classify and to publish biomedical bibliographical references through the information technologies which have been developing since 1818 till nowadays from hardcopy into MEDLINE via Internet. The author explains the concept of MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) and describes the structure of the Thesaurus MeSH: a vocabulary containing all the subjects which are used for the articles'indexing. The MeSH Browser has got all the MeSH describers which are in the hardcopy of the Medical Subject Heading, with the relative <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>abbreviations</b> of the corresponding subheadings: that is a classification of subheadings representing a particular aspect of the describer to which they refer. Finally, the author describes how the MEDLINE and PubMed work: the former is available through the electronic subscription to CSA (Cambridge Scientific Abstract), the latter is free and available on the NLM website. Through the several search options (free search, advanced search with boolean operators, field search or subject search etc [...] .) one can find the selected bibliographical references in the above mentioned databases, which provide abstracts of articles and sometimes the possibility of reading the articles in full text, thanks to the link to the journals' websites...|$|R

The modules incorporated patient background information, 13 videos, nationally recognized policies, procedures and documentation that facilitate medication management, simulated medication management activities (i.e. admission medication reconciliation, interpret hospital <b>notes</b> <b>and</b> charts with <b>abbreviations,</b> identifying <b>and</b> addressing MRPs), practice questions, pre- and post-tests, and an evaluation and feedback questionnaire. In {{addition to the}} medication management activities, the simulation-based aspects of the package included videos with actors to portray an unfolding scenario as a patient received care in a hospital and community setting, as well as hospital and community pharmacists and other health professionals simulating various aspects of medication management processes, such as an initial assessment, medication reconciliation, interprofessional team meetings and a home visit. Woven throughout the package were modules that incorporated strategies to manage high risk medicines in order to emphasise potential for medication errors and approaches to improve medication safety (The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia 2015).|$|R
