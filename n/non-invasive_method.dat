25|$|In {{patients}} who are at high likelihood of having OSA, a randomized controlled trial found that home oximetry (a <b>non-invasive</b> <b>method</b> of monitoring blood oxygenation) may be adequate and easier to obtain than formal polysomnography. High probability patients were identified by an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater and a Sleep Apnea Clinical Score (SACS) of 15 or greater. Home oximetry, however, does not measure apneic events or respiratory event-related arousals and thus does not produce an AHI value.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{push-pull}} cannula, microdialysis and in vivo voltammetry, fMRS is a <b>non-invasive</b> <b>method</b> {{for studying}} dynamics of biochemistry in an activated brain. It is done without exposing subjects to ionizing radiation {{like it is}} done in positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. fMRS gives a more direct measurement of cellular events occurring during brain activation than BOLD fMRI or PET which rely on hemodynamic responses and show only global neuronal energy uptake during brain activation while fMRS gives also information about underlying metabolic processes that support the working brain.|$|E
25|$|Electrical Cardiometry is a <b>non-invasive</b> <b>method</b> {{similar to}} Impedance cardiography; both methods measure {{thoracic}} electrical bioimpedance (TEB). The underlying model differs {{between the two}} methods; Electrical cardiometry attributes the steep increase of TEB beat-to-beat to the change in orientation of red blood cells. Four standard ECG electrodes are required for measurement of cardiac output. Electrical Cardiometry is a method trademarked by Cardiotronic, Inc., and shows promising results {{in a wide range}} of patients. It is currently approved in the US for use in adults, children and babies. Electrical cardiometry monitors have shown promise in postoperative cardiac surgical patients, in both haemodynamicially stable and unstable cases.|$|E

40|$|Quantification of {{regional}} {{cerebral blood flow}} (CBF) using [(15) O]H 2 O positron emission tomography (PET) {{requires the use of}} an arterial input function. Arterial sampling, however, is not always possible, for example in ill-conditioned or paediatric patients. Therefore, it is of interest to explore the use of <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods</b> for the quantification of CBF. For validation of <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods,</b> test-retest normal and hypercapnia data from 15 healthy volunteers were used. For each subject, the data consisted of up to five dynamic [(15) O]H 2 O brain PET studies of 10 [*]min and including arterial sampling. A measure of CBF was estimated using several <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods</b> earlier reported in literature. In addition, various parameters were derived from the time-activity curve (TAC). Performance of these methods was assessed by comparison with full kinetic analysis using correlation and agreement analysis. The analysis was repeated with normalization to the whole brain grey matter value, providing relative CBF distributions. A reliable, absolute quantitative estimate of CBF could not be obtained with the reported <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods.</b> Relative (normalized) CBF was best estimated using the double integration metho...|$|R

25|$|Echocardiography is a <b>non-invasive</b> <b>method</b> of {{quantifying}} {{cardiac output}} using ultrasound. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound and Doppler measurements are used together to calculate cardiac output. 2D {{measurement of the}} diameter (d) of the aortic annulus allows calculation of the flow cross-sectional area (CSA), which is then multiplied by the VTI of the Doppler flow profile across the aortic valve to determine the flow volume per beat (stroke volume, SV). The result is then multiplied by the heart rate (HR) to obtain cardiac output. Although used in clinical medicine, it has a wide test-retest variability. It is said to require extensive training and skill, but the exact steps needed to achieve clinically adequate precision have never been disclosed. 2D measurement of the aortic valve diameter is one source of noise; others are beat-to-beat variation in stroke volume and subtle differences in probe position. An alternative {{that is not necessarily}} more reproducible is the measurement of the pulmonary valve to calculate right-sided CO. Although it is in wide general use, the technique is time consuming and is limited by the reproducibility of its component elements. In the manner used in clinical practice, precision of SV and CO is of the order of ±20%.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{methods of}} rupture {{assessment}} have been recently reported. The {{majority of these}} approaches involve the numerical analysis of AAAs using the common engineering technique of the finite element method (FEM) to determine the wall stress distributions. Recent reports have shown that these stress distributions {{have been shown to}} correlate to the overall geometry of the AAA rather than solely to the maximum diameter. It is also known that wall stress alone does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength. In light of this, rupture assessment may be more accurate if both the patient-specific wall stress is coupled together with patient-specific wall strength. A <b>non-invasive</b> <b>method</b> of determining patient-dependent wall strength was recently reported, with more traditional approaches to strength determination via tensile testing performed by other researchers in the field. Some of the more recently proposed AAA rupture-risk assessment methods include: AAA wall stress; AAA expansion rate; degree of asymmetry; presence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT); a rupture potential index (RPI); a finite element analysis rupture index (FEARI); biomechanical factors coupled with computer analysis; growth of ILT; geometrical parameters of the AAA; and also a method of determining AAA growth and rupture based on mathematical models.|$|E

Materials and Methods: for evaluating the validity of each of these <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods,</b> the thoracic Kyphosis and lumber Lordosis angle of 20 students of Birjand University (age mean and standard deviation: 26 ± 2, weight: 72 ± 2. 5 kg, height: 169 ± 5. 5 cm) through fours methods of flexible ruler, spinal mouse, and image processing and X-ray. Results: the results indicated that the validity of the methods including flexible ruler, spinal mouse, and image processing in measuring the thoracic Kyphosis and lumber Lordosis angle respectively have an adherence of 0. 81, 0. 87, 0. 73, 0. 76, 0. 83, 0. 89 (p> 0. 05). As a result, regarding the gained validity against the golden method of X-ray, it could be stated that the three mentioned <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods</b> have adequate validity. In addition, the one-way analysis of variance test indicated that there existed a meaningful relationship between the three methods of measuring the thoracic Kyphosis and lumber Lordosis, and with respect to the Tukey’s test result, the image processing method is the most precise one.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of above ground biomass {{is important in}} managing natural resources, like assessing habitat conditions. Direct, destructive measurements by clipping, drying, and weighing plant matter is time consuming and labor intensive. It is of interest to develop <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods</b> to complement or replace direct vegetation harvest. Two <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods</b> were evaluated, light penetration and visual obstruction, in the Purdue Wildlife Area prairie. Light penetration in the grassland plots were measured using a Decagon light stick (LP- 80), 5 cm {{from the ground and}} above the plants. Estimation of visual obstruction was done using a Robel pole, which focuses on the height and density of the vegetation. Plots were also clipped to provide direct measurements. The relationship between clipped and estimated biomass was significant for both <b>non-invasive</b> <b>methods.</b> However, visual obstruction had higher correlation (R 2 = 0. 74) than light penetration (R 2 = 0. 41). This could provide a basis for future interest in predicting biomass using the Robel pole method as a complement to direct clipping of vegetation.
