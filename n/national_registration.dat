25|$|Therefore, {{the status}} of Confucianism in Indonesia in the New Order regime was never clear. De jure, there were {{conflicting}} laws, because the higher law permitted Confucianism, but the lower law did not recognise it.

This practice was applied in many places, including the <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> card, marriage registration, and family registration card. Civics education in Indonesia taught school children that there are only five official religions.|$|E

500|$|With the {{primaries}} wrapped up, McCarthy spent July attempting to woo uncommitted delegates and clarify his {{positions on the}} issues. He continued a strong anti-war sentiment, mentioning that he might travel to Paris, France to discuss peace with the North Vietnamese. Chief negotiators called the potential trip a mistake, and that the talks were too important [...] "to interject partisan politics." [...] Next, the candidate was cited by the emergency committee for gun control chair John Glenn as being one of five presidential candidates that endorsed the group's movement to control firearms. McCarthy argued for a <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> of handguns, {{and the development of}} a system to sell mail order guns only to qualified individuals. But argued that the sale of shotguns and rifles, should be left to the discretion of individual states. The next week, he proposed a [...] "war on hunger" [...] to help the millions of Americans he claimed were starving, commenting that [...] "our first concern is the health of each hungry individual." [...] The Department of Agriculture disputed his claims on the matter. Six days later, McCarthy made his way to Georgia, where he sought additional Democratic delegates to counter Vice President Humphrey's strong organization. The previous day, he had visited Pittsburgh and attended a rally that he hoped would gain Pennsylvania's Democratic delegates and the African-American vote. McCarthy challenged Humphrey to a series of debates on an assortment of issues. The Vice-President accepted the invitation but modified the proposal by requesting there be only one debate prior to the Democratic National Convention. As the month ended, and with the Democratic Convention speedily approaching, McCarthy tried to change a few rules of the convention, focusing a great deal on [...] "unit voting" [...] rule, which gave party bosses more control. The tactics were meant to compensate for Humphrey's delegate lead, and were previously used by Dwight Eisenhower in his successful 1952 campaign, while battling Robert A. Taft for the Republican nomination.|$|E

A similar bill, the <b>National</b> Voter <b>Registration</b> Act of 1991, gained less bipartisan support; it passed in both the Senate and the House, but it was vetoed by President George H.W. Bush.
