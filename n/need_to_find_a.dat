5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This fact {{is important for}} fig wasps—female wasps <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> syconium in which to lay their eggs {{within a few days}} of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time.

5|$|Around 1550 the {{mounting}} conflict {{seems to have}} reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader's marriage to a local woman. Historical texts tie the lineage of the family's leader, Zafikazimambobe, to Anteony noble Ramarohala, who had settled there at least three generations before. Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual, and that the Zafikazimambo family had only newly arrived and so had no demonstrable descent from local nobles. Rather, these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means, and also reflect an awareness among the Antemoro {{of the importance of}} local caste and lineage traditions and their <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> place within them. Upon rising to power, the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier ombiasy (wise men) who practiced astrology and served as scribes; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed. These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities, further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it. The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct sombily (ritual sacrifice) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area. To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia, they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas. In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom. They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island.|$|E

25|$|In June 1954, Vengeance {{was removed}} from active service and {{reclassified}} as the RAN's primary training ship. The previous training ship, the cruiser , had been earmarked in mid-1953 to be decommissioned and scrapped, as modernising her would have been uneconomical. At the same time, the RAN was exploring avenues to reduce operating costs: the reduction of naval aviation from two active carriers to one would provide significant savings. The removal of Vengeance from active service, combined with the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> replacement training ship for Australia which was {{large enough to accommodate}} the large number of National Service trainees, saw the carrier placed in the training role. On 31 August, Vengenace accompanied Australia during the latter's final voyage before decommissioning. The carrier sailed to Japan in late October; her first departure from Australian waters while in RAN service. Vengeance returned to Australia in November, after collecting No. 77 Squadron RAAF.|$|E
25|$|As {{capitalism}} {{developed as}} an economic system in early modern Europe, overseas colonies became increasingly important in the Atlantic trade system. Labor-intensive colonial plantations generated a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> stable, long-term labor force. Indentured servants posed a problem in that they had legal rights and could eventually become a competing force. The advantages of slave labor {{in comparison with the}} disadvantages of indentured servitude contributed to the growth of the European slave trade. Pirates were a bane to English attempts to gain supremacy on the African coast. They disrupted the flow of labor and capital by attacking, capturing and sometimes destroying slave vessels. Pirate captains often absorbed captured slaves into their crews, and blacks, both African and African American made up a substantial part of the pirate vanguard. As long as pirates were actively disrupting the slave trade, they posed a threat to England's dominance in the Atlantic system.|$|E

This was the first time since 2007 that Djokovic had failed to reach the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, and the first time ever in his career that he had lost to a player ranked outside of the top 100 in a Grand Slam tournament. In February and March, Djokovic played at the Mexican Open and the Indian Well Masters, but in both events was eliminated by Nick Kyrgios in third and fourth round, respectively. In April, Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing to David Goffin. After the tournament, he decided to split with his long-time coach Marián Vajda, fitness specialist Gebhard Phil-Gritsch and physioterapeut Miljan Amanović, citing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> winning spark.

25|$|The Cardinals {{announced}} on July 23 {{that they had}} selected the contract of right-hand pitcher Mike Mayers to major his major league debut and start the following day against the Dodgers, a Sunday nationally televised game on ESPN at Busch Stadium. Reliever Miguel Socolovich was optioned to AAA-Memphis. The club {{will be the last}} team in the Majors to employ a sixth starting pitcher this season when Mayers takes the mound. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> fill-in starter {{was the result of the}} Cardinals having to play a doubleheader on July 20, and then a 16-inn. game on July 22. He was destroyed by the Dodgers, giving up 9 runs, all earned, 8 hits (one Double, two HRs), walking two, striking out only one in just 1.1 IP. He endured the shortest start by a pitcher making his Major League debut in 12 years, and the first Cardinals pitcher in 92 years to allow six first-inning runs in his debut. His early exit meant that a bullpen two days removed from covering 10 innings had to shoulder another 7 2/3. Seth Maness threw a career-high 53 pitches over 3 2/3 innings to settle things.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of July 9, 1937 Gershwin {{collapsed}} in Harburg's house, {{where he had been}} working on the score of The Goldwyn Follies.

Leonore called George's close friend Emil Mosbacher and explained the dire <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> neurosurgeon. Mosbacher immediately called pioneering neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in Boston, who, retired for several years by then, recommended Dr. Walter Dandy, who was on a boat fishing in Chesapeake Bay with the governor of Maryland. Mosbacher then called the White House and had a Coast Guard cutter sent to find the governor's yacht and bring Dandy quickly to shore. Mosbacher then chartered a plane and flew Dandy to Newark Airport, where he was to catch a plane to Los Angeles; however, by that time, Gershwin's condition was critical and the need for surgery immediate. In the early hours of July 11th doctors at Cedars removed a large brain tumour, believed to have been a glioblastoma, but Gershwin died on the morning of July 11, 1937, at the age of 38.|$|E

He continued to use his name as a promotional vehicle for over 30 years after his retirement. Richard briefly returned to hockey in 1972 as head coach for the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association.
