40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} problem of {{skeleton}} extraction for large-scale sensor networks using only connectivity information. Existing solutions for this problem heavily depend on an al-gorithm that can accurately detect <b>network</b> <b>boundaries.</b> This dependence may seriously affect the effectiveness of skeleton extraction. For example, in low density <b>networks,</b> <b>boundary</b> detection algorithms normally do not work well, potentially leading to an incorrect skeleton being generated. This paper proposes a novel approach, named DIST, to skeleton extraction from incomplete boundaries using the idea of distance transform, a concept in the computer graphics area. The main contribution is a distributed and low-cost algorithm that produces accurate network skeletons without requiring that the boundaries be complete or tight. The algorithm first establishes the network’s distance transform – the hop distance of each node to the <b>network’s</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Based on this, some critical skeleton nodes are identified. Next, a set of skeleton arcs are generated by controlled flooding; connecting these skeleton arcs then gives us a coarse skeleton. The algorithm finally refines the coarse skeleton by building shortest path trees, followed by a prune phase. The obtained skeletons are robust to boundary noise and shape variations. Index Terms—Sensor networks, skeleton, distance transform, incomplete boundaries. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel methodology for finding the network connectivity in wireless mesh networks while {{taking into account}} dependencies existing between links of geometrically co-located nodes, {{as well as the}} effect of a finite <b>network</b> <b>boundary.</b> We show that the commonly used assumption of link independence almost always underestimate the network connectivity. We also show that the assumption of infinite <b>network</b> <b>boundary</b> is invalid as it overestimates the network connectivity by a non negligible amount. We use our methodology to derive accurate upper bounds for network connectivity in the optimal triangular lattice topology. A comparison study shows that the error due to either assumptions depends on the link connectivity as well as the network size, and can be very significant. The devised methodology can also be applied to any lattice topology in order to quantify the error and define the range of link conductivities within which the assumptions can be used. I...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecently, {{there have}} been several studies {{focusing}} on the implementation of process calculi with distribution and mobility. Among these, Pan and GcPan are distributed abstract machines for executing Safe Ambients, a variant of the Ambient calculus. However, in order to use them or to exploit their implementation techniques, we must assume all-to-all and permanent connectivity in the underlying network; this is inappropriate for most real-world wide-area and mobile networks, in which each private network is delimited by <b>network</b> <b>boundaries</b> and each mobile device may become disconnected at any moment. In this paper, we propose novel abstract machines Panmov, GcPanmov, and GcPanshift that can handle such <b>network</b> <b>boundaries</b> and mobile devices by using a special kind of agents called boundary forwarders. Especially in GcPanshift, operations related to boundary forwarders improve the fault tolerance of user programs.

40|$|We perform {{sensitivity}} analyses {{to assess the}} impact of missing data on the structural properties of social networks. The social network is conceived of as being generated by a bipartite graph, in which actors are linked together via multiple interaction contexts or affiliations. We discuss three principal missing data mechanisms: <b>network</b> <b>boundary</b> specification (non-inclusion of actors or affiliations), survey non-response, and censoring by vertex degree (fixed choice design), examining their impact on the scientific collaboration network from the Los Alamos E-print Archive as well as random bipartite graphs. The results show that <b>network</b> <b>boundary</b> specification and fixed choice designs can dramatically alter estimates of network-level statistics. The observed clustering and assortativity coefficients are overestimated via omission of interaction contexts (affiliations) or fixed choice of affiliations, and underestimated via actor non-response, which results in inflated measurement error. We also find that social networks with multiple interaction contexts have certain surprising properties due to the presence of overlapping cliques. In particular, assortativity by degree does not necessarily improve network robustness to random omission of nodes as predicted by current theory.

In addition, we analyze the robustness of the time-fractional order wave equation with a fractional order boundary controller subject to delayed boundary measurement. Conditions are given to guarantee stability when the delay is small. For large delays, again the Smith predictor is applied to solve the instability problem and the scheme is proved to be robust against a small difference between the assumed delay and the actual delay. The analysis shows that fractional order controllers are better than integer order controllers in the robustness against delays in the boundary measurement...|$|R
