5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
5|$|Despite the parties' ostensibly cordial relations, {{each side}} was highly {{suspicious}} of the other's intentions. For instance, the Soviet invasion of Bukovina in June 1940 went beyond their sphere of influence as agreed with Germany. After Germany entered the Axis Pact with Japan and Italy, it began negotiations about a potential Soviet entry into the pact. After two days of negotiations in Berlin from 12 to 14 November 1940, Germany presented a written proposal for a Soviet entry into the Axis. On 25 November 1940, the Soviet Union offered a written counter-proposal to join the Axis if Germany would agree to refrain from interference in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, but Germany did not respond. As both sides began colliding {{with each other in}} Eastern Europe, conflict appeared more likely, although they did sign a border and commercial agreement addressing several open issues in January 1941. Historian Robert Service avows that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was convinced that the overall military strength of the USSR was such that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> and anticipated an easy victory should Germany attack; moreover, Stalin believed that since the Germans were still fighting the British in the west, Hitler would be unlikely to open up a two front war and subsequently delayed the reconstruction of defensive fortifications in the border regions. When German soldiers swam across the Bug River to warn the Red Army of an impending attack, they were treated like enemy agents and shot. Some historians believe that Stalin, despite providing an amicable front to Hitler, did not wish to remain allies with Germany. Rather, Stalin might have had intentions to break off from Germany and proceed with his own campaign against Germany to be followed by one against the rest of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

25|$|In non-Orthodox {{denominations}} of Judaism most rabbis {{hold that}} Jews have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> {{from engaging in}} theological dialogue, and may have much to gain. Some hold that in practice Soloveitchik's distinctions are not viable, for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse. Thus, since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur, one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} films {{in which his}} {{character}} made an appearance, Stalin took {{a keen interest in}} the work on The Fall of Berlin. The premier intervened in Pavlenko's writing, read the screenplay's manuscript and corrected several grammatical mistakes; he also deleted a short sequence during which a German civilian in Berlin exhorted his family to hasten and flee as the Red Army approaches. German historian Lars Karl believed this signaled his resolution to demonstrate that the civilian populace had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from the Soviets. The picture was the first feature film about the Battle of Berlin and the events in Hitler's bunker, preceding Der letzte Akt by five years.|$|E

25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E
