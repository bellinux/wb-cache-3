5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} like Surendranath Sen, Mohibbul Hasan, N. K. Sinha, and B. Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's religious policies on Christians, conclude {{that he was}} <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> bigot. They argue that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political, not religious reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians who supported the British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E
5|$|Paul was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> man; {{he viewed}} the papacy {{as a means}} to {{consolidate}} his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.|$|E
5|$|Zotov was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> scholar, but he {{knew the}} Bible well—an {{important}} qualification for Tsaritsa Natalia. Although he did not expect it, he was well rewarded before he had even started his work, receiving from Feodor and the Tsaritsa, as well as Patriarch Joachim, gifts including a set of apartments, two new sets of clothing, and 100 rubles. He was also raised {{to the rank of}} a minor nobleman. Zotov was deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the Tsaritsa's request, and was enthralled at the prospect of teaching Peter. Zotov and Peter quickly became good friends, and Zotov remained close to Peter until the former's death.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1999 in Huntington Beach, California with {{original}} members M. Shadows, Zacky Vengeance, The Rev and Matt Wendt.

Upon its formation, each member of the band also took on a pseudonym which were already nicknames of theirs from high school. Matt Wendt was later replaced by Justin 'Sane' Meacham who was previously the bassist for Suburban Legends.|$|E
25|$|The dispute {{was finally}} settled {{by a court}} in London in 1903 in an {{important}} case where the government was represented by Sir Edward Carson, who was a Unionist and Solicitor-General. A pivotal issue in the case were that the finds were all closely packed which was indicative of burial. It was held that the treasure was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> offering and was therefore forfeit to the crown. The treasure was taken to Dublin {{and placed in the}} museum there. Although some have suggested that the gold should be transferred to nearer their find-spot in what is now Northern Ireland, the items remain in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin.|$|E

25|$|Kabbalah's {{definition}} {{varies according to}} the tradition and aims of those following it, from its religious origin {{as an integral part}} of Judaism, to its later Christian, New Age, and Occultist/western esoteric syncretic adaptations. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal, and mysterious Ein Sof (infinity) and the mortal and finite universe (God's creation). While it is heavily used by some denominations, it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> denomination in itself. It forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation. Kabbalah seeks to define the nature of the universe and the human being, the nature and purpose of existence, and various other ontological questions. It also presents methods to aid understanding of the concepts and thereby attain spiritual realization.|$|E
25|$|All {{scientific}} evidence to date concerning {{the origin of}} life implies at least a dualism or the necessity to use several theories to fully explain the relationships between established data points. This dualism is not unique to this field of study, but is also appropriate in other scientific disciplines such as the physics of light. While the Bible and other philosophical treatises also mention creation, science has independently postulated the various theories of creation. Therefore creation in scientific terms is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> or philosophical belief. Also note that creation and evolutionary theories are not necessarily mutual exclusives. Some of the scientific data, for example the regular absence of transitional forms, may be best explained by a creation theory, while other data, for example transmutation of species, substantiate a process of evolution.|$|E
25|$|Nicolas Flamel is a {{well-known}} alchemist, but {{a good example of}} pseudepigraphy, the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Though the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612. Flamel was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher's stone. His work spends {{a great deal of time}} describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone. Through the 14th and 15th centuries, alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. Bernard Trevisan and George Ripley made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.|$|E

25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E
25|$|After {{the sudden}} {{death of the}} {{influential}} Louvois in July 1691 Louis XIV had assumed {{a more active role in}} the direction of military policy, relying on advice from experts such as the Marquis of Chamlay and Vauban. Louvois' death also brought changes to state policy with the less adventurous Duke of Beauvilliers and the Marquis of Pomponne entering Louis XIV's government as ministers of state. From 1691 onwards Louis XIV and Pomponne pursued efforts to unglue the Grand Alliance, including secret talks with Emperor Leopold I and, from August, attempts of religious solidarity with Catholic Spain. The approaches made to Spain came to naught (the Nine Years' War was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> war), but the Maritime Powers were also keen for peace. Talks were hampered, however, by Louis XIV's reluctance to cede his earlier gains (at least those made in the Reunions) and, in his deference to the principle of the divine right of kings, his unwillingness to recognise William III's claim to the English throne. For his part William III was intensely suspicious of Louis XIV and his supposed designs for universal monarchy.|$|E
25|$|The Freemasons were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> community, but functioned {{like one}} {{and had a}} {{powerful}} impact on events in Paris in the 18th century. The first lodge in France, the Grand Loge de France, was founded on 24 June 1738 on the rue des Boucheries, and was led by the Duke of Antin. By 1743 there were sixteen lodges in Paris, and their grand master was the Count of Clermont, close to the royal family. The lodges contained aristocrats, the wealthy, church leaders and scientists. Their doctrines promoted liberty and tolerance, and they were strong supporters of the Enlightenment; Beginning in 1737, the freemasons funded {{the publication of the}} first Encylopedie of Diderot, by a subscription of ten Louis per member per year. By 1771 there were eleven lodges in Paris. The Duke of Chartres, eldest son of the Duke of Orleans and owner of the Palais-Royal, became the new grand master; the masons began meeting regularly in cafes, and then in the political clubs, and they played an important part is circulating news and new ideas. The Freemasons were particularly hard-hit by the Terror; the aristocratic members were forced to emigrate, and seventy freemasons were sent to guillotine in the first our months of 1794.|$|E

25|$|The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act ("MRHA") is a Singapore statute which, {{according}} to its long title, provides {{for the maintenance of}} religious harmony, {{for the establishment of a}} Presidential Council for Religious Harmony ("PCRH"), and for matters connected therewith. The Act, which was passed on 9 November 1990 and came into force on 31 March 1992, empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to make a restraining order against a person who is in a position of authority in any religious group or institution if the Minister is satisfied that the person has committed or is attempting to commit any of the following acts: causing feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different religious groups; or promoting a political cause, carrying out subversive activities, or exciting disaffection against the President or the Government under the guise of propagating or practising a religious belief. A restraining order may also be made against a person who incites, instigates or encourages any religious leader or any religious group or institution to commit the above acts; or a person who is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> leader who causes or attempts to cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different religious groups. A restraining order made against a religious leader may direct that he or she must obtain the permission of the Minister before addressing members of any religious group or institution, assisting or contributing to religious publications, or holding office in the editorial board or committee of such publications. Breaching a restraining order is a criminal offence.|$|E

500|$|As {{noted by}} New Testament scholar Obrey M.

[...] In later centuries, John was used to support anti-Semitic polemics, but {{the author of the}} gospel regarded himself as a Jew, championed Jesus and his followers as Jews, and probably wrote for a largely Jewish community.|$|E
