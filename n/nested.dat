40|$|AbstractGolden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are {{long-lived}} raptors {{that maintain}} <b>nesting</b> territories {{that may be}} occupied for a century or longer. Within occupied <b>nesting</b> territories there is one <b>nest</b> in which eagles lay their eggs {{in a given year}} (i. e., the used <b>nest),</b> but there are usually other <b>nests</b> (i. e., alternative <b>nests).</b> Conservation plans often protect used <b>nests,</b> but not alternative <b>nests</b> or <b>nesting</b> territories that appear vacant. Our objective is to review literature on golden eagle use of alternative <b>nests</b> and occupancy of <b>nesting</b> territories to determine if alternative <b>nests</b> are biologically significant and warrant greater conservation consideration. Our review shows that: (1) alternative <b>nests</b> or their associated habitat are most often in core areas of golden eagle <b>nesting</b> territories; (2) alternative <b>nests</b> likely will become used in the future; (3) probability of an alternative <b>nest</b> becoming used is greatest where prey availability is high and alternative <b>nest</b> sites are limited; (4) likelihood of annual occupancy or reoccupancy of golden eagle <b>nesting</b> territories is high; and (5) prey availability is the most important determinant of <b>nesting</b> territory occupancy and breeding activity. We recommend alternative <b>nests</b> be treated with the same deference as used <b>nests</b> in land use planning...|$|R
40|$|Under the Direction of David Rostal) The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of <b>nest</b> relocation on <b>nest</b> parameters and embryonic development. The <b>nesting</b> biology of the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) was studied on Blackbeard Island in 2005 and 2006, during the <b>nesting</b> season.

We examined nest-site characteristics relative to <b>nest</b> suc-cess in Karoo Prinias breeding in coastal dwarf shrubland, where high <b>nest</b> predation {{is the main}} cause of <b>nest</b> failure. Initially, we compared <b>nests</b> that failed during the building, laying, incubation and nestling stages and those from which young were successfully raised, to test whether <b>nests</b> that survived to progressive stages in the <b>nesting</b> cycle differed in their nest-site characteristics. Subsequently, we compared the characteristics of successful <b>nests</b> with those of unsuccessful <b>nests.</b> The nest-site characteristics considered included <b>nest</b> height, nest-plant height, nest-plant species, distance from lateral foliage edge, <b>nest</b> concealment, nest-patch heterogeneity and vegetation cover at four different heights. We were unable to distin-guish between the nest-site characteristics of <b>nests</b> that failed during the various stages of the <b>nesting</b> cycle. Concealment was the main nest-site characteristic that differentiated successful <b>nests</b> from unsuccessful <b>nests,</b> with successful <b>nests</b> being located in more concealed sites. The other variables that contributed to the discrimination between successful and unsuc-cessful <b>nests</b> by discriminant function analysis included nest-plant type and distance from edge, which are also directly relat-ed to concealment.

Half of the groups had access to six identical rollaway group-nests, while the others had access to six <b>nests</b> of the same type differing in outer appearance. Three colours (red, green, yellow) and three black symbols (cross, circle, rectangle) were used to create three different <b>nest</b> curtain designs per pen. Nest position and the side of entrance to the pens were changed at 28 and 30 weeks of age, respectively, whereby the order of changes was counterbalanced across trials. Nest positions were numbered 1 – 6, with <b>nest</b> position 1 representing the <b>nest</b> closest to the pen entrance. Eggs were counted per <b>nest</b> daily from week of age 18 to 33. Nest visits were recorded individually with an RFID system for the first 5 h of light throughout weeks 24 – 33. Hens with access to <b>nests</b> differing in curtain appearance entered fewer <b>nests</b> daily than hens with identical <b>nests</b> throughout the study but both groups entered more <b>nests</b> with increasing age. We found no other evidence that curtain appearance affected <b>nest</b> choice and hens were inconsistent in their daily <b>nest</b> selection.

Orphaned <b>nests</b> allow a new wasp to gain status as queen without a fight. Females that adopt <b>nests</b> are less cooperative and expend less energy than those that found <b>nests.</b> Spring foundresses sometimes found colonies alone, form associations with others, take over established conspecific colonies, or even adopt abandoned <b>nests.</b> Females would adopt an abandoned <b>nest</b> if they lost their <b>nest</b> due to predation or other damage or if they waited to adopt an orphaned <b>nest</b> rather than found their own.
