40|$|The {{effect of}} {{withholding}} cows' milk was examined in 487 infants {{at high risk}} of allergic disease. Before birth they were randomly allocated either to a control group, most of whom received cows' milk preparations, or to an intervention group, who were offered a soya based substitute. Eczema and wheezing occurred to a similar extent in the two groups {{during the first year of}} life, although <b>napkin</b> <b>rash,</b> diarrhoea, and oral thrush were commoner in the intervention group, especially during the first three months. Breast feeding for any length of time was associated with a reduced incidence of wheezing and diarrhoea...|$|E
40|$|Wilm's-aniridia {{syndrome}} with transient hypo-y-globulinaemia of infancy Aniridia is {{the only}} congenital malformation linked in significant numbers with the subsequent development of Wilm's tumour (Miller, Fraumeni, and Manning, 1964). Though aniridia is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant, with 2 of 3 affected children having 1 affected parent, children with the Wilm's-aniridia syndrome only very rarely have a parent with aniridia (Miller, 1968; Fraumeni and Glass, 1968). The syndrome is characterized by aniridia, secondary cataracts, microcephaly with mental retardation, a folding-over of the pinna, and anomalies of the urinary tract with Wilm's tumour. We report a case of Wilm's-aniridia syndrome where development of the tumour was preceded by development and recovery from transient hypo-y-globulinaemia of infancy. Case report The patient was the second child of normal parents. There was no parental consanguinity. He weighed 3 * 7 kg at birth and 9 * 3 kg {{at the age of}} 1 year. The mother's brother had had a bad chest until the age of 7 years, but there was no family history of eye trouble, tendency to infection, or malignant disease. At birth he would not open his eyes, and later the mother noticed that the eyes had no colour. Bilateral aniridia was diagnosed at the age of 9 weeks {{and at the same time}} two large lacunae of the left occipitoparietal region and a large anterior fontanelle were noted. The top of the pinnae were folded over. Later he developed bilateral buphthalmos, glaucoma, and lens opacities. At 9 weeks he developed croup. Subsequently he required repeated anaesthetics for the management of the eye condition, and several of these were complicated by postoperative chest symptoms with an asthmatic element. For this reason it was necessary to postpone the operation on several occasions. Investigations showed deficiency of serum IgG (Table). At 5 months of age he had eczema of the face and neck, and a <b>napkin</b> <b>rash.</b> On a milk-free diet the skin manifestations cleared and there was no recurrence of the wheeziness for several months. He was sub-sequently troubled by recurrent coughs and colds and was treated with antibiotics. At the age of 14 months it was thought that a single injection of y-globulin (10 ml...|$|E
40|$|The best {{recognized}} intestinal {{manifestation of}} food allergy is food allergic (food-sensitive) enteropathy. The feature of enteropathy may include lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration, epithelial abnormality, or crypt hyperplastic villous atrophy, and impairing absorption, enterophaty continues while the food {{remains in the}} diet, remitting on an exclusion diet, and usually recurring on food challenge. Diagnosis is now usually based on histological features at initial biopsy and clinical response to antigen exclusion and challenge. Clinical findings in food allergic enteropathy include abdominal distension, loose stools, micronutrient deficiency, and rarely protein-losing enteropathy. There may be other features of allergic disease, most commonly eczema unlike coeliac disease, food allergic enteropathies are usually transient in early life, and later challenge is usually tolerated. Cow’s milk-sensitive enteropathy (CMSE) was the first recognized food allergic enteropathy and remains the most common cause. The best-characterized syndrome is CMSE, classically presenting with chronic loose stools and failure to thrive, often beginning after an episode of gastroenteritis in a formula-fed infant. Other clinical features include abdominal distension, perianal erythema or <b>napkin</b> <b>rash</b> (due to malabsorbed dietary carbohydrates), and deratographia. Associated clinical features may include colic, gastroesophageal reflux, rectal bleeding, or eczema. There may be evidence of micronutrient deficiency, notably for iron and zinc. Up to 40 % of infants with classic CMSE also sensitize to soy, often after an initial period when it is tolerated. The great majority however settle on extensively hydrolyzed formulate. Classic CMSE is usually self-limiting, with most children tolerating reintroduction {{at the age of}} 2 to 3 years. By contrast, some children may have persistent low-grade symptoms for a prolonged period. A proportion of children manifest additional immediate reactions to food antigens, such as rash, urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis. However, many children suffer enteropathy without immediate reactions, and {{it is important to recognize}} that food allergic entropathy often occurs in the absence of systemic signs of food allergy. Thus, skin prick tests may be negative and specific IgE undetectable.   Review of growth records in classic CMSE often shows a period of good weight gain prior to the onset of symptoms, followed by downward drift against the centiles until antigen exclusion is adequate. This presentation probably represents the loss of initially established oral tolerance. ...|$|E
