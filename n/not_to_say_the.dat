Armed {{reconnaissance}} – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. That is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force {{was not about to}} surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E
25|$|The {{tempo of}} marches varies significantly. While most bands perform marches {{in their own}} tempo, most marches are quick (faster than a waltz, as fast as or slower than a polka). As alluded to before, most march composers did not {{designate}} a specific tempo on their manuscripts. However, that is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> march music composer is random with his/her tempo while conducting the march. For example, John Philip Sousa conducted his marches using around 120 beats per minute. Most European march composers, however, conducted their marches in a slower style, using around 100 beats per minute. There are, however, many and notable exceptions: see concert march and screamer.|$|E

2500|$|Today, Liszt's {{songs are}} {{relatively}} obscure. As an exception, most frequently the song [...] "Ich möchte hingehn" [...] is cited. It {{is because of}} a single bar, most resembling the opening motif of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. While it is commonly claimed that Liszt wrote that motif ten years before Wagner started work on his masterpiece, it has turned {{out that this is}} not true: the original version of [...] "Ich möchte hingehn" [...] was composed in 1844 or 1845. There are four manuscripts, and only a single one, a copy by August Conradi, contains the said bar with the Tristan motif. It is on a paste-over in Liszt's hand. Since {{in the second half of}} 1858 Liszt was preparing his songs for publication, and he just at that time received the first act of Wagner's Tristan, it is most likely that the version on the paste-over was a quotation from Wagner. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> motif was originally invented by Wagner. An earlier example can be found in bar 100 of Liszt's Ballade No. 2 in B minor for piano, composed in 1853.|$|E
2500|$|Spectator wrote: [...] "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, {{like its}} {{predecessor}} , suggests {{the idea of}} considerable abilities ill applied. There is power, effect, and even nature, though of an extreme kind, in its pages; but there seems in the writer a morbid love for the coarse, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> brutal; so that his level subjects are not very attractive, and the more forcible are displeasing or repulsive, from their gross, physical, or profligate substratum. He might reply, that such things are in life... Mere existence, however, as we have often had occasion to remark, is not a sufficient reason for a choice of subject: its general or typical character is a point to consider, and its power of pleasing must be regarded, {{as well as its}} mere capabilities of force or effect. It is not only the subject of this novel, however, that is objectionable, but the manner of treating it. There is a coarseness of tone throughout the writing of all these Bells , that puts an offensive subject in its worst point of view, and which generally contrives to dash indifferent things".|$|E
