40|$|Slang, as {{a subject}} of {{sociolinguistics}} which deals with the language in society always develops form time to time (Fromkin, 1993,p. 320 - 362). The writer attempts to observe slang terms on IRC (Internet Relay Chat), as a media for chatting with people around the world. On IRC, there must be many slang terms used by <b>netters</b> like in talking to others for hours. This study tries to find slang terms on IRC used by Indonesian nettes. Then, she also tries to observe how those terms are formed and why the <b>netters</b> use those terms. This study is supported by slang theory of Thomas Pyles. It is called 'making new word 1. To collect the data, the writer copies the chatting of <b>netters</b> on IRC in a disk and uses questionnaire. The data of netters' chatting on IRC are taken in August, 1998 from Indonesian channels, such as; #imanuel and #metesek. Those channels are used by Indonesian <b>netters</b> from many cities, such as; Bandung, Surabaya, and Medan. Some <b>netters</b> are in Indonesia and some others live abroad. For the questionnaire, the data are taken in July, 1998 and the respondents are also from Indonesian <b>netters.</b> To classify the data, the writer uses Thomas Pyles theory of making new word. Then, she presents the data into IRC slang terms table and analyses term by term to be analysed based on the theory of making new word. The writer puts groups of slang terms due to the syllables. After analyzing the data, she finds out that slang terms on IRC are mostly formed by clipping word. The <b>netters</b> also have various reasons for using those terms in their chatting. <b>Netters</b> mostly use slang terms spontaneously and also to create a good atmosphere in chatting on IRC...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{two recent}} economic studies which undertook a first attempt in evaluating possible alternative vessel types and fishing methods for diversifying the Belgian overspecialised fleet. This diversification is necessary because the current beam trawling fleet lacks economic stability. The first study starts with unveiling {{the differences in}} 1) catch composition, 2) fuel efficiency and 3) profitability {{of different kinds of}} beam trawlers and set <b>netters.</b> Further on, this study examines how set <b>netters</b> perform relatively to beam trawlers. The second study evaluates the option of introducing handlining to the Belgian fleet. Special attention is drawn the comparson of differences in costs structure between handliners and eurocutters. The results of these two studies indicate that set <b>netters</b> and handliners can be profitable, but further research is needed...|$|R

25|$|After the pogroms in 1881, {{crowds of}} Russian Jews flooded into Brody, {{from where they}} headed for America or back to Russia. By summer of 1882 the number of Russian {{refugees}} in Brody reached 20.000, most of them stayed in Brody temporarily until the possibility of further immigration westwards. A local refugee relief committee was organised in Brody {{and a number of}} foreign representatives from Paris and Vienna Alliances, other major Jewish organisations were active at this time in the city, including such figures as Friedlander, <b>Netter</b> and Schafir. In the course of four months 1800 immigrants were transported on their way to America. After arrival of British deputies, the committee was reorganised and managed to send 11 trains with immigrants westwards (in one case 533 people in a go). Meanwhile, the number of refugees continued to grow. On 2 June 1882 it reached 12.476 individuals in 10 days the number increased to 12.668, despite the fact that 1.405 had been sent already within that week. The social situation deteriorated reaching a critical limit. Baron Hirsch entrusted his secretary Veneziani to buy spacious premises of an old clothing factory, where the refugees were consequently accommodated.|$|E
