The mechanism for suppressed blinking and dramatically enhanced stability is attributed to both effective isolation of the NQD core excitonic wavefunction from the NQD surface, as well as a quasi-Type II electronic structure.

We optically excite the system by creating a single high energy exciton $E_{SX}$ in resonance to a double exciton $E_{DX}$. With Coulomb electron-electron interaction, the population can be transferred from the single exciton to the double exciton state by impact ionisation (inverse Auger process). The ratio between the recombination processes and the absorbed photons provide the yield of the structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rapid {{and highly}} {{sensitive}} detection of the carbohydrate components of glycoconjugates {{is critical for}} advancing glycobiology. Fluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) is commonly used in detection of DNA, in protein structural biology, and in protease assays but is less frequently applied to glycan analysis due to difficulties in inserting two fluorescent tags into small glycan structures. We report an ultrasensitive method for the detection and quantification of a chondroitin sulfate disaccharide based on FRET, involving a CdSe−ZnS core−shell <b>nanocrystal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>dot</b> (QD) streptavidin conjugate donor and a Cy 5 acceptor. The disaccharide was doubly labeled with biotin and Cy 5. QDs then served to concentrate the target disaccharide, enhancing the overall energy transfer efficiency, with unlinked QDs and Cy 5 hydrazide producing nearly zero background signal in capillary electrophoresis using laser-induced fluorescence detection with two different band-pass filters. This method is generally applicable to the ultrasensitive analysis of acidic glycans and offers promise for the high-throughput disaccharide analysis of glycosaminoglycans.

40|$|In this project, we have {{developed}} a novel platform for capturing, transport, and separating target analytes using the work harnessed from biomolecular transport systems. Nanoharvesters were constructed by co-organizing kinesin motor proteins and antibodies on a <b>nanocrystal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>dot</b> (nQD) scaffold. Attachment of kinesin and antibodies to the nQD was achieved through biotin-streptavidin non-covalent bonds. Assembly of the nanoharvesters was characterized using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that confirmed attachment of both proteins. Nanoharvesters selective against tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} (TNF-{alpha}) and nuclear transcription factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) were capable of detecting target antigens at < 100 ng/mL in ELISAs. A motility-based assay was subsequently developed using an antibody-sandwich approach in which the target antigen (TNF-{alpha}) formed a sandwich with the red-emitting nanoharvester and green-emitting detection nQD. In this format, successful sandwich formation resulted in a yellow emission associated with surface-bound microtubules. Step-wise analysis of sandwich formation suggested that the motility function of the kinesin motors was not adversely affected by either antigen capture or the subsequent binding of the detection nQDs. TNF-{alpha} was detected as low as {approx} 1. 5 ng/mL TNF-{alpha}, with 5. 2 % of the nanoharvesters successfully capturing the target analyte and detection nQDs. Overall, these results demonstrate the ability to capture target protein analytes in vitro using the kinesin-based nanoharvesters in nanofluidic environments.
