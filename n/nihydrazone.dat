40|$|ABSTRACT In {{a series}} of experiments, various {{chemotherapeutic}} agents administered in feed were evaluated for their efficacy against experimental Pasteurella anatipestifer (PA) infection in White Pekin ducklings. The feeding of medicated diets was started 3 days prior to challenge and continued throughout each experiment. Novobiocin and lincomycin, when fed at adequate concen-trations, were the most effective medicaments tested. Mortality in treated groups was 0 - 18 % compared with 45 - 92 % mortality in controls. Sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim, sulfaquinoxaline, and lincomycin-spectinomycin were moderately effective. Drugs that were not effective included chlortetracycline, tylosin-sulfamethazine, fosfomycin, furazolidone, <b>nihydrazone,</b> penicillin, bacitracin, and erythromycin. Six antibiotics were tested parenterally against experimental PA infection in another series of experiments. A single dose of an antibiotic was injected subcutaneously 5 to 6 hr after infection except in one experiment in which treatment was delayed until 24 hr after infection. When given 5 to 6 hr after infection, lincomycin-spectinomycin, penicillin-streptomycin, penicillin, oxytetra-cycline, and spectinomycin significantly reduced mortality. Gentamicin tested under the same conditions was ineffective. Drugs injected 24 hr after infection were not effective...|$|E
