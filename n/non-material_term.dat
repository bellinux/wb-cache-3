50|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature of}} the relief one party can claim on a breach of a term by the other, the terms of a contract are sometimes distinguished as either ‘material’ or ‘non-material’. Generally, {{in the absence of a}} clause that provides for cancellation (a lex commissoria), rescission of a contract is permissible only if the breach in question is regarded as a material breach, which is usually the case if it relates to a material (or essential or vital term)—that is, one that goes to the root of the contract. Material terms are those vital to the performance of obligations. The breach of a material term entitles the innocent party to cancel the contract. Breach of a <b>non-material</b> <b>term</b> gives rise to a claim for damages only.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} enlargement {{from the viewpoint of}} the maximisation of the EU interest, broadly understood in both material and <b>non-material</b> <b>terms.</b> It starts by developing a theoretical model for estimating costs and benefits connected with size of political systems. Subsequently it applies this model to the EU enlargement process to estimate the likely costs/benefits balance of territorial exansion and therefore the optimal size of the EU. It concludes by showing that only a limited enlargement would maximise the utility of the EU...|$|R
50|$|Although {{downshifting}} {{is primarily}} motivated by personal desire {{and not by}} a conscious political stance, it does define societal overconsumption {{as the source of}} much personal discontent. By redefining life satisfaction in <b>non-material</b> <b>terms,</b> downshifters assume an alternative lifestyle but continue to coexist in a society and political system preoccupied with the economy. In general, downshifters are politically apathetic because mainstream politicians mobilize voters through the hip-pocket nerve, proposing governmental solutions to periods of financial hardship and economic recessions. This economic rhetoric is meaningless to downshifters who have forgone worrying about money.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rule for}} {{creating}} a minimally acceptable [...] "holographic" [...] will has been agreed upon: to be indisputably without edit or revision by an outsider (other than the author), absolutely no mechanically printed material must be contained in the document. It must not be typeset, typewritten, mechanically printed or scribed by any means other than by {{the hand of the}} original author. This rule does not, however, apply to <b>non-material</b> <b>terms</b> of the will. As a result, so-called [...] "form wills" [...] purchased at stationery stores can constitute legally valid holographic wills provided that their material terms are completed solely in the testator's handwriting.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decades, the {{worldwide}} {{spread of the}} human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) has created one of the deadliest epidemics in human history. Despite widely available bio-medical knowledge about how to prevent transmission of the virus, and technologies and resources to treat people living with HIV/AIDS, the disease continues to spread, and especially in sub-Saharan Africa. However, despite the general precarious situation in sub-Saharan Africa, there is in fact great variation among African states as regards HIV prevalence. This paper builds a framework for increasing {{our understanding of the}} sources of this variation. More specifically, we argue that HIV/AIDS {{is a different kind of}} problem than other diseases in the sense that effective prevention demands sacrifices on the behalf of individuals that are costly in both material and <b>non-material</b> <b>terms.</b> The failure to recognize these costs makes standard solutions, such as for example increased access to medication, expanded funds, and health sector reforms, potentially ineffective. With the point of departure in the costs and individual sacrifices demanded for the successfu...|$|R
40|$|This thesis critiques the {{historical}} and modern relationship between war, military contracting, and military effectiveness. Its central aim is to review {{and add to the}} theory and practice of the relationship between military contracting and military effectiveness. Specifically, it questions the “bigger is better” dictum that currently informs military contracting policy by constructing and testing a competing perspective: contractor force employment (CFE). To facilitate, and to ensure the outcomes have policy relevance, the thesis evaluates contractor manpower and contractor force employment perspectives by analyzing quantitative and qualitative data relating to military contracting in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). It argues that military contracting effectiveness can be better understood through a combination of material terms as well as <b>non-material</b> <b>terms.</b> This approach is original - a new way of thinking about {{the historical}} and modern prevalence and utility of military contracting. A second purpose of the thesis is to demonstrate that military contracting policy rests on weak foundations because it insists that military contracting enhances military effectiveness though the provision of manpower...|$|R
40|$|The Templeton Prize winner wrote: „In {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the {{deterministic}} character of Newton’s equations encouraged many people to see the physical world in strictly mechanical terms, as if the universe is a gigantic piece of cosmic clockwork. ” [1] Such wrong view comes from the belief, that the energy and momentum are always conserved. It means: if I pull the door, the door reaction pools me. Thus, our opposite momentums vanish each other. When I have pooled the door, I have lost a bit of food in my stomach: So the kinetic energy of accelerated door came from my food. Nothing lost, nothing is gained. But what if the invisible God does some job? What if an angel pools the door for us? Can a divine be source of energy and momentum, or they are being simply created from nothing? Because the energy and momentum are material essence, when they are being simply created. Thus the system of God, angels, matter and us is not closed. So, the law of decay (the grow of entropy [9]) is not taken the place. It is the eternal life with care of our Lord. And they will eat from the Tree of Life. To describe some (not all) actions of God within Newtonian formalism, one simply adds non-material force f to his second law: m a = F + f. Another kind of actions is materialization and de-materialization (Jesus came to them while doors were closed). Latter violates Einstein’s General Relativity, thus the additional <b>non-material</b> <b>terms</b> X shall be added to the Einstein Equations: G + X = 8 pi T. In the book [2] they ar...|$|R
