The governor of Indiana refused to extradite Taylor, {{and he was}} thus <b>never</b> <b>questioned</b> about {{his knowledge of the}} plot to kill Goebel. Taylor became a successful lawyer in Indiana, and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros, made short {{work of the}} unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs {{managed to}} get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before {{dropping}} their torpedoes—close {{enough to be able}} to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed to explode. Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers <b>never</b> <b>questioned</b> why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results. The abysmal performance of American torpedoes in the early months of the war became a scandal. Torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed to explode.|$|E

The three-man board reviewed two days of testimony and ruled that the case was based largely on uncorroborated hearsay. Some witnesses contradicted themselves and Rocha acknowledged getting some of the facts wrong in his Washington Post article and in his original testimony.|$|E

She also decided to greet anyone properly dressed—regardless of race—who attended her afternoon receptions, but <b>never</b> <b>questioned</b> why blacks failed to call on her.

25|$|As of 2017, bestiality {{is illegal}} in 42 U.S. states. Most state bestiality laws were enacted between 1999 and 2017. Until 2005, {{there was a}} farm near Enumclaw, Washington that was {{described}} as an “animal brothel”, where people paid {{to have sex with}} animals. After an incident on 2 July 2005, when a man was pronounced dead in the emergency room of the Enumclaw community hospital after his colon ruptured due to having been sodomized by a horse, the farm garnered police attention. The state legislature of the State of Washington, which {{had been one of the}} few states in the United States without a law against bestiality, within six months passed a bill making bestiality illegal. Arizona, Alaska, Florida, Alabama, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Ohio have banned sex with animals between 2006 and the present. When such laws are proposed, they are <b>never</b> <b>questioned</b> or debated. Laws which prohibit non-abusive bestiality have been criticized for being discriminatory, unjust and unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|On May 16, 1426, in Kraków Sophia {{gave birth}} to Casimir, second son of Jogaila. However, the boy died on March 2, 1427. These dates, {{provided}} in historical sources, contradict a 1950 study of Casimir's skeleton which found that the bones are of an approximately 18-month-old boy. In spring 1427, while pregnant with the third child, Sophia was accused of marital infidelity, therefore casting a doubt over Władysław's and yet-unborn Casimir's paternity. Two of her servants were arrested and tortured and seven men were named as Sophia's lovers: treasurer Hińcza of Rogów, Piotr Kurowski, Wawrzyniec Zaręba, Jan Kraska, Jan Koniecpolski, brothers Piotr and Dobiesław of Szczekociny. The case went before a court. After {{the birth of her}} third son, Sophia took an oath before the court that she was innocent and the case was dismissed. Despite the scandal which dragged on for several months, the paternity of Sophia's children was <b>never</b> <b>questioned</b> again.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the civil}} rights movement, the LDS Church's {{doctrine}}-based policy went largely unnoticed and unchallenged for around a century with the First Presidency stating in 1947 that {{the doctrine of the}} LDS Church which banned interracial marriage and black people from entering the temple or receiving the priesthood was <b>never</b> <b>questioned</b> by any of the Church leaders. In the 1960s, the NAACP twice threatened to protest the LDS Church if they did not support civil rights. The first time, Hugh B. Brown made a statement in general conference supporting civil rights; the second time, the LDS church refused to support a piece of legislation and the NAACP led an anti-discrimination march in Salt Lake City to protest. In response to a NAACP lawsuit in 1974, the LDS Church changed their policy to allow any boy to be troop leader in Boy Scouting troops. Apostle Ezra Taft Benson was vocally against civil rights. In 1968 and 1969, various collegiate athletic teams refused to play matches with Brigham Young University. In the 1970s, three LDS church members were excommunicated for criticizing church's racial exclusion policies. Church president Kimball refuted racism in the 1970s, and in 2017 the LDS Church denounced racism and white supremacy.|$|E

Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who <b>never</b> <b>questioned</b> the existing social order or conventional beliefs, {{in many ways the}} polar opposite of Voltaire, who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court.

500|$|The Historical Enquiries Team (HET), {{which was}} set up to {{investigate}} the more controversial Troubles-related deaths, released its report on the Miami Showband killings to the victims' families in December 2011. The findings noted in the report confirmed Mid-Ulster UVF leader Robin Jackson's involvement and identified him as an RUC Special Branch agent. According to the report, Jackson had claimed during police interrogations that after the shootings, a senior RUC officer had advised him to [...] "lie low". Although this information was passed on to RUC headquarters, nothing was done about it. In a police statement made following his arrest for possession of the silencer and Luger on 31 May 1976, Jackson maintained that a week before he was taken into custody, two RUC officers had tipped him off about the discovery of his fingerprints on the silencer; he also claimed they had forewarned him: [...] "I should clear as there was a wee job up the country that I would be done for {{and there was no way}} out of it for me". Although ballistic testing had linked the Luger (for which the silencer had been specifically made) to the Miami Showband attack, Jackson was <b>never</b> <b>questioned</b> about the killings after his fingerprints had been discovered on the silencer, and the Miami inquiry team were never informed about these developments.|$|E
