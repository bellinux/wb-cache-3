25|$|While most NBA teams hold {{contracts}} {{valued in}} excess of the salary cap, few teams have payrolls at luxury tax levels. The tax threshold in 2005–06 was $61.7million. In 2005–06, the New York Knicks' payroll was $124million, putting them $74.5million above the salary cap, and $62.3million above the tax line, which Knicks owner James Dolan paid to the league. Tax revenues are normally redistributed evenly among <b>non-tax-paying</b> teams, so there is often a several-million-dollar incentive to owners not to pay the luxury tax.|$|E
60|$|I {{found that}} the nation had at first tried {{universal}} suffrage pure and simple, but had thrown that form aside because the result was not satisfactory. It had seemed to deliver all power {{into the hands of}} the ignorant and <b>non-tax-paying</b> classes; and of a necessity the responsible offices were filled from these classes also.|$|E

50|$|Between 1797 and 1807 women {{voted in}} large numbers in New Jersey. But in 1807 the state's {{legislature}} ignored the constitution and restricted suffrage to white male citizens who paid taxes. This was largely {{a result of the}} Democratic-Republican Party's attempt to unify its factions for the 1808 presidential election. A faction within the party wanted to deny the vote to aliens and the <b>non-tax-paying</b> poor. The liberal faction within the party gave way on this, but also took the vote from women, who tended to vote for the Federalist Party.|$|E
50|$|Income {{taxes in}} the United States are self-assessed by taxpayers by filing {{required}} tax returns. Taxpayers, as well as certain <b>non-tax-paying</b> entities, like partnerships, must file annual tax returns at the federal and applicable state levels. These returns disclose a complete computation of taxable income under tax principles. Taxpayers compute all income, deductions, and credits themselves, and {{determine the amount of}} tax due after applying required prepayments and taxes withheld. Federal and state tax authorities provide preprinted forms that must be used to file tax returns. IRS Form 1040 series is required for individuals, Form 1120 series for corporations, Form 1065 for partnerships, and Form 990 series for tax exempt organizations.|$|E
