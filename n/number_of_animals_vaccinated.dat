40|$|Vaccination {{is one of}} {{the main}} tools {{currently}} available to control animal diseases. In eradication campaigns, vaccination plays a crucial role by reducing the number of susceptible hosts with the ultimate goal of interrupting disease transmission. Nevertheless, mass vaccination campaigns may be very expensive and in some cases unprofitable. VacciCost is a tool designed to help decision-makers in the estimation of the resources required to implement mass livestock vaccination campaigns against regulated diseases. The tool focuses on the operational or running costs of the campaign, so acquisition of new equipment or vehicles is not considered. It takes into account different types of production systems to differentiate the vaccination productivity (<b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>vaccinated</b> per day) in systems where animals are concentrated and easy to reach, from those characterized by small herds that are scattered and less accessible. The resource requirements are classified in eight categories: vaccines, injection supplies, personnel, transport, maintenance and overhead, training, social mobilization, and surveillance and monitoring. This categorization allows identifying the most expensive components of a vaccination campaign, which is crucial to design cost-reduction strategies. The use of the tool is illustrated using data collected in collaboration with Senegalese Veterinary Services regarding vaccination against peste des petits ruminants. The average daily <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>vaccinated</b> per vaccination team was found to be crucial for the costs of the campaign so significant savings can be obtained by implementing training to improve the performance of vaccination teams...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{potential}} role of {{oral vaccination}} of dogs against rabies in the Philippines {{was investigated in}} terms of safety and efficacy. Methods Prior to the vaccination campaign, a house-to-house survey was carried out {{to collect data on}} the dog population in the study area, the coastal village of Mindoro. During the vaccination campaign all households were visited again, and all dogs encountered (> 2 months old) were, if possible, vaccinated. Furthermore, 14 dogs vaccinated were bled on different occasions. Results During the survey, a total of 216 dogs were counted, and none of these animals had previously been vaccinated against rabies. Only 17 dogs could be restrained and subsequently vaccinated directly by the vaccinators. Another 126 dogs were offered a local-made boiled intestine bait, containing a capsule filled with 3. 0 ml SAD B 19 (10 7. 9 FFU/ml). The bait acceptance rate of dogs offered a bait was 96. 1 %. The vaccination coverage of the dog population (> 2 months old) estimated by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>vaccinated</b> directly and the number of dogs that accepted a bait and subsequently punctured the vaccine container was 76 %. Fifteen and 29 days after the vaccination campaign 6 and 10 dogs (n = 14) had rabies virus neutralizing antibody titres of ≥ 0. 5 IU/ml, respectively. No unintentional contacts of nontarget species, including humans, with the vaccine virus were reported. Conclusions The results of the campaign show that oral vaccination of dogs against rabies is a promising supplementary method in dog rabies control in the Philippines. </p...|$|E

ScoglioEarly {{detection}} of livestock diseases {{and development of}} cost optimal mitigation strategies are becoming a global necessity. Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) {{is considered one of}} the most serious livestock diseases owing to its high rate of transmission and extreme economic consequences. Thus, it is imperative to improve parameterized mathematical models for predictive and preventive purposes. In this work, a meta-population based stochastic model is implemented to assess the FMD infection dynamics and to curb economic losses in countries with underdeveloped livestock disease surveillance databases. Our model predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of FMD over a weighted contact network where the weights are characterized by the effect of wind and movement of animals and humans. FMD incidence data from countries such as Turkey, Iran and Thailand are used to calibrate and validate our model, and the predictive performance of our model is compared with that of baseline models as well. Additionally, learning-based prediction models can be utilized to detect the time of onset of an epidemic outbreak. Such models are computationally simple and they may be trained to predict infection in the absence of background data representing the dynamics of disease transmission, which is otherwise necessary for predictions using spatio-temporal models. Thus, we comparatively study the predictive performance of our spatio-temporal against neural networks and autoregressive models. Also, Bayesian networks combined with Monte-Carlo simulations are used to determine the gold standard by approximation. Next, cost-effective mitigation strategies are simulated using the theoretical concept of infection network fragmentation. Based on the theoretical reduction in the total number of infected animals, several simulative mitigation strategies are proposed and their cost-effectiveness measures specified by the percentage reduction in the total number of infected animals per million US dollars, are also analyzed. We infer that the cost-effectiveness measures of mitigation strategies implemented using our spatio-temporal predictive model have a narrower range and higher granularity than those for mitigation strategies formulated using learning-based prediction models. Finally, we coin optimal mitigation strategies using Fuzzy Dominance Genetic Algorithms (FDGA). We use the concept of hierarchical fuzzy dominance to minimize the total number of infected animals, the direct cost incurred due to the implementation of mitigation strategies, the number of animals culled, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>vaccinated</b> to mitigate an epidemic. This method has the potential to aid in economic policy development for countries that have lost their FMD-free status...|$|E

40|$|Peste des petits {{ruminants}} (PPR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating diseases that limit small ruminant industry in Ghana and causes substantial economic losses to small ruminant farmers. However, there is lack of documented evidence on the distribution of the disease across the various regions in the country. A retrospective epidemiological study was therefore conducted to investigate the pattern, distribution and prevalence of PPR disease in Ghana. The study also investigated the impact of vaccination on PPR burden using descriptive epidemiological analysis. Data on PPR outbreaks from 2005 to 2013 as well as vaccination records from the Veterinary Services Directorate in Ghana and from the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) were collated and used for this study. Results from the study indicated that PPR was endemic in Ghana, at a prevalence level of 6. 84 % per 1, 000 population. All ten regions reported PPR outbreaks with Western region reporting the highest, followed by Eastern and Central regions. PPR occurred in both seasons, but mostly in the dry season. Vaccination programmes covered all the ten regions in Ghana. The lowest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccinated</b> <b>animals</b> and highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> outbreaks were registered in the Western region, while Volta region had the high-est <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccinated</b> <b>animals</b> and lowest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> outbreaks.

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) can have devastating effects on animal welfare, economic revenues, the export position and {{society as a}} whole, as occurred during the 2001 FMD epidemic in the Netherlands. Following the preemptive culling <b>of</b> 260, 000 <b>animals</b> during this outbreak, the Dutch government adopted emergency vaccination as preferred control policy. However, a vaccination-to-live strategy has not been applied before, posing unprecedented challenges for effectively controlling the epidemic, regaining FMD-free status and minimizing economic losses. These three topics are covered in an interdisciplinary model analysis. In this first part we evaluate whether and how emergency vaccination can be effectively applied to control FMD epidemics in the Netherlands. For this purpose we develop a stochastic individual-based model that describes FMD virus transmission between animals and between herds, taking heterogeneity between host species (cattle, sheep and pigs) into account. Our results in a densely populated livestock area with > 4 farms/km 2 show that emergency ring vaccination can halt the epidemic as rapidly as preemptive ring culling, while the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> farms to be culled is reduced {{by a factor of}} four. To achieve this reduction a larger control radius around detected farms and a corresponding adequate vaccination capacity is needed. Although sufficient for the majority of simulated epidemics with a 2 km vaccination zone, the vaccination capacity available in the Netherlands can be exhausted by pig farms that are on average ten times larger than cattle herds. Excluding pig farms from vaccination slightly increases the epidemic, but more than halves the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> to be <b>vaccinated.</b> Hobby flocks – modelled as small-sized sheep flocks – do not {{play a significant role in}} propagating the epidemic, and need not be targeted during the control phase.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyGary A. AndersonBrucellosis {{is one of}} {{the major}} endemic {{zoonotic}} diseases worldwide, and it has history dating back to 1937 in Iraq when it was first isolated by an Iraqi physician. In order to establish a solution for the continuous devastating impacts of the disease in humans and livestock, the Brucellosis Control Program was established in 1995. The main responsibilities of this program were setting and implementing the appropriate strategies for controlling the disease. After the war in 2003, the United Nation organization for Food and Agriculture (FAO) developed a strategic plan to control the disease. The main goal of the project was to improve productivity in the livestock sector and reduce the prevalence of disease in small ruminants (sheep and goats) to less than 2 %, and less than 0. 2 % in cattle and buffalo. Achieving such goals ultimately would reduce the disease incidence among the human population from more than 27. 2 cases/ 100, 000 persons in 2002, to less than 4 cases/ 100, 000 people within 15 years. A serological surveillance was conducted and revealed the apparent prevalence of the disease in sheep and goats, cattle, buffalo, and camels was 6. 51 %, 1 %, 1. 48 %, and 0. 02 %, respectively in Iraqi governorates except the three northern governorates of Kurdistan province. Based on surveillance results, a vaccination policy was the only appropriate strategy that could be chosen to control the disease. Four vaccination campaigns were implemented in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, with a total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccinated</b> <b>animals</b> each year at 10099972, 4698482, 753153, and 1833482 head, respectively. The primary satisfactory outcome of the program was the apparent decline in livestock abortions leading to obvious increases in productivity. Regarding the incidence of brucellosis among the human population, the apparent decline in the middle and south of Iraq began with the vaccination phase of the control program in 2006. The results represented a significant decrease in human cases after only four vaccination campaigns of a program that was intended to continue for 15 years...|$|R
40|$|Master of Public HealthPublic Health Interdepartmental ProgramMichael B. CatesMichael B. CatesBackground Rabies is {{a highly}} fatal viral {{zoonosis}} that contributes to at least 55, 000 human deaths annually throughout the world. Any mammal is susceptible to the rabies virus, but {{there are only a}} few species that are reservoirs for rabies; in the U. S., wildlife serves as the source of rabies infection. Domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, contract rabies from these reservoirs; therefore, animal vaccination is key in preventing rabies transmission to humans. Vaccination programs have eliminated canine rabies in the U. S., and Kansas currently does not have a statewide rabies vaccination requirement for dogs and cats. This study analyzes the effectiveness of countywide rabies vaccination laws in Kansas to prevent cases of rabies among dogs and cats. Methods An Animal Rabies Vaccination Survey was created using Survey Monkey and sent to all local health departments in Kansas to determine which counties have a rabies vaccination law. Other county agencies were contacted to determine this information if needed. Rabies test data was obtained for all dogs, cats, and ferrets submitted to the Kansas State University Rabies Laboratory for rabies testing from 2006 - 2010. The address of residence for the animal was geocoded to determine if it resided inside or outside of city limits. Descriptive analyses were performed on the rabies test data and the difference between two independent proportions was calculated. A hypothesis test and 95 % confidence interval was used to determine the significance of each comparison. Results From 2006 through 2010, 75 % of dogs and 25 % of cats that were submitted for rabies testing were vaccinated against rabies in Kansas. In counties that have a rabies vaccination law for dogs, 53. 9 % of dogs submitted were vaccinated against rabies and 0. 5 % of dogs tested positive for rabies. In counties that do not have a vaccination law for dogs, 35. 2 % of submitted dogs were vaccinated and 0. 3 % of dogs tested positive for rabies. In counties that have a rabies vaccination law for cats, 21. 8 % of cats submitted were vaccinated against rabies and 1 % of cats tested positive for rabies. In counties that do not have a vaccination law for cats, 11. 9 % of submitted cats were vaccinated and 2. 4 % of cats tested positive. The geocoded rabies data revealed that 50. 8 % of submitted dogs and 15. 2 % of submitted cats that resided within city limits were vaccinated against rabies compared to 24. 8 % of submitted dogs and 11. 5 % of submitted cats that resided outside of city limits were vaccinated against rabies. Furthermore, 0. 5 % of submitted dogs and 1. 8 % of submitted cats that resided inside city limits tested positive for rabies compared to 2. 1 % of submitted dogs and 6. 5 % of submitted cats that resided outside of city limits tested positive for rabies. Conclusions This study shows that among samples submitted to the KSU Rabies Lab, vaccination rates are much higher in dogs than in cats in Kansas. It shows that there are more dogs submitted for rabies testing that are vaccinated against rabies and more rabies-positive dogs in counties with a rabies vaccination law for dogs than in counties with no dog vaccination law. In addition, there are more cats submitted for rabies testing that are vaccinated against rabies and fewer rabies-positive cats in counties with a rabies vaccination law for cats than in counties with no cat vaccination law. The results also show that there are more vaccinated dogs and cats and fewer rabies-positive dogs and cats submitted for rabies testing residing inside city limits when compared to living outside of city limits. A rabies vaccination requirement of all dogs and cats in Kansas would be beneficial in increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccinated</b> <b>animals</b> and reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> rabies-positive domestic <b>animals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Immunization {{of sheep}} with the gut membrane-associated protein complex H-gal-GP of adult Haemonchus contortus induces {{high levels of}} {{protection}} against a homologous challenge infection. Protection is correlated with a systemic IgG response against the antigen. Analysis of the antibody response showed {{that the majority of}} the antigen-specific IgG was of the IgG 2 isotype. A substantial proportion (74 %) of this response was directed against the glycan component of H-gal-GP. The high immunogenicity of the H-gal-GP glycans may be due to the presence of the fucosylated LacdiNAc (LDNF) antigen. 2 D electrophoresis, Western blotting and mass spectrometry analysis of H-gal-GP showed that this glycan epitope was specifically located on a metalloendopeptidase, MEP 3. MEP 3 is the most abundant protein in H-gal-GP and has been identified as one of the most likely protective components of the complex.
