5|$|To {{promote the}} release of Mockingjay, many bookstores held midnight release parties. The {{official}} event in New York City was attended by Collins, and included many activities such as a tarot card reader, a magician, jugglers and face-painters. Prizes such as signed copies of Catching Fire and Hunger Games-themed cups were raffled. Once Collins arrived, she read {{the first chapter of}} the novel, explaining that she would read with an accent since Katniss, the <b>narrator,</b> <b>is</b> from Appalachia. By midnight, copies were being sold with a signature stamp since Collins had a hand injury and was unable to sign.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed <b>Narrator</b> <b>is</b> a {{traveling}} automobile recall specialist {{who suffers from}} insomnia. When he is unsuccessful at receiving medical assistance for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting {{a support group for}} testicular cancer victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a freedom from the catharsis that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.|$|E

25|$|In the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, it is {{eventually}} {{revealed that the}} <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, {{and many of the}} events he witnessed occurred only in his own mind.|$|E
25|$|Next is he is {{not strong}} (laysa bi l-qawī). The hadith of a narrator {{determined}} to be at this level would also be taken into consideration, as with the previous level, however, this <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> weaker {{than one of the}} previous level.|$|E
25|$|A hadith {{which is}} not {{reported}} by multiple narrators using the same words. The words of the <b>narrators</b> <b>are</b> different. Sometimes even the reported events are not the same. But all the <b>narrators</b> <b>are</b> unanimous in reporting a basic concept, which is common in all reports. This common concept is also ranked as a mutawatir concept.|$|R

25|$|The film ends a {{few days}} after World War I officially begins, with the final scene {{occurring}} in Sunday church on the day of a visit from the narrator's prospective father-in-law. Disquiet remains in the village, with no explanation of the violent events. The <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> eventually drafted, leaving Eichwald, never to return.|$|E
25|$|The {{least severe}} {{level for the}} {{criticism}} of a <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> soft in hadith (layyin al-ḥadīth) and, according to al-'Iraqi, they have spoken about him (takallamū fīhi). This level would also {{be taken into consideration}} as a corroborating narrator, but at a level less than the lowest level of praise.|$|E
25|$|An {{accusation}} of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating {{from the direction}} (as it pertains to that hadith's chain of narration) of that individual. Or, that a <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith.|$|E

5000|$|In 1977 Bernstein {{revised the}} symphony, saying: [...] "I was not {{satisfied}} with the original (version). There was too much talk. The piece is...(now) tighter and shorter." [...] With the revision, Bernstein no longer specified the gender of the narrator, and recordings featuring both male and female <b>narrators</b> have <b>been</b> made. In the first recording below (which is of the original version for female <b>narrator),</b> the <b>narrator</b> <b>was</b> Bernstein's wife, Felicia Montealegre, whereas {{in the second and third}} recordings below (which were of the revised work), the <b>narrators</b> <b>were</b> men, Michael Wager and Willard White.|$|R

25|$|This is not {{the first}} time that the theme of a {{relationship}} between Beowulf and Grendel's mother was explored. In Gaiman's 1998 collection of short stories, Smoke and Mirrors, the poem Bay Wolf is a retelling of Beowulf in a modern-day setting. In this story, Beowulf as the <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous about what happened between Grendel's mother and himself.|$|E
25|$|An {{unreliable}} <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> a narrator, {{whether in}} literature, film, or theatre, whose credibility has been seriously compromised. The term was coined in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth in The Rhetoric of Fiction. While unreliable narrators are almost by definition first-person narrators, arguments {{have been made}} {{for the existence of}} unreliable second- and third-person narrators, especially within the context of film and television.|$|E
25|$|The Tale's satire is most {{consistent}} in attacking misreading of all sorts. Both {{in the narrative}} sections and the digressions, the single human flaw that underlies all the follies Swift attacks is over-figurative and over-literal reading, both of the Bible and of poetry and political prose. The <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> seeking hidden knowledge, mechanical operations of things spiritual, spiritual qualities to things physical, and alternate readings of everything.|$|E

25|$|The song {{describes}} a hitchhiking journey {{south along the}} eastern coast of the United States, from New England in the northeast, through Roanoke, Virginia with the intended destination of Raleigh, North Carolina, where the narrator hopes to see his lover. As the <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> walking south of Roanoke, he catches a ride with a trucker who is traveling from Philadelphia through Virginia westward toward the Cumberland Gap and Johnson City, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|The hero {{discovers that}} these beings, who call {{themselves}} Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to transmit information, get rid of pain, and put others to sleep. The <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> offended {{by the idea that}} the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who {{turns out to be a}} magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.|$|E
25|$|The War of the Worlds {{presents}} {{itself as a}} factual account of the Martian invasion. The <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> a middle-class writer of philosophical papers, somewhat reminiscent of Doctor Kemp in The Invisible Man, with characteristics similar to author Wells {{at the time of}} writing. The reader learns very little about the background of the narrator or indeed of anyone else in the novel; characterisation is unimportant. In fact none of the principal characters are named, aside from the astronomer Ogilvy.|$|E

25|$|The poem {{is similar}} to the {{conversation}} poems created by Coleridge, including Dejection: An Ode. The poems were not real conversations as there is no response to the narrator of the poem, but they are written as if there would be a response. The poems seek to have a response, though it never comes, and the possibility of such a voice though absence is a type of prosopopoeia. In general, Coleridge's poems discuss the cosmic as they long for a response, and it is this aspect, not a possible object of the conversation, that forms the power of the poem. Wordsworth took up the form in both Tintern Abbey and Ode: Intimations of Immortality, but he lacks the generous treatment of the narrator as found in Coleridge's poems. As a whole, Wordsworth's technique is impersonal and more logical, and the <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> placed in the same position as the object of the conversation. The narrator of Wordsworth is more self-interested and any object beyond the <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> kept without a possible voice and is turned into a second self of the poet. As such, the conversation has one of the participants lose his identity {{for the sake of the}} other and that individual represents loss and mortality.|$|E
25|$|Abridged audio {{books have}} been made {{from all of the}} series except Callum and An Eye For an Eye. As the {{character}} narrating the story changes with each chapter, each <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> played by a different actor. Sephy is played by Nina Sosanya, Callum by Nigel Greaves, Jude by John Hasler, Meggie by Joan Walker, Callie Rose by Nicole Davis, Jasmine by Adjoa Andoh and Tobey by Nigel Pilkington. The additional parts of the story were read by the author in the first book and by Joan Walker in the three other books.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The <b>narrator</b> <b>is</b> telling us about his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative {{of a child who}} is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those who have access to this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E
