40|$|Previous {{studies using}} {{monotypic}} nerve cell cultures {{have shown that}} bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) involves apoptosis and necrosis-like cell death, following <b>neuritic</b> <b>atrophy</b> and astrocyte activation, and that glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) has therapeutic efficacy against BIND. Cross-talk between neurons and astrocytes may protect or aggravate neurotoxicity by unconjugated bilirubin (UCB). In a previous work we have shown that bidirectional signaling during astrocyte-neuron recognition attenuates neuronal damage by UCB. Here, we investigated whether the establishment of neuron-astrocyte homeostasis prior to cell exposure to UCB was instead associated with a lower resistance of neurons to UCB toxicity, and if the pro-survival properties of GUDCA were replicated in that experimental model. We have introduced a 24 h adaptation period for neuron-glia communication prior to the 48 h treatment with UCB. In such conditions, UCB induced glial activation, which aggravated neuronal damage, comprising increased apoptosis, cell demise and <b>neuritic</b> <b>atrophy,</b> which were completely prevented {{in the presence of}} GUDCA. Neuronal multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 expression and tumor necrosis factor-α secretion, although unchanged by UCB, increased in the presence of astrocytes. The rise in S 100 B and nitric oxide in the co-cultures medium may have contributed to UCB neurotoxicity. Since the levels of these diffusible molecules did not change by GUDCA we may assume that they are not directly involved in its beneficial effects. Data indicate that astrocytes, in an indirect neuron-astrocyte co-culture model and after homeostatic setting regulation of the system, are critically influencing neurodegeneration by UCB, and support GUDCA for the prevention of BIND...|$|E
30|$|For normal aging, age-related brain atrophy is a mild process, {{responsible}} for {{increased risk of}} memory decline with increasing age (Pakkenberg et al., 2003; Fox and Schott, 2004), whereas the highly accelerated rate of brain atrophy has a major or sole role in neurodegenerative diseases (Regeur et al., 1994; Schott et al., 2003). Loss of neuronal architecture is the main contributor to brain atrophy (Swaab et al., 1994; Freeman et al., 2008), thus atrophy of brain and neuron can be well defined as the shortening or shrinkage of neurites. <b>Neuritic</b> <b>atrophy</b> is a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD). A neuron consists of a soma and long neurites including one axon and multiple dendrites. The physiological structures of neurons render them particularly vulnerable to motor protein malfunction, protein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Particularly, abnormalities to dynein and mitochondria are linked to ALS (Soo et al., 2011).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Elevated {{levels of}} serum unconju-gated {{bilirubin}} (UCB) {{in the first}} weeks of life may lead to long-term neurologic impairment. We previously reported that an early exposure of developing neurons to UCB, in conditions mimicking moderate to severe neonatal jaundice, leads to <b>neuritic</b> <b>atrophy</b> and cell death. Here, we have further analyzed the effect of UCB on nerve cell differentiation and neuronal development, addressing how UCB may affect the viability of undif-ferentiated neural precursor cells and their fate deci-sions, {{as well as the}} development of hippocampal neu-rons in terms of dendritic and axonal elongation and branching, the axonal growth cone morphology, and the establishment of dendritic spines and synapses. Our results indicate that UCB reduces the viability of prolifer-ating neural precursors, decreases neurogenesis without affecting astrogliogenesis, and increases cellular dysfunc-tion in differentiating cells. In addition, an early exposure of neurons to UCB decreases the number of dendritic and axonal branches at 3 and 9 days in vitro (DIV), and a higher number of neurons showed a smaller growth cone area. UCB-treated neurons also reveal a decreased density of dendritic spines and synapses at 21 DIV. Such deleterious role of UCB in neuronal differen-tiation, development, and plasticity may compromise the performance of the brain in later life. ' 2009 Wiley Periodi...|$|E
40|$|Neuropsychiatric {{behaviours}} occur {{frequently in}} Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and {{are thought to}} arise from the neurodegenerative process. However, {{it is unclear whether}} neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus are associated with neuropsychiatric behaviours such as aggression. In this study, semiquantitative measurements of cell loss, <b>atrophy,</b> <b>neuritic</b> plaque and neurofibrillary tangle load in the postmortem hippocampus were taken for dementia patients, prospectively assessed for neuropsychiatric behaviours. It was found that increased tangle load, but not other hippocampal neuropathological variables, was associated with increased severity of aggressive behaviours and presence of chronic aggression. This study suggests a pathogenic link between neurofibrillary tangle load and aggressive behaviours in the hippocampus of dementia patients...|$|R
40|$|Whether the neuropathological {{profile of}} mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) reflects an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia is not clear. Identifying which phenomena initiate disease and which occur secondary to the neuropathological process is important for targeted disease prevention. Current definitions of MCI include amnestic (aMCI), nonamnestic (nMCI), and multidomain (mMCI) subtypes. In an unbiased population-based cohort of brain donors, we have determined how many individuals fulfill these criteria in the period leading up to death [n= 10 (5 multidomain MCI, 4 amnestic MCI, 1 nonamnestic MCI) ]. All MCI cases were collapsed into 1 group and we tested whether their pathologic profile, including markers of Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease (VD), is intermediate to individuals (matched for age, sex, and education) without cognitive impairment (n= 20) or dementia (n= 20). The main findings are of a significant linear trend in the odds of <b>neuritic</b> plaques (entorhinal/hippocampus), <b>atrophy</b> (hippocampal and cortical), infarcts, and small vessel disease (SVD) with increased cognitive impairment. Neuropathologically, MCI is complex, with 10 % of MCI brains classified as normal, 10 % as VD, 10 % as AD, and 40 % as mixed AD/VD, with the remaining showing other pathologies. Rather than pure pathologic changes, several different factors seem {{to contribute to the}} impairment of MCI. In MCI, both AD and non-AD pathology should be considered as possible intervention targets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} {{hypothesized that}} achievement of recovery of brain function after the injury requires {{the reconstruction of}} neuronal networks, including neurite regeneration and synapse reformation. Kihi-to is composed of twelve crude drugs, {{some of which have}} already been shown to possess neurite extension properties in our previous studies. The effect of Kihi-to on memory deficit has not been examined. Thus, the goal of the present study is to determine the in vivo and in vitro effects of Kihi-to on memory, neurite growth and synapse reconstruction. Methods Effects of Kihi-to, a traditional Japanese-Chinese traditional medicine, on memory deficits and losses of neurites and synapses were examined using Alzheimer's disease model mice. Improvements of Aβ(25 – 35) -induced <b>neuritic</b> <b>atrophy</b> by Kihi-to and the mechanism were investigated in cultured cortical neurons. Results Administration of Kihi-to for consecutive 3 days resulted in marked improvements of Aβ(25 – 35) -induced impairments in memory acquisition, memory retention, and object recognition memory in mice. Immunohistochemical comparisons suggested that Kihi-to attenuated neuritic, synaptic and myelin losses in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Kihi-to also attenuated the calpain increase in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. When Kihi-to was added to cells 4 days after Aβ(25 – 35) treatment, axonal and dendritic outgrowths in cultured cortical neurons were restored as demonstrated by extended lengths of phosphorylated neurofilament-H (P-NF-H) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 2 -positive neurites. Aβ(25 – 35) -induced cell death in cortical culture was also markedly inhibited by Kihi-to. Since NF-H, MAP 2 and myelin basic protein (MBP) are substrates of calpain, and calpain is known to be involved in Aβ-induced axonal atrophy, expression levels of calpain and calpastatin were measured. Treatment with Kihi-to inhibited the Aβ(25 – 35) -evoked increase in the calpain level and decrease in the calpastatin level. In addition, Kihi-to inhibited Aβ(25 – 35) -induced calcium entry. Conclusion In conclusion Kihi-to clearly improved the memory impairment and losses of neurites and synapses. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{conclusive}} {{diagnosis of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{can be made}} only by correlating clinical findings and neuropathological studies of post-mortem tissues. Two leading neuropathological changes correlate with the diagnosis of AD: first, the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which accumulate in neuronal perikarya and are made of paired helical filaments (PHFs) containing the microtubule-associated protein tau; second, extracellular amyloid deposits {{in the form of}} diffuse or neuritic senile plaques which contain the amyloid peptide. In AD, NFTs can be easily visualized using antibodies recognizing the microtubule associated protein tau and are composed of bundles of PHFs. In the autopsy-derived AD brain, tau is hyperphosphorylated and more than 30 phosphorylation sites have been identified in PHF-tau proteins. The formation of NFTs is thought to be associated with a collapse of the microtubule network, disturbances of axoplasmic transports, synapse loss, <b>neuritic</b> <b>atrophy,</b> and neuronal death. Senile plaques are extracellular lesions which have been shown by electron micro-scopic studies to contain amyloid fibrils. Fibrils were isolated and a small 4. 2 kDa poly-peptide was purified from this material. The amyloid peptide found in amyloid deposits of AD is designated Abeta. Since the Abeta peptide is small and unlikely to be a primary translational product, it was predicted to arise from a larger precursor. In 1987, this amyloid peptide precursor (APP) was characterised from the analysis of a full-length cDNA encoding a primary translational product of 695 residues. This protein is synthetized by neurons as a 100 -kDa glycosylated transmembrane protein with a single membrane spanning domain. The use of cellular models has clearly identified two catabolic pathways for APP. A non amyloidogenic pathway, in which APP is cleaved by beta-secretase within the sequence of the amyloid peptide. This cleavage precludes the formation of the full-length Abeta found in the amyloid core of senile plaques. A second catabolic pathway of APP leads to the production of Abeta from its precursor. In this amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by beta-secretase at the N-terminus of Abeta. The C-terminal fragment of APP thus formed is in turn cleaved by beta-secretase to release the full-length amyloid peptide. In primary cultures of neurons over-expressing APP, the production of intraneuronal Abeta induces neuronal apoptosis. This neurotoxicity, which is not observed in epithelial cells, seems {{to be related to the}} formation of intraneuronal aggregates of Abeta 1 - 42. In AD, the specific inhibition of beta- or beta-secretase activities would decrease the production of Abeta from its precursor, in such a way that its relative concentration could be low enough to avoid the formation of aggregates. Molecules which can interact with Abeta in order to inhibit its aggregation are also being developed. Immunization against Abeta has also been tested in both animal models and clinical studies. Although these clinical studies had to be interrupted due to the development of T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis in some patients, very preliminary results indicate that antibodies against Abeta slow cognitive decline in AD, and generate areas of neocortex devoid of senile plaques...|$|E
