40|$|Nucleotide {{metabolism}} in potato (Solanum tuberosum) mitochondria was studied using 31 P-nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy and the O 2 electrode. Immediately following the addition of ADP, ATP synthesis exceeded the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, fueled by succinate oxidation, due to mitochondrial adenylate kinase (AK) activity two to four times the maximum activity of ATP synthase. Only when the AK reaction approached equilibrium was oxidative phosphorylation the primary mechanism for net ATP synthesis. A pool of sequestered ATP in mitochondria enabled AK and ATP synthase to convert AMP to ATP {{in the presence of}} exogenous inorganic phosphate. During this conversion, AK activity can indirectly influence rates of oxidation of both succinate and NADH via changes in mitochondrial ATP. Mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphokinase, in cooperation with ATP synthase, was found to facilitate phosphorylation of <b>nucleoside</b> <b>diphosphates</b> other than ADP at rates similar to the maximum rate of oxidative phosphorylation.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that acylphosphatase possesses ATP-diphosphohydrolase (apyrase-like) activity. In fact, acylphosphatase first catalyses the hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate group of nucleoside triphosphates, and then attacks the beta-phosphate group of the initially produced <b>nucleoside</b> <b>diphosphates,</b> generating <b>nucleoside</b> monophosphates. In contrast, it binds nucleoside monophosphates but does not catalyse their hydrolyses. The calculated k(cat) values for the nucleoside triphosphatase activity of acylphosphatase are of the same order of magnitude as those displayed by certain G-proteins. An acidic environment enhances the apyrase-like activity of acylphosphatase. The true nucleotide substrates of acylphosphatase are free nucleoside di- and triphosphates, {{as indicated by the}} Mg(2 +) ion inhibition of the activity. We have also demonstrated that, although nucleoside triphosphates are still hydrolysed at pH 7. 2 and 37 degrees C, in the presence of millimolar Mg(2 +) concentrations this occurs at a lower rate. Taken together with the previously observed strong increase of acylphosphatase levels during induced cell differentiation, our findings suggest that acylphosphatase plays {{an active role in the}} differentiation process (as well as in other processes, such as apoptosis) by modulating the ratio between the cellular levels of <b>nucleoside</b> <b>diphosphates</b> and <b>nucleoside</b> triphosphates...|$|R
