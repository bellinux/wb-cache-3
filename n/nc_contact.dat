50|$|Where {{a switch}} {{contains}} both normally open (NO) and normally closed (<b>NC)</b> <b>contacts,</b> {{the order in}} which they make and break can be significant. In most cases, the rule is break-before-make or B-B-M; that is, the NO and <b>NC</b> <b>contacts</b> are never simultaneously closed during the transition between states. This is not always the case, Form C contacts follow this rule, while the otherwise equivalent Form D contacts follow the opposite rule, make before break. The less common configuration, when the NO and <b>NC</b> <b>contacts</b> are simultaneously closed during the transition, is make-before-break or M-B-B.|$|R
50|$|Since relays are switches, the {{terminology}} applied to switches is also applied to relays; a relay switches {{one or more}} poles, each of whose contacts can be thrown by energizing the coil. Normally open (NO) contacts connect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is disconnected when the relay is inactive. Normally closed (<b>NC)</b> <b>contacts</b> disconnect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is connected when the relay is inactive.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{constructing}} an abstract model for analyzing and diagnosing electrical circuit ladder diagrams (LDs) using Petri nets, and also supporting network-based monitoring and supervision. This approach converts normal open (NO) and normal close (<b>NC)</b> <b>contacts</b> in the LD into Petri net transitions, and converts devices (e. g. relay coils) in the LD into Petri net places. This study introduces the concepts of composite transi-tions, composite places, and relevant state to reduce complexity and increase readability of Petri nets for constructing abstract models. The current study constructing diagnosis of fault modeling, introduces simple matrix manipula-tion and the difference output vector (DOV) to determine the faulty area for diagnosis in the ladder diagram. An LD controller example demonstrates the usable approach...|$|R
50|$|Other {{uses for}} these {{contacts}} have been found. One is to interrupt a signal path to enable other circuitry to be inserted. This {{is done by}} using one <b>NC</b> <b>contact</b> of a stereo jack to connect the tip and ring together when no plug is inserted. The tip is then made the output, and the ring the input (or vice versa), thus forming a patch point.|$|E
50|$|Another use is {{to provide}} {{alternative}} mono or stereo output facilities on some guitars and electronic organs. This is achieved by using two mono jacks, one for left channel and one for right, and wiring the <b>NC</b> <b>contact</b> on the right channel jack {{to the tip of}} the other, to connect the two connector tips together when the right channel output is not in use. This then mixes the signals so that the left channel jack doubles as a mono output.|$|E
50|$|Panel-mounting jacks {{are often}} {{provided}} with switch contacts. Most commonly, a mono jack {{is provided with}} one normally closed (<b>NC)</b> <b>contact,</b> which {{is connected to the}} tip (live) connection when no plug is in the socket, and disconnected when a plug is inserted. Stereo sockets commonly provide two such NC contacts, one for the tip (left channel live) and one for the ring or collar (right channel live). Some designs of jack also have such a connection on the sleeve. As this contact is usually ground, it is not much use for signal switching, but could be used to indicate to electronic circuitry that the socket was in use.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of these}} contacts was for switching in telephone exchanges, for which there were many patterns. Two sets of change-over contacts, isolated from the connector contacts, were common. The more recent pattern of one <b>NC</b> <b>contact</b> for each signal path, internally attached to the connector contact, stems from their use as headphone jacks. In many amplifiers and equipment containing them, such as electronic organs, a headphone jack is provided that disconnects the loudspeakers when in use. This is done by means of these switch contacts. In other equipment, a dummy load is provided when the headphones are not connected. This is also easily provided by means of these NC contacts.|$|E
50|$|Force-guided {{contacts}} {{by themselves}} {{can not guarantee}} that all contacts {{are in the same}} state, however they do guarantee, subject to no gross mechanical fault, that no contacts are in opposite states. Otherwise, a relay with several normally open (NO) contacts may stick when energised, with some contacts closed and others still slightly open, due to mechanical tolerances. Similarly, a relay with several normally closed (NC) contacts may stick to the unenergised position, so that when energised, the circuit through one set of contacts is broken, with a marginal gap, while the other remains closed. By introducing both NO and NC contacts, or more commonly, changeover contacts, on the same relay, it then becomes possible to guarantee that if any <b>NC</b> <b>contact</b> is closed, all NO contacts are open, and conversely, if any NO contact is closed, all NC contacts are open. It is not possible to reliably ensure that any particular contact is closed, except by potentially intrusive and safety-degrading sensing of its circuit conditions, however in safety systems it is usually the NO state that is most important, and as explained above, this is reliably verifiable by detecting the closure of a contact of opposite sense.|$|E

Using intravascular ultrasound virtual-histology (IVUS-VH) we examined the temporal changes in composition of the plaque behind the struts (PBS) following the implantation of the everolimus eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS). Using IVUS-VH and dedicated software, the composition of plaque was analyzed in all patients from the ABSORB B trial who were imaged with a commercially available IVUS-VH console (s 5 i system, Volcano Corporation, Rancho Cordova, CA, USA) post-treatment and at 6 -month follow-up. This dedicated software enabled analysis of the PBS after subtraction of the VH signal generated by the struts. The presence of necrotic core (<b>NC)</b> in <b>contact</b> with the lumen was also evaluated at baseline and follow-up. IVUS-VH data, recorded with s 5 i system, were available at baseline and 6 -month follow-up in 15 patients and demonstrated an increase in both the area of PBS (2. 45  ±  1. 93  mm(2) vs. 3. 19  ±  2. 48  mm(2), P =  0. 005) and the external elastic membrane area (13. 76  ±  4. 07  mm(2) vs. 14. 76  ±  4. 56  mm(2), P =  0. 006).

A digital bite scan records a static, MI occlusion of the patient and orients the digital casts into the indicated occlusal relationship. This information is transferred to a milling machine that carves casts from a solid polyurethane block using a subtractive process. The completed arches can be ?snapmounted? in a proprietary articulator for restoration fabrication at a lab. Digital acquisition of the tooth preparation is comparable to traditional impression methods {{for many of the}} intraoral scanners on the market today.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the relationship between the presence of valvular calcification and plaque morphology and/or vulnerability. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to assess valvular calcification in 280 patients with coronary artery disease who underwent radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound (Virtual Histology IVUS, VH-IVUS). A propensity score-matched cohort of 192 patients (n = 96 in each group) was analyzed. Thin-capped fibroatheroma (TCFA) was defined as a necrotic core (NC) > 10 % of the plaque area with a plaque burden > 40 % and <b>NC</b> in <b>contact</b> with the lumen for ≥ 3 image slices. A remodeling index (lesion/reference vessel area) > 1. 05 was considered to be positive. Patients were divided into two groups: any calcification in at least one valve (152 patients) vs. no detectable valvular calcification (128 patients). Groups were similar in terms of age, risk factors, clinical diagnosis, and angiographic analysis after propensity score-matched analysis. Gray-scale IVUS analysis showed that the vessel size, plaque burden, minimal lumen area, and remodeling index were similar. By VH-IVUS, % NC and % dense calcium (DC) were greater in patients with valvular calcification (p = 0. 024, and p = 0. 016, respectively). However, only % DC was higher at the maximal NC site by propensity score-matched analysis (p = 0. 029). The frequency of VH-TCFA occurrence was higher depending on the complexity (p = 0. 0064) and severity (p = 0. 013) of valvular calcification. There is a significant relationship between valvular calcifications and VH-IVUS assessment of TCFAs. Valvular calcification indicates a greater atherosclerosis disease complexity (increased calcification of the coronary plaque) and vulnerable coronary plaques (higher incidence of VH-TCFA) ...|$|R
40|$|Liquid (like) {{droplets}} may {{be separated}} from the continuous phase in which they are dispersed by employing a membrane. Because droplets are deformable, the separation is not simply based on size; droplets may deform sufficiently to enter pores that are much smaller than the droplets themselves. Such a deformation requires a certain critical pressure drop, Δpc. Assuming the geometry of the droplet is determined by a natural tendency for a minimum surface area, Δpc can be shown to depend on the surface tension γ, the contact angle θ, and the ratio a of the radii of droplet and pore, rd and rp, respectively. When 100 % retention is required, Δpc should not be exceeded and, hence, this pressure drop corresponds to the highest attainable (critical) flux Nc. An almost linear increase is predicted for Δpc with a. Despite the monotone increase of Δpc, the critical flux Nc shows a maximum at a≈− 2 /cos(θ). Hence, {{on the basis of a}} and θ an optimal membrane selection can be made. In the absence of affinity (θ=π), the pore radius should be approximately two times larger then the initial droplet radius. When affinity is not negligible, the pore radius required to maintain complete retention increases rapidly, i. e., the maximum critical flux decreases and is observed at larger a. The largest change in maximum attainable <b>Nc</b> with the <b>contact</b> angle is observed at θ= 0. 75 π...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} precise and {{efficient}} nuclear radiation detection has significantly increased, especially in many scientific research fields {{as well as}} homeland security and medical imaging applications. The utilization of a quantum-dot-based semiconductor detector can, in principle, transform the capabilities of radiation detectors by yielding a high-performance detector via a low-cost solution-based fabrication modality. Nanocrystalline semiconductor (Nanocrystal, NC) materials exhibit exploitable properties, which arise due to the strong quantum confinement effect. If highly uniform multiplicities of excitons can be developed across macroscopic NC samples, then one can potentially quench the statistical counting noise associated with charge carrier creation in the bulk material. Based on the favorable features of NC materials for their application to the ionizing radiation detection, the NC approach, with a primary focus on the high atomic number and density materials (PbS, PbSe and CdTe), was investigated {{as a means to}} maximize the charge creation and minimize the uncertainty in that conversion. NC particles of different size and shape were synthesized by changing the reaction conditions, and their physical and opto-electric properties were investigated. Close-packed NC assemblies of cadmium and lead chalcogenides were formed by drop-, slide-, spin-casting or dip-coating NC dispersions on various metal contacts. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of each NC assembly were studied to evaluate its properties as an NC-assembly diode, {{as a function of the}} opto-electric properties of the <b>NC</b> particles, metal <b>contacts,</b> and the physiochemical property of the NC assembly. The responses of the NC assemblies toward radiation sources were studied via alpha particle impingement from an Am- 241 source, and the highest energy-resolution samples exhibited a gamma-ray response that was comparable to existing semiconductor materials, including high-purity germanium and cadmium-zinc-telluride. The viability of using NC materials as a basis for the detection of ionizing radiation is assessed and empirical challenges are discussed. In short, this research focuses on fabricating nuclear radiation detectors out of nanocrystalline semiconductors via a solution-based approach. Various recipes and the subsequent electrical results for the NC assembly samples will be discussed, the main attention being paid to the enhancement of the charge carrier transport properties of the NC assembly...|$|R

The X-ray crystal structures of 1, 3 ·CHCl 3, 4, 6 ·CHCl 3 ·CH 3 OH· 4 H 2 O, 7, 8 (yellow form), and 8 ·CHCl 3 (orange form) have been determined. For complex 1, the Pt(C NC) units are oriented into pairs in a head-to-tail fashion with an interplanar separation of 3. 40 Å. For complex 4, dimeric π-π overlap between Pt(C NC) and phenyl moieties in a head-to-tail manner is observed, with interplanar stacking at 3. 39 Å. There are two crystal forms for complex 8. Only one intramolecular Pt(C NC) -phenyl π-π interaction (separation 3. 381 Å) {{is apparent in}} the yellow form. For the orange form (8 ·CHCl 3), there are two intramolecular Pt(C <b>NC)</b> -phenyl π-π <b>contacts</b> (separations 3. 115 and 3. 287 Å). For 3 ·CHCl 3, the dihedral angles between the pyrazine and the two Pt(C NC) planes are 124. 0 ° and 130. 5 °, which allows the possibility for partial orbital interaction between the (5 d) Pt and pπ*(pyrazine) orbitals. Complexes 1 and 4 - 9 display vibronically structured emission (λ max of most intense band = 508 - 526 nm) in 77 K methanol/ethanol (1 : 5, v/v) glass, which are assigned to 3 IL excited states. For 1, 4 - 6, 8, and 9, the 77 K structureless emission at λ max 596 - 636 nm in methanol/ethanol glasses is assigned as ππ* excimeric in nature. These excimeric emissions are concentration-dependent for 1 and 4 - 6 and concentration-independent for 8 and 9. The 298 K solid emission spectra of 1, 4 - 6, 8, and 9 are characterized by a broad, unstructured band at λ max 566 - 633 nm, which red-shift in energy upon cooling to 77 K. These bands are comparable in energy to the 77 K glassy emissions and are similarly assigned. Complexes 2 and 3 show an intense absorption at λ max 410 (shoulder) and 456 nm, which are ascribed to the MLCT (5 d) Pt → π*(1 -methyl- 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium/pyrazine) transition, respectively.
