5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is <b>no</b> <b>warning</b> that injury is occurring.|$|E
5|$|Although the Vice President Henry A. Wallace {{had been}} {{involved}} in the Manhattan Project since the beginning, his successor, Harry S. Truman, was not briefed on the project by Stimson until April 23, 1945, eleven days after he became president on Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. On May 2, 1945, Truman approved the formation of the Interim Committee, an advisory group that would report on the atomic bomb. It consisted of Stimson, James F. Byrnes, George L. Harrison, Vannevar Bush, James Bryant Conant, Karl Taylor Compton, William L. Clayton, and Ralph Austin Bard, advised by scientists Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Arthur Compton. In a June 1 report, the Committee concluded that the bomb should be used as soon as possible against a war plant surrounded by workers' homes and that <b>no</b> <b>warning</b> or demonstration should be given.|$|E

5|$|Of the 158 {{people on}} board, 73 {{died as a}} result of the crash. The lead flight {{attendant}} was the only crew member to survive. Of the surviving passengers, 72 adults and children over three years old sustained serious injuries, while two sustained minor injuries. Of the 11 infants, two sustained minor injuries, eight were seriously injured, and one, Kenneth Fernando Martinez, the four-month-old son of Gloria L. Martinez, died. The surviving steward testified that there had been no communication from the cockpit as to the unfolding situation and, thus, <b>no</b> <b>warning</b> in the end to assume brace positions. The NTSB report held that, had passengers been warned ahead of time to brace for impact, the severity of some injuries might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly and with <b>no</b> <b>warning</b> symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages}} of a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 6 November 1794 (Known in French as the Combat du 16 Brumaire an III) was a naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars. Two British ships of the line, HMS Alexander and HMS Canada were intercepted while returning to Britain through the Celtic Sea {{by a large}} French squadron. The French squadron had sailed from Brest {{in search of an}} inward bound British convoy in October, but instead encountered the two British ships returning from escorting an outward-bound convoy. There had been <b>no</b> <b>warning</b> of the French approach as the British force assigned to watch Brest was absent at Plymouth due to the policy of operating a distant blockade.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{attracted}} the attention of Bartholomew Iscanus, Bishop of Exeter, who made him archdeacon at Totnes in about 1161, after Baldwin's father's death. Baldwin was known as a canon lawyer during his holding of Totnes. He received a letter from John of Salisbury in 1167, complaining about Bartholomew's conduct during the Becket controversy. John accused Bartholomew of not properly supporting Thomas Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury in his dispute with the king, urging Baldwin to influence the bishop to increase his support, and not to sign any appeal by the English bishops against Becket. Other letters from John dealt with rumours concerning Roger, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had heard was speaking badly of Becket. John's purpose seems to have been to have Baldwin pass along a warning from Becket to Roger about his behaviour; John was a supporter of Becket's during the latter's exile. In 1169 Baldwin was once again peripherally involved in the Becket dispute, when he objected to Becket's excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing Becket's cause. Baldwin's objection was not so much that they were excommunicated, but that <b>no</b> <b>warning</b> had been given that such an action was contemplated.|$|E
5|$|Many of the tornadoes {{embedded}} in this initial squall line were weak, though several were strong and caused considerable damage. An EF3 caused major damage to homes in Coaling, Alabama, an EF2 and an EF3 caused major damage and a fatality near Eupora, Mississippi, and an EF3 caused heavy damage in downtown Cordova, Alabama, which {{was struck by}} a deadly EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded cell that began in Cullman County, Alabama produced a long-tracked EF2 that struck the town of Hanceville, killing one person. That cell would go on to produce over ten tornadoes (mostly EF1s) to the northeast in Marshall County and another EF1 in Dade County, Georgia. The initial storms caused widespread power and telephone line outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some NOAA weather radio transmitter sites to stop functioning {{for the remainder of the}} outbreak. As a result, many people had <b>no</b> <b>warning</b> of approaching tornadoes later in the day.|$|E
5|$|With even a {{few hundred}} missiles, the Soviets could afford to target every US bomber base. With <b>no</b> <b>warning</b> system in place, a sneak attack could destroy a {{significant}} amount of the US bomber fleet on the ground. The US would still have the airborne alert force and its own small ICBM fleet, but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch, leaving them with a massive strategic advantage. To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would come too late to cover this period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E

At 0900 UTC the following day, the warnings in Visayas were extended to include the provinces of Leyte and Biliran. The warnings were also expanded to include numerous provinces in Luzon. Later that day, all preexisting warnings in Visayas and Mindanao were upgraded to signal No. 2 classification, while other areas of Visayas were issued new signal <b>No.</b> 1 <b>warnings.</b> In Luzon, the provinces of Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate, Burias Island, and Ticao Island were upgraded to <b>No.</b> 2 <b>warnings,</b> while the provinces of Quezon, Polillo Island, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Marinduque, and Romblon remained under or were issued <b>No.</b> 1 <b>warnings.</b> As Rumbia approached the coast, <b>No.</b> 1 <b>warnings</b> were expanded to include additional provinces, while <b>No.</b> 2 <b>warnings</b> generally covered the same areas up until landfall.

25|$|These {{rules of}} {{engagement}} {{were based on the}} situation in 1968, when North Vietnam's surface-to-air missiles were controlled by fire control radars with a high-pulse recurring frequency, which keyed an alarm in the USAF aircraft. By late 1971, shortly after Lavelle had taken command of 7th Air Force, the North Vietnamese had begun networking their long-range search radars with the missile sites. These additional sources of radar data allowed North Vietnam to turn on SAM radar at the last second, giving US aircrews virtually <b>no</b> <b>warning.</b>|$|E
