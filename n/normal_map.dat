2500|$|Coming {{back to the}} [...] "existence" [...] {{question}} from above, we see that a space X has the homotopy type of a smooth manifold {{if and only if}} it receives a <b>normal</b> <b>map</b> of degree one whose surgery obstruction vanishes. This leads to a multi-step obstruction process: In order to speak of normal maps, X must satisfy an appropriate version of Poincaré duality which turns it into a Poincaré complex. Supposing that X is a Poincaré complex, the Pontryagin-Thom construction shows that a <b>normal</b> <b>map</b> of degree one to X exists if and only if the Spivak normal fibration of X has a reduction to a stable vector bundle. If normal maps of degree one to X exist, their bordism classes (called normal invariants) are classified by the set of homotopy classes [...] Each of these normal invariants has a surgery obstruction; X has the homotopy type of a smooth manifold if and only if one of these obstructions is zero. Stated differently, this means that there is a choice of normal invariant with zero image under the surgery obstruction map ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{consider}} the case where the dimension n=4k is a multiple of four, and [...] It is known that [...] is isomorphic to the integers under this isomorphism the surgery obstruction of f maps, up to a scalar factor, to the difference of the signatures [...] of X and M.

50|$|Basic <b>normal</b> <b>mapping</b> can be {{implemented}} in any hardware that supports palettized textures. The first game console to have specialized <b>normal</b> <b>mapping</b> hardware was the Sega Dreamcast. However, Microsoft's Xbox was the first console to widely use the effect in retail games. Out of the sixth generation consoles, only the PlayStation 2's GPU lacks built-in <b>normal</b> <b>mapping</b> support, though it can be simulated using the PlayStation 2 hardware's vector units. Games for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 rely heavily on <b>normal</b> <b>mapping</b> and were the first generation {{to make use of}} parallax mapping.

50|$|The cobordism {{classes of}} <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> on X are called normal invariants.

2500|$|In the {{classical}} approach, as developed by Browder, Novikov, Sullivan and Wall, surgery {{is done on}} normal maps of degree one. Using surgery, the question [...] "Is the <b>normal</b> <b>map</b> f: M → X of degree one cobordant to a homotopy equivalence?" [...] can be translated (in dimensions greater than four) to an algebraic statement about some element in an L-group of the group ring [...] More precisely, the question has a positive answer {{if and only if}} the surgery obstruction [...] is zero, where n is the dimension of M.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} surface <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> of {{an object}} from either its diffuse or specular reflectance using four spherical gradient illumination patterns. In contrast to traditional photometric stereo, the spherical patterns allow normals to be estimated simultaneously from any number of viewpoints. We present two polarized lighting techniques that allow the diffuse and specular <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> {{of an object}} to be measured independently. For scattering materials, we show that the specular <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> yield the best record of detailed surface shape while the diffuse normals deviate from the true surface normal due to subsurface scattering, and that this effect is dependent on wavelength. We show several applications of this acquisition technique. First, we capture <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> of a facial performance simultaneously from several viewing positions using time-multiplexed illumination. Second, we show that highresolution <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> based on the specular component {{can be used with}} structured light 3 D scanning to quickly acquire high-resolution facial surface geometry using off-the-shelf digital still cameras. Finally, we present a realtime shading model that uses independently estimated <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> for the specular and diffuse color channels to reproduce some of the perceptually important effects of subsurface scattering. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Normal</b> <b>maps</b> {{are widely}} used as a {{resource-efficient}} means of simulating detailed topology on 3 D surfaces in the gaming, simulation, and film industries. However, as surface mesh density increases, it is unknown at what level of density these increases become no longer perceivable, and whether <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> significantly affect this threshold. This study examined at what point participants were unable to discern differences between one level of mesh density and another using an adapted staircase model. Participants identified this threshold for five different organic character models. The averages {{of each of these}} thresholds were taken and compared against the results of a control group, which observed the same models without <b>normal</b> <b>maps.</b> The study found that the average threshold for discerning differences in level of detail occurred in the 3, 000 to 14, 000 polygon range for <b>normal</b> <b>mapped</b> models, and the 240, 000 to 950, 000 range for the control group. This analysis suggested that <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> {{have a significant impact on}} the viewer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to discern differences in detail, and that developing graphics beyond the range of 3, 000 to 14, 000 polygons is unnecessary for organic character models when <b>normal</b> <b>maps</b> are used. ...|$|R

40|$|This work investigates face {{recognition}} based on <b>normal</b> <b>maps,</b> {{and the performance}} improvement that can be obtained when exploiting it within a multimodal system, where a further independent module processes visible images. We first propose a technique to align two 3 D models of a face by means of <b>normal</b> <b>maps,</b> which is very fast while providing an accuracy comparable to well-known and more general techniques such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP). Moreover, we propose a matching criterion based on a technique which exploits difference maps.
