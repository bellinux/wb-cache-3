Initially a mechanical prototype machine was designed, built and successfully tested to prove the knitting mechanism and its interaction with the patterning rings. The second prototype has a mechatronic patterning mechanism, hence increasing the patterning capabilities significantly, and enabling changing fabric pattern change during knitting without requiring long machine stoppages and cam changes...|$|R

40|$|Placing {{engineering}} objects (roads, embankments etc.) on low-bearing ground {{requires the}} use of geosynthetics as a reinforcement of it. Cellular geonets of three dimensional structure and honeycomb form are traditionally made from sets of perforated poliethylene straps ultrasonically bonded by spot welds. This article presents an original, innovative structure of a cellular geonet based on the technology of producing three dimensional knit-ted fabrics with {{the use of}} warp knitting machines with two <b>needle</b> <b>bars.</b> A 3 D knitted geonet can be designed considering its three dimensional configuration and strength properties in the aspect of the anisotropic character of its structure.

50|$|When {{creating}} a zigzag stitch, the back-and-forth {{motion of the}} sewing machine's needle is controlled by a cam. As the cam rotates, a fingerlike follower, connected to the <b>needle</b> <b>bar,</b> rides along the cam and tracks its indentations. As the follower moves in and out, the <b>needle</b> <b>bar</b> is moved from side to side. Very old sewing machines lack this hardware and so cannot natively produce a zigzag stitch, but there are often shank-driven attachments available which enable them to do so.|$|E

The design uses a transverse shuttle lockstitch mechanism with the upper mechanism and the <b>needle</b> <b>bar</b> secreted beneath a bronzed cast iron lion. A pair of matching legs could be attached to hide the lower <b>needle</b> <b>bar</b> and presser foot when the machine was not in use. The treadle was equally ornate with depictions of a lion and eagle as well as the motto ‘Strength and Speed’. The Lion sewing machine was the only British-made sewing machine to win a medal at the American Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. A rare example of both the Lion treadle machine of 1868 and hand crank model of 1902 can be seen at Glasgow Museums Resource Centre.|$|E

50|$|In 1790, the English {{inventor}} Thomas Saint {{invented the}} first sewing machine design, {{but he did}} not successfully advertise or market his invention. His machine was meant to be used on leather and canvas material. It is likely that Saint had a working model but {{there is no evidence of}} one; he was a skilled cabinet maker and his device included many practically functional features: an overhanging arm, a feed mechanism (adequate for short lengths of leather), a vertical <b>needle</b> <b>bar,</b> and a looper.|$|E

As the double cam rotates, the first follower rides along one track to move the <b>needle</b> <b>bar</b> from side to side, while the second follower rides along a different track to move the feed dogs forward and reverse.|$|E

50|$|During 1837-38 Professor Page of Massachusetts had {{discovered}} that a <b>needle</b> or thin <b>bar</b> of iron, placed {{in the hollow of}} a coil or bobbin of insulated wire, would emit an audible 'tick' at each interruption of a current, flowing in the coil, and if these separate ticks followed each other fast enough, by a rapid interruption of the current, they would run together into a continuous hum, to which he gave the name galvanic music. He also found that the pitch of this note corresponded to the rate of the current's interruption. These faint sounds were due to magnetostriction. From these and other discoveries by Noad, Wertheim, Marrian, and others, Reis knew that if the current which had been interrupted by his vibrating diaphragm were conveyed to a distance by wires and then passed through a coil like that of Page's, the iron needle would emit notes like those which had caused the oscillation of the transmitting diaphragm. Acting on this knowledge, he constructed his rudimentary telephone. Reis' prototype is now in the museum of the Reichs Post-Amt, Berlin.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether high-pressure injection of air into the brain of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) could render the animal unconscious and insensible immediately and permanently. In the study, 48 African catfish with a live weight of 900 - 1900 g were restrained and equipped with EEG and ECG electrodes and then stunned. The catfish were stunned mechanically using a captive needle pistol. The pressure to shoot the <b>needle</b> was 8 <b>bar</b> and that to inject the air was 3 bar for 1. 5 s. The catfish behaviour was observed during and after stunning. and waves and spikes, which precede a stoppage in brain activity as measured on the EEG, were used as indices for the measurement of immediate induction of unconsciousness and insensibility In 23 of 42 fish, an iso-electric line was observed after an average of 13. 4 s, while in the remaining fish the and waves and spikes remained on the EEG during the recording period. In all cases, the ECG showed an irregular heart rate with fibrillation and extra systolae. Moreover, the configuration showed ischaemia. Before the captive needle stunning, free-swimming fish (n= 7) explored the tank for an average of 21 ± 12 s before lying down at the bottom. After stunning, they showed clonic uncoordinated swimming movements. The movements stopped after an average of 38 ± 50 s. In another group (n= 7) that was stunned and subsequently placed in ice water, clonic cramps were observed in two out of seven animals. When taking into account the number of animals with a reliable EEG (n= 42) and using 95 onfidence intervals, it was concluded that at least 93 f the catfish were effectively stunned using a correctly positioned captive needle pistol.

50|$|In 1854, Wilson {{patented}} his four-motion feed, {{in combination}} with a spring presser foot. The feed bar, as its name indicates, had four distinct motions, two vertical and two horizontal.
