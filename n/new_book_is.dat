25|$|Their {{latest book}} to date, The Body Shape Bible, was {{published}} on 18 September 2007. Prior to writing The Body Shape Bible, Trinny and Susannah {{conducted a survey}} on women that helped them to identify the twelve most common body shapes which they would then feature in their fashion advice book. They gave the shapes different names that include 'apple', 'brick', 'pencil' and 'lollipop'. The <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> aimed to help women decipher what particular shape they are, and then proceeds to give fashion guidelines according to each individual shape. An 'apple' for instance, is classed {{as a woman who}} is round but has breasts that are smaller than her stomach as the weight is carried around the middle. They have also donated a few pages to highlight their own fashion faux-pas from the past.|$|E

Esther Howard {{wrote in}} The Spectator, [...] "Surprisingly Ian Fleming's <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> a romantic one and, {{except for some}} early sex in England (rather well done, this) only just as nasty as is needed to show how {{absolutely}} thrilling it is for... the narrator to be rescued from both death and worse – than by a he-man like James Bond. Myself, I like the Daphne du Maurier touch and prefer it this way but I doubt his real fans will." ...|$|E

500|$|English author Giles Foden in The Guardian called Last Night in Twisted River [...] "a very playful novel": it {{toyed with}} {{character}} and the [...] "fluidity of identity", suggesting that someone may [...] "perform [...] identity rather than be defined by it". Foden said that the whole novel {{could be seen as}} a performance of Irving's own literary identity. More of Irving's [...] "playfulness" [...] manifests itself {{at the end of the}} book when the first sentence of Danny's <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> the same as the first sentence of Last Night in Twisted River—Danny is writing the very book we have been reading. And the book cover of a wind-bent pine tree (photographed by Irving's son, Everett) is the same tree Danny and Irving see from the window of their writing shacks in Pointe au Baril Station in Ontario.|$|E
500|$|Tom Shone, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, praised the novel for its {{atypical}} qualities for Ellis, [...] "known for his orgies of violence". Shone asks [...] "Why {{is a new}} sequel to Less Than Zero... so moving?", noting the presence of [...] "feelings" [...] in the novel to be starkly different from Ellis' usual style. Touching on its personal qualities, Shone notes [...] "If Lunar Park unspooled the atrocities of American Psycho back to their source, Imperial Bedrooms pulls the thread further and reaches Less Than Zero". The emotive energy in the <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{traced back to the}} last pages of Lunar Park as well; fellow writer Jay McInerney observes that [...] "The last few pages of [...] are among the most moving passages I know in recent American fiction ... Bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book." [...] Vice observes that the [...] "final passages in both Imperial Bedrooms and Lunar Park pack a lot of emotional impact." [...] San Francisco Chronicle hails Imperial Bedrooms as [...] "the very definition of authorly meta: Ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can't write his way out of it, or else he is such a genius that he's created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself like some kind of Escher print." ...|$|E

6000|$|Note by the editor: I do not {{quarrel with}} the {{contents}} of such valuable compendiums as [...] "Who's Who," [...] "Men and Women of the Time," [...] etc., etc. But they leave out the really Representative People. The names that they include are so well known as to need no commentary, while those that they exclude are the very people one most wishes to read about.

6000|$|Certain modern books, [...] "on large paper," [...] {{are safe}} investments. The [...] "Badminton Library," [...] an English {{series of books}} on sport, is at a huge premium already, when on [...] "large paper." [...] But one should never buy the book unless, {{as in the case}} of Dr. John Hill Burton's [...] "Book-Hunter" [...] (first edition), it is not only on large paper, and not only rare (twenty- five copies), but also {{readable}} and interesting. {7} A collector should have the taste to see when a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> in itself valuable and charming, and when its author is likely to succeed, so that his early attempts ({{as in the case of}} Mr. Matthew Arnold, Lord Tennyson, and a few others of the moderns) are certain to become things of curious interest.|$|E

60|$|The {{launching}} of {{a volume of}} this kind in neo-Georgian days by one who began writing in mid-Victorian, and has published nothing to speak of for some years, may seem {{to call for a}} few words of excuse or explanation. Whether or no, readers may feel assured that a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> submitted to them with great hesitation at so belated a date. Insistent practical reasons, however, among which were requests from some illustrious men of letters who are in sympathy with my productions, the accident that several of the poems have already seen the light, and that dozens of them have been lying about for years, compelled the course adopted, in spite of the natural disinclination of a writer whose works have been so frequently regarded askance by a pragmatic section here and there, to draw attention to them once more.|$|E
6000|$|The {{rare book}} that {{differs from the}} rest has a bizarrerie with its originality, and in the poems of 1830 there was, assuredly, more than enough of the bizarre. There were no hyphens in the double epithets, and words like [...] "tendriltwine" [...] seemed provokingly affected. A kind of lusciousness, like that of Keats when under the {{influence}} of Leigh Hunt, may here and there be observed. Such faults as these catch the indifferent eye when a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> first opened, and the volume of 1830 was probably condemned by almost every reader of the previous generation who deigned to afford it a glance. Out of fifty-six pieces only twenty-three were reprinted in the two volumes of 1842, which won for Tennyson the general recognition of the world of letters. Five or six of the pieces then left out were added as Juvenilia in the collected works of 1871, 1872. The whole mass deserves the attention of students of the poet's development.|$|E
6000|$|After {{years of}} {{preparation}} Mr. Bellamy now puts forward a work which will command universal attention. The <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{larger and more}} comprehensive than [...] "Looking Backward." [...] The scene is the same--that is to say, {{the world of the}} twentieth century--and the same characters reappear. But while the new book tells us much that is fresh about the institutions of the world of to-morrow, its especial purpose, as distinguished from that of [...] "Looking Backward," [...] is to account for these institutions by explaining not only a righteousness and reason, but like-wise the course of historical evolution by which they were born out of the very different order of things existing to-day. In this part of his work the author has much to say of the meaning of the events of our own times, which he links with the future by predictions of changes now close upon us. The title, [...] "Equality," [...] is well chosen, in view of the general theme.|$|E

60|$|My dear Brown--I {{ought to}} be off {{at the end of}} this week, as the cold winds begin to blow towards evening;--but I will wait till I have your answer to this. I am to be introduced, before I set out, to a Dr. Clark, a {{physician}} settled at Rome, who promises to befriend me in every way there. The sale of my book is very slow, though it has been very highly rated. One of the causes, I understand from different quarters, of the unpopularity of this <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> <b>is</b> the offence the ladies take at me. On thinking that matter over, I am certain that I have said nothing in a spirit to displease any woman I would care to please; but still there is a tendency to class women in my books with roses and sweetmeats,--they never see themselves dominant. I will say no more, but, waiting in anxiety for your answer, doff my hat, and make a purse as long as I can.|$|E
60|$|One wishes our friends, the critics, would grasp {{this simple}} truth, and leave off clamoring for the impossible, and being shocked {{because they do}} not get it. When a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> written, the high-class critic opens it with {{feelings}} of faint hope, tempered by strong conviction of coming disappointment. As he pores over the pages, his brow darkens with virtuous indignation, and his lip curls with the Godlike contempt that the exceptionally great critic ever feels for everybody in this world, who is not yet dead. Buoyed up by a touching, but totally fallacious, belief that he is performing a public duty, and {{that the rest of the}} community is waiting in breathless suspense to learn his opinion of the work in question, before forming any judgment concerning it themselves, he, nevertheless, wearily struggles through about a third of it. Then his long-suffering soul revolts, and he flings it aside with a cry of despair.|$|E
