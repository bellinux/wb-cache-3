40|$|While {{the use of}} nanopesticides {{in modern}} {{agriculture}} continues to increase, their effects on crop plants are still poorly understood. Here, 4 week old spinach plants grown in an artificial medium were exposed via foliar spray to Cu(OH) 2 <b>nanopesticide</b> (0. 18 and 18 mg/plant) or Cu ions (0. 15 and 15 mg/plant) for 7 days. A gas chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry metabolomics approach was applied to assess metabolic alterations induced by Cu(OH) 2 <b>nanopesticide</b> in spinach leaves. Exposure to Cu(OH) 2 <b>nanopesticide</b> and copper ions induced alterations in the metabolite profiles of spinach leaves. Compared to the control, exposure to 18 mg of Cu(OH) 2 <b>nanopesticide</b> induced significant reduction (29 - 85 %) in antioxidant or defense-associated metabolites including ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, threonic acid, β-sitosterol, 4 -hydroxybutyric acid, ferulic acid, and total phenolics. The metabolic pathway for ascorbate and aldarate was disturbed in all exposed spinach plants (<b>nanopesticide</b> and Cu 2 +). Cu 2 + {{is responsible for the}} reduction in antioxidants and perturbation of the ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. However, nitrogen metabolism perturbation was nanopesticide-specific. Spinach biomass and photosynthetic pigments were not altered, indicating that metabolomics can be a rapid and sensitive tool for the detection og earlier <b>nanopesticide</b> effects.

Metabolomics can capture a snapshot of cellular metabolic responses to a stressor. We selected maize and cucumber as model plants for exposure to different doses of Cu(OH) 2 <b>nanopesticide.</b> GC-TOF-MS-based metabolomics was employed to determine the metabolic responses of these two species. Results revealed significant differences in metabolite profile changes between maize and cucumber. Furthermore, the Cu(OH) 2 <b>nanopesticide</b> induced metabolic reprogramming in both species, but in different manners. In maize, several intermediate metabolites of the glycolysis pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were up-regulated, indicating the energy metabolism was activated. In addition, the levels of aromatic compounds (4 -hydroxycinnamic acid and 1, 2, 4 -benzenetriol) and their precursors (phenylalanine, tyrosine) were enhanced, indicating the activation of shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in maize leaves, which is an antioxidant defense-related pathway. In cucumber, arginine and proline metabolic pathways were the most significantly altered pathway. Both species exhibited altered levels of fatty acids and polysaccharides, suggesting the cell membrane and cell wall composition may change in response to Cu(OH) 2 <b>nanopesticide.</b> Thus, metabolomics helps to deeply understand the differential response of these plants to the same <b>nanopesticide</b> stressor...|$|E

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) or anionic clays are especially convenient as host materials for anionic or acid pesticides to decreasetheir soil leaching losses, which areoftenvery high for this type of pesticides, particularly if they have high water solubility [4]. Alkylammonium cationic clays have also been shown as good carriers for pesticides in controlled release formulations [3, 5]. We prepared and compared <b>nanopesticide</b> formulations of a very water soluble anionic herbicide, bispyribac (BIS), as LDH and as alkylammonium clay complexes, whose water and soil behaviour were lab-tested, as smart deliverysystemsto minimize their surface and ground water impact.

This concern has generated research efforts to reduce pesticide environmental risks by developing formulations which gradually release the active ingredient supported on diverse materials (Perez-deLuque & Hermosin 2013). This type of slow-release formulation is fundamental for anionic herbicide as Imazamox, because its high soil mobility. The concept of <b>nanopesticide</b> has very recently appeared in the phytopathology (Kah et al. 2013, Perez-deLuque&Hermosin 2013, Cabrera et al. 2015) being specially interesting for the systemic pesticide, which are those needing to enter in the plant by leaves or roots to act versus pest.

In preparation of nanoemulsion Tween® 80 /Span® 80 as nonionic surfactants via ultrasonic emulsification method was used. The average droplets size of clove oil nanoemulsion decreased {{with an increase in}} duty cycle; whereas pulsed ultrasound with proper intervals was more efficient than continuous ultrasonication. In order to replace the use of organic solvent and increase the dispersity of active ingredient, suitable emulsifiers were used. The nanopesticides made by ultrasound at optimum formula conditions were defined at ultrasonication time of 300 s, surfactants concentration of 5 wt%, hydrophilic–lipophilic balance number of 9, duty cycle 0. 75 % and ultrasonic intensity 208 W/cm 2. The stability of droplets size of nanoemulsions for duration of 6 months was evaluated. Stable nanoemulsion clove oil with 10 wt% of clove oil content was formulated at optimum conditions with average droplets size around 43 nm at the beginning and after 6 months nanoemulsions re-sized and it was around 100 nm.

In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized using a cheap leaf extract of Berberis tinctoria as reducing and stabilizing agent and tested against Ae. albopictus and two mosquito natural enemies. AgNPs were characterized by using UV–vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. In laboratory conditions, the toxicity of AgNPs was evaluated on larvae and pupae of Ae. albopictus. Suitability Index/Predator Safety Factor was assessed on Toxorhynchites splendens and Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides. The leaf extract of B. tinctoria was toxic against larval instars (I–IV) and pupae of Ae. albopictus; LC 50 was 182. 72  ppm (I instar), 230. 99  ppm (II), 269. 65  ppm (III), 321. 75  ppm (IV), and 359. 71  ppm (pupa).

We described the {{synthesis of}} silver nanoparticles (AgNP) at room temperature using the aqueous extract of Chenopodium ambrosioides, and their high toxicity against the invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus. LC 50 calculated on young instars ranged from 13 ppm (first instar larvae) to 19 ppm (pupae). LC 50 calculated on adults was 14 ppm. The chemical composition of the C. ambrosioides extract was characterized by GC–MS analysis. The production of AgNP was confirmed by the surface Plasmon resonance band illustrated in UV–Vis, FTIR spectroscopy, EDX, XRD, TEM, and Zeta Potential analyses. In the field, a single treatment of AgNP (10 × LC 50) led to complete elimination of larval populations within 72 h. Sub-lethal doses of the reducing extract and AgNP magnify predation rates of Oryzias melastigma fishes against A. albopictus larvae.

40|$|<b>Nanopesticides</b> are novel plant {{protection}} products offering numerous benefits. As nanoparticles behave differently from dissolved chemicals, environmental risks of these materials could differ from conventional pesticides. Here we used soil-earthworm systems to compare the fate and uptake of analytical grade bifenthrin to that of bifenthrin in traditional and nano-encapsulated formulations. Apparent sorption coefficients for bifenthrin in the nano-treatments were up to 3. 8 times lower than in the non-nano treatments whereas dissipation half-lives of the nano-treatments were up to two time longer. Earthworms in the nano-treatments accumulated around 50 % more bifenthrin {{than those in the}} non-nano treatments. In the non-nano treatments, most of the accumulated material was found in the earthworm tissue while in the nano-treatments, the majority resided in the gut. Evaluation of toxicokinetic modelling approaches showed that models incorporating the release rate of bifenthrin from the nanocapsule and distribution within the earthworm provided the best estimations of uptake from the nanoformulations. Overall, our findings indicate that the risks of <b>nanopesticides</b> may be different from conventional formulations. The modelling presented here provides a starting point for assessing risks of these materials but needs to be further developed to better consider the behaviour of the nanoencapsulated pesticide within the gut system.

Agri-food themes focus on sustainability and protection of agriculturally produced foods, including crops for human consumption and animal feeding. Nanotechnology provides new agrochemical agents and new delivery mechanisms to improve crop productivity, and it promises to reduce pesticide use. Nanotechnology can boost agricultural production, and its applications include: 1) nanoformulations of agrochemicals for applying pesticides and fertilizers for crop improvement; 2) the application of nanosensors/nanobiosensors in crop protection for the identification of diseases and residues of agrochemicals; 3) nanodevices for the genetic manipulation of plants; 4) plant disease diagnostics; 5) animal health, animal breeding, poultry production; and 6) postharvest management. Precision farming techniques could be used to further improve crop yields but not damage soil and water, reduce nitrogen loss due to leaching and emissions, as well as enhance nutrients long-term incorporation by soil microorganisms. Nanotechnology uses include nanoparticle-mediated gene or DNA transfer in plants for the development of insect-resistant varieties, food processing and storage, nanofeed additives, and increased product shelf life.
