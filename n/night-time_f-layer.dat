40|$|Incoherent scatter radar {{observations}} of the <b>night-time</b> <b>F-layer</b> at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, are used to determine horizontal gradients in peak electron density and the F-layer height. At certain times of night, in both the summer and winter, the horizontal gradients in these parameters may be significant. The continuity equation for O+ is {{used to examine the}} sources and sinks of plasma {{at the peak of the}} <b>night-time</b> <b>F-layer.</b> In summer, before midnight, the F-layer is sufficiently elevated that chemical recombination at the peak is very slow. At these times we find that the local peak electron density may be significantly influenced by horizontal (predominantly eastward) advection or convergence of plasma. In winter, horizontal advection is usually less important than plasma convergence and chemical loss...|$|E

The data were collected from quarter-hourly ionograms of an Ionospheric Prediction Service (IPS) 42 -type vertical sounder. The main focus of this work was to study the seasonal changes in the F-layer height and to clarify the equinox transition process recently evidenced at Korhogo during 1995, the year of declining solar flux activity. The F-layer height was found to vary strongly with time, with up to three main phases. The night-to-night variability of these morphological phases was then analysed. The early post-sunset slow rise, commonly associated with rapid chemical recombination processes in the bottom part of the F layer, remained featureless and was observed regardless of the date. By contrast, the following event, either presented like the post-sunset height peak associated with the evening E × B drift, or was delayed to the midnight sector, thus involving another mechanism. The statistical analysis of the occurrence of these events throughout the solar minimum period 1995 – 1997 revealed two main F-layer height patterns, each characteristic of a specific season. The one with the post-sunset height peak was associated with the northern winter period, whereas the other, with the midnight height peak, characterized the northern summer period. The transition process from one pattern to the other took place during the equinox periods and was found to last only a few weeks. We discuss these results in the light of earlier works...|$|R
