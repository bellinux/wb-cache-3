40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to estimate phenotypic and genetic correlations between fertility and milk production traits. The following traits characterizing cow reproduction were studied: non-return rates till 56 and 72 days, age at first insemination, age at conception, calving interval, days open, days to first service, and service period. Data included reproductive traits of 42 283 first-parity Black-and-White cows. Days open and calving interval were calculated for 25 013 cows. The highest phenotypic correlation obtained between protein yield and days open amounted to 0. 22; non-return rates showed the lowest phenotypic correlations with yield traits. All genetic correlations between reproductive traits and yield traits were unfavourable. The largest were found between yield traits and days open and calving interval (0. 35 - 0. 48), and the smallest for age at first insemination and <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> until day 72 (less than 0. 1). Fat and protein content showed very small correlations with fertility traits; genetic correlations were also low except for non-return rates, which ranged from- 0. 55 (between fat content and <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> until day 56) to- 0. 24 (between protein content and <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> until day 72).

Sperm concentration needed for AI to obtain reasonable fertility, taking genetic value of bull and numerous others components into consideration is one of the essential constituents for successful AI breeding program. However, low sperm concentrations in AI-doses lead to reducing post-thaw viability. The reduction in viability of low sperm doses may be affected by fresh semen volume, sperm number and seminal plasma level at final dilution. Reduction in quality and fertility of low sperm doses is one of the limitations for their use in successful AI programme. Sperm number per AI required to achieve optimum fertility {{is one of the main}} crucial things to AI industry, and numerous efforts have been made in this regard. Due to great variability among bulls, sperm number per AI could be a limiting factor in achieving acceptable fertility values.

40|$|Reproductive {{performance}} {{is a critical}} trait in dairy cattle. Poor reproductive performance leads to prolonged calving intervals, higher culling rates and extra expenses related to multiple inseminations, veterinary treatments and replacements. Genetic gain for improved reproduction through traditional selection is often slow because of low heritability and negative correlations with production traits. Detection of DNA markers associated with improved reproductive performance through genome-wide association studies could lead to genetic gain that is more balanced between fertility and production. Norwegian Red cattle are well suited for such studies, as very large numbers of detailed reproduction records are available. We conducted a genome-wide association study for <b>non-return</b> <b>rate,</b> fertility treatments and retained placenta using almost 1 million records on these traits and 17 343 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Genotyping costs were minimized by genotyping the sires of the cows recorded and by using daughter averages as phenotypes. The genotyped sires were assigned to either a discovery or a validation population. Associations were only considered to be validated if they were significant in both groups. Strong associations were found and validated on chromosomes 1, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12. Several of these were highly supported by findings in other studies.

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were {{to improve the}} {{knowledge}} about the genetic background of health and reproduction traits in dairy cattle. This was accomplished by performing gene mapping studies of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting these traits and also by exploring the genetic variability for pathogen-specific mastitis. Ten sire families were used in a granddaughter design to map QTL. Several QTL were detected {{for most of the}} traits studied. Inclusion of cofactors in the analyses to adjust for QTL found on other chromosomes increased both the number of QTL detected and the significance levels. In total, 20 QTL were detected in analyses without cofactors whereas 41 QTL were detected when cofactors were used. Chromosome regions with several QTL were found, e. g. on chromosome 9 and 11 we observed QTL for both health and reproduction traits. A QTL for resistance to mastitis was found close to the same marker where a QTL for the fertility measure <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> was detected. The QTL affecting <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> was fine mapped to a small region on chromosome 9. Further research is required to evaluate whether this QTL could be used in breeding programs by marker assisted selection. Resistance to mastitis is a multifactorial trait that involves a variety of pathogens and physiological defense mechanisms. To dissect the trait into sub-traits of resistance to individual pathogens, bacteriological data on mastitis pathogens were analyzed. The most common pathogen in the data set was Staphylococcus aureus. Genetic variation in resistance to individual mastitis pathogens was found. Estimated heritabilities for the sub-traits were higher compared to heritabilities for general resistance to mastitis in most other studies. Haplotypes of a QTL previously shown to affect resistance to mastitis were analyzed for effects on resistance to pathogen specific mastitis.

The existence of subfertile sires with apparent normal semen quality is an important observation and has stimulated the search for other markers of fertility. Killian et al.

The same protein, detected in accessory sex gland fluid, was associated with fertility indexes of dairy bulls. Osteopontin was first described in mineralized bone tissues as a cell ad-hesion component and its functions include cell migra-tion, chemotaxis, calcification, tumor growth, and macrophage activation. This ubiquitous protein is ex-pressed in the ampullae, seminal vesicles and possibly the epididymis, {{as well as in the}} oviduct. In the seminif-erous tubules, where it is synthesized by Sertoli and germ cells, OPN is potentially involved in cell adhesion and migration.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} genetic parameters for fertility and production traits in the Brown Swiss population reared in the Alps (Bolzano-Bozen province, Italy). Fertility indicators were interval from parturition to first service, interval from first service to conception (iFC), and interval from parturition to conception, either expressed as days and as number of potential 21 -d estrus cycles (cPF, cFC, and cPC, respectively); number of inseminations to conception; conception rate at first service; and <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> at 56 d post-first service. Production traits were peak milk yield, lactation milk yield, lactation length, average lactation protein percentage, and average lactation fat percentage. Data included 71, 556 lactations (parities 1 to 9) from 29, 582 cows reared in 1, 835 herds. Animals calved from 1999 to 2007 and were progeny of 491 artificial insemination bulls. Gibbs sampling and Metropolis algorithms were implemented to obtain (co) variance components using both univariate and bivariate censored threshold and linear sire models. All of the analyses accounted for parity and year-month of calving as fixed effects, and herd, permanent environmental cow, additive genetic sire, and residual as random effects. Heritability estimates for fertility traits ranged from 0. 030 (iFC) to 0. 071 (cPC). Strong genetic correlations were estimated between interval from parturition to first service and cPF (0. 97), and interval from parturition to conception and cPC (0. 96). The estimate of heritability for cFC (0. 055) was approximately double compared with iFC (0. 030), suggesting that measuring the elapsed time between first service and conception in days or potential cycles is not equivalent; this was also confirmed by the genetic correlation between iFC and cFC, which was strong (0. 85), but more distant from unity than the other 2 pairs of fertility traits. Genetic correlations between number of inseminations to conception, conception rate at first service, <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> at 56 d post-first service, cPF, cFC, and cPC ranged from 0. 07 to 0. 82 as absolute value. Fertility was unfavorably correlated with production; estimates ranged from − 0. 26 (cPC with protein percentage) to 0. 76 (cPC with lactation length), confirming the genetic antagonism between reproductive efficiency and milk production. Although heritability for fertility is low, the contemporary inclusion of several reproductive traits in a merit index would help to improve performance of dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|Synchronization of oestrus {{has been}} used to {{increase}} reproductive effi ciency in most animals, including ewes. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the effect of the length of a progestagen treatment (12 d vs. 6 d) on synchronization effi ciency (oestrus response, time to onset of oestrus and duration of oestrus) and fertility rate using fl uorogestone acetate (FGA) progestagen sponge treatment with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) administration applied at different times of sponge removal. Ewes (n = 68) were divided into two groups; long term (LT, n = 33) and short term (ST, n = 35) groups treated with FGA progestagen sponges. At the end of intravaginal sponge treatment period the animals of each group were divided into the 3 subgroups in relation to time of PMSG (300 IU) treatment. PMSG treatment was applied 24 h before sponge removal, at sponge removal and 24 h after sponge removal for LT 1 and ST 1, LT 2 and ST 2, and LT 3 and ST 3, respectively. Each ewe was inseminated intra-cervically twice with skim cow milk-diluted semen (1000 × 106 motile cells/ml) 40 h and 60 h after sponge removal. <b>Non-return</b> <b>rates</b> (NRR- 30) were monitored from 12 day after sponge removal to 30 day with the aid of teaser rams.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to diagnose pregnancy 30 days following estrus synchronization and natural mating using transabdominal ultrasonography and to compare the traditional use of non return rates of estrus with pregnancy diagnosis by day 30 using transabdominal ultrasonography in “Red Sokoto goats” of Nigeria. Forty nine (n= 49) Red Sokoto does were treated with fluorogestone acetate sponges (FGA- 30) for 15 days. At the end of progestagen treatment, does received i. m 200 IU equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) concurrent with progestagen removal. Does were mated naturally using proven sexually active bucks in the ratio 1 buck to 10 does. Measurement of <b>non-return</b> <b>rates</b> of estrus was evaluated 21 to 30 days following estrus and natural mating. Pregnancy rate was determined on day 30 following estrus and natural mating using a real time B-mode ultrasound scanner equipped with a 3. 5 MHz probe. Non return rate of estrus (conception) was compared with pregnancy rate using ultrasonography. Conception rate by measurement of non return rate of estrus by day 30 was 87. 7 % (43 / 49). An 85. 7 % (42 / 49) pregnancy rate was obtained at day 30 of gestation using ultrasonography. Conceptus in pregnancy fluid was visible in 100 % cases between 30 and 35 days of gestation.   From the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report of pregnancy diagnosis using ultrasonography in Red Sokoto goats of Nigeria.   <br /...|$|R
40|$|International {{experience}} has been that cervical insemination of sheep with frozen-thawed semen usually yields unacceptably low pregnancy rates (10 to 30 %). An exceptional case has been Norway where <b>non-return</b> <b>rates</b> in on-farm usage are around 60 %. The objective of the work described in this report was to develop an AI procedure for Irish conditions, based initially on Norwegian protocols, using semen from individual rams. Such a procedure would greatly facilitate and enhance genetic improvement programmes for sheep. The work undertaken had two separate aspects:- (i) studies on semen, including processing and freezing methods, laboratory evaluation of semen quality post thawing {{and the relationship of}} in vitro evaluation to fertilisation rate in vivo (ii) studies on pregnancy rate following AI in relation to issues such as ram breed effects, effects of synchronisation, operator differences and the role of ewe breed inducing the timing of ovulation and various physical and physiological assessments of the cervix at AI. The main results in relation to semen studies were that, while a range of differential staining procedures could be used to objectively evaluate semen with respect to proportion of live speramatozoa and the integrity of sperm cells after thawing, these results were not useful as indicators of fertilisation capacity in vivo. The in vitro fertilisation (IVF) of sheep oocytes recovered from abattoir material gave promising results as a method for evaluating the fertilisation capacity of frozen-thawed semen. The technique requires further validation. End of Project ReportDepartment of Agriculture, Food and the Marin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – A whole genome scan {{was carried}} out to detect {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) for fertility traits in Finnish Ayrshire cattle. The mapping population consisted of 12 bulls and 493 sons. Estimated breeding values for days open, fertility treatments, maternal calf mor-tality and paternal <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> were used as phenotypic data. In a granddaughter design, 171 markers were typed on all 29 bovine autosomes. Associations between markers and traits were analysed by multiple marker regression. Multi-trait analyses were carried out with a vari-ance component based approach for the chromosomes and trait combinations, which were ob-served significant in the regression method. Twenty-two chromosome-wise significant QTL were detected. Several of the detected QTL areas were overlapping with milk production QTL previously identified in the same population. Multi-trait QTL analyses were carried out to test if these effects were due to a pleiotropic QTL affecting fertility and milk yield traits or to linked QTL causing the effects. This distinction could only be made with confidence on BTA 1 where a QTL affecting milk yield is linked to a pleiotropic QTL affecting days open and fertility treat-ments.

40|$|A genome wide scan was {{performed}} on a total of 2093 Italian Holstein proven bulls genotyped with 50 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), {{with the objective of}} identifying loci associated with fertility related traits and to test their effects on milk production traits. The analysis was carried out using estimated breeding values for the aggregate fertility index and for each trait contributing to the index: angularity, calving interval, <b>non-return</b> <b>rate</b> at 56 days, days to first service, and 305 day first parity lactation. In addition, two production traits not included in the aggregate fertility index were analysed: fat yield and protein yield. Analyses were carried out using all SNPs treated separately, further the most significant marker on BTA 14 associated to milk quality located in the DGAT 1 region was treated as fixed effect. Genome wide association analysis identified 61 significant SNPs and 75 significant marker-trait associations. Eight additional SNP associations were detected when SNP located near DGAT 1 was included as a fixed effect. As there were no obvious common SNPs between the traits analyzed independently in this study, a network analysis was carried out to identify unforeseen relationships that may link production and fertility trait...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effect of}} {{different}} thawing procedures for ram semen frozen in minitubes and mini straws on the fertility of sheep was {{tested in a}} field trial. Methods Altogether, 719 Norwegian Crossbred ewes, aged between six months and six-and-a-half years from 8 farms, were inseminated vaginally in natural oestrus with frozen-thawed semen. Minitubes were thawed at 70 °C for 8 sec (T 70) and mini straws either at 50 °C for 9 sec (S 50) or at 35 °C for 12 sec (S 35). Results Vaginal insemination with 200 × 10 6 spermatozoa resulted in 25 -days <b>non-return</b> <b>rates</b> of 63. 2, 59. 6, and 62. 5 % (overall 61. 8 %), respectively, and lambing rates of 56. 8, 55. 0, and 59. 2 % (overall 57. 0 %), respectively. No significant effect on fertility (as 25 -days non-return- or lambing rate) was seen for straw type/thawing temperature (P = 0. 5 / 0. 5), but semen filled in mini straws and thawed at 35 °C resulted numerically in the highest lambing rate (59. 2 %). A significant effect was, however, seen for farmer (P = > 0. 0001 /> 0. 0001) and ram (P = 0. 009 / 0. 002). Moreover, age of the ewes {{had a significant effect}} on the NR rate (0. 007), but not on lambing rate (P = 0. 2). Conclusion A vaginal deposition of frozen ram semen containing approximately 200 × 10 6 spermatozoa, filled in mini straws and thawed at 35 °C is a simplified technique that under field conditions and used on a do-it-yourself regime gives acceptable lambing rates in Norway. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{positive}} correlation {{has been found}} between oxygen consumption (ZO 2) in bull spermatozoa and <b>non-return</b> <b>rates</b> and concluded that an increase in ZO 2, characteristic of the freeze/thaw process, was possibly associated with mitochondrial membrane damage during this procedure: alternatively, sperm may be hyperactivated through the capacitation-like effects of freezing/thawing. We speculated that the morphology of spermatozoa {{may be associated with}} their rate of ZO 2 and fertility: for example, sperm mid-piece length where mitochondria are located. Such a relationship has not been investigated before, particularly in context of commercial cattle breeding programmes and bull fertility characteristics. Sperm biometry was performed on ejaculates obtained from 34 bulls representing six breeds: Holstein (yearlings and mature), Friesian, Belgian Blue, Aberdeen Angus, Charolais and Limousin. Five ejaculates were collected from every bull and from each sample a semen smear was fixed and stained with eosin/nigrosin: the mid-piece length of 40 sperm with normal morphology was measured in every sample. Data were analysed by breed, age and within each bull. Significant differences (p< 0. 01) between ejaculates in 9 / 34 bulls was found, as well as differences (p< 0. 001) between individual bulls within the same breed. The average mid-piece length for Aberdeen Angus was 13. 35 microm, for Belgian Blues and Limousin around 13. 8 microm and for Charolais 13. 68 microm: for dairy breeds such as Holstein and Friesian it was about 13. 4 microm. The mean value of mid-piece length for breed was compared with their 49 day non-return rate; a negative correlation (r = - 0. 53) was found in black and white dairy breeds...|$|R
40|$|A genetic {{analysis}} of some reproductive traits {{was made on}} the female progeny of artificial insemination (A. I.) sires of the Belgian Blue cattle breed. As the sires were used in commercial herds, the progenies are of two biological types: beefy (double-muscled) and conventional. The traits considered were body measurements (chest girth and height at withers) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years of age, percent culled for infertility, <b>non-return</b> <b>rates</b> (proportion of calvings resulting from one single insemination) after the first insemination, number of inseminations per gestation, ages at first and second calving, calving interval and milk yield score. For these traits, {{the differences between the}} two biological types were estimated. From the comparison of the two biological types for production and reproductive traits, it is shown that the beneficial effects of the beefy condition to the carcass composition and to the commercial value represent several phenotypic standard deviations, while the detrimental effects on the fertility traits are only a fraction of the phenotypic standard deviations of these traits. The estimates of the coefficients of heritability were chest girth (1 year= 0. 04, 2 years= 0. 11, 3 years= 0. 13, 4 years= 0. 18); height at withers (1 year= 0. 07, 2 years= 0. 12, 3 years= 0. 24, 4 years= 0. 21); age at first calving= 0. 03; age at second calving= 0. 04; calving interval= 0. 03; milk yield score (first lactation= 0. 08, second lactation= 0. 10). The genetic correlations between successive measurements were large and positive, but the genetic correlations between the ages at calving on the one hand and body measurements and milk yield score on the other hand were systematically negative and thus favourable. © 1989.
