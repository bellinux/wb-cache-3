40|$|This paper {{analyses}} development mechanism {{through which}} <b>natural</b> resource <b>capital</b> regenerates {{and contributes to}} economic growth. Climate change challenges economic development in the 21 st century but it also provides opportunity to grow with developing green. New development strategy is the inclusive green growth that leads towards sustainable development. Regeneration of natural resource is a crucial productive capital in the economy. This paper suggests a theoretical model and explains sustainable development mechanism through productive consumption. Empirical observations also support this model. This paper suggests policy inputs regarding regeneration of <b>natural</b> resource <b>capital</b> and its preservation in term of water shed development, flood control or development of ecosystem services through creation {{of jobs in the}} channel of productive consumption. Policy makers should focus on employability, regeneration and preservation of <b>natural</b> resource <b>capital</b> for sustaining livelihoods in the economy. ...|$|R

25|$|The 1973 {{publication}} of , {{a collection of}} essays, finished {{in the house of}} his friend Leopold Kohr, brought his ideas to a wider audience. One of his main arguments in Small is Beautiful is that we cannot consider the problem of technological production solved if it requires that we recklessly erode our finite <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> and deprive future generations of its benefits. Schumacher's work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism, and he became a hero to many in the environmental movement and community movement.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem of}} <b>natural</b> and social <b>capital</b> {{deterioration}} lies in their partial irreversibility. The loss of biodiversity, for example, is often definitive. The {{same can be}} true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates. Moreover, the depletion of <b>natural</b> and social <b>capital</b> may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of <b>natural</b> and social <b>capital</b> may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients {{for a long time}} while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.|$|R

25|$|Ecological {{economics}} generally {{rejects the}} view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity - or <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> and individual capital, in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of uneconomic growth and quality of life. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge {{that much of what}} is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.|$|E
25|$|Some {{ecological}} economists prioritise adding <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> to {{the typical}} capital asset analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} value of <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> and ecosystem services is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as {{especially important in}} ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms. Ecological economist Robert Costanza led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in Nature, the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global GDP was $27 trillion). Half of the value went to nutrient cycling. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in Ecological Economics Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|A {{large and}} still {{growing number of}} {{attempts}} to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as GDP.

Parallel to these initiatives, political interest in producing a green GDP that would take at least the cost of pollution and <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> depletion into account has grown, even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and statistical services arising mostly from a concern about conceptual and technical challenges.|$|E

25|$|After the Revolutions of 1848, the {{apparent}} {{leader of the}} Italian unification movement was Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, renowned for his extremely loyal followers. Garibaldi led the Italian republican drive for unification in Southern Italy, but the Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Sardinia, a state with an important Italian population, whose government was led by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. Though the Kingdom had no physical connection to Rome (seen by all as the <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> of Italy, but still capital of the Papal States), the Kingdom had successfully challenged Austria in the Second Italian War of Independence, liberating Lombardy-Venetia from Austrian rule. The Kingdom also had established important alliances which helped it improve the possibility of Italian unification, such as with the United Kingdom and France in the Crimean War. Sardinia was dependent on French protection and in 1860 Sardinia was forced to cede territory to France to maintain relations, including Garibaldi's birthplace, Nizza.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} some {{suggestions}} concerning the usage of <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> to further aid New Orleans’s economy. One such is that, as opposed to rebuilding on flooded lands, restoring acres of wetlands {{to profit from the}} economic wealth. The Mississippi delta provides the United States with one of the largest fisheries and the most important flyway terminus, enabling New Orleans to profit from these ecological industries. Furthermore, by increasing the wetlands, it would help create a natural barrier that could aid New Orleans in future storms. It is estimated that if New Orleans were to restore [...] of wetland lost before 2005, the <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> would be worth an estimated $6 billion/year, or $200 billion at the present value. While New Orleans has made numerous efforts in rebuilding their economy, and has been successful with tourist-attracting events such as Mardi Gras, the <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> provided could further assist the city in returning to its pre-Katrina wealth and economy.|$|E

40|$|While an {{increasing}} number of large food companies commit themselves to source only certified cocoa, research on the impacts of certification on cocoa farmers is falling behind. We investigate how Rainforest Alliance (RA) certification of smallscale cocoa farmers in Ghana has affected both the financial and the <b>natural</b> <b>capitals</b> of the farmers. Across two villages, certified farmers were compared to conventional farmers, using both qualitative and quantitative data collected through farmer and key informant interviews and participatory rural appraisals. A combination of the Sustainable Livelihood Framework and the input–output–outcome–impact framework was used for the analysis. Results indicate that the RA certification scheme has a positive influence on the certified farmers in terms of cocoa production, yield, income, and farmers’ perception of changes in their <b>natural</b> and financial <b>capitals.</b> The positive influence is a result of inputs from the RA certification, including financial support, information and knowledge, technical assistance, and increased access to farm inputs and credit. However, these positive impacts are conditioned by the presence of active farmer organizations and access to agricultural inputs and credit through associations and government institutions, and may be undermined by certified farmers who sell their produce outside the premium value chain.

500|$|Biodiversity (an {{abbreviation}} of [...] "biological diversity") {{describes the}} diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, {{and there are many}} ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization. Biodiversity includes species diversity, ecosystem diversity, and genetic diversity and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels. Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem services which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life. Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity. <b>Natural</b> <b>capital</b> that supports populations is critical for maintaining ecosystem services and species migration (e.g., riverine fish runs and avian insect control) has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service losses are experienced. An understanding of biodiversity has practical applications for species and ecosystem-level conservation planners as they make management recommendations to consulting firms, governments, and industry.|$|E
500|$|The Jevons paradox {{indicates}} that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that sustainable energy policy {{must rely on}} other types of government interventions. As the Jevons paradox applies only to technological improvements that increase fuel efficiency, the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase costs do not display the paradox {{and can be used}} to control the rebound effect. To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g. green taxes, cap and trade, or higher emissions standards). The ecological economists Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be [...] "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in <b>natural</b> <b>capital</b> rehabilitation."
