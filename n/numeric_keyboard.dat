25|$|<b>Numeric</b> <b>keyboards</b> contain only numbers, {{mathematical}} symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, {{and several}} function keys. They {{are often used}} to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards {{that do not have}} a numeric keypad, commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, numbers, arrow keys, Navigation keys, Num Lock and Enter key.|$|R
30|$|It {{is assumed}} that a user (the victim) wears a smartwatch such as Apple Watch or Moto 360 Sport, while he/she types {{passwords}} and PINs. The smartwatch is equipped with accelerometer and gyroscope which collect the motion information of the victim’s wrist. If the victim uses one hand to type, the smartwatch is worn on the same hand. As smartwatches are widely used, {{it is not uncommon}} to make such assumption in daily life. We focus on two types of keyboards in this paper, including QWERTY <b>keyboards</b> and <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboards,</b> which can be used on PCs, mobile devices, Point of Sale (POS) terminals and Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} simple cast-as-intended remote e-voting {{protocol}} where the security {{is based on}} the use of secure (and trusted) smart cards that incorporate incard <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboards</b> and LCD displays, and can perform a limited number of cryptographic operations (like encryption, signing, and random number generation). The protocol, while very simple, is significantly more secure (in the sense of “cast-as-intended”) and convenient to use than the e-voting protocol currently used in Norway. The protocol is developed primarily with the idea of deploying it in Estonia within the next 3 to 10 years. Since in Estonia, a vast majority of the population already has ID-cards with digital signing and authentication functionality, and the use of ID-cards is a required prerequisite to participate in Estonian e-voting anyway, our assumption of every voter having a secure hardware token makes sense in this concrete context...|$|R

50|$|The Roland MC-4 MicroComposer was {{an early}} {{microprocessor-based}} music sequencer released by the Roland Corporation. It could be programmed using the ten key <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard</b> or a synthesizer keyboard using the keyboards control voltage and gate outputs. It was released in 1981 with a list price of US$3,295 (¥430,000 JPY) and was the successor to the MC-8, which in 1977 was the first microprocessor-based digital sequencer. Like its predecessor, the MC-4 is a polyphonic CV/Gate sequencer.|$|E
50|$|Since the hand-pulled {{magnetic}} cards (HP-75 compatible) could only store two tracks of 650 bytes each, the card reader (installed under the logo plate above the <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard)</b> {{was not a}} very popular option. Larger storage capacities could be accommodated through HP-IL peripherals such as the 82161A cassette drive or 9114A diskette drive that were also battery-powered and portable, if rather bulky compared to the 71B. Subsequently, memory expansion modules to fit the card reader compartment became available from third-party vendors.|$|E
50|$|Most 2010s-era flat-panel {{displays}} use LCD and/or LED technologies. Most LCD screens are back-lit to {{make them}} easier to read or view in bright environments. Flat-panel displays are thin and lightweight and provide better linearity and {{they are capable of}} higher resolution than typical consumer-grade TVs from earlier eras. The highest resolution for consumer-grade CRT TVs was 1080i; in contrast, many flat-panels can display 1080p or even 4K resolution. As of 2016, some devices that use flat-panels, such as tablet computers, smartphones and, less commonly, laptops, use touchscreens, a feature that enables users to select onscreen icons or trigger actions (e.g., playing a digital video) by touching the screen. Many touchscreen-enabled devices can display a virtual QWERTY or <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard</b> on the screen, to enable the user to type words or numbers.|$|E
50|$|On IBM {{compatible}} personal computers, many characters {{not directly}} {{associated with a}} key can be entered using the Alt Numpad input method or Alt code: pressing and holding the Alt key while typing the number identifying the character with the <b>keyboard's</b> <b>numeric</b> keypad. Similar or extended forms of this feature are also available in many operating systems, including DOS and Microsoft Windows.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 3270 display {{terminal}} subsystem consisted of displays, printers and controllers.Optional features for the 3275 and 3277 were the selector-pen or light pen, ASCII rather than EBCDIC character set, an audible alarm, and a keylock for the <b>keyboard.</b> A <b>keyboard</b> <b>numeric</b> lock was available and would lock the keyboard if the operator attempted to enter non-numeric data {{into a field}} defined as numeric. Later an Operator Identification Card Reader was added which could read information encoded on a magnetic stripe card.|$|R
25|$|Astronauts {{communicated with}} the AGC using a <b>numeric</b> display and <b>keyboard</b> called the DSKY (DiSplay, {{pronounced}} 'DISS-key').

50|$|A {{keyboard}} is {{an arrangement}} of buttons that each correspond to a function, letter, or number. They are the primary devices used for inputting text. In most cases, they contain an array of keys specifically organized with the corresponding letters, numbers, and functions printed or engraved on the button. They are generally designed around an operators language, and many different versions for different languages exist. In English, the most common layout is the QWERTY layout, which was originally used in typewriters. They have evolved over time, and have been modified for use in computers {{with the addition of}} function keys, number keys, arrow keys, and keys specific to an operating system. Often, specific functions can be achieved by pressing multiple keys at once or in succession, such as inputting characters with accents or opening a task manager. Programs use keyboard shortcuts very differently and all use different keyboard shortcuts for different program specific operations, such as refreshing a web page in a web browser or selecting all text in a word processor. In addition to the alphabetic keys found on a typewriter, computer keyboards typically have a <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard</b> and a row of function keys and special keys, such as CNTRL, ALT, DEL and Esc.|$|E
5000|$|The small phone keypad and the rapidity {{of typical}} text message exchanges {{has caused a}} number {{spelling}} abbreviations: as in the phrase [...] "txt msg", [...] "u" [...] (an abbreviation for [...] "you"), [...] "HMU", or use of CamelCase, such as in [...] "ThisIsVeryLame". To avoid the even more limited message lengths allowed when using Cyrillic or Greek letters, speakers of languages written in those alphabets often use the Latin alphabet for their own language. In certain languages utilizing diacritic marks, such as Polish, SMS technology created an entire new variant of written language: characters normally written with diacritic marks (e.g., ą, ę, ś, ż in Polish) are now being written without them (as a, e, s, z) to enable using cell phones without Polish script or to save space in Unicode messages. Historically, this language developed out of shorthand used in bulletin board systems and later in Internet chat rooms, where users would abbreviate some words to allow a response to be typed more quickly, though {{the amount of time}} saved was often inconsequential. However, this became much more pronounced in SMS, where mobile phone users either have a <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard</b> (with older cellphones) or a small QWERTY keyboard (for 2010s-era smartphones), so more effort is required to type each character, and there is sometimes a limit on the number of characters that may be sent. In Mandarin Chinese, numbers that sound similar to words are used in place of those words. For example, the numbers 520 in Chinese (wǔ èr líng) sound like the words for [...] "I love you" [...] (wǒ ài nǐ). The sequence 748 (qī sì bā) sounds like the curse [...] "go to hell" [...] (qù sǐ ba).|$|E

The hypothesis of no differences in response times between the two modes of access could not be rejected...|$|E
30|$|As the {{conventional}} password/PIN authentication has been rigorously investigated, {{we focus on}} how to use machine learning techniques to process the sensor data of smartwatches and match users’ profiles. We collect the sensor data when users type passwords on QWERTY keyboards or type PINs on <b>numeric</b> keypads. QWERTY <b>keyboards</b> and <b>numeric</b> keypads are mainstream devices for inputting passwords and PINs nowadays, respectively. As long as a user types passwords or PINs with the hand wearing the smartwatch, the sensor data can be collected and then help authenticate the user. We extract unique features from the sensor data and train several machine learning classifiers using the features as user profiles. The classifiers are used to authenticate users.|$|R

40|$|Study I {{examined}} the effects of the computerised format of the ACER Advanced Test BL (ACER-BL) on the test scores and anxiety of undergraduate participants, compared with the traditional paper-and-pencil format. Forty-one students were assigned to either a computer or paper-and-pencil treatment group using a stratified random design. Participants sequentially completed a general background questionnaire, the ACER-BL, an anxiety questionnaire, the ACER-BL, and a final anxiety questionnaire, with a 10 minute test-retest period between the ACER-BL administrations. There {{were no significant differences in}} ACER-BL score, and subsection scores, between the 2 treatment groups on either administration. The internal consistency reliability of each formats was moderate to high, and there was a high test-retest reliability for each format. While the mean scores for each treatment group were higher for the second test administration compared with the first, this result only reached significance for the computerised group. Gender, Undergraduate Year, and Typing Ability significantly influenced test score, although these failed to remain significant when treatment group was included in each analysis. These results suggest that the computerised version of the ACER-BL is equivalent to the paper-and-pencil version. Generally, there was no significant difference in reported test anxiety measures between the treatment groups, with mean reported anxiety indicating "slight anxiety. " These anxiety results suggest little influence of test format on test anxiety. Study 2 {{examined the}} influence of input device (<b>keyboard,</b> <b>numeric</b> pad, and mouse) on ACER-BL scores and test anxiety of undergraduate participants. Using stratified random assignment, 90 subjects were tested on all three input devices using a one factor repeated measures design. Each participant sequentially completed a general background questionnaire, the ACER-BL, an anxiety questionnaire, the ACER-BL, an anxiety questionnaire, the ACER-BL, and a final anxiety questionnaire, with a 10 minute delay between each ACER-BL administration. There was no significant main effect of input device on test score, and there was no significant order effect for input device. Between- subjects analyses indicated a significant increase in mean test score across administrations for the <b>keyboard</b> and <b>numeric</b> pad, but no significant change in mean scores with the mouse. These results were also reflected in the analyses of mean input response time. While there was no significant effect of any measured participant characteristic on input device scores, mathematical ability and undergraduate year each had a significant influence on mean scores in the first ACER-BL administration. Participants with higher mathematical ability or more years at university had significantly higher mean test scores than participants with less mathematical ability or first year undergraduates respectively. While mean reported anxiety on all test anxiety measures decreased over the ACER-BL administrations, all mean reported anxiety indicated "slight anxiety. " These anxiety results suggest little influence of input device on test anxiety. The lack of test-retest comparisons between the computerised and paper-and-pencil formats of a test was discussed along with the need for future computerised testing research to use participants from the general population...|$|R

40|$|As mobile, {{handheld}} computing devices {{become more}} common and are used for an ever-increasing variety of tasks, new mechanisms for data entry must be investigated. Personal digital assistants often provide a small stylus-activated soft keyboard, as do some mobile phones that include touch screens.

In this study, 30 novices completed 6 realistic tasks using either a small, medium, or large soft keyboard. The results not only confirm that keyboard size does not affect data entry rates but that making the keyboard smaller does not increase error rates or negatively impact preference ratings.

The tasks required participants to press keys on the computer <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard,</b> with different spatial and temporal requirements, manipulated in order to modify their complexity. No significant differences were found in the interaction between the frequency of Kr and the complexity of the task, as well as between classical Kr frequencies controlled by the experimenter and frequencies close to the classical, self-controlled by the subjects.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{security}} analysis of an internet banking system used {{by one of}} the bigger banks in the Netherlands, in which customers use a USB-connected device – a smartcard reader with a display and <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard</b> – to authorise transactions with their bank card and PIN code. Such a set-up could provide a very strong defence against online attackers, notably Man-in-the-Browser attacks, where an attacker controls the browser and host PC. However, we show that the system we studied is seriously flawed: an attacker who controls an infected host PC can get the smartcard to sign transactions that the user does not explicitly approve, which is precisely what the device is meant to prevent. The flaw is not due to a simple implementation bug in one of the components (e. g. the device or the software components on the PC). It is a more fundamental design flaw, introduced in assigning responsibilities to the different components and designing the protocols between them. The system we studied, used by the Dutch bank ABN-AMRO, was developed by the Swedish company Todos AB. This company has since been acquired by Gemalto.

40|$|This project aims {{to improve}} {{performance}} of NASA missions by developing multimodal neuroelectric technologies for augmented human-system interaction. Neuroelectric technologies will add completely new modes of interaction that operate in parallel with keyboards, speech, or other manual controls, thereby increasing the bandwidth of human-system interaction. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of real-time electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition for a direct neuroelectric human-computer interface. We recorded EMG signals from an elastic sleeve with dry electrodes, while a human subject performed a range of discrete gestures. A machine-teaming algorithm was trained to recognize the EMG patterns associated with the gestures and map them to control signals. Successful applications now include piloting two Class 4 aircraft simulations (F- 15 and 757) and entering data with a "virtual" <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Current research focuses on on-line adaptation of EMG sensing and processing and recognition of continuous gestures. We are also extending this on-line pattern recognition methodology to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This {{will allow us to}} bypass muscle activity and draw control signals directly from the human brain. Our system can reliably detect P-rhythm (a periodic EEG signal from motor cortex in the 10 Hz range) with a lightweight headset containing saline-soaked sponge electrodes. The data show that EEG p-rhythm can be modulated by real and imaginary motions. Current research focuses on using biofeedback to train of human subjects to modulate EEG rhythms on demand, and to examine interactions of EEG-based control with EMG-based and manual control.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a security {{analysis of the}} online banking system {{of one of the}} most important banks of the Netherlands. New security devices have been designed in order to authorize transactions in a handy and userfriendly way. In doing so, it has been attempted to strengthen the online authentication system using hand-held smartcard readers connected by a USB-cable to a PC. These USB-connected smartcard readers are devices with a small display and <b>numeric</b> <b>keyboard</b> with two additional keys in order to accept or deny operations. The customers of Internet banking can perform any operation in a ”secure way ” with such devices. In this document we will discuss different USB-connected smartcard readers from several Dutch banks. For ABN-AMRO we will discuss the smartcard reader called the e. dentifier 2 made by Gemalto, which we will principally focus on it in more detail, and for ING the reader DigiPass 850, made by VASCO. We will focus on reverse engineering the ABN-AMRO’s readers. We will verify that last attack [1] on those devices is not working in the new version of the e. dentifier 2 and we will also reverse engineer some additional functionalities,which were not considered in earlier research about ABN-AMRO e. dentifier 2 reverse engineering [2], and currently do not seem to be used in ABN-AMRO’s internet banking website. These additional functionalities [6] could be used for authentications and transactions in Internet banking in the future. ivAcknowledgements To my family and best friends [...] .
