40|$|Abstract. In {{view of the}} {{teaching}} problems and difficulties of machinery manufacturing equipment design, the automatic generation technology of structural <b>net</b> <b>and</b> speed diagram was proposed. The conceptions and characteristics of structural formula, structural <b>net</b> <b>and</b> speed diagram were discussed. The expected targets of the automatic generation technology were put forward. The technical principles of automatically generating structural <b>net</b> <b>and</b> speed diagram were respectively analyzed. Based on these, the automatic generation software of structural <b>net</b> <b>and</b> speed diagram was designed and developed. The development environment and implementation methods of the software were proposed. It is proved that the software {{can play an important}} role in improving {{the teaching}} effect and quality...|$|R

5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as poultry {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in <b>nets</b> <b>and</b> then bred in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing <b>nets,</b> <b>and</b> direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for <b>nets</b> <b>and</b> other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} compares {{negative}} Ets transcription factor (<b>Net)</b> <b>and</b> hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF 1 α) regulation by hypoxia. Their protein stabilities are differently regulated by hypoxia, defining three periods in the kinetics: normoxia (high <b>Net</b> levels <b>and</b> low HIF 1 α levels), early hypoxia (high levels of <b>Net</b> <b>and</b> HIF 1 α), and late hypoxia (degradation of <b>Net</b> <b>and</b> HIF 1 α). Modulators of prolyl hydroxylase domain protein (PHD) activity induce a mobility shift of Net, similar to HIF 1 α, suggesting that post-translational modifications of both factors depend on PHD activity. The three PHDs have different {{roles in the}} regulation of Net protein levels; PHD 1 and PHD 3 {{are involved in the}} stabilization of Net, whereas PHD 2 controls its degradation in late hypoxia. Net physically interacts with PHD 2 in hypoxia, whereas PHD 1 and PHD 3 bind to <b>Net</b> in normoxia <b>and</b> hypoxia. Under the same conditions, PHD 2 and PHD 3 regulate both HIF 1 α stabilization in early hypoxia and its degradation at late hypoxia, whereas PHD 1 is involved in HIF 1 α degradation in late hypoxia. We describe interconnections between the regulation of both <b>Net</b> <b>and</b> HIF 1 α at the protein level. Evidence is provided for a direct physical interaction between <b>Net</b> <b>and</b> HIF 1 α and indirect transcriptional regulation loops that involve the PHDs.

5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the <b>nets</b> <b>and</b> lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of {{catching}} the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins {{get caught in the}} <b>nets</b> <b>and</b> exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{authority}} {{would have}} {{rested on the}} control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites.
