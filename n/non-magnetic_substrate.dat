40|$|The {{magnetic}} behaviour of ultrathin ferromagnetic films {{deposited on}} substrates is strongly {{affected by the}} properties of the substrate. We investigate the spin pumping rate, interlayer exchange coupling and dynamic exchange coupling between ultrathin ferromagnetic films through palladium, a <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrate</b> that displays strong Stoner enhancement. We find that the interlayer exchange coupling, both in the static and dynamic versions, is qualitatively affected by the substrate's Stoner enhancement. For instance, the oscillatory behavior that is a hallmark property of the RKKY exchange coupling is strongly suppressed by Stoner enhancement. Although the spin pumping rate of ferromagnetic films atop palladium is only mildly changed by Stoner enhancement the change is large enough to be detected experimentally. The qualitative aspects of our results for palladium are expected to remain valid for any <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrate</b> where Coulomb repulsion is large...|$|E

At the critical Ta concentration, the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is small and the magnetic phase space is dramatically broadened.

40|$|AbstractUniformity of superconducting layer {{can play}} {{important}} role in various applications of coated conductor tapes. For example a degradation of critical current density at the tape edges causes significant elevation of transport AC loss compared to the uniform tape with the same critical current.

For this purpose we investigated experimentally the distributions of magnetic field above the tape surface obtained by Hall probe mapping.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is presented {{for the study}} of the scattering of magnons at an extended symmetric atomic well in very thin magnetic films. The thin film consists of three cubic atomic planes with ordered spins coupled by Heisenberg exchange, and the system is supported on a <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrate,</b> and considered otherwise free from magnetic interactions. The coherent transmission and reflection scattering coefficients are derived as elements of a Landauer type scattering matrix. Transmission and reflection scattering cross sections are hence calculated specifically, as a function of the varying local magnetic exchange on the inhomogeneous boundary. Detailed numerical results for the individual incident film magnons, and for the calculated overall magnon conductance, show characteristic transmission properties, with associated Fano resonances, depending on the magnetic boundary conditions and on the magnon incidence.

40|$|The {{debate over}} {{the origin of the}} ultrafast {{demagnetization}} has been intensively active for the past 16 years. Several microscopic mechanisms have been proposed but none has managed so far to provide direct and incontrovertible evidences of their validity. In this context I have proposed an approach based on spin dependent electron superdiffusion as the driver of the ultrafast demagnetization. Excited electrons and holes in the ferromagnetic metal start diffusing after the absorption of the laser photons. Being the material ferromagnetic, the majority and minority spin channels occupy very different bands. It is then not surprising that transport properties are strongly spin dependent. In most of the ferromagnetic metals, majority spin excited electrons have better transport properties than minority ones. The effect is that majority carriers are more efficient in leaving the area irradiated by the laser, triggering a net spin transport. Recent experimental findings are revolutionising the field by being incompatible with previously proposed models and showing uncontrovertibly the sign of spin superdiffusion. We have shown that spin diffusing away from a layer undergoing ultrafast demagnetization can be used to create an ultrafast increase of magnetization in a neighboring magnetic layer. We have also shown that optical excitation is not a prerequisite for the ultrafast demagnetization and that excited electrons superdiffusing from a <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrate</b> can trigger the demagnetization. Finally we have shown {{that it is possible to}} control the time shape of the spin currents created and developed a technique to detect directly spin currents in a contact-less way.   The impact of these new discoveries goes beyond the solution of the mystery of ultrafast demagnetization. It shows how spin information can be, not only manipulated, as shown 16 years ago, but most importantly transferred at unprecedented speeds. This new discovery lays the basis for a full femtosecond spintronics...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, studies {{based on}} {{magnetization}} dynamics on atomic length scales are presented {{for a number}} of magnetic systems, where Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction is present. First-principle methods, based on density functional theory (DFT), have been used to study the pairwise magnetic interactions, such as Heisenberg exchange and DM interaction, which are the crucial parameters for the helimagnetic systems. The first part of this thesis concerns the theoretical background: basics of DFT, atomistic spin dynamics and magnetic skyrmions. The second part concerns the ground state and dynamical properties of helimagnets. Magnetic interaction parameters have been calculated for heterostructures, such as Co/Ni/Co on heavy metal non-magnetic substrates. These parameters are strongly dependent on the material of the substrate. Furthermore, the magnetization dynamics of domain wall and skyrmion are studied and our results show that motion is influenced by the spin-Hall effect (SHE) which arises from the <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrate.</b> Similar studies of magnetic interaction parameters have been made for several half-Heusler compounds MnZSn (Z=Tc, Ru, Rh, Os, Ir and Pt) and the phase diagram of the MnPt 0. 99 Ir 0. 01 Sn alloy proves the existence of skyrmions {{in a wide range of}} temperature and external magnetic field.   The manipulation of low-dimensional magnetic structures (skyrmions and solitons) with spin transfer torques have been investigated. The nucleation and annihilation processes of skyrmion, by the use of spin polarised current, are essential and the impact of different edges (antiferromagnetic, magnetically softer and stiffer) on both processes is studied. When the edge is magnetically softer, less current is required for skyrmion nucleation and annihilation. Furthermore, one-dimensional magnetic solitons are used to explore concepts of logical operations in a prototype majority gate device, since they are stable and can be easily created and manipulated by spin currents. Lastly, edge dislocations in FeGe helimagnet have been studied. These dislocations described in terms of thermally driven dynamics by the use of atomistic spin dynamics approach and possibly explain some unusual jumps of the spiral wavelength observed by time-dependent experiments...|$|E

The field-driven magnetization reversal of small Co clusters deposited on a Cu(111) surface has been studied by means of first-principles calculations and atomistic spin dynamics simulations. For applied fields ranging from 1 Tesla to 10 Tesla, we observe a coherent magnetization reversal with switching times {{in the range of}} several tenths of picoseconds to several nanoseconds, depending on the field strength. We find a non-monotonous dependence of the switching times with respect to the strength of the applied field, which we prove to have its origin in the complex magnetic anisotropy landscape of these low dimensional systems. This effect is shown to be stable for temperatures around 10 K, and is possible to realize over a range of exchange interactions and anisotropy landscapes. Possible experimental routes to achieve this unique switching behaviour are discussed. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Current {{longitudinal}} thin-film {{media in}} magnetic hard-disk drives are facing an oncoming limit {{caused by the}} superparamagnetic effect, {{in which the individual}} grains in the medium become so small that they are no longer stable against thermal fluctuation. This situation is undesirable as the stored information may be lost within an unexpectedly short time frame. There have been several proposed solutions in addressing the superparamagnetic limit, {{and one of them is}} perpendicular patterned media. In this approach, a periodic array of magnetic pillars is defined lithographically on a <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrate.</b> Binary data of " 1 " or " 0 " can be stored in each of these elements, which have two possible magnetization directions perpendicular to the plane of the medium. In our perpendicular patterned media design, Ni columns of 150 - 230 nm diameter with a 6 : 1 aspect ratio are embedded in an (AlGa) 2 O 3 /GaAs substrate. The fabrication procedure uses a combination of high resolution electron beam lithography, dry etching, and electroplating. The high aspect ratio in the column is achieved by taking advantage of the high etching rate and selectivity of AlGaAs/GaAs over (AlGa) 203 in the Cl 2 chemically assisted ion beam etching process. In addition to being a robust etching mask, the (AlGa) 2 O 3 layer also plays an important role in the chemical mechanical polishing procedure to remove the overplated Ni mushrooms. Once the Ni columns are fabricated, magnetic characterization is performed using magnetic force microscopy and scanning magnetoresistance microscopy. The former measurement confirms that the electroplated Ni columns are magnetic while the latter determines whether the individual columns are stable enough to retain the recorded information. We have successfully demonstrated recording in our 170 nm diameter Ni column array arranged in a square format using a commercial read/write head. This is the first demonstration of single magnetic column per bit data storage in a prototype perpendicular patterned medium. Furthermore, we have recorded in higher density Ni column arrays in the form of tracks, corresponding to 1. 3 and 2. 6 Gbits/in. 2. Even though we are limited by the spatial resolution of the magnetoresistive read sensor, we have continued to pursue higher density structures up to an areal density of 350 Gbits/in. 2. Consideration of the issues in high resolution patterning and the magnetic stability of the individual columns have prompted researchers in the magnetic recording industry to anticipate the ultimate storage limit of perpendicular patterned media to be around 1 Tbits/in. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} first-principles methods, based on density {{functional}} theory, {{have been used}} to characterize a wide range of magnetic materials. Special emphasis has been put on pairwise magnetic interactions, such as Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and also on in the Gilbert damping parameter. These parameters {{play a crucial role in}} determining the magnetization dynamics of the considered materials. Magnetic interaction parameters, has been calculated for several materials based on Co/Ni/Co heterostructures deposited on non-magnetic heavy metals where. The aim was to clarify how the composition of the underlayers affect the magnetic properties, in particular the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The DMI was found to be strongly dependent on the material of the underlayer, which is consistent with previous theoretical works. Such behaviour can be traced back to the change of the spin-orbit coupling with the material of the underlayer, as well as with the hybridization of the d- states of the magnetic system with the d- state of the <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrate.</b> First-principles calculations of the Gilbert damping parameter has been performed for several magnetic materials. Among them the full Heusler families, Co 2 FeZ, Co 2 MnZ with Z=(Al, Si, Ga, Ge). It was found that the first-principles methods, reproduce quite well the experimental trends, even though the obtained values are consistently smaller than the experimental measurements. A clear correlation between the Gilbert damping and the density of states at the Fermi energy was found, which is in agreement with previous works. In general as the density of states at the Fermi energy decreases, the damping decreases also. The parameters from first principles methods, have been used in conjunction with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, in order to study ultra-narrow domain walls. The domain wall motion of a monolayer of Fe on W(110) has been studied for a situation when the domain wall is driven via thermally generated spin waves from a thermal gradient. It was found that the ultra-narrow domain walls have an unexpected behaviour compared to wide domain walls in the continuum limit. This behaviour have been explained by the fact that for ultra-narrow domain walls the reflection of spin waves is not negligible. Furthermore, the dynamics of topologically protected structures, such as topological excitations in a kagome lattice and edge dislocations in FeGe has been studied. For the FeGe case, the description of the thermally driven dynamics of the edge dislocations, was found to be a possible explanation for the experimentally observed time dependence of the spiral wavelength. In the kagome lattice, it was also found that due to its topological properties, topological excitations can be created in it...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} pole tip recession (PTR) in laminated magnetic recording heads (also known as "sandwich heads"). These heads provide a platform for the utilisation of advanced soft magnetic thin films in practical recording heads suitable for high frequency helical scan tape recording systems. PTR results from a differential wear of the magnetic pole piece from the tape-bearing surface of the head. It results in a spacing loss of the playback or read signal of 54. 6 dB per recording wavelength separation of the poles from the tape. PTR depends on the material combination used in the head, on the tape type and the climate - temperature and relative humidity (r. h.). Five head materials were studied: two <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrate</b> materials- sintered multi granular CaTi 03 and composite CaTi 03 /ZrTi 04 /Ti 02 and three soft magnetic materials- amorphous CoNbZr, and nanocrystalline FeNbSiN and FeTaN. Single material dummy heads were constructed and their wear rates measured when cycling them in a Hi- 8 camcorder against commercially available metal particulate (MP) and metal evaporated (ME) tapes in three different climates: 25 °C/ 20 %r. h., 25 °C/ 80 %r. h. and 40 °C/ 80 %r. h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{was used to examine}} changes the head surface chemistry. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine changes in head and tape surface topography. PTR versus cycling time of laminated heads of CaTi 03 /ZrTiO 4 /Ti 02 and FeTaN construction was measured using AFM. The principal wear mechanism observed for all head materials was microabrasion caused by the mating body - the tape surface. The variation in wear rate with climate and tape type was due to a variation in severity in this mechanism, except for tape cycling at 40 °C in which gross damage was observed to be occurring to the head surface. Two subsidiary wear mechanisms were found: third body scratching (all materials) and grain pullout (both ceramics and FeNbSiN). No chemical wear was observed, though tribochemical reactions were observed on the metal head surfaces. PTR was found to be caused by two mechanisms - the first differential microabrasion of the metal and substrate materials and which was characterised by a low (~ 10 nm) equilibrium value. The second was by deep ploughing by third body debris particles, thought mainly to be grain pullout particles. This level of PTR caused by this mechanism was often more severe, and of a non-equilibrium nature. It was observed more for ME tape, especially at 40 °C/ 80 %r. h. and 25 °c/ 20 %r. h. Two other phenomena on the laminated head pole piece were observed and commented upon: staining and ripple texturing...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{molecular}} spintronics, the use of magnetic molecules for information technology is a main target and the observation of magnetic hysteresis on individual molecules organized on surfaces is a necessary step to develop molecular memory arrays. Although simple paramagnetic molecules can show surface-induced magnetic ordering and hysteresis when deposited on ferromagnetic surfaces, information storage {{at the molecular level}} requires molecules exhibiting an intrinsic remnant magnetization, like the so-called single-molecule magnets (SMMs). These have been intensively investigated for their rich quantum behaviour but no magnetic hysteresis has been so far reported for monolayers of SMMs on various <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrates,</b> most probably owing to the chemical instability of clusters on surfaces.

40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{an experimental}} investigation of magnetic behaviour of square-planar paramagnetic molecules (e. g. metallo-phthalocyanines and metallo-porphyrins) adsorbed on magnetic and <b>non-magnetic</b> <b>substrates.</b> Magnetic and electronic {{properties of the}} molecules are studied by means of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy, Low-Energy Electron Diffraction and synchrotron based X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism. The experimental results are complemented by Density Functional Theory calculations conducted by Kartick Tarafder, Mohammed Ali Ehesan and Peter Oppeneer from Uppsala University, Sweden. Main results of the thesis include studies on: Exchange coupling of chromium-tetraphenylporphyrin chloride (CrTPPCl) molecules to bare ferromagnetic Co(001) thin films. Adsorption of CrTPPCl species on the bare Co substrate leads to an induced magnetic moment on Cr ion. The magnetic moment is shown to couple antiferromagnetically with the substrate magnetization. Furthermore, CrTPPCl molecules adsorbed on the bare cobalt thin film change their oxidation state from 3 + to 2 + upon release of chlorine ligand from the Cr ion. Microscopic origin of the observed AFM coupling is described by a 90 ° indirect cation-anion-cation exchange coupling between less than half-filled 3 d shell of the Cr(II) ion, 2 p orbitals of molecular nitrogen and out-of-plane 3 d orbitals of cobalt atoms. Exchange interaction of manganese- and iron-tetraphenylporphyrin chloride (Mn- & FeTPPCl) molecules to nitrogen and chlorine terminated Co(001) thin films. Insulating spacer inserted between the paramagnetic molecules and the cobalt substrates is formed by an atomically thin layer of cobalt nitride or cobalt chloride, respectively. The layers are shown to alter molecule-substrate exchange coupling resulting in reduced electronic interaction of the ad-molecules with both substrates as evidenced by formation of self-assembled molecular 2 D arrays. Magnetic moments resolved on Mn and Fe ions of the molecules are observed to couple antiferromagnetically with N/Co substrates. Microscopic origin of the interaction is explained by an indirect 180 ° cation-anion-cation exchange coupling between 3 d orbitals of Mn(Fe) ions, 2 pz orbital of substrates’ nitrogen atoms and out-of-plane orbitals of cobalt atoms. The pre-adsorbed nitrogens possess sizeable magnetic moment on the 2 pz orbital which is induced due to the exchange interaction with the cobalt atoms. The magnetic moment of pre-adsorbed nitrogens is shown to couple ferromagnetically with that of cobalt. Adsorption of MnTPPCl molecules at chlorine terminated Co film has revealed an antiferromagnetic coupling between a relatively small magnetic moment induced on Mn ion and the substrate magnetization. Surprisingly, the XMCD signal measured at Fe L 3, 2 edges of FeTPPCl species adsorbed on Cl/Co substrate, resolves a subtle molecule-substrate coupling. Our magnetic measurements reveal ferromagnetic coupling between magnetic moment of Fe {{and that of the}} cobalt thin film. Analysis of XAS/XMCD spectra acquired at L 3, 2 and K edges of chlorine suggest that the exchange interaction between adsorbed molecules and the underlying substrate is mediated by 3 d-orbitals of the chlorine atoms pre-adsorbed at the surface, i. e. 180 degree indirect exchange coupling. Exchange coupling of manganese-tetraphenylporphyrin chloride (MnTPPCl) molecules to Co(001) substrates through a chromium spacer. Chromium spacer {{in the form of a}} wedge is shown to alter magnetic exchange coupling between MnTPPCl molecules and ferromagnetic cobalt substrates as a function of increasing thicknesses of chromium spacer. Magneto-chemical origin of the exchange coupling at the organic-inorganic interface is investigated by X-ray Photoelectron Emission Microscopy, i. e. spectro-microscopy correlation approach. At higher thicknesses of the chromium layer, the magnetic coupling between the molecules and the substrate is reduced due to the fact that induced spin waves decay exponentially with increasing distance. Long-range ferrimagnetic order in supramolecular 2 D Kondo lattice consisting of paramagnetic manganese-phthalocyanine (MnPc) and hexadeca-flourinated iron-phthalocyanine (FeFPc) molecules self-assembled into checkerboard array on Au(111) substrate. Magnetic moments of the molecules show magnetic remanence in absence of magnetic substrate or external magnetic field. Exchange coupling between the molecules, leading to a long-range ferrimagnetic order, is attributed to RKKY coupling mediated by the conduction electrons of the underlying gold substrate. Remanent molecular magnetic moments align in out-of-plane direction and reveal a notable contribution from orbital magnetic moment. Interestingly, the magnetic measurements performed for two different geometries (i. e. normal and grazing) suggest easy-plane anisotropy. Furthermore, the interaction of molecular magnetic moments with the substrate electronic states leads to a profound many body Kondo effect. Presented results demonstrate the ability to control magnetic properties of paramagnetic molecules by means of exchange coupling to magnetic or via non-magnetic surfaces. ...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedWhen a thin superconducting film (S film) is {{condensed}} onto a thin normal conducting film (N film), {{the first}} {{layers of the}} S film loose their superconductivity. This phenomenon is generally called the "superconducting proximity effect(SPE) ". As an investigation of SPE {{we focus on the}} transition temperature of extremely thin NS double layers in the thin regime. Normal metal is condensed on top of insulating Sb, then Pb is deposited on it in small steps. The transition temperature is plotted in an inverse Tc-reduction 1 /dTc= 1 /(Ts-Tc) versus Pb thickness graph. To compare our experimental results with the theoretical prediction, a numerical calculation of the SN double layer is performed by our group using the linear gap equation. As a result, there are large discrepancies between the experimental and theoretical results generally. The results of the NS double layers can be divided into three groups in terms of their discrepancies between experiment and theory. (1) Non-coupling(Tc= 0 K) :N= Mg, Ag, Cu, Au. There are large deviations between experiment and theory by a factor to the order of 2. 5. (2) Weak coupling (Tc is low(< 2. 5 K) :N=Cd, Zn, Al. Deviation is present, but only by a factor of 1. 5. (3) Intermediate coupling(Tc is around half of Pb's(4. 5 K)) : N=In, Sn. The experimental results agree with the theory.; Next, we examine the detection of the magnetic dead layer (MDL) of Ni thin films in terms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with several <b>non-magnetic</b> metal <b>substrates.</b> In our results, when Ni film is contact with a polyvalent metal substrate film, the sandwich film has around 2 to 3. 5 at. lay. of magnetic dead layers. However we have not observed the magnetic dead Ni layers with the alkali and noble metal substrate film.; Finally, we revisit the Pb/Ni system to measure the magnetic scattering of Ni with the method of Weak Localization (WL) to compare with the dephasing rate due to the Tc-reduction. In this series, we use only very thin Pb films between 1. 3 and 5 at. lay. deposited on top of the Ag substrate with about 37 at. lay. thickness, because we make the Ag substrate suppress the superconductivity of the extremely thin Pb film with the SPE and avoid the Azlamazov-Larkin fluctuations. After comparison, it becomes clear that the dephasing rate from the Tc-reduction method is much larger than that measured by the weak localization (the factor is around 120). We consider not only "pair breaking" but also "pair weakening", and conclude that the reduction of the superconducting transition temperature is not due to dephasing by magnetic scattering but due to the resonance scattering of Cooper pairs by non-magnetic d-states...|$|R
