This paper explains the divergent preferences on Basel III of <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> in three countries that approximate what are frequently presented as distinct varieties of capitalism in Europe — Germany, the United Kingdom and France. It is argued that <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> setting post crisis capital requirements had to reconcile three inter-related and potentially conflicting objectives: banking sector stability, the competitiveness of national banks and short to medium term economic growth. The different national preferences on Basel III reflected how different <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> defined and pursued these objectives, which in turn reflected the structure of national banking systems — specifically, systemic patterns of bank capital and bank-industry ties. ...|$|R

40|$|Coordination between <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> in EU {{agencies}} {{is based}} on a variety of mechanisms – such as mutual exchange and hierarchy – which the existing literature has extensively documented. However, it has paid less attention to explaining such variation. This article suggests that cultural theory can systematically integrate the observation of varied coordination mechanisms into one framework. More crucially, cultural theory also provides a coherent theoretical explanation for variation of coordination mechanisms by pointing to the importance of formal and informal social organization: the grid and group boundedness of <b>national</b> <b>regulators,</b> namely the constraints exercised on them by EU bodies and by the shared norms of their professional communities, can account for the emergence of different types of coordination across policy sectors. The article demonstrates this by presenting original empirical research on three cases, namely coordination between <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> in the EU agencies responsible for food and maritime safety, as well as banking regulation...|$|R
40|$|The Basel III Accord was the {{centerpiece}} of the international regulatory response to the global financial crisis, setting new capital requirements for internationally active banks. This paper explains the divergent preferences on Basel III of <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> in three countries that approximate what are frequently presented as distinct varieties of capitalism in Europe – Germany, the United Kingdom and France. It is argued that <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> faced a ‘trilemma’ in setting capital requirements, having to prioritize among banking sector stability, the competitiveness of national banks and short to medium term economic growth. Different varieties of national financial system – specifically, banking system and different kinds of ‘banking champions’ – explain the different prioritization of objectives in the ‘trilemma’ and hence for the divergent preferences of <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> on Basel III capital requirements.

40|$|Governmental {{authorities}} {{are known for}} zealously protecting their ‘turf’, which is usually seen to inhibit them from coordinating their work with rival authorities. In the EU, however, <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> often engage proactively in coordination with sister authorities in the forum of EU regulatory bodies. This is puzzling if one considers that this means that national authorities actively support EU bodies –potential rivals- in their work. The thesis hence examines what determines the coordinative behaviour of <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> at a transnational level in the European Union. It analyses the engagement of UK and German authorities in transnational coordination in the regulatory regimes of drug safety, maritime safety, food safety, and banking supervision. The study demonstrates that coordinative behaviour is driven by strategic considerations of <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> that want their coordination activities to add value to their own work, rather than being determined by their professional norms, functional pressures or the ‘shadow of hierarchy’, as stipulated in the EU governance literature. Their strategic assessments of whether they are getting something out of transnational activities are informed by the interpretative filters of the social relations they are embedded in at the domestic level. They are also fundamentally shaped by the institutional frameworks provided by the tasks of the EU regulatory bodies in which <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> come together. This explains variation of coordination patterns across policy areas and <b>national</b> <b>regulators,</b> which the EU governance literature has not accounted for. The argument of the thesis implies that the engagement with coordination {{can be linked to}} an enhancement –rather than a loss– of bureaucratic autonomy. By identifying the determinants of coordinative behaviour at a transnational level, this thesis hence also seeks to contribute {{to our understanding of the}} conditions in which transnational administration functions. This, in turn, is vital for understanding of how capacity to manage cross-border risks is created in the absence of a ‘European’ state...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{efficient}} resolution of global {{banks in the}} presence of <b>national</b> <b>regulators.</b> Single-point-of-entry (SPOE) resolution, where loss-absorbing capacity is shared across juris-dictions, is efficient but may not be implementable. First, when expected cross-jurisdiction transfers are too asymmetric, <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> will not agree to set up an efficient SPOE resolution regime ex ante. Second, when ex-post required transfers across jurisdictions are too large, <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> choose to ring-fence local banking assets, leading to a breakdown of a planned SPOE resolution. In this case, constrained efficient resolution is achieved through multiple-point-of-entry (MPOE) resolution, where some loss-absorbing capacity is assigned ex ante to national holding companies in each jurisdiction. Our analysis highlights a com-plementarity between bank resolution and the organizational structure of global banks—the more decentralized a global bank’s operations, the greater the relative efficiency of MPOE resolution. ∗Bolton is at Columbia University, NBER, and CEPR.

40|$|The {{international}} {{integration of}} regulated markets poses new challenges for regulatory policy. One {{question is the}} implications that the overall international regulatory regime will have for cross-border and/or domestic merger activity. In particular, do non-coordinated policies stimulate cross-border mergers that are overall inefficient, and is this then an argument for international coordination of such policies? The paper addresses this issue in a setting where firms must {{have access to a}} transportation network which is controlled by <b>national</b> <b>regulators.</b> The analysis reveals that while non-coordinated regulatory policies may induce cross-border mergers (by allowing the firms in question to play <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> out against each other), this can nevertheless be overall welfare enhancing compared to market outcomes under coordinated regulation.

40|$|States {{and their}} representatives, {{national}} governments, {{play a key}} role in national telecommunication markets. As lawmakers, they determine the playing field of the agents in the markets and the decision powers of <b>national</b> <b>regulators.</b> Simultaneously, they are involved in appointing presidential chambers of <b>national</b> <b>regulators.</b> On the other hand, governments keep shares in regulated companies and support single infrastructure projects based on financial and legal state aid measures. Therefore, European Union regulatory frameworks require a strict separation of tasks between national ministries. However, the European Commission has repeatedly criticized member states for in-transparency and insufficient separations of tasks in national implementation. While the Second Regulatory Package balanced competition and investment aims, the new Regulatory Package implemented in December 2009 dedicates a higher weight to the role of infrastructure quality as a driver of service innovations. Moreover, <b>national</b> <b>regulators</b> become more independent, and former national regulation tasks are partially shifted to the pan-European level. In consequence, the role of governments also changes. I discuss the transposition process of Regulatory Packages to national laws and how they have been implemented on the national level to learn more about how the new Regulatory Package will affect the national situation and the European integration process.

40|$|When <b>national</b> {{financial}} sector <b>regulators</b> need to mutually harmonize macroprudential policy decisions, imperfections of cross-border information exchange may undermine fair cooperation.
