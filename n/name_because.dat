5|$|Woods' and Nordegren's first child, a {{daughter}} named Sam Alexis Woods, {{was born in}} 2007. Woods chose the <b>name</b> <b>because</b> his own father had always called him Sam. Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} {{after the}} sales call, Andy steals Dwight's keys, breaks into his car, and finds the toll booth ticket to New York City. Andy gives {{the evidence to}} Michael, who then accuses Dwight of disloyalty, and Angela prevents him from clearing his <b>name</b> <b>because</b> it would expose their relationship. Dwight resigns. Andy gloats over his success, but the documentary camera catches Angela in the background glaring at him.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second <b>name</b> <b>because</b> she has no middle name.|$|E
50|$|The Egdon {{operating}} system was so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> {{one was going}} to UKAEA Winfrith: in Thomas Hardy's book The Return of the Native Winfrith Heath is called Egdon Heath. Their Fortran was called Egtran. Eldon was so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> Leeds University's computer was located in a converted Eldon chapel.|$|R
50|$|Angle Creek was so <b>named</b> <b>because</b> of its course.|$|R

5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this <b>name</b> <b>because</b> a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
5|$|An {{impressed}} tutor {{suggested he}} should become an actor and, on Pryce's behalf, {{applied to the}} Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for an application form; Pryce was awarded a scholarship to RADA. When he joined Equity he used Jonathan Pryce as his stage <b>name</b> <b>because</b> Equity will only have one actor with any particular name on its books. While at RADA Pryce worked as a door-to-door salesman of velvet paintings. Pryce {{was part of a}} 'new wave' of actors to emerge from the Academy. Others included Bruce Payne, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Kenneth Branagh and Fiona Shaw.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked {{their way into the}} {{interior}} of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamési) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this <b>name</b> <b>because</b> the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug.|$|E

5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its <b>name</b> <b>because</b> most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its <b>name</b> <b>because</b> normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Urnula craterium allows for both an {{imperfect}} (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given a different <b>name,</b> <b>because</b> {{the relationship between the}} perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect stage of Urnula craterium is the plant pathogenic species Conoplea globosa, known to cause a canker disease (Strumella canker) of oak and several other hardwoods.|$|E

5|$|This road got its <b>name</b> <b>because</b> it {{formerly}} {{served as}} a demarcation line which separated the civic area from the ethnic settlements of Singapore {{as part of the}} British colonial government's town planning, known as the Jackson Plan. Jackson's 1822 plan for the European Town composed of four parallel roads laid out in the northeast-southwestern direction, and a major intersecting road. This perpendicular road is the present-day Middle Road. Due to increasing Chinese immigrants settling near the European Town, the Europeans subsequently vacated the area to dwell more inland, away from the urbanising city quarters.|$|E
5|$|Beneath the GMCA are the ten councils of Greater Manchester's ten {{district}}s, {{which are}} Bolton, Bury, the City of Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, the City of Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. These district councils {{have the greatest}} powers over public services, and control matters such as council tax, education provision, social housing, libraries and healthcare. Eight of the ten metropolitan boroughs were named after the eight former county boroughs that now compose the largest centres of population and greater historical and political prominence. As an example, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport is centred on the town of Stockport, a former county borough, but includes other smaller settlements, such as Cheadle, Gatley, and Bramhall. The names {{of two of the}} metropolitan boroughs were given a neutral <b>name</b> <b>because,</b> at the time they were created, there was no agreement on the town to be put forward as the administrative centre and neither had a county borough. These boroughs are Tameside and Trafford, centred on Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford, respectively, and are named with reference to geographical and historical origins. The lowest formal tier of local government in Greater Manchester are the parish councils, which cover the various civil parishes in Greater Manchester, and have limited powers over upkeep, maintenance and small grants.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Morton {{returned}} to the band. Two years later, the band released its first full-length self-titled album, Burn the Priest, through Legion Records. Mikey Brosnan of Legion Records saved up $2,500 for the recording and then broke them in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania through DIY shows. The album was produced by Today Is the Day guitarist and vocalist Steve Austin. Spear left the band, leaving an open position for a guitarist. Adler's younger brother Willie became the band's second guitarist a year later, and a deal with Prosthetic Records was signed. Contrary to rumour, the band did not change their name to Lamb of God after being banned from venues; these bans occurred afterwards. They changed their <b>name</b> <b>because</b> of the altered line-up, and to avoid being mistaken for a satanic metal band.|$|E

5|$|Metallica {{began by}} playing shows in local clubs in Los Angeles. They {{recorded}} several demos to gain attention from club owners, and eventually relocated to San Francisco {{to secure the}} services of bassist Cliff Burton. The group's No Life 'til Leather demo (1982) was noticed by Megaforce label head Jon Zazula, who signed them and provided a small budget of $15,000 for recording. The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in Rochester, New York. It was originally intended to be titled Metal Up Your Ass, with cover art featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. The band was asked to change the <b>name</b> <b>because</b> distributors feared that releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success. Metallica promoted the album on the two-month co-headlining Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven in the U.S. Although the initial shipment was 15,000 copies in the U.S., the album sold 60,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} Metallica's Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{registered}} teams {{set a record}} of 180 teams representing 175 countries, however 10 of these did not arrive so the actual participation was 170 teams. The women's event was contested by 142 teams from 138 countries, leaving 38 teams from 37 countries participating in the open event only. Ten FIDE Member Federations did not have teams at the Olympiad. They include the triple champions (2006, 2008 and 2012) in the open event Armenia as well as Bhutan, Burundi, Cambodia, Comoros, Gabon, Laos, Nauru, Solomon Islands and East Timor. The Netherlands Antilles, albeit a non-existing entity since 2010, were allowed to field teams under this <b>name,</b> <b>because</b> the Curaçao Chess Federation remains officially registered as representing the dissolved country in the FIDE Directory. Eritrea, Kosovo, and South Sudan debuted at the Chess Olympiads. Countries that had teams in the women's event {{for the first time}} were: Djibouti, Guam, Guyana, Maldives, Sierra Leone and Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band <b>name,</b> <b>because</b> if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

5|$|Æthelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury {{prior to}} his {{becoming}} a bishop. Several historians opine {{that he might have}} been the same as the Æthelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. That Æthelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050, but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumièges becoming archbishop instead. The evidence is not merely that they shared the same <b>name,</b> <b>because</b> the name was a relatively common one in Anglo-Saxon England. Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes {{the fact that he was}} felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop's great age in 1076.|$|E
