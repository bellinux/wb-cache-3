However, Sweden would not allow the Norwegian ships to use their <b>neutral</b> <b>waters</b> for this, and Swedish ships steered the escapees towards waiting German warships. Of the 10, two made it through to the British, six were sunk by the Germans or scuttled by their crew, of which Skytteren was one, two turned back to Gothenburg. Skytteren was scuttled in the waters off Måseskär, Sweden. Her crew were taken as prisoners of war. The wreck of Skytteren remains in those waters, with her bow facing to the west.|$|E

Tegetthoff decided to break off the engagement and fled to the <b>neutral</b> <b>waters</b> around Heligoland. As Tegetthoff's ships began with withdraw, one of them scored a hit on Jyllands rudder, which prevented Suenson from being able to effectively pursue the retreating Austrians and Prussians. McClintock took Aurora between the two squadrons to deter Suenson from pursuing Tegetthoff in violation of British neutrality. The two Austrian frigates had suffered a total of 36 men killed and 108 deadof those 31 killed and 81 wounded aboard Schwarzenbergand both vessels were damaged. The Danish vessels suffered 14 men killed and 54 wounded, and only Niels Juel was damaged in the action. The battle was the last to be fought solely by wooden warships, and it was also the last major naval action to involve the Danish Navy.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 May, the two squadrons {{encountered}} each other off the island of Heligoland, then controlled by neutral Great Britain. Tegetthoff attacked with his two frigates while the slower Prussian vessels lagged behind, unable to effectively engage the Danish warships. Tegetthoff's flagship, Schwarzenberg, bore {{the brunt of the}} Danish gunfire and caught fire three times, the last of which could not be put out quickly and forced Tegetthoff to seek shelter in the <b>neutral</b> <b>waters</b> around Heligoland. Though Denmark claimed a tactical victory in the battle, the Danes were forced to end the blockade of the German coast. An armistice came into effect three days after the Battle of Heligoland.

On 28 March 1814, Porter {{determined}} to gain the open sea, fearing the arrival of British reinforcements. Upon rounding the point, Essex lost her main top-mast to foul weather, forcing her return to the harbour. The British, disregarding the neutrality of the harbour, proceeded with {{the attack on the}} crippled ship. For 2½ hours, Essex, armed almost entirely with powerful but short range guns called carronades, resisted the enemy's superior fighting power and longer gun range. A fire erupted twice aboard the Essex, at which point about 50 men abandoned the ship and swam for shore; only half of them landing. Eventually, the hopeless situation forced the frigate to surrender. The Essex suffered 58 killed, 97 wounded, while the British casualties were 5 dead, 10 wounded.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 May, Tegetthoff learned that a Danish {{squadron}} consisting of the steam frigates [...] and [...] and the corvette [...] were patrolling off the island of Heligoland. Tegetthoff took the five ships under his command out to attack the Danish vessels, resulting in the Battle of Heligoland. Basilisk and the other Prussian ships were too slow {{to keep pace with}} Schwarzenberg and Radetzky. After Schwarzenberg caught fire, Tegetthoff broke off the action and escaped to the <b>neutral</b> <b>waters</b> around Heligoland, where the ships remained until early the next day. During the period off Heligoland, the Prussian vessels sent their doctors to the Austrian frigates to help tend to their wounded. The next morning, the ships returned to Cuxhaven.

40|$|A {{re-analysis}} {{of water}} samples collected {{to determine the}} occurrence of lipophilic organochlorine chemicals, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in six tributaries to Lake Ontario in 1997 to 1998 has shown relatively high concentrations {{of some of those}} chemicals in extracts of chromic acid-digested water after the water had been extracted at neutral pH. For organochlorine chemicals and PCBs the effect was dramatic—for some tributaries the sums of concentrations of the chemicals in the acidic extracts over all sampling dates were larger than the sums of con-centrations of the chemicals in the (<b>neutral)</b> <b>water</b> plus suspended solids frac-tion that had been determined previously. In addition, some chemicals were found in the acidic extracts that were not found in the prior extracts of (<b>neutral)</b> <b>water</b> plus suspended solids. Although some individual PAHs were found at relatively high concentrations in the acidic extracts compared to extracts of (<b>neutral)</b> <b>water</b> plus suspended solids, in general the phenomenon was not sig-nificant for total PAHs. The implication of our finding is that conventional dichloromethane extraction of <b>neutral</b> (filtered) <b>water</b> and the suspended solids phases can significantly underestimate the concentrations of some lipophilic chemicals such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and PCBs in fresh water, leading to an underestimation of their loadings to aquatic ecosystems.
