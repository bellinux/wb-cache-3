50|$|The {{companys}} contract, {{charter and}} tourism fleet of turbine aircraft {{were being used}} predominantly on <b>non-revenue</b> <b>flights</b> between recruiting venues to bolster local school locations and make it appear that they had more aircraft. This also meant that the company did not have jobs available for its graduates. Throughout 2007 the company started selling off aircraft from its training fleet to raise capital to increase recruiting, which further slowed down training. Orders for simulators were cancelled and aircraft ready for delivery from Robinson Helicopter were not picked up.|$|R
50|$|Flight testing—typically as a {{class of}} <b>non-revenue</b> {{producing}} <b>flight,</b> although SpaceX has also done extensive flight tests on the post-mission phase of a returning booster flight on revenue launches—can {{be subject to the}} latter's statistically demonstrated higher risk of accidents or serious incidents. This is mainly due to the unknowns of a new aircraft or launch vehicle's handling characteristics and lack of established operating procedures, and can be exacerbated if test pilot training or experience of the flight crew is lacking For this reason, flight testing is carefully planned in three phases: preparation; execution; and analysis and reporting.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 December 2012 at 16:35 {{local time}} (12:35 GMT), Red Wings Flight 9268, a Tupolev Tu-204-100В (RA-64047, c/n 1450743164047, s/n 047, built 2008) crashed on landing after {{overrunning}} runway 19 at Moscow Vnukovo International Airport (VKO) following a <b>non-revenue</b> repositioning <b>flight</b> originating from Pardubice Airport, Czech Republic. The aircraft broke up {{and came to}} a stop on elevated highway M3 about 400 m past the runway's end. There were eight crew members on board of whom five were killed and the other three seriously injured. Apart from those, one man driving his car on M3 highway was seriously injured when the detached Tu-204's nosewheel crashed into side of the car; the driver behind him recorded the impact on camera. The fatal Vnukovo accident was the second runway overrun incident involving a Red Wings operated Tu-204-100B in nine days following a Moscow Vnukovo to Novosibirsk flight on 20 December 2012 that overran runway 25 at Tolmachevo Airport by 1,150 ft into an open field. Flight data recorder readouts indicate that brake failure as well as engine thrust reverser issues were major contributing causes in both overruns resulting in the issuance of additional airworthiness directives.|$|R

The aircraft broke up {{and came to}} a stop on elevated highway M3 about 400 meters/1,200 feet past the runway’s end. There were eight crew members on board of whom five were killed and the other three seriously injured. The fatal Vnukovo accident was the second runway overrun incident involving a Red Wings operated TU-204-100B in nine days following a Moscow Vnukovo to Novosibirsk flight on 20 December 2012 that overran runway 25 at Tolmachevo Airport by 1,150 feet (350 meters) into an open field. Initial flight data recorder readouts indicate that brake failure as well as engine thrust reverser issues were major contributing causes in both overruns resulting in the issuance of additional airworthiness directives. Russia’s Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) later determined that, as in the precursor non-fatal overrun incident in Novosibirsk, the fatal Moscow accident was caused by a failure of the compression switches in two of the three landing gear assemblies to close on touchdown thus causing the engine thrust reverser shells to fail to deploy.|$|R
