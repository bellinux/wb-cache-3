5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is <b>negatively</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E

Its necessitate that the R & D expenditures must be accounted in the comprehensive income statement, and none of the intangible assets are considered from the R & D research phases must be accounted as an asset in the statement of financial position. For the data collection, the total samples size contains of 105 firms with 525 observations, from the audited financial statements of the public listed companies at Colombo Stock Exchange, which are engaged with the R & D activities over the period of last five financial years between 2010 / 2011 and 2014 / 2015. Those samples are adopted with the random and stratified sampling techniques as well as the multivariate quantitative technique is selected as the research technique to measure the financial performance of the firm by using the selected accounting based indicators.

Patches of remnant habitat occupied by barrens dagger moths are typically larger than 2,000 acres (1,000 ha). In models based on surveys of rare moths in a pitch pine-bear oak community in southeastern Massachusetts, barrens dagger moth was positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> landscapes {{with a high}} percentage of open-canopy oak scrub [...] and <b>negatively</b> <b>associated</b> (P=0.03) <b>with</b> mixed hardwood-conifer forest without pitch pine at the 1,120-acre (450 ha) scale.

40|$|NFκB is an {{inducible}} transcriptional factor {{controlled by}} two principal signaling cascades and plays pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes including inflammation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, immunity, and development. Activation of NFκB signaling was detected in skin of SHAPRIN-deficient mice {{and can be}} diminished by an NFκB inhibitor. However, in vitro studies demonstrated that SHARPIN activates NFκB signaling by forming a linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex with RNF 31 (HOIP) and RBCK 1 (HOIL 1). The inconsistency between in vivo and in vitro findings about SHARPIN's function on NFκB activation could be partially due to SHARPIN's potential interactions with downstream molecules of NFκB pathway. In this study, 17 anti-flag immunoprecipitated proteins, including TRAF 2, were identified by mass spectrum analysis among Sharpin-Flag transfected mouse fibroblasts, B lymphocytes, and BALB/c LN stroma 12 cells suggesting their interaction with SHARPIN. Interaction between SHARPIN and TRAF 2 confirmed previous yeast two hybridization reports that SHARPIN was one TRAF 2 's partners. Furthermore, luciferase-based NFκB reporter assays demonstrated that SHARPIN <b>negatively</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> NFκB activation, which can be partly compensated by over-expression of TRAF 2. These data suggested that other than activating NFκB signaling by forming ubiquitin ligase complex with RNF 31 and RBCK 1, SHARPIN may also <b>negatively</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> NFκB activation via interactions with other NFκB members, such as TRAF 2...|$|R

Other studies have found indications of mental health among both the religious and the secular. For instance, Vilchinsky & Kravetz found negative correlations with psychological distress among religious and secular subgroups of Jewish students. In addition, intrinsic religiosity has been inversely related to depression in the elderly, while extrinsic religiosity has no relation or even a slight positive relation to depression.

25|$|A 2013 study {{examined}} adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being <b>negatively</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial {{skills as a}} form of intervention. Emotional intelligence has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress and as mentioned previously, the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative of a victim going on to perpetuate aggression. One factor that is important in resilience is the regulation of one’s own emotions. Schneider et al. (2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.|$|E

The distinguishing factor was their inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such as [...] "happy" [...] or [...] "unhappy" [...] when describing these feelings.
