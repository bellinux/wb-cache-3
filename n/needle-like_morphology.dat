They are therefore promising candidates as fillers for polymer composites with enhanced thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. Target applications for this kind of composites are materials for heat management, electrostatic dissipators, wear protection materials, photovoltaic elements, etc. Inorganic nanotubes are heavier than carbon nanotubes and not as strong under tensile stress, but they are particularly strong under compression, leading to potential applications in impact-resistant applications such as bulletproof vests.|$|E
50|$|Inconel 625 was {{designed}} as a solid solution strengthened material with no significant microstructure. This holds true at low and high temperatures, but there is a region (923 to 1148 K) where precipitates form that are detrimental to the creep properties, and thus the strength, of the alloy. Under any creep conditions (high temperature with an applied stress), M23C6-type carbides form at the grain boundaries. When tested at 973 K, γ” precipitates begin forming. These γ” phase precipitates are ordered A3 B type with a composition of Ni3(Nb, Al, Ti) and a tetragonal crystal structure. They form a disk-shaped morphology and are coherent with respect to the matrix. When tested at 998 K, a δ-phase precipitate begins forming which consist of Ni3(Nb, Mo) in a orthorhombic crystal structure. They form in a <b>needle-like</b> <b>morphology</b> and are incoherent with the matrix. Both of these precipitates can be completely dissolved back into the matrix when the sample is heated 1148 K. This leads to the ability to recover creep properties of the alloy to prolong the materials lifetime.|$|E
40|$|Crystal polymorphism, where a {{molecule}} forms several different crystal lattices, is common, and often {{needs to be}} controlled. For example, crystalline drugs must be manufactured as one specified polymorph, so polymorph purity {{is essential to the}} pharmaceutical industry. This thesis is a quantitative study of the crystallization of glycine from aqueous solution, which focuses particularly on polymorphism. Crystallization is observed within a 96 -well microplate, where each well is filled with 0. 1 mL of supersaturated solution. We address the difficulty of obtaining reproducible nucleation data. This problem is difficult because induction times are extremely sensitive to factors such as how the crystallizing system is prepared, and small variations in the supersaturation. The appropriate statistical tests needed to show reproducibility are discussed. Glycine has two common polymorphs, alpha and gamma, the competition between these polymorphs is studied. We obtain data at multiple NaCl concentrations. Addition of NaCl is known to favour nucleation of the gamma polymorph. The polymorph of crystals are individually identified in-situ using Raman spectroscopy. At high salt concentrations, nucleation kinetics of the alpha and gamma polymorphs are qualitatively different. The gamma polymorph behaves like the hare in Aesop's story of the tortoise and the hare: Nucleation start off rapidly, but slows, while for the alpha polymorph, nucleation starts off slow but at later times almost overtakes that of the gamma polymorph. The opposite time dependencies of the nucleation of the competing polymorphs, allows optimisation of polymorph purity using time-dependent supersaturation. Growth of the two polymorphs is analysed. The alpha polymorph is observed to grow faster than the gamma polymorph. Growth rates were variable, so they were also analysed in relation to induction times and crystal habits. We show that crystals with long induction times tend to be <b>needle-like,</b> and <b>needle-like</b> <b>morphologies</b> tend to grow faster than non <b>needle-like</b> <b>morphologies...</b>|$|R

The coatings were deposited from both liquid HMDSO and TCFS (tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane / fluorosiloxane) precursors. These precursors were nebulized into a helium / nitrogen plasma and the coatings were deposited onto silicon wafer substrates. By controlling the deposition conditions superhydrophobic coatings exhibiting a <b>needle-like</b> coating <b>morphology</b> was obtained from both precursors. Initial fibre lengths were in the nm range but after longer deposition time’s coatings with micron long fibre lengths were obtained. In {{the case of the}} HMDSO precursor individual aligned fibres with diameters of up to 300 nm and lengths of up to 12 μm were observed. The TCFS coatings were structurally different as they exhibited a non-aligned, more densely packed, fibrous structures. For the same deposition time as used with HMDSO, the TCFS coatings exhibited fibre lengths of up to 10 microns. Coating morphology, water contact angle and functional chemistry were examined using optical profilometry, contact angle and FTIR techniques respectively. The micron thick fibrous coatings both exhibited superhydrophobic properties with contact angles of over 150 °...|$|R
40|$|In-situ {{studies of}} Al-Si {{eutectic}} {{growth has been}} carried {{out for the first time}} by X-ray video microscopy during directional solidification of Al-Si-Cu alloys with and without Sr-addtions. The unmodified eutectics showed distinctive non-isothermal growth dynamics, where Si-crystals attained <b>needle-like</b> tip <b>morphologies</b> and progressed under significantly higher undercooling than Al, leading to formation of an irregular eutectic with Si as the leading phase and subsequent nucleation of Al on the Si-surfaces. In the Sr-modified alloys, the eutectic reaction was found to be strongly suppressed, occurring with low nucleation frequencies at undercoolings in the range 10 - 18 K. In the Cu-enriched melt, the eutectic front was found to attain meso-scale interface perturbations evolving into equiaxed cellular rosettes in order to accommodate to the long-range redistribution of Cu from the composite eutectic interface. The eutectic front also attained short-range microscale interface perturbations consistent with characteristics of a fibrous Si growth, however further improvements in spatial resolution is required in order to study microscale structure formation in greater detail. Evidence was found in support of Si-nucleation occurring on potent particles suspended in the melt. Yet, both with Sr- modified and unmodified alloys, Si precipitation alone was not sufficient to facilitate the eutectic reaction, which apparently required additional undercooling for Al to form on the Si-particles. To what extent nucleation mechanisms in the Cu-enriched systems are transferable to binary or commercial Al-Si alloys remains uncertain...|$|R
