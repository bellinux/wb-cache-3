We also obtain sharp lower and upper bounds for the regularity coefficient, thus allowing the application of our results to many concrete dynamics. It turns out that, using the theory of Lyapunov regularity, we can show that the nonuniform <b>exponential</b> <b>behavior</b> is ubiquitous, contrarily to what happens with the uniform <b>exponential</b> <b>behavior</b> that although robust is much less common.

40|$|Abstract—It {{has been}} known for some years that the uniform-density problem for forward neural {{networks}} has a positive answer: Any real-valued, continuous function on a compact subset of Rd can be uniformly approximated by a sigmoidal neural network with one hidden layer. We design here algorithms for efficient uniform approximation by a certain class of neural networks with one hidden layer which we call <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential.</b> This class contains, e. g., all networks with the activation functions 1 =(1 + e t), tanh (t), or et ^ 1 in their hidden layers. The algorithms flow from a theorem stating that such networks attain the order of approximation O (N 1 =d), d being dimension and N the number of hidden neurons. This theorem, in turn, is a consequence of a close relationship between neural networks of <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> type and multivariate algebraic and exponen-tial polynomials. The algorithms need neither a starting point nor learning parameters; they do not get stuck in local minima, and the gain in execution time relative to the backpropagation algorithm is enormous.
