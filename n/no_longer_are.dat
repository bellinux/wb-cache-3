But the Canaanites were in the land when Moses was alive." [...] Rabin also quotes the 11th century Rabi, Rashi, as saying that Moses could not have written, in Deuteronomy 34:5, [...] "And Moses died there", but it must have been written by Joshua. However, it is also noted that the second century commentator Rabbi Meir, has it that God dictated those words to Moses, who wrote them down with a tear in his eye.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the postmodern}} must be {{characterized}} as {{a situation in which}} the survival, the residue, the holdover, the archaic, has finally been swept away without a trace. In the postmodern, then, the past itself has disappeared (along with the well-known [...] "sense of the past" [...] or historicity and collective memory). Where its buildings still remain, renovation and restoration allow them to be transferred to the present in their entirety as those other, very different and postmodern things called simulacra. Everything is now organized and planned; nature has been triumphantly blotted out, along with peasants, petit-bourgeois commerce, handicraft, feudal aristocracies and imperial bureaucracies. Ours is a more homogeneously modernized condition; we <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>are</b> encumbered with the embarrassment of non-simultaneities and non-synchronicities. Everything has reached the same hour on the great clock of development or rationalization (at least from the perspective of the [...] "West").

Under this doctrine, men <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>are</b> allowed to have children with their wives. Charlene Jeffs wrote in her custody petition: [...] "It is the husband's responsibility to hold {{the hands of their}} wives while the seed bearer 'spreads his seed'. In layman terms, the husband is required to sit in the room while the chosen seed bearer, or a couple of them, rape his wife or wives." [...] She also described the [...] "Law of Sarah," [...] in which FLDS women perform sex acts on each other to prepare for a sexual encounter with a man in the FLDS leadership. Lorin Holm, who claimed to have been part of Jeffs' [...] "inner circle" [...] before he was excommunicated from the group in 2011, later described the [...] "Law of Sarah" [...] practice in Jeffs' community as akin to a lesbian sex show with Jeffs participating and sermonizing.

2500|$|However {{influential}} Malfatti's debut {{into the}} Modernist art scene was in Brazil, her later pieces of work seem {{to revert to}} an older and more serene style. <b>No</b> <b>longer</b> <b>are</b> her pieces shocking or with as intense of a mixture of Cubism and Impressionism. Her painting O Canal e a Ponta done in the 1940s {{is not nearly as}} stunning in style or character as The Idiot. The brush-strokes are much smaller and identical in relation to one another. They all go in the same direction, merely seen as a transitory means for color to be expressed. Malfatti's color palette is much less stunning as well. Although the colors in the painting are still lovely, they lack the vivid contrast which makes The Idiot so memorable. Instead of playing off of opposite colors, O Canal e a Ponta is one swell of deep shades that vary slightly from light reflections. The painting is still beautiful, it is simply much more traditional. The style is much more reminiscent of a toned down expressionism and does not utilise any qualities of Cubism which made her first pieces so planarly abstract. Even the subject matter is much more traditional and [...] "European". It is a very tranquil setting of a bridge over a river with two trees on its sides a set of houses down the way and a serene sky. It is very harmonious but lacking in zest which would make her painting unique.|$|E
