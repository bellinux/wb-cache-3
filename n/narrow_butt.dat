However, when detecting the <b>narrow</b> <b>butt</b> of a specular reflection workpiece, the existing methods may fail because of the extremely small groove width and the poor imaging quality. This paper proposes a novel detection method to solve these issues. We design a uniform surface light source to get high signal-to-noise ratio images against the specular reflection effect, and a double-line laser light source is used to obtain the workpiece surface equation relative to the torch. Two light sources are switched on alternately and the camera is synchronized to capture images when each light is on; then the position and pose between the torch and the groove can be obtained nearly at the same time. Experimental results show that our method can detect the groove effectively and efficiently during the welding process. The image resolution is 12. 5 Î¼m and the processing time is less than 10 ms per frame. This indicates our method can be applied to real-time <b>narrow</b> <b>butt</b> detection during high-speed welding process...|$|E
