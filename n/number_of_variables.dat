The only assumption needed is that constraints can involve only a bounded <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> (all relations are of some bounded arity, 2 {{in the case}} of graphs).

25|$|This {{is because}} one can always reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> by substituting zero for some variables, {{and one can}} {{increase}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> by applying the homomorphisms n; the definition of those homomorphisms assures that n(P(X1,,X'n))=P(X1,,X'n+1) (and similarly for Q) whenever n'd.

Ecological sensitivity index (ESI) of mangrove ecosystem is an alternative tool to control oil spill by protecting highly sensitive areas from oil spill. One of the problems found {{in the development of}} ecological sensitivity index (ESI) of mangrove ecosystem is large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> ecological sensitivity.

25|$|In all {{instances}} where R2 is used, the predictors are calculated by ordinary least-squares regression: that is, by minimizing SSres. In this case R2 increases as we increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> {{in the model}} (R2 is monotone increasing with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> included—i.e., it will never decrease). This illustrates a drawback to one possible use of R2, where one might keep adding variables (Kitchen sink regression) to increase the R2 value. For example, if one is trying to predict the sales of a model of car from the car's gas mileage, price, and engine power, one can include such irrelevant factors as the first letter of the model's name or {{the height of the}} lead engineer designing the car because the R2 will never decrease as variables are added and will probably experience an increase due to chance alone.|$|E

40|$|Kalman Filtering is a {{computational}} tool with widespread {{applications in}} robotics, financial and weather forecasting, environmental engineering and defense. Given observation and state transition models, the Kalman Filter (KF) recursively estimates the state <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> a dynamic system. However, the KF requires a cubic time matrix inversion operation at every timestep which prevents its application in domains with large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> state <b>variables.</b> We propose Relational Gaussian Models to represent and model dynamic systems with large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> efficiently. Furthermore, we devise an exact lifted Kalman Filtering algorithm which takes only linear {{time in the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> random <b>variables</b> at every timestep. We prove that our algorithm takes linear time in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> state <b>variables</b> even when individual observations apply to each variable. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} lifted (linear time) algorithm for filtering with continuous dynamic relational models. ...|$|R

25|$|In 1953, DRL had {{collected}} extensive raw data during {{the evaluation of}} several US Navy mine-hunting sonars.

25|$|In {{order to}} deal with {{problems}} with thousands of variables, it is necessary to use a different approach. One is to first sample one ordering, and then find the optimal BN structure with respect to that ordering. This implies working on the search space of the possible orderings, which is convenient as it is smaller than the space of network structures. Multiple orderings are then sampled and evaluated. This method has been proven to be the best available in literature when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> is huge.|$|E
25|$|Before Wilson's RG approach, {{there was}} an {{astonishing}} empirical fact to explain: the coincidence of the critical exponents (i.e., the exponents of the reduced-temperature dependence of several quantities near a second order phase transition) in very disparate phenomena, such as magnetic systems, superfluid transition (Lambda transition), alloy physics, etc. Thus, in general, thermodynamic features of a system near a phase transition depend only on a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables,</b> such as dimensionality and symmetry, but are insensitive to details of the underlying microscopic properties of the system.|$|E
50|$|Many {{research}} areas see increasingly large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> in only few samples.

We speak of positive redundancy if the system is calculable and the total redundancy is positive. One can see that the level of topological redundancy merely depends on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> equations (the more equations the higher the redundancy) and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> unmeasured <b>variables</b> (the more unmeasured variables, the lower the redundancy) and not on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> measured <b>variables.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{determining}} the time complexity of algorithms {{for the decision}} problem for the existential theory of the reals, {{it is important to}} have a measure of the size of the input. The simplest measure of this type is the length of a sentence: that is, the number of symbols it contains. However, in order to achieve a more precise analysis of the behavior of algorithms for this problem, it is convenient to break down the input size into several variables, separating out the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> to be quantified, the number of polynomials within the sentence, and the degree of these polynomials.|$|E
25|$|A {{polynomial}} is {{an expression}} that {{is the sum of}} a finite number of non-zero terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> raised to whole number powers. For example, x2 + 2x − 3 is a polynomial in the single variable x. A polynomial expression {{is an expression}} that may be rewritten as a polynomial, by using commutativity, associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example, (x − 1)(x + 3) is a polynomial expression, that, properly speaking, is not a polynomial. A polynomial function is a function that is defined by a polynomial, or, equivalently, by a polynomial expression. The two preceding examples define the same polynomial function.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertices}} of the polytope {{are also}} called basic feasible solutions. The {{reason for this}} choice of name is as follows. Let d denote the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables.</b> Then the fundamental theorem of linear inequalities implies (for feasible problems) that for every vertex x* of the LP feasible region, there exists a set of d (or fewer) inequality constraints from the LP such that, when we treat those d constraints as equalities, the unique solution is x*. Thereby we can study these vertices by means of looking at certain subsets of the set of all constraints (a discrete set), rather than the continuum of LP solutions. This principle underlies the simplex algorithm for solving linear programs.|$|E
