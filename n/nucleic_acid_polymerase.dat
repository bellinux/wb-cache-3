We evaluated {{the role of}} dynamic plasma cell-free DNA EGFR mutation status in outcome prediction. MethodsAdvanced lung adenocarcinoma patients were enrolled and prospectively observed for outcomes of EGFR-TKI treatment. Peptide nucleic acid–zip <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clamp method was developed to assess EGFR mutations in matched tumor and serial plasma cell-free DNA specimens. ResultsA total of 72 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 62 patients (86. 1 %) had EGFR-mutant tumors (34 patients with exon 19 deletions, and 28 patients with L 858 R). Pretreatment plasma used for EGFR mutation testing showed a sensitivity of 59. 7 % and a specificity of 100 %. Detection sensitivity was significantly higher in stage IV-M 1 b patients compared with stage IIIb and IV-M 1 a patients (78. 0 % versus 23. 8 %, p < 0. 001). All patients who presented with EGFR-mutant tumors received first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 74. 2 % and 82. 3 %, respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 8. 8 months (95 % CI: 6. 6 – 11. 0) and 20. 5 months (95 % CI 15. 1 – 26. 0), respectively. Failure to clear plasma EGFR mutations after EGFR-TKI treatment was an independent predictor of lower disease control rate (odds ratio 5. 26 [95 % CI: 1. 13 – 24. 44]; p = 0. 034), shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 1. 97 [95 % CI: 1. 33 – 2. 91]; p = 0. 001), and shorter overall survival (hazard ratio: 1. 82 [95 % CI: 1. 04 – 3. 18], p = 0. 036).

Methods: We retrospectively examined the efficacy of the peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clamp (PNA-LNA PCR clamp) method for detecting EGFR mutations in 122 bronchoscopic cytological specimens from NSCLC patients. Results: Overall, 41 specimens (33. 6 %) were positive for EGFR mutation. Twenty-nine (39. 7 %) of 73 specimens obtained by using endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath, 7 (33. 3 %) of 21 specimens obtained under direct vision by using a conventional bronchoscope, 4 (36. 4 %) of 11 specimens obtained by using an ultrathin bronchoscope, and 1 (5. 9 %) of 17 specimens obtained by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration were positive for EGFR mutation. Furthermore, among 22 resected NSCLC cases, the EGFR mutation status obtained from bronchoscopic materials was consistent with the status obtained from surgical samples, {{with the exception of one}} case.

40|$|Abstract. Factors {{predicting}} {{the efficacy of}} erlotinib treatment in patients with EGFR mutation‑negative non‑small‑cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not been well studied. This retrospective study investigates whether patient characteristics, such as site of metastasis, can predict the efficacy of erlotinib treatment in NSCLC patients. In total, 53 EGFR mutation‑negative NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib were enrolled, and the associations between clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival were analyzed. The EGFR mutation status was determined using the peptide nucleic acid‑locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clamp method. Survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan‑Meier method. Among the NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib, 27 patients with pulmonary metastasis exhibited significantly longer progression‑free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times than those without pulmonary metastasis (median PFS time, 2. 9 versus 1. 2 months; P= 0. 0010 and median OS time, 12. 4 versus 4. 1 months; P= 0. 0007). Multivariate analyses also revealed that pulmonary metastasis independently correlated with PFS and OS times (hazard ratio, 0. 39; P= 0. 0055 and hazard ratio, 0. 33; P= 0. 0022, respectively). Patients with pulmonary metastasis exhibited significantly longer PFS and OS times than those without pulmonary metas-tasis.

A 75 -year-old female with lung adenocarcinoma harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (15 -bp in-frame deletion in exon 19 and T 790 M in exon 20) developed obstructive jaundice during therapy. Obstruction of the common bile duct caused by an intraductal tumor was identified by computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and endoscopic ultrasonography. Although primary cholangiocarcinoma was highly suspected according to the imaging findings, immunohistochemical evaluation of the intraductal tumor demonstrated thyroid transcription factor- 1 positive adenocarcinoma.

Materials and MethodsPlasma genomic DNA from consecutive advanced lung cancer subjects was tested for EGFR mutations before anticancer treatment, and compared with mutation status in tumor tissue.

ResultsIn 74 lung cancer patients, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of plasma EGFR detection were 79. 1 %, 96. 8 %, 97. 1 %, and 76. 9 %, respectively. EGFR mutants with concomitant {{detection of}} plasma EGFR mutation showed worse survival compared with mutants with no concomitant plasma mutation detected in biopsy specimens.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, it was argued that only those coding sequences descended from oligomeric repeats (the number of {{bases in the}} oligomeric unit not being a multiple of 3) can retain sufficiently long alternative open reading frames, and that such alternative open reading frames serve as the reservoir for the sudden generation of new polypeptide chains with novel functions. It was suggested that plasmid-encoded 6 -amino hexanoic acid linear oligomer hydrolase that suddenly endowed Flavobacterium sp. K 172 with the capacity to live off nylon by-products arose by the above mechanism. A corollary to the above argument is the expectation that those viral base sequences that are known to use {{two of the three}} alternative reading frames to encode two different polypeptide chains should invariably contain recognizable remains of the oligomeric tandem repeats, and as a consequence, various oligopeptidic repeats should also be present in the amino acid sequence of each.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{mechanisms}} of generation and progression of multicentric lung adenocarcinoma (AD), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) in the peripheral lung {{is not well}} known. In this study, we analyzed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations {{in the cases of}} multicentric AD, BAC, and AAH to reveal the role of EGFR mutation in their generations and progressions. MethodNinety-seven AAH, BAC, or AD lesions less than 3 cm in size in 26 patients were surgically resected. Of these, EGFR mutations of the nodules with the highest and the second highest grade of histologic malignancy were examined in each patient by using the peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction (PNA-LNA PCR) clamp method. ResultsEGFR mutations could be examined in 48 nodules in the 26 patients. The EGFR mutations were found more frequently in lesions with higher histologic malignancy, ie, 9 of 10 ADs (90 %), 16 of 28 BACs (57 %), and one of 10 AAHs (10 %). In 22 patients who could be examined of EGFR mutations for the two lesions in each patient, only two patients (9 %) had the same mutation patterns between the two lesions, whereas 15 patients (68 %) had the different statuses and the remaining five (23 %) had no mutations.

40|$|IntroductionAdenocarcinoma of the lung, {{especially}} bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) and adenocarcinoma with BAC features (AWBF), {{is potentially}} sensitive to {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs); however, the efficacy seems to differ between the histologic subtypes. Mucinous BAC and AWBF (MBAC/AWBF) are not particularly responsive to EGFR-TKIs compared with nonmucinous BAC/AWBF (N-MBAC/AWBF). This {{may be due to}} the rarity of EGFR mutations and high frequency of KRAS mutations in MBAC/AWBF in contrast to N-MBAC/AWBF. MethodsOne hundred ninety-one patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung underwent surgery at our institution. There were 59 patients (30 %) diagnosed with BAC/AWBF; 20 had MBAC/AWBF (10 %) and 39 had N-MBAC/AWBF (20 %). We isolated 44 tissue specimens from these patients (20 consecutive cases of MBAC/AWBFs and 24 randomly chosen cases of N-MBAC/AWBFs as the control group), and we analyzed them for EGFR and KRAS mutations. We used the peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clump method to detect EGFR mutations and conventional DNA sequencing to identify KRAS mutations. ResultsEGFR mutations were found in three of the 20 MBAC/AWBFs (15 %) and in 14 of the 24 N-MBAC/AWBFs (58 %) (p = 0. 005). In addition, there were 14 KRAS mutations identified in the 20 MBAC/AWBFs (70 %) and seven in the 24 N-MBAC/AWBFs (29 %) (p = 0. 0144). ConclusionsThe incidence of EGFR mutation is low and that of KRAS mutation is frequent in MBAC/AWBFs. Conversely, the incidence of EGFR mutation is high and KRAS mutation is low in N-MBAC/AWBFs. Based on these findings, EGFR-TKIs may not be effective in patients with MBAC/AWBF...|$|E
40|$|The rate-limiting {{step for}} {{nucleotide}} incorporation in the pre-steady state for most <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerases</b> {{is thought to}} be a conformational change. As a result, very little information is available on the role of active-site residues in the chemistry of nucleotidyl transfer. For the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3 Dpol), chemistry is partially (Mg 2 +) or completely (Mn 2 +) rate limiting. Here we show that nucleotidyl transfer depends on two ionizable groups with pKa values of 7. 0 or 8. 2 and 10. 5, depending upon the divalent cation used in the reaction. A solvent deuterium isotope effect of three to seven was observed on the rate constant for nucleotide incorporation in the pre-steady state; none was observed in the steady state. Proton-inventory experiments were consistent with two protons being transferred during the rate-limiting transition state of the reaction, suggesting that both deprotonation of the 3 ′-hydroxyl nucleophile and protonation of the pyrophosphate leaving group occur in the transition state for phosphodiester bond formation. Importantly, two proton transfers occur in the transition state for nucleotidyl-transfer reactions catalyzed by RB 69 DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, T 7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and HIV reverse transcriptase. Interpretation of these data in the context of known polymerase structures suggests the existence of a general base for deprotonation of the 3 ′-OH nucleophile, although use of a water molecule cannot be ruled out conclusively, and a general acid for protonation of the pyrophosphate leaving group in all <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerases.</b> These data imply an associative-like transition-state structure...|$|R

Mutation of this residue resulted in a variant enzyme now capable of acting as an RNA polymerase. In marked contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the Km of the mutant enzyme for ribonucleotides was comparable to that for deoxyribonucleotides.

Recently, the survival advantage of erlotinib, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was not affected by EGFR mutation status in a phase III trial, indicating that patients with EGFR-wild-type (EGFR-wt) tumors might also benefit from this tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of erlotinib in Japanese patients with EGFR-wt tumors. MethodsThe primary end point was an objective response. Patients with EGFR-wt tumors previously receiving one to three chemotherapy regimens were enrolled in this trial. The mutation status was assessed using the peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clamp method. Erlotinib was administered (150 mg/d) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities occurred. ResultsThirty patients were enrolled between January and December 2008.

Grades 3 – 4 adverse events included pulmonary embolism, keratitis, and anemia. Two other patients developed interstitial lung disease (grades 1 and 2). Nevertheless, all these events were reversible, resulting in no treatment-related deaths. With a median follow-up time of 10. 7 months, the median survival time and median progression-free survival times were 9. 2 and 2. 1 months, respectively.

40|$|Introduction:Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that first-line treatment with gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR) –targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is significantly superior to standard chemotherapy for advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR sensitive mutations. Meanwhile, the efficacy of gefitinib therapy among elderly populations diagnosed with EGFR-mutated NSCLC has not yet been elucidated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of gefitinib for chemotherapy-naive patients aged 75 or older with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations; generally, these patients have no indication for treatment with platinum doublets. Methods:Chemotherapy-naive patients aged 75 years or older with performance status 0 to 1 and advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations, as determined by the peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clamp method, were enrolled. The enrolled patients received 250 mg/day of gefitinib orally. Results:Between January 2008 and May 2009, 31 patients were enrolled, all of whom were eligible. The median age was 80 (range, 75 – 87) years. Twenty-five patients (81 %) were women, and 30 patients (97 %) had adenocarcinoma. The overall response rate was 74 % (95 % confidence interval, 58 %– 91 %), and the disease control rate was 90 %. The median progression-free survival was 12. 3 months. The common adverse events were rash, diarrhea, and liver dysfunction. One treatment-related death because of interstitial lung disease occurred. Conclusions:This is the first study that verified safety and efficacy of first-line treatment with gefitinib in elderly patients having advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation. Considering its strong antitumor activity and mild toxicity, first-line gefitinib may be preferable to standard chemotherapy for this population...|$|E

Sixty-four patients (48. 1 %) were available for mutational analysis in the chemotherapy alone group and 61 (45. 1 %) in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group. RESULTS: 1. 6 % (2 / 116) harbored an EGFR mutation (2 patients; exon 20), 9. 6 % (12 / 121) harbored a KRAS mutation (12 patients; exon 2), and 9. 6 % (12 / 118) harbored a PIK 3 CA mutation (10 patients, exon 9 and 2 patients, exon 20). The addition of erlotinib to GEMOX in patients with KRAS wild-type disease (n = 109) resulted in significant improvements in overall response compared with GEMOX alone (30. 2 % vs 12. 5 %, P =. 024).

40|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) {{was first}} discovered {{as an essential}} catalyst in the biological cycle of retroviruses. However, in the past years evidence has accumulated showing that RTs {{are involved in a}} surprisingly large number of RNA-mediated transpositional events that include both viral and nonviral genetic entities. Although it is probable that some RT-bearing genetic elements like the different types of AIDS viruses and the mammalian LINE family have arisen in recent geological times, the possibility that reverse transcription first took place in the early Archean is supported by (1) the hypothesis that RNA preceded DNA as cellular genetic material; (2) the existence of homologous regions of the subunit tau of the E. coli DNA polymerase III with the simian immunodeficiency virus RT, the hepatitis B virus RT, and the beta' subunit of the E. coli RNA polymerase (McHenry et al. 1988); (3) the presence of several conserved motifs, including a 14 -amino-acid segment that consists of an Asp-Asp pair flanked by hydrophobic amino acids, which are found in all RTs and in most cellular and viral RNA polymerases. However, whether extant RTs descend from the primitive polymerase involved in the RNA-to-DNA transition remains unproven. Substrate specificity of the AMV and HIV- 1 RTs can be modified in the presence of Mn 2 +, a cation which allows them to add ribonucleotides to an oligo (dG) primer in a template-dependent reaction. This change in specificity is comparable to that observed under similar conditions in other <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerases.</b> This experimentally induced change in RT substrate specificity may explain previous observations on the misincorporation of ribonucleotides by the Maloney murine sarcoma virus RT in the minus and plus DNA of this retrovirus (Chen and Temin 1980).

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the role of EGFR mutations and ERCC 1 in predicting the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy and the outcome of patients with NSCLC. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to analyze the relationships between EGFR mutations or ERCC 1 expression and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with NSCLC who received platinum-based chemotherapy. EGFR mutation status was determined using the peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clamp method, and immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of ERCC 1 in tumor samples obtained from the patients. RESULTS: Among the NSCLC patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy, the median PFS was significantly better in those who had never smoked and those with exon 19 deletion, and the median overall survival (OS) was significantly better in those who had never smoked, those with exon 19 deletion, and women. Cox regression analysis revealed that exon 19 deletion and having never smoked were significantly associated with both PFS and OS. Subset analysis revealed a significant correlation between ERCC 1 expression and EGFR mutation, and ERCC 1 -negative patients with exon 19 deletion had a longer PFS than the other patients; ERCC 1 -positive patients without exon 19 deletion had a shorter PFS than the other patients.

Results:Thirty-three of 249 patients with SQC (13. 3 %) had EGFR mutations, including exon 19 deletion (19 of 33 patients, 58 %), L 858 R point mutation in exon 21 (12 of 33, 36 %), and G 719 S point mutation in exon 18 (2 of 33, 6 %). Twenty of these 33 patients received EGFR-TKI therapy, and five of these 20 responded to EGFR-TKIs with {{a response rate of}} 25. 0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 8. 7 %– 49. 1 %). The patients’ median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 1. 4 months (95 % CI, 0. 7 – 5. 8 months) and 14. 6 months (95 % CI, 2. 9 –undeterminable months), respectively. Approximately one third of the EGFR-mutated SQC patients achieved progression-free survival for longer than 6 months. Some of these patients had high carcinoembryonic antigen levels or a history of never smoking, or were positive for thyroid transcription factor- 1. Conclusions:Although EGFR-TKIs seem to be generally less effective in EGFR-mutated SQC than in EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma, some EGFR-mutated SQC patients can obtain clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs. To better identify these patients, not only EGFR mutation status, but also clinical factors and pathologic findings should be taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Using {{sequence}} profile {{methods and}} structural comparisons we characterize a previously unknown family of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerases</b> {{in a group}} of mobile elements from genomes of diverse bacteria, an algal plastid and certain DNA viruses, including the recently reported Sputnik virus. Using contextual information from domain architectures and gene-neighborhoods we present evidence that they are likely to possess both primase and DNA polymerase activity, comparable to the previously reported prim-pol proteins. These newly identified polymerases help in defining the minimal functional core of superfamily A DNA polymerases and related RNA polymerases. Thus, they provide a framework to understand the emergence of both DNA and RNA polymerization activity in this class of enzymes. They also provide evidence that enigmatic DNA viruses, such as Sputnik, might have emerged from mobile elements coding these polymerases.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the antiviral activity shown by chelating agents towards different viruses is probably related to the action on viral <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerases</b> which require metal ions as essential cofactors. Desferrioxamine B, a metabolite from Streptomyces pilosus which chelates ions (Fe 3 +, Al 3 +, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Co 2 +) from intracellular and external compartments, has been tested for its activity on the multiplication of VSV and rabies virus in CER cells. While desferrioxamine B was ineffective on rabies virus multiplication, it was shown to reduce plaque formation, cytopathic effect and viral yield by VSV at both low and high multiplicity of infection. The activity of the drug was not due to a direct action on virions outside the cells, but was probably related to an alteration in the delicate balance of intracellular ions which could in turn be critical for VSV multiplication...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic cells package their genomes into a {{nucleoprotein}} form called chromatin. The {{basic unit}} of chromatin is the nucleosome, {{formed by the}} wrapping of ∼ 147 bp of DNA around an octameric complex of core histones. Advances in genomic technologies have enabled the locations of nucleosomes to be mapped across genomes [1, 2]. This has revealed a striking organisation with respect to transcribed genes in a diverse range of eukaryotes. This consists of a nucleosome depleted region upstream of promoters, {{with an array of}} well spaced nucleosomes extending into coding regions [2]. This observation reinforces the links between chromatin organisation and transcription. Central to this is the paradox that while chromatin is required by eukaryotes to restrict inappropriate access to DNA, this must be overcome in order for genetic information to be expressed. This conundrum is at its most flagrant when considering the need for <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase's</b> to transit 1000 's of based pairs of DNA wrapped as arrays of nucleosomes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:Mutation of the {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) gene can predict the efficacy of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Different mutations {{have been shown to}} co-occur in a single tumor. However, the frequency of these so-called “complex mutations” and the efficacy of gefitinib in treating patients with these mutations are unclear. Methods:We investigated the frequency of complex mutations in 783 patients with non-small cell lung cancer seen at our institutes between April 2006 and May 2009. Mutational analysis was performed using the peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clamp method. Gefitinib efficacy was evaluated in patients found to have complex mutations. Results: EGFRmutations were detected in 318 (41 %) patients, with 21 (6. 6 %) of these individuals having complex mutations. Sixteen of these 21 patients received gefitinib. The response rate (RR) was 67 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 35 – 90 %) and median progression-free survival was 12. 2 months (95 % CI, 1. 3 months to undeterminable). Analysis of RR according to mutation type revealed that patients with deletional mutation in exon 19 (Del- 19) and a point mutation in exon 21 (L 858 R) had a better RR (86 %, 6 of 7) than those with other complex mutation patterns such as a point mutation in exon 18 (G 719 S) + L 858 R (40 %, 2 of 5) (p = 0. 2222). The median progression-free survival was also longer in these patients (16. 5 months; 95 % CI, 1. 1 months to undeterminable versus 3. 8 months; 95 % CI, 0. 7 – 10. 0 months) (p = 0. 0459). Conclusions:Complex EGFR mutations are not rare. Gefitinib has different efficacy according to the type of complex EGFR mutations. Patients with Del- 19 and L 858 R mutations may benefit more from gefitinib than other types of complex mutations...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{sequencing}} {{remains the}} most widely used method for the detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung cancer; however, its relatively low sensitivity limits its clinical use. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the sensitivity of detecting an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation from peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction (PNA-LNA PCR) clamp and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) techniques compared to that by direct sequencing. Furthermore, the predictive efficacy of EGFR mutations detected by PNA-LNA PCR clamp was evaluated. EGFR mutational status was assessed by direct sequencing, PNA-LNA PCR clamp, and Ion Torrent PGM in 57 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated the predictive efficacy of PNA-LNA PCR clamp on the EGFR-TKI treatment in 36 patients with advanced NSCLC retrospectively. Compared to direct sequencing (16 / 57, 28. 1 %), PNA-LNA PCR clamp (27 / 57, 47. 4 %) and Ion Torrent PGM (26 / 57, 45. 6 %) detected more EGFR mutations. EGFR mutant patients had significantly longer progressive free survival (14. 31 vs. 21. 61 months, P = 0. 003) than that of EGFR wild patients when tested with PNA-LNA PCR clamp. However, no difference in response rate to EGFR TKIs (75. 0 % vs. 82. 4 %, P = 0. 195) or overall survival (34. 39 vs. 44. 10 months, P = 0. 422) was observed between the EGFR mutations by direct sequencing or PNA-LNA PCR clamp. Our results demonstrate firstly that patients with EGFR mutations were detected more frequently by PNA-LNA PCR clamp and Ion Torrent PGM than those by direct sequencing. EGFR mutations detected by PNA-LNA PCR clamp may be as a predicative factor for EGFR TKI response in patients with NSCLC...|$|E
40|$|Total {{regression}} of brain metastases in non-small cell {{lung cancer}} patients harboring EGFR mutations treated with gefitinib without radiotherapy: two case reports Masashi Chonan 1 *, Norio Narita 2 and Teiji Tominaga 3 Background: Gefitinib is an {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Clinical trials have reported its effectiveness in the treatment of brain metastases from {{non-small cell lung cancer}} by overcoming the blood–brain barrier. Gefitinib is generally regarded as a relatively safe agent, and several reports have described its efficacy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer and a poor performance status. Case presentation: We herein described two patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer who achieved the total regression of metastasis with the administration of gefitinib. A 70 -year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with a severe cough. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a metastatic lesion in the left temporal lobe. The tumor was positive for an epidermal growth factor receptor L 858 R mutation in exon 21 using the peptide nucleic acid-locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerase</b> chain reaction clamp method. She was treated with 250 mg gefitinib per day, and, 1 month later, the primary lesion and brain metastasis had totally resolved. A 58 -year-old Japa-nese woman was referred to our hospital with nausea and headache. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a metastatic lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere and meningeal dissemination. The tumor was positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor L 858 R mutation in exon 21. She was treated with 250 mg gefitinib per day, and, 3 weeks later, the primary lesion, brain metastasis, and meningeal dissemination had completely resolved. Conclusion: We successfully treated two lung cancer patients with brain metastasis using gefitinib. Gefitinib therapy may be a suitable treatment for brain metastasis in lung cancer with an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation, particularly in elderly patients with a poor performance status...|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} the X-ray crystal {{structures of the}} pre- and postcatalytic forms of the initiation complex of bacteriophage N 4 RNA polymerase that provide the complete set of atomic images depicting the process of transcript initiation by a single-subunit RNA polymerase. As observed during T 7 RNA polymerase transcript elongation, substrate loading for the initiation process also drives a conformational change of the O helix, but only the correct base pairing between the + 2 substrate and DNA base is able to complete the O-helix conformational transition. Substrate binding also facilitates catalytic metal binding that leads to alignment of the reactive groups of substrates for the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. Although all <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerases</b> use two divalent metals for catalysis, they differ in the requirements and the timing of binding of each metal. In the case of bacteriophage RNA polymerase, we propose that catalytic metal binding is the last step before the nucleotidyl transfer reaction...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Base {{unstacking}} in template strands, when {{accompanied by}} strand slippage, {{can result in}} deletion mutations during strand extension by <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>polymerases.</b> In a GCCC mutation hot-spot sequence, which was previously identified to have a 50 % probability of causing such mutations during DNA replication by a Y-family polymerase, a single-base deletion mutation could result from such unstacking of any one of its three template cytosines. In this study, the intrinsic energetic differences in unstacking among these three cytosines in a solvated DNA duplex overhang model were examined using umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy profiles obtained show that cytosine unstacking grows progressively more unfavorable as one moves inside the duplex from the 5 ′-end of the overhang template strand. Spontaneous strand slippage occurs in response to such base unstacking {{in the direction of}} both the major and minor grooves for all three cytosines. Unrestrained simulations run from three distinct strand-slipped states and one non-strand-slipped state suggest that a more duplexlike environment can help stabilize strand slippage. The possible underlying reasons an...|$|R
