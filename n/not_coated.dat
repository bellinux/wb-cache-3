2500|$|In centuries past, a ship's rigging was {{typically}} fashioned from rope. In the 19th century this was {{commonly referred to}} as Manilla, a reference to the origin of much good quality rope. Traditionally the running rigging was easily recognized since, for flexibility, it was <b>not</b> <b>coated</b> with tar and therefore of a lighter color than the standing rigging which was tarred for protection from weather and therefore darker or even black in color. On modern vessels, running rigging is likely to be made from synthetic fibers, while the standing rigging is most often fashioned from stainless steel [...] "wire rope". Since the 1990s, several new synthetic fibers have become common, particularly on racing and other high-performance sailing boats. These fibers include Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene [...] (UHMWPE) (also known as Spectra or Dynema), Vectran, and Technora.|$|E

30|$|The {{results show}} that the {{cationic}} surface-active substances do <b>not</b> <b>coat</b> uniformly the particle surface. In addition, due to the high surface energy and free OH groups on the silica surface which produce the hydrogen bond with water molecules, when the dispersed silica was isolated from the solvent, this hydrogen bond was also removed forming a Si-O-Si liaison and resulting to larger size particles which were agglomerated.|$|R

It is indicated for use in patients who are allergic to barium, or in cases where the barium might leak into the abdominal cavity. It does <b>not</b> <b>coat</b> the stomach/bowel lining as well as barium, so it is not used commonly for this purpose.|$|R
6000|$|Who takes {{count of}} the prejudices which we absorb through the skin by way of our surroundings? It was not the {{spectacle}} that impressed me. The first thought that almost spoke itself aloud was: [...] "They are killing kine;" [...] {{and it was a}} shock. The pigs were nobody's concern, but cattle--the brothers of the Cow, the Sacred Cow--were quite otherwise. The next time an M.P. tells me that India either Sultanises or Brahminises a man, I shall believe about half what he says. It is unpleasant to watch the slaughter of cattle when one has laughed at the notion for a few years. I could not see actually what was done in the first instance, because the row of stalls in which they lay was separated from me by fifty impassable feet of butchers and slung carcasses. All I know is that men swung open the doors of a stall as occasion required, and there lay two steers already stunned, and breathing heavily. These two they pole-axed, and half raising them by tackle they cut their throats. Two men skinned each carcase, somebody cut off the head, and in half a minute more the overhead rail carried two sides of beef to their appointed place. There was clamour enough in the operating room, but from the waiting cattle, invisible {{on the other side of}} the line of pens, never a sound. They went to their death, trusting Judas, without a word. They were slain at the rate of five a minute, and if the pig men were spattered with blood, the cow butchers were bathed in it. The blood ran in muttering gutters. There was no place for hand or foot that was <b>not</b> <b>coated</b> with thicknesses of dried blood, and the stench of it in the nostrils bred fear.|$|E

30|$|The {{majority}} of DOTs replied {{that they do}} <b>not</b> <b>coat</b> the ends of concrete beams. Among all the respondents, 77  % indicated that their state either does <b>not</b> <b>coat</b> (or rarely coats) the beam ends. The Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) shared that with new concrete structures, the outside fascia of exterior girders is sealed with a siloxane or an acrylic sealer, {{but there is no}} special treatment of girder ends. The agencies that do use coating systems and provided product descriptions were Florida DOT, Illinois DOT, and Iowa DOT. Protective coatings, concrete sealers, latex acrylic primer, and an epoxy sealer were products reported by these DOTs. These systems all require frequent or periodic inspection and are estimated to last up to 10  years. It {{is interesting to note that}} a previous survey performed in 2001 (Ahlborn et al. 2002) also revealed that most states do not repair prestressed I-beams for end deterioration, and if they were to perform one, the state DOT specification would be used in the rehabilitation process.|$|R

The teichoic acid portion of the staphylococcal polysaccharide displayed precipitin activity similar to polysaccharide, but it did <b>not</b> <b>coat</b> either latex particles or tanned red cells.

50|$|The mixture had the {{consistency}} of a thick paste or putty. It {{was applied to the}} vehicle, usually at the factory, patterned, and then hardened with blow torches. There were many variations seen in application designs, from the regular ridge-shaped pattern, to a less common waffle-shaped pattern. The differences mostly related to the factory producing each type of AFV. For example, the waffle pattern was seen almost exclusively on Sturmgeschütz III assault guns.

This shell is allowed to dry, and the process is repeated until at least a half-inch coating covers the entire piece. The bigger the piece, the thicker the shell needs to be. Only the inside of the cup is <b>not</b> <b>coated,</b> and the cup's flat top serves as the base upon which the piece stands during this process.|$|E
50|$|There was a licence {{issued to}} the pound keeper {{otherwise}} {{he could not}} charge a fee for the detention of the animals, hence the saying 'your cow is in the pound.'

The nails were <b>not</b> <b>coated</b> with any substance, the only tools used were a hammer and tongs, an anvil and a chisel.

50|$|The clay {{found in}} Imbe is sticky and fine, {{with a high}} iron content and, traditionally, much organic matter that is unreceptive to glazing. For some potters this is an {{inadequate}} material, since it has weak characteristics such as high shrinkage and relatively low fire resistance. Most Bizen ware is <b>not</b> <b>coated</b> with a glaze because of this shrinkage, since any applied glaze would peel off during the firing process. Due to its low fire resistance it cannot withstand rapid high-temperature changes, so the firing {{has to be done}} gradually. However, the soil also has beneficial properties, such as plasticity. The high strength of Inbe clay causes it to retain its form, making it tough even without glaze.|$|E
50|$|Traditional waffle irons are {{attached}} to tongs with wooden handles and are held over an open flame, or set on a stove. Most modern waffle irons are self-contained tabletop electrical appliances, heated by an electric heating element controlled by an internal thermostat. Professional waffle makers are usually made of cast iron whereas domestic models are often teflon coated. Many have a light that goes off when the iron is at the set temperature. Most modern waffle irons - particularly cast aluminum ones - are coated with a non-stick coating (e.g. teflon) to prevent the waffles from sticking to them. Cast-iron waffle makers are usually <b>not</b> <b>coated</b> and require seasoning like a cast-iron frying pan.|$|E
5000|$|The pipeline's inside wall is <b>not</b> <b>coated</b> for {{petroleum}} service.

[...] In the petroleum industry, where leaks are unacceptable and the pipelines are subject to internal pressures typically in the order of 10 MPa (1500 psi), the segments are joined by full penetration welds. Mechanical joints are also used. A pig is a standard device in pipeline transport, be it on-land or offshore. It is used to test for hydrostatic pressure, to check for dents and crimps on the sidewalls inside the pipe, and to conduct periodic cleaning and minor repairs.|$|E
5000|$|In Poland, {{the coat}} of arms {{as a whole is}} {{referred}} to as godło both in official documents and colloquial speech, despite the fact that other national, personal or family coats of arms are usually called a herb (e.g. the Nałęcz herb or the {{coat of arms}} of Finland). This probably {{stems from the fact that}} in Polish heraldry, the word godło (plural: godła) means only a heraldic charge (in this particular case a white crowned eagle) and <b>not</b> an entire <b>coat</b> of arms, but it is also an archaic word for a national symbol of any sort (national emblems which are <b>not</b> <b>coats</b> of arms, i. e. do not have a heraldic shield, are officially described as godła, for example the National emblem of Belarus) - in the Coat of Arms and National Colors Act from 1919 the herb of the Republic, the Seal of the Republic and the Civil Ensigns are all described as godła. In later legislation only the herb retained this designation; it is unknown why.|$|R
