A batch-stirred tank {{was used as the}} permeation unit. An aqueous solution of saponin and n-hexane were used as the liquid membrane and the outer oil phase, respectively. Yield and selectivity of individual NHC was much larger than that of BAC, Bp and Pe. Increasing the initial mass fraction of the saponin to the membrane solution (Csap, 0) and the initial volume fraction of O/W emulsion to total liquid in a stirred tank (øOW, 0) resulted in deteriorating the yield of individual NHC, but increasing the stirring speed (N) resulted in improving the yield of each NHC. With increasing Csap, 0, the selectivity of each NHC based on DMNs increased. Increasing øOW, 0 and N resulted in decreasing the selectivity of individual NHC based on DMNs. At an experimental condition fixed, the sequence of the yield and selectivity in reference to DMNs for each NHC was Q> Qu = iQ> In. Furthermore, we compared LPM method with methanol extraction method in view of the separation efficiency (yield, selectivity) of NHC.

Notable differences in sulfur compounds between the samples suggested that small changes in sulfur amino acids could be responsible. When this hypothesis was tested, salmon heated with cysteine had increased levels of many thiophenes, thiazoles, alicyclic sulfides, and nitrogen heterocycles. With the addition of methionine, levels of dimethyl sulfides, two alicyclic sulfides, pyrazines, some unsaturated aldehydes, and alcohols and 2 -furanmethanethiol increased.
