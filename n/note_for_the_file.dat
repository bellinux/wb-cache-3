5000|$|The Parents Television Council, a media {{watchdog}} group <b>noted</b> <b>for</b> <b>filing</b> <b>the</b> majority of FCC complaints for controversial programs like the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show that featured the brief exposure {{of one of}} Janet Jackson's breasts, is a frequent target of criticism by <b>the</b> group <b>for</b> inaccurate reporting on the media, support of increased government regulation of television, and using [...] "sensationalism" [...] in their reporting to reinforce their views. TV Watch has also objected to the PTC's annual list of the [...] "Best and Worst Shows for Primetime Viewing". In June 2007, the organization released an in-depth survey that concluded that most parents take their own responsibility for their children's TV viewing, thus challenging the PTC's views that most parents want increased government regulation of TV.|$|R
5000|$|The trio of Joseph Whiteford (guitar and vocals), Aaron Richardson (bass) and Christopher Thomas (drums) came {{together}} in 1998 and released Sibling Rivalry, a split album with No More Droids, in 1999. In 2000 the band put out Enter the Danger Brigade with Tooth and Nail Records. After the band's initial recording sessions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> album, Tooth & Nail thought {{that some of the}} submitted songs were too questionable in content and asked the band to reconvene with producer Barry Poynter and record several more. In all, Calibretto 13 recorded 19 songs <b>for</b> Enter <b>the</b> Danger Brigade, and only 11 songs were included on the debut album. Seven of the remaining songs were released as an EP titled From <b>the</b> Secret <b>Files</b> of <b>the</b> Danger Brigade (2000). In <b>the</b> liner <b>notes</b> <b>for</b> From <b>the</b> Secret <b>Files...,</b> Chris Thomas wrote: [...] "songs were kept from being on <b>the</b> album <b>for</b> one reason or another, and because we consider some of these to be our best songs we tried {{to make sure that you}} got to hear them. Of course, some of these songs are pretty crappy, too." [...] Calibretto 13 released a second full-length album on Tooth & Nail titled Adventures in Tokyo in 2002. This was the band's final release on Tooth & Nail. After the release of Adventures in Tokyo, the band made several changes.|$|R
