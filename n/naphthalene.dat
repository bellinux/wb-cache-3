5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{colliery}} site had become crowded, and included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from the pit. It was surrounded by housing and factories in what {{was one of the most}} industrial parts of Manchester. The ready supply of coal encouraged the development of Manchester's chemical industry around the colliery and in the northeast of the city generally. A factory producing carbolic acid from coal tar was established in 1857, and sulphuric acid and <b>naphthalene</b> were produced from 1865 in nearby Blackley, later the site of ICI's Dyestuff's Division.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other <b>naphthalene</b> products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} understanding of chemical bonds and non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of <b>naphthalene</b> and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>naphthalene</b> {{is derived}} from coal tar. From the 1960s until the 1990s, {{significant}} amounts of <b>naphthalene</b> were also produced from heavy petroleum fractions during petroleum refining, but today petroleum-derived <b>naphthalene</b> represents only a minor component of <b>naphthalene</b> production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Naphthalene</b> is {{the most}} {{abundant}} single component of coal tar. Although the composition of coal tar varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical coal tar is about 10% <b>naphthalene</b> by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% <b>naphthalene,</b> along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate <b>naphthalene.</b> The crude <b>naphthalene</b> resulting from this process is about 95% <b>naphthalene</b> by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound benzothiophene (<nbsp&2%), indane (0.2%), indene (<nbsp&2%), and methylnaphthalene (<nbsp&2%). Petroleum-derived <b>naphthalene</b> is usually purer than that derived from coal tar. Where required, crude <b>naphthalene</b> can be further purified by recrystallization from any {{of a variety of}} solvents, resulting in 99% <b>naphthalene</b> by weight, referred to as 80nbsp&°C (melting point). Approximately 1.3M tons are produced annually.|$|E
25|$|In electrophilic {{aromatic}} substitution reactions, <b>naphthalene</b> reacts {{more readily}} than benzene. For example, chlorination and bromination of <b>naphthalene</b> proceeds without a catalyst to give 1-chloronaphthalene and 1-bromonaphthalene, respectively. Likewise, whereas both benzene and <b>naphthalene</b> can be alkylated using Friedel–Crafts reactions, <b>naphthalene</b> can also be easily alkylated by reaction with alkenes or alcohols, using sulfuric or phosphoric acid catalysts.|$|E

25|$|<b>Naphthalene</b> {{has been}} used as a {{household}} fumigant. It was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, although its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a sealed container containing <b>naphthalene</b> pellets, <b>naphthalene</b> vapors build up to levels toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths that attack textiles. Other fumigant uses of <b>naphthalene</b> include use in soil as a fumigant pesticide, in attic spaces to repel animals and insects, and in museum storage-drawers and cupboards to protect the contents from attack by insect pests.|$|E
25|$|Unlike benzene, the carbon–carbon {{bonds in}} <b>naphthalene</b> {{are not of}} the same length. The bonds C1−C2, C3−C4, C5−C6 and C7−C8 are about 1.37 Å (137 pm) in length, whereas the other carbon–carbon bonds are about 1.42 Å (142 pm) long. This difference, {{established}} by X-ray diffraction, {{is consistent with the}} valence bond model in <b>naphthalene</b> and in particular, with the theorem of cross-conjugation. This theorem would describe <b>naphthalene</b> as an aromatic benzene unit bonded to a diene but not extensively conjugated to it (at least in the ground state). As such, <b>naphthalene</b> possesses several resonance structures.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} {{pyrotechnic}} {{special effects}} such as the generation of black smoke and simulated explosions.

25|$|Commercially used {{creosote}} {{is often}} treated {{to extract the}} carbolic acid, <b>naphthalene,</b> or anthracene content.

American produced creosote oils typically will have low amounts of anthracene and high amounts of <b>naphthalene,</b> because when forcing the distillate at a temperature that produces anthracene the soft pitch will be ruined and only the hard pitch will remain; this ruins it for use in roofing purposes, and only leaves a product which isn't commercially useful.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. Part one {{presents}} a novel method for the synthesis of <b>naphthalenes</b> bearing aryl substituents. The novel route starts from three simple and readily available tetralones, α-tetralone, 6 -methoxy-α-tetralone and 6, 7 -dimethoxy-α- tetralone. By means of standard Suzuki coupling methodology and aromatization methods, twelve aryl-substituted <b>naphthalenes</b> were synthesized from the tetralones over five steps in good yields. Some of the aryl-substituted <b>naphthalenes</b> synthesized have shown positive results when tested against malignant cancer cells. Part one also explains how unexpected cyclopropa[a]naphthalenes were obtained from 1 -aryl- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 - naphthaldehydes by treatment with lithium aluminium hydride. The methodology developed in part one is further explored in part two of the thesis, which describes the synthesis of analogues of [1, 1 ’]binaphthalenyl- 2, 2 ’-diol. A small library of twelve different biaryl diols was prepared from simple bromo(methoxy) naphthaldehydes that were synthesized in part one. The resultant biaryl diols were used in the design of twenty-two novel phosphite, phosphate, phosphoramidite and phosphoramidate ligands in which the phosphorus atoms are contained in either a nine-or an eight-membered heteroatom ring. However, these ligands are still to be tested in metal-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions...|$|R

40|$|Aromatic compounds, {{accessible}} only by multistep procedures, can be synthesized easily by nucleophilic substitution of nitrite in nitrobenzenes, nitrobiphenyls, and nitronaphthalenes.
