We conducted a study to determine whether intraoperative radiodetection of somatostatin receptors is feasible and could increase the probability of complete meningioma resection, especially for bone-invasive en plaque meningiomas, which are difficult to control surgically. METHODS: Eighteen patients with en plaque sphenoid wing and cranial convexity <b>meningiomas</b> were <b>studied</b> <b>by</b> preoperative and postoperative somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. In 10 of them, intraoperative radiodetection with a hand-held gamma probe was performed 24 hours after the intravenous administration of (111) In-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid octreotide. This procedure was combined with a computer-aided navigation system. RESULTS: All preoperative scintigrams were positive. Intraoperative gamma probe detection was achieved for the invaded bone, dura, and periorbit of sphenoid wing meningiomas. The average tumor/nontumor count ratio was 2 : 1, with a maximum of 12 : 1, thus allowing precise detection capable of defining the tumor margins. In three cases of sphenoid wing meningiomas, postoperative scintigrams were helpful for the determination of recurrences that magnetic resonance imaging failed to detect. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data show that intraoperative radiodetection of somatostatin receptors with a hand-held gamma probe is feasible and {{may be helpful to}} guide the surgical removal of bone-invasive en plaque meningiomas. Preoperative and postoperative scintigraphy may be useful for the management and follow-up of patients with these tumors...|$|R

The immunohistochemical technique to estrogen receptors was negative in all <b>meningiomas</b> <b>studied.</b> Progesterone receptors were detected in 58. 3 % of typical, and in 48. 2 % of non-typical meningiomas. This difference was not statistically significant. However, individually considering the criteria used for selection of non-typical tumours, those that concurrently displayed brain invasion and increased mitotic activity or necrosis, as well as the summation of those three features, were predominantly negative for progesterone receptors (respectively p= 0. 038; p= 0. 001; and p= 0. 044).

The 181 <b>meningiomas</b> <b>studied</b> included 173 classic (41 meningotheliomatous, 27 fibroblastic, 82 transitional, nine psammomatous, eight angiomatous and six hemangioblastic tumors) and eight malignant meningiomas (three hemangiopericytomas and five tumors that we labeled HFM, that is, tumors exhibiting evidence of histological features of malignancy). The results reveal a strong relationship between incomplete surgical resection and recurrence {{on the one hand and}} between the probability of recurrence and histopathological type on the other. Whereas neither nuclear area nor nuclear DNA content assessments were helpful in distinguishing the six classic and the two malignant meningioma subgroups, a statistically significant increase in proliferative activity was observed in the malignant meningiomas as compared with classic ones, excepting hemangioblastomas that proliferate at the same rate as the malignant meningiomas. Furthermore, the multiple meningiomas definitely proliferated more actively than the single ones, but a similar proliferative activity was observed in the nonrecurrent and recurrent meningiomas. Proliferation analyses might be therefore helpful for determining aggressive meningiomas and for planning adjuvant therapy in these cases. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

There was no consistent pattern of elevated odds ratios for glioma, meningioma, or acoustic neuroma with use or prolonged use of permanent, semipermanent, temporary, or gradual hair dyes. Although use of permanent brown hair dye for 20 or more years was associated with glioma among women, the estimate was imprecise (odds ratio 3. 8, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 2, 12. 5) and was based on just 13 exposed cases; thus, {{this could be a}} chance finding.

40|$|Meningiomas are {{the second}} most common type of brain and CNS tumors by histology. Surgery and {{radiotherapy}} are main treatment options, but meningiomas may be impossible to adequately resect or may regrow after surgery. In spite of many experimental attempts, there is no generally accepted chemotherapeutic approach. We have studied in a series of meningiomas the expression of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), which apart from its major role as a key factor of the innate immune system, is believed {{to play a role in}} tumorigenesis. All <b>meningiomas</b> <b>studied</b> expressed TLR 4 mRNA and protein at variable degree. Paclitaxel, a ligand of TLR 4, exhibited a dose- and time-dependent growth suppression in both monolayer and spheroid meningioma cell cultures. The knockdown of TLR 4 with siRNA in meningioma cell cultures abrogated the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel. The suppressive action of paclitaxel on meningioma cell growth was enhanced in the presence of fluvastatin or the mitogen-actvated protein kinase (ERK 1 / 2) inhibitor PD 98059. At least part of the growth suppressive effect was mediated by the induction of apoptosis in meningioma cells by paclitaxel alone or in combination with fluvastatin. In conclusion, our in vitro results suggest that paclitaxel alone or in combination with other inhibitors of cell growth (statins, MAPK inhibitors) could provide a potential tool for the treatment of TLR 4 expressing meningiomas.

40|$|Abstract. Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) is a {{regulator}} of angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and vascular permeability. Recent reports suggest that VEGF {{may play a}} critical role in formation of peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) associated with meningiomas. While VEGF expression has been shown in <b>meningiomas,</b> <b>studies</b> have not focused on VEGF in the adjacent peritumoral brain regions. The present study examined the protein and gene expression of VEGF in human meningiomas and peritumoral brain areas. Biopsies were obtained from 37 patients. Immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting were performed to detect the expression of VEGF protein. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze the presence and quantity of VEGF mRNA. The extent of PTBE was estimated as an edema index (EI) based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. In meningiomas, western blot and RT-PCR results were congruent and the expression of both protein and mRNA had a significant correlation with EI. However, in peritumoral areas, western blot results were not consistent with the RT-PCR results. Protein results showed high correlation with EI, but mRNA was almost undetectable. In VEGF-positive cases, a decreasing gradient of VEGF protein expression was observed with increasing distance from tumors. These data suggest that peritumoral tissue does not produce VEGF and that VEGF protein levels in peritumoral tissues have a high correlation with EI. We conclude that VEGF macromolecules are secreted by the tumor tissue and enter peritumoral normal brain tissue to induce edema...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The widely {{accepted}} MR method for quantitating brain tumor micro-vascular permeability, Ktrans, is the steady-state T 1 -weighted gradient-echo method (ssT 1). Recently the first-pass T 2 *-weighted (fpT 2 *) method {{has been used}} to derive both relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and Ktrans. We hypothesized that Ktrans derived from the ssT 1 and the fpT 2 * methods will correlate differently in gliomas and meningiomas because of the unique differences in morphologic and functional status of each tumor vascular network. METHODS: Before surgery, 27 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas (WHO grade I–IV; <b>n</b> 20) or <b>meningiomas</b> (<b>n</b> 7) underwent conventional anatomic MR imaging and 12 dynamic ssT 1 acquisitions followed by 60 dynamic fpT 2 * images before and after gadopentate dimeglumine administration.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{implement}} a unique low-field open magnetic resonance scanner for perioperative imaging in neurosurgery. A paradigm was created for joint intraoperative/interventional MRI, including premises, surgical practice and an operational model. The feasibility of the paradigm was tested in clinical work. The joint use of the facilities between the Departments of Neurosurgery and Diagnostic Radiology was found to enhance the economic rationale and provide for perioperative imaging. It was also found to be organizationally viable in the long run. Intraoperative MRI was implemented and studied in connection with neuronavigation and other intraoperative instruments, tools and imaging modalities. The unique shut down possibility of the magnet enabled staged operating-imaging practice, use of non-MRI-compatible instruments and devices, multimodal imaging with navigation, and avoidance of safety risks associated with operating in magnetic fringe fields. Two dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging sequences, which used undersampled projection reconstruction, were implemented in the low-field scanner. The applicability of these imaging sequences to follow contrast enhancement of <b>meningiomas</b> was <b>studied</b> in laboratory experiments and in two patient cases. The laboratory experiments showed a nearly linear response in signal intensity to the concentration of gadopentetate dimeglumine in purified water up to 1. 25 mM. The patient cases showed results consistent with an earlier study performed at high-field strength. The potential of low-field MRI study including dynamic contrast enhanced imaging to predict surgical and histopathologic characteristics of <b>meningiomas</b> was <b>studied</b> in a series of 21 patients. Dynamic contrast enhanced imaging could be used to evaluate microvessel densities of meningiomas.

40|$|Background: About 10 &#x 0025; of meningiomas behave aggressively and are graded {{atypical}} or malignant {{with important}} therapeutic and prognostic implications. Routine histological parameters are inconsistent {{in the assessment}} of their aggressive behavior. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} find a threshold level of the MIB- 1 labeling index (MIB- 1 LI) with the highest diagnostic validity in predicting histological atypia in a meningioma. Setting and Design: This was a retrospective study of all atypical and malignant meningiomas diagnosed at our center between January 1995 and June 2000 and which were identified from the General Pathology Registry. Material and Methods: These meningiomas were assessed histologically with respect to the individual criteria of atypia. They were categorized according to the WHO 2000 classification as benign, atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, WHO Grades I, II and III respectively and by immunohistochemical analysis using the MIB- 1 monoclonal antibody. Statistical Analysis: The diagnostically useful cut-off level for the prediction of atypia was estimated by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the MIB- 1 LI at various levels and a receiver operated characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. The correlation between the individual histological parameters was studied and the MIB- 1 LI was obtained using Fisher&#x 0027;s exact test. Results: Of the 40 <b>meningiomas</b> <b>studied</b> 21 were benign, 16 atypical and 3 anaplastic. Atypical tumors had a higher MIB- 1 LI than benign tumors, with diagnostic validity highest at a threshold of 7 &#x 0025;, with a sensitivity of 0. 86 and a specificity of 0. 93, giving a likelihood ratio of 17. The MIB- 1 LI correlated well with mitotic activity and the other individual criteria in the WHO 2000 definition of atypia in a meningioma. MIB- 1 LI did not, however, correlate well with brain invasion. Conclusion: The MIB- 1 LI has the highest validity in the diagnosis of atypia in meningiomas at a threshold level of 7 &#x 0025;. The MIB- 1 LI used in conjunction with histological features can help in making a recommendation regarding potentially aggressive behavior in meningiomas...|$|R

Background: The role of {{exogenous}} hormone exposures {{in the development}} of meningioma is unclear, but these exposures have been proposed as one hypothesis to explain the over-abundance of such tumors in women. Methods: The association between oral contraception (OC) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and intracranial meningioma in women was investigated using a population-based, matched case-control study. Exposures for 143 cases and 286 controls matched on age within five years were obtained by interview. Diagnoses were confirmed histopathologically and estrogen and progesterone receptor assays conducted. Results: Although risk of meningioma appeared modestly elevated in past OC users (OR = 1. 5, 95 % CI 0. 8 - 2. 7), and in current users (OR = 2. 5, 95 % CI 0. 5 - 12. 6), the confidence intervals were wide. No significant association between meningioma risk and duration of OC use was found. Likewise, risk of meningioma was only weakly associated with past use of HRT (OR = 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 1. 3), and not at all with current use of HRT (OR = 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 5 - 2. 2). Of 142 available specimens, 2 (1 %) expressed estrogen receptors, whereas 130 (92 %) expressed progesterone receptors (PR). OC use was associated with increased risk of a meningioma expressing less rather than more PR (OR = 3. 2, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 8. 0).

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to objectively compare the {{application}} of several techniques {{and the use of}} several input features for brain tumour classification using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Short echo time H- 1 MRS signals from patients with glioblastomas (<b>n</b> = 87), <b>meningiomas</b> (<b>n</b> = 57), metastases (n = 39), and astrocytomas grade 11 (n = 22) were provided by six centres in the European Union funded INTERPRET project. Linear discriminant analysis, least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) with a linear kernel and LS-SVM with radial basis function kernel were applied and evaluated over 100 stratified random splittings of the dataset into training and test sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure the performance of binary classifiers, while the percentage of correct classifications was used to evaluate the multiclass classifiers. The influence of several factors on the classification performance has been tested: L 2 - vs. water normalization, magnitude vs. real spectra and baseline correction. The effect of input feature reduction was also investigated by using only the selected frequency regions containing the most discriminatory information, and peak integrated values. Using L 2 -normalized complete spectra the automated binary classifiers reached a mean test AUC of more than 0. 95, except for glioblastomas vs. metastases. Similar results were obtained for all classification techniques and input features except for water normalized spectra, where classification performance was lower. This indicates that data acquisition and processing can be simplified for classification purposes, excluding the need for separate water signal acquisition, baseline correction or phasing.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present the}} {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging findings of 78 patients with meningiomas diagnosed {{in a single}} institution. METHOD: 78 patients with histological proven intracranial <b>meningioma</b> were <b>studied.</b> There were 52 female and 26 male patients (median= 56 years). All MR imaging examinations were performed with 1. 5 -T MR imaging unit with standard protocol. The images were <b>studied</b> <b>by</b> two neuroradiologists, who reached the decisions regarding the findings by consensus. RESULTS: Most of the tumors showed low signal on T 1 - (60 %) and high signl on T 2 - (68 %) and FLAIR (69 %) weighted images. Also, the lesions showed heterogeneous signal on T 1 (60 %), T 2 (68 %) and FLAIR (64 %) sequences. After contrast administration, 83 % (n= 65) of the tumors presented acentuated and 17 % (n= 13) showed moderate enhancement. The tumors were located in the frontal lobe in 44 % of the cases, in the parietal lobe in 35 %, the occipital lobe in 19 % and the temporal lobe in 12 % of the patients. Areas of vasogenic edema around the tumors were seen in 90 % of the cases. Twenty six per cent of the cases showed bone infiltration, and the dural tail sign was seen in 59 % of the tumors. CONCLUSION: Intracranial meningiomas usually show heterogeneous low signal on T 1 - and high signal on T 2 -weighted and FLAIR images, with intense enhancement after contrast administration. The frontal and parietal lobes are commonly affected. In addition, brain edema, dural tail sign and bone infiltration are the most frequent associated findings...|$|R

The only well-established environmental risk factor for meningioma and glioma is ionizing radiation. Evidence for inherited predisposition to meningioma and glioma is provided by a number of rare inherited syndromes where collectively these diseases account for only a small proportion of the twofold increased risk of brain tumors seen in first-degree relatives for meningioma and glioma patients. It is very possible that much of the excess familial risk is a consequence of co-inheritance of multiple low-risk genetic variations. With this in mind, the aims of the studies in this thesis were to discover genetic risk variants influencing the probability of acquiring the disease and to identify the association between risk variants on the tumor phenotype. To identify genetic variants influencing meningioma risk, a comprehensive tagging of the selected genes in a case-control study was performed. We identified nine risk variants in EGF, ERBB 2, and LRIG 2 genes. However, these findings could not be confirmed in another larger independent dataset. In addition, the study identified a correlation between LRIG 2 protein expression and ER status when analyzed with different parameters. In a separate study with a larger sample of meningioma patients, the same correlation between LRIG 2 and ER status was observed. To explore the potential association between reported germline risk variants and somatic genetic events, matched tumor and blood samples from glioma patients were analyzed by SNP array. The results identified correlations between EGFR gene variants and somatic aberrations within the EGFR locus and CDKN 2 A/B locus. To further study the relationship between germline risk variants and tumor phenotype, the same patient material was used and analyzed by three different techniques: SNP array, IHC, and FISH. The results revealed EGFR risk variants effecting copy number variation of the EGFR gene and the expression of the IDH 1 and p 53. Further comparison between different techniques such as SNP array and FISH analysis revealed the difficulty in achieving consistent results with different techniques. To summarize, the glioma studies show a link between genotype and phenotype where genetic risk variants in the EGFR gene were found to be associated with specific somatic aberrations. These associations are biologically interesting because EGFR is involved in multiple cellular processes. Additional studies of the direct functional role of these observations need to be conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the identified association between germline gene variants and somatic aberrations. For the <b>meningioma</b> <b>studies,</b> no significant risk variants influencing the disease were found but a correlation between LRIG 2 and ER status was observed. This result suggests a potential role for the LRIG protein in the pathogenesis of <b>meningioma,</b> but more <b>studies</b> are needed to confirm this hypothesizes.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the visual findings as primary manifestations {{in patients with}} intracranial tumors. METHODS: The medical charts of the patients with intracranial tumors who initially admitted to the Neuro-ophthalmology and Strabismus Department with ocular complaints between August 1999 and December 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. The detailed clinical history and the findings of neuro-ophthalmologic examination were recorded. Ocular symptoms and signs, the types and locations of intracranial tumors, and the duration of symptoms before the diagnosis were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of 11 women (61. 1 %) and 7 men (38. 9 %) was 42. 2 ± 11. 0 (range 20 - 66 y) {{at the time of}} intracranial tumor diagnosis. Initial symptoms were transient visual obscurations, visual loss or visual field defect in 16 cases (88. 9 %), and diplopia in 2 cases (11. 1 %). Neuro-ophthalmologic examination revealed normal optic discs in both eyes of 6 patients (33. 3 %), paleness, atrophy or edema of optic disc in 12 patients (66. 7 %), and sixth cranial nerve palsy in 2 patients (11. 1 %). Visual acuity ranged between normal vision and loss of light perception. Cranial imaging demonstrated craniopharyngioma (n = 1), plasmacytoma (<b>n</b> = 1), <b>meningioma</b> (<b>n</b> = 6; olfactory groove and tuberculum sellae, pontocerebellar angle, anterior cranial fossa, frontal vertex, suprasellar region), and pituitary macroadenoma (n = 10). The mean duration between the onset of visual disturbances and the diagnosis of intracranial tumor was 9. 8 ± 18 mo (range 3 d- 6 y). CONCLUSION: The ophthalmologist is frequently the first physician to encounter a patient with clinical manifestations of intracranial tumors that may cause neurological and ocular complications. Neuro-ophthalmologic findings should be carefully evaluated to avoid a delay in the diagnosis of intracranial tumors...|$|R
40|$|Genes {{involved}} in phase I and phase II regulation of aromatic hydrocarbon–induced effects exhibit sequence variability that may mediate {{the risk of}} adult brain tumors. We evaluated associations between gene variants in CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 B 1, GSTM 3, EPHX 1, and NQO 1 and adult brain tumor incidence. Cases were patients with glioma (<b>n</b> = 489), <b>meningioma</b> (<b>n</b> = 197), or acoustic neuroma (n = 96) diagnosed from 1994 to 1998 at three U. S. hospitals. Controls were 799 patients admitted to the same hospitals for nonmalignant conditions. DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 1277 subjects, and genotyping was conducted for CYP 1 A 1 I 462 V, CYP 1 B 1 V 432 L, EPHX 1 Y 113 H, GSTM 3 *A/*B (intron 6 deletion), and NQO 1 P 187 S. The CYP 1 B 1 V 432 L homozygous variant was associated with decreased risk of meningioma (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 6; 95 % CI, 0. 3 – 1. 0) but not the other tumor types. The GSTM 3 *B/*B genotype was associated with increased risk of glioma (OR = 2. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 0 – 5. 2) and meningioma (OR = 3. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 3 – 9. 8). Increased risks associated with GSTM 3 *B/*B were observed in younger subjects (age < 50) and older subjects (age ⩾ 50), in men and women, and within each study site. The magnitude of association for GSTM 3 with glioma and meningioma was greater among ever-smokers than among those who had never smoked. None of the other genotypes showed consistent associations with any tumor type. The association with the GSTM 3 *B allele, while intriguing, requires replication, and {{additional research is needed}} to clarify the function of the GSTM 3 alleles studied here...|$|R
