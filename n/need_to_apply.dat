A prime target habitat envisaged to be enhanced and re-created under the Habitat Enhancement Plan is upland blanket bog and important habitats for skylarks and wading birds on the moorland fringe. To receive funding, landowners within an identified area will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> to a panel made up of representatives from Peel, the local authorities and independent ecological experts. This panel will meet regularly throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|In October 1776, {{at the age}} of 17, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge. The {{deaths of}} his {{grandfather}} and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> himself to serious study. Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful. Witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, Wilberforce was a popular figure. He made many friends including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt. Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788.|$|E

25|$|However, some third-country {{nationals}} {{are permitted}} {{to stay in the}} Schengen Area for more than 90 days without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for a long-stay visa. For example, France does not require citizens of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City to apply for a long-stay visa. In addition, Article 20(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement allows for this 'in exceptional circumstances' and for bilateral agreements concluded by individual signatory states with other countries before the Convention entered into force to remain applicable. As a result, for example, New Zealand citizens {{are permitted to}} stay for up to 90 days in each of the Schengen countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) which had already concluded bilateral visa exemption agreements with the New Zealand Government prior to the Convention entering into force without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for long-stay visas, but if travelling to other Schengen countries the 90 days in a 180-day period time limit applies.|$|E
