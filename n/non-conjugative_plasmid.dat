40|$|SUMMARY. Aminoglycoside-resistance {{determinants}} in staphylococci are borne on conjugative and non-conjugative plasmids. The conjuga-tive plasmids {{were found}} in methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylo-coccus aureus isolated recently in Darwin and Sydney, Australia and in Houston, Texas, USA. These plasmids and the class- 2 conjugative plasmid reported by Archer and Johnston (1 983) had similar patterns of EcoR 1 restriction-endonuclease fragments, encoded resistance to genta-micin, kanamycin and neomycin, transferred to a non-lysogenic recipient in conditions that promoted close cell-to-cell contact and mobilised a small, <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid.</b> A further plasmid, pWG 14, encoding resistance to kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, erythromy-cin and lincomycin, also displayed conjugative properties but did not mobilise the small, <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid.</b> The transfer frequency of all conjugative plasmids was stimulated {{by the addition of}} polyethylene glycol, particularly at concentrations above 20 %, to mixtures of donor and recipient broth cultures. Polyethylene glycol appeared to promote close cell-to-cell contact between donor and recipient cells. A represen-tative of the most common aminoglycoside-resistance plasmids in Australian isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was non-conjuga-tive and transferred by a bacteriophage-mediated system to a lysogenic recipient. With the exception of plasmid pWG 14, the conjugative plasmids were also transferred by a bacteriophage-mediated system. Furthermore, cultural conditions that favoured conjugative transfer of plasmids inhibited bacteriophage-mediated transfer and vice versa. The efficacy of the two transfer systems for analysing the plasmids of gentamicin-resistant, methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus has been compared...|$|E

Conjugative transposons, designated Tn 5031, Tn 5032 and Tn 5033, were present in the chromosome of three isolates. The transposons were similar both structurally and functionally to Tn 916 containing the tetM determinant. A large <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid</b> found in a fourth isolate contained an element homologous to Tn 916. The four isolates containing the element showing homology to Tn 916 exhibited a substantially higher level of Tc resistance than the remaining five Tc-resistant isolates.

50|$|Plasmids may be {{classified}} {{in a number}} of ways. Plasmids can be broadly classified into conjugative <b>plasmids</b> and <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Conjugative plasmids contain a set of transfer or tra genes which promote sexual conjugation between different cells. In the complex process of conjugation, plasmid may be transferred from one bacterium to another via sex pili encoded by some of the tra genes (see figure). <b>Non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids</b> are incapable of initiating conjugation, hence they can be transferred only with the assistance of conjugative plasmids. An intermediate class of plasmids are mobilizable, and carry only a subset of the genes required for transfer. They can parasitize a conjugative plasmid, transferring at high frequency only in its presence.|$|R

The {{ability of}} Staphylococcus aureus conjugative <b>plasmids</b> to {{mobilise}} <b>non-conjugative</b> resistance <b>plasmids</b> from clinical isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was studied. Plasmids {{which could not}} be transferred by transduction or mixed-culture transfer were transferred from phage-typable and non-typable S. aureus and from S. epidermidis. Plasmids encoding single resistance determinants were transferred by mobilisation whereas multiple-resistance plasmids were transferred as co-integrates between the conjugative and <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids.</b> This study demonstrates that mobilisation is a useful tool for the transfer and study of staphylococcal plasmids and illustrates how antibiotic resistance could be transferred between staphylococci in uiuo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, we {{discovered}} a novel phenomenon, “cell-to-cell transformation” by which <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids</b> are transmitted horizontally in co-cultures of Escherichia coli F− strains. In this study, we aimed {{to identify the}} DNA element responsible for the high cell-to-cell transformability of pHSG 299. By transplanting pHSG 299 DNA fragments into pHSG 399, a plasmid showing low transformability, {{we discovered}} that a specific 88 bp fragment of pHSG 299 significantly promoted pHSG 399 transformability. Although several short motif-like repetitive sequences (6 – 10 bp) {{were present in the}} 88 bp sequence, no known DNA motifs were recognized, suggesting that this 88 bp sequence (cell-to-cell transformation promoting sequence, CTPS; Accession number: AB 634455) is a novel DNA element...|$|R
40|$|The results {{presented}} in this paper confirm the existence of two types of tetracycline resistance in Shigella sonnei. One group of strains had a high level of resistance to tetracycline and oxytetracyline, with a variable level of minocycline resistance. The second group had a lower level of tetracycline resistance and were sensitive to minocycline. After conjugation with E. coli K 12 the selected E. coli transconjugants had the same levels of resistance as the parent Sh. sonnei strain, with one exception. Sh. sonnei 87 was resistant to a high level of tetracycline, but was able to transfer only low level resistance. It is suggested that Sh. sonnei 87 carriers two plasmids: pSU 1, a conjugative plasmid conferring a low level of tetracycline resistance, and pSU 2, a <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid</b> which confers a high level of resistance to tetracycline...|$|E
40|$|Twelve Salmonella ser. Enteritidis strains {{phage type}} 4 {{isolated}} in Italy from different food-borne outbreaks were characterized for {{the expression of}} different virulence traits, for antibiotic resistance, and for plasmid DNA profile. All the twelve S. Enteritidis strains were able to invade and multiply within HeLa cell monolayers, even if at a lower efficiency if compared to an invasive Shigella flexneri strain. The strains were not hemolytic and produced only a moderate-level cytotoxic effect on HeLa cell monolayers. Moreover, all the strains examined produced mannose-sensitive hemagglutination with chicken erythrocytes but were not able to adhere to tissue culture cells. The strains did not produce the hydroxamate-type siderophore aerobactin or the specific ferric-aerobactin receptor. The S. Enteritidis strains were resistant only to spectinomycin, and eleven strains harbored a 38 MDa <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid,</b> while one strain harbored a 64 MDa conjugative plasmid which carried a colicinogenic activity-encoding locus.

40|$|The {{entire region}} {{required}} for mobilization of the <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid</b> RSF 1010 has been cloned into a mobilization-deficient pBR 322 derivative. The segment of DNA cloned was ∼ 1. 8 kb and included {{the origin of}} conjugal DNA transfer (oriT). The DNA sequence of the mobilization region has been determined, and revealed the presence of several overlapping reading frames. The isolation and mapping of both Tn 1725 and BamH 1 -linker insertions and comparison with the DNA sequence data has allowed the identification of three genes required for mobilization. Two of these genes are overlapping and encode proteins of 16 kDa and > 65 kDa (although the truncated protein is functional, the gene extends outside the region cloned). The third gene is transcribed in the opposite direction. Promoters capable of transcribing these genes were located by S 1 mapping in the inter-cistronic region between these divergently transcribed genes. The oriT site is located in this region, and the transcriptional patterns observed for mob + and mob - plasmids implied that the promoters may be regulated {{by two of the}} mobilization proteins binding to the oriT site. © 1987 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Staphylococcus aureus isolate WBG 1003 {{resistant}} to benzyl penicillin, cadmium, arsenate and streptomycin harbours two plasmids of 38. 8 (pWBG 621) and 4 - 4 (pWBG 625) kb. In conjugation experiments {{two types of}} streptomycin-resistant transconjugants were obtained; one carried a 4. 4 -kb plasmid and the other, a 34. 5 -kb and a 4. 4 -kb plasmid.

Restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA-DNA hybridisation have revealed that pWBG 620 is unrelated to pWBG 621 present in strain WBG 1003.

With {{the exception of the}} human isolate of R-type ASSuTTm, all strains carried two <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids,</b> one coding for SSu and belonging to incompatibility group Q, and a second coding for multiple resistance and belonging to the FIme incompatibility group. The human isolate of R-type ASSuTTm did not carry the IncQ SSu plasmid but like the poultry isolates, carried a <b>non-conjugative</b> FIme <b>plasmid.</b> Restriction endonuclease digestion with the enzymes EcoR I, Pst I and Hind III demonstrated that the FIme plasmids from strains of different R-types showed a high degree of homology but exhibited numerous fragment size polymorphisms. The restriction digest fingerprint of plasmids in the human isolate of R-type ACGKSSuTTm was indistinguishable from a poultry isolate of the same R-type. Analysis of segregants of one of the poultry isolates of R-type ACGKSSuTTm demonstrated that resistance determinants could be rapidly lost from the FIme plasmid to give rise to a number of R-types and fingerprint patterns. Loss of tetracycline resistance from this plasmid appeared to be correlated with the integration of other plasmid-mediated resistances into the bacterial chromosome. Evidence is presented for the rapid loss of antimicrobial resistance determinants from a multiple resistance plasmid of the FIme incompatibility group in response to withdrawal of antibiotic selective pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{repression}} of competition by mechanisms of policing is now {{recognized as a}} major force in the maintenance of cooperation. General models on the evolution of policing have focused on the interplay between individual competitiveness and mutual policing, demonstrating a positive relationship between within-group diversity and levels of policing. We expand this perspective by investigating what is possibly the simplest example of reproductive policing: copy number control (CNC) among <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids,</b> a class of extra-chromosomal vertically transmitted molecular symbionts of bacteria. Through the formulation and analysis of a multi-scale dynamical model, we show that the establishment of stable reproductive restraint among plasmids requires the co-evolution of two fundamental plasmid traits: policing, through the production of plasmid-coded trans-acting replication inhibitors, and obedience, expressed as the binding affinity of plasmid-specific targets to those inhibitors. We explain the intrinsic replication instabilities that arise in the absence of policing and we show how these instabilities are resolved by the evolution of copy number control. Increasing levels of policing and obedience lead to improvements in group performance due to tighter control of local population size (plasmid copy number), delivering benefits both to plasmids, by reducing the risk of segregational loss and to the plasmid-host partnership, by increasing the rate of cell reproduction, and therefore plasmid vertical transmission...|$|R
40|$|Streptomycin is the {{industry}} standard for managing fire blight on apples and pears. In 2002, streptomycin-resistance was confirmed in Wayne County and eradicated through prompt action. In October 2011, streptomycin-resistance was confirmed in four apple blocks in Wayne and Ontario Counties. We conducted a statewide survey in 2012 to locate and characterize any additional resistant bacterial populations. A total of 174 samples were collected. Erwinia amylovora was isolated from 129 of these and 15 of these isolates were resistant to streptomycin (11. 6 %). Preliminary phylogenetic results show that all streptomycin-resistant isolates carry the streptomycin resistance genes, strA and strB, on transposon Tn 5393 which resides on the <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid,</b> pEa 29, meaning that the isolates had to be spread physically. The survey found seven new locations in which resistant bacteria are present in Wayne, Ontario, Monroe, Orleans, and Niagara counties. These counties are now considered 'High Risk Areas' for streptomycin-resistant fire blight in 2013.

40|$|Salmonella typhimurium, {{resistant}} only to trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole, {{was isolated}} from the faeces and blood of a chronic alcoholic patient in acute renal failure. The isolates harboured an 18 Md <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid.</b> He was dia-lysed peritoneally and treated with ampicillin; four days later there was no clinical improvement and his peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) had become infected. Salm. typhimurium was isolated from faeces and PDF. Both isolates were additionally resistant to ampicillin and contained two plasmids (55 Md and 18 Md). Therapy was changed to chloramphenicol and gentamicin {{was added to the}} PDF. Two weeks later Salm. typhimurium was again isolated from PDF and faeces. The PDF isolate was unchanged but 4 % of the colonies isolated from this faecal specimen were resistant to chloramphenicol and had acquired an additional 62 Md plasmid. From all PDF and faecal specimens two different strains of Escherichia coli and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated which contained plasmids indistinguishable, on the basis of molecular weight and transferable resistance markers, from those acquired by Salm. typhimurium.

40|$|Two large {{tetracycline}} resistance (TcR) plasmids {{have been}} completely sequenced, the pTet plasmid (45 ? 2 kb) from Campylobacter jejuni strain 81 - 176 and a plasmid pCC 31 (44 ? 7 kb) from Campylobacter coli strain CC 31 that was isolated from a human case of severe gastroenteritis in the UK. Both plasmids are mosaic in structure, having homologues of genes found {{in a variety of}} different commensal and pathogenic bacteria, but nevertheless, showed striking similarities in DNA sequence and overall gene organization. Several predicted proteins encoded by genes involved in conjugation showed highest homology to proteins found in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a periodontal pathogen. In addition to replication- and conjugation-associated genes, both plasmids carried a tet(O) gene encoding tetracycline resistance, a 6 kb ORF encoding a putative methylase and a number of genes of unknown function. The pTet plasmid co-exists in C. jejuni strain 81 - 176 with a smaller, previously characterized, <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid</b> pVir that also encodes a type IV secretion system (T 4 SS) that may affect virulence.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) - mediated hospital infections in China prompted {{a need to}} investigate the genetic basis of emergence of such strains. A nationwide survey was conducted in China covering a total of 1105 CRE strains collected from 25 geographical locales with results showing that acquisition of two carbapenemase genes, blaKPC- 2 and blaNDM, was responsible for phenotypic resistance in 90 % of the CRE strains tested (58 % and 32 % respectively), among which several major strain types, such as ST 11 of K. pneumoniae and ST 131 /ST 167 of E. coli, were identified, suggesting that dissemination of specific resistant clones is mainly responsible for emergence of new CRE strains. Prevalence of the fosA 3 gene which mediates fosfomycin resistance, was high, while the colistin resistance determinant mcr- 1 was rarely present in these isolates. Consistently, {{the majority of the}} blaNDM-bearing plasmids recoverable from the test strains belonged to IncX 3, which contained a common core structure, blaNDM-blaMBL-trpF. Likewise, the core structure of ISKpn 27 -blaKPC- 2 -ISKpn 2 was observed among plasmids harboring the blaKPC- 2 gene, although they were genetically more divergent. In conclusion, the increasing prevalence of CRE strains in China is attributed to dissemination of conservative mobile elements carrying blaNDM or blaKPC- 2 on conjugative and <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} a putative novel macrolide efflux gene located in the vicinity of sul 3 in porcine Escherichia coli. Methods: Five sul 3 -encoding E. coli isolates of porcine origin were investigated by plasmid character-ization and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR. Unknown DNA adjacent to the sul 3 genes was amplified using a PCR approach, followed by sequencing of the fragments. The putative macrolide efflux gene was cloned into pK 18. The cloned gene was characterized by susceptibility testing by Etest in the presence and absence of efflux inhibitors. Results: Five sul 3 -encoding isolates, demonstrated to be unrelated by RAPD PCR, were characterized. The immediate genetic context of sul 3 in five isolates was identical to that in plasmid pVP 440, and in all cases, sul 3 was associated with class 1 integrons. In three isolates, an open reading frame (orf 2) encoding a putative protein with 38 % amino acid identity to Mef(A) was found, while the two remaining isolates contained a fragment of orf 2 truncated by IS 26 insertion. In three of the isolates, this DNA region was demonstrated to be located on <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids.</b> When the complete orf 2 was cloned, it conferred high-level resistance to erythromycin and azithromycin, and the resistance prop-erty could be partially inhibited using the efflux inhibitor Phe-Arg b-naphthylamide dihydrochloride. The gene was named mef(B).

40|$|Fifty three Staphylococcus aureus {{isolates}} {{were obtained}} from three centres, two hospitals and a private pathology laboratory, and studied for susceptibility to bacteriophages, resistance to antimicrobial agents and plasmid contents. Results of bacteriophage typing revealed that they belonged {{to a variety of}} phage types. Eighteen were untypable by any of the International Set of Phages, 16 belonged to phage group 111, nine to group I, four to group 11, two to group IV and two to the miscellaneous group. The isolates were resistant to one or more of methicillin (Mc), benzyl penicillin (Pc), gentamicin (Gm), kanamycin (Km), neomycin (Nm), streptomycin (Sm), trimethoprim (Tp), sulphonamides (Su), tetracycline (Tc), minocycline (Mn), chloramphenicol (Cm), novobiocin (Nb) and fusidic acid (Fa). Resistance to Pc was due to the production of beta-lactamase (Bla). No resistance to vancomycin, spectinomycin and erythromycin was detected. Resistance was also found to heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), phenyl mercuric acetate (Pma), arsenate (Asa) and to the nucleic-acid binding compounds propamidine isethionate (Pi) and ethidium bromide (Eb). All but one of the isolates harboured plasmids. The number of plasmids the isolates carried varied from one to six and their sizes ranged from < 1. 0 kb to c. 48 kb. Location of the resistance determinants was ascertained by curing and transfer experiments. Loss of resistance was tested after growth at 43. 5 °C and transfer of resistance determinants was attempted by transduction, mixed-culture transfer and conjugation. The results revealed that resistance to Mc, Gm, Tp, Mn and Fa was chromosomal in all the resistant isolates and in some isolates Bla and resistance to Sm and Cd were chromosomal as well as plasmid encoded. In the majority of cases Bla and resistance to Km, Nm, Sm, Tc, Cin, Cd, Hg, Asa, Pma, Pi and Eb was encoded ++by plasmids. Conjugation experiments led to the isolation of three unique conjugative plasmids which have not been found to confer resistance to antimicrobials or to produce haemolysins or diffusible pigment (Dip). The three plasmids, pWBG 620, pWBG 637 and pWBG 661, were indistinguishable by restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA-DNA hybridisation. However pWBG 620, unlike pWBG 637 and pWBG 661, was not detected in the cytoplasm of its host and was only detected in transconjugants after it mobilised a <b>non-conjugative</b> Sm-resistance (SmR) <b>plasmid.</b> Further analysis indicated that it is integrated into the chromosome of its host, excises during conjugation and mobilises the SmR plasmid. These plasmids were studied further using pWBG 637 as a representative. It was compared with representatives of the two groups of conjugative plasmids which {{have been reported in the}} staphylococci. These are the plasmids which encode resistance to Gm, Km and Nm and those which code for the production of diffusible pigment. The three types of conjugative plasmids were compared by restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA- DNA hybridisation and were found to be different. A preliminary restriction map of pWBG 637 has also been constructed. However since pWBG 637 has no resistance phenotype direct selection for it was not possible in transfer experiments and for incompatibility (Inc.). To study it further it was necessary to construct resistant derivatives which could be selected for in transfer experiments. This was achieved by labelling pWBG 637 with resistance transposons to generate two conjugative plasmids, pWBG 636 carrying an insert of Tn 3851 (Gm- resistance) and pWBG 642 carrying an insert of Tn 551 (hn- resistance). It was found that transposon labelling had not changed the incompatibility of pWBG 637 and therefore pWBG 636 and pWBG 642 were used in further experiments in place of pWBG 637. Inc. ++tests with the pWBG 637 derivatives revealed that the pWBG 637 type of plasmid is not only different from the other two types of conjugative plasmids but is different from any of the described staphylococcal Inc. groups and therefore the pWBG 637 type of plasmids represent a new Inc. group 15. The pWBG 637 type of plasmids were studied further using plasmids pWBG 636 and pWBG 642. They were able to transfer conjugatively to a capsulated S. aureus strain either by the polyethylene glycol method or on filter membranes. They also transferred by conjugation to S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis and were able to transfer back from these strains to S. aureus indicating that they also replicate in these hosts. Consequently they have been used to mobilise <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids</b> from S. epidermidis and non phage typable S. aureus. Both plasmids failed to transfer conjugatively to Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. pWBG 637 transferred <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids</b> by mobilising them in a manner similar to mobilisation (donation) in E. coli or by recombining with them to form new resistance plasmids. In one case, pWBG 628 which encodes Bla and resistance to Cd, Km, Nm and Sm and has no homology with pWBG 637 recombined with it during conjugation to produce three new conjugative plasmids pWBG 629, pWBG 630 and pWBG 631 carrying resistance determinants from pWBG 628. One of these plasmids, pWBG 629, was found to be pWBG 637 which had acquired a 4. 5 kb element encoding resistance to Km, Nm and Sm. This element was shown to be transposable in both rec+ and rec- backgrounds and has been designated Tn 3854. It expressed Sm resistance in E. coli and differs on this account from the Gram-negative transposon Tn 5 which expresses resistance to Km, Nm and Sm in non-enteric bacteria but only resistance to Km and Nm in E. coli. Where possible the <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids</b> encoding resistance to ++antimicrobial agents were compared with phenotypically similar plasmids isolated from other parts of the world. It was found that the Tc and Sm resistance plasmids were closely related to other plasmids with the same phenotype whereas the Cm resistance plasmids were different. Although the majority of the Bla plasmids belonged to Inc. group 1 they demonstrated significant restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism when compared with other Bla plasmids. This study has provided the first data on the genetics of antimicrobial resistance in Nigerian S. aureus. Although many of the plasmids studied were found to be similar to those previously described the isolates also contained some unique and previously undescribed plasmids...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe High Pathogenicity Island of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP 32637 was {{previously}} {{shown to be}} horizontally transferable {{as part of a}} large chromosomal segment. We demonstrate here that at low temperature other chromosomal loci, as well as a non-mobilizable plasmid (pUC 4 K), are also transferable. This transfer, designated GDT 4 (Generalized DNA Transfer at 4 uC), required the presence of an IP 32637 endogenous plasmid (pGDT 4) that carries several mobile genetic elements and a conjugation machinery. We established that cure of this plasmid or inactivation of its sex pilus fully abrogates this process. Analysis of the mobilized pUC 4 K recovered from transconjugants revealed the insertion of one of the pGDT 4 -borne ISs, designated ISYps 1, at different sites on the transferred plasmid molecules. This IS belongs to the IS 6 family, which moves by replicative transposition, and thus could drive the formation of cointegrates between pGDT 4 and the host chromosome and could mediate the transfer of chromosomal regions in an Hfr-like manner. In support of this model, we show that a suicide plasmid carrying ISYps 1 is able to integrate itself, flanked by ISYps 1 copies, at multiple locations into the Escherichia coli chromosome. Furthermore, we demonstrate the formation of RecA-independent cointegrates between the ISYps 1 - harboring plasmid and an ISYps 1 -free replicon, leading to the passive transfer of the <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid.</b> We thus demonstrate here a natural mechanism of horizontal gene exchange, which is less constrained and more powerful than the classical Hfr mechanism, as it only requires the presence of an IS 6 -type element on a conjugative replicon to drive the horizontal transfer of any large block of plasmid or chromosomal DNA. This natural mechanism of chromosome transfer, which occurs under conditions mimicking those found in the environment, may thus {{play a significant role in}} bacterial evolution, pathogenesis, and adaptation to new ecological niches...|$|E
40|$|Tn 916 is a 18 kb, broad-host range conjugative {{transposon}} originally {{isolated from}} Enterococcus faecalis. Transposon TnphoA {{was used to}} identify genes in Tn 916 encoding for membrane-targeted proteins or for secretion. Sixty five independent PhoA+ gene fusions were isolated. These insertions clustered into two regions, open reading frames 13 and 15 (Flanagan et al., Plasmid 32 : 350 - 354). These TnphoA insertional mutations in resulted in a Tn+ (ability to transpose intracellularly) and Tra- (inability to transfer conjugatively) phenotype. The hydrophathy analysis of ORF 13 and ORF 15 revealed that these proteins lack the classical signal peptides necessary for protein export, suggesting that these two proteins might be exported out of the cytoplasm independent of the classical signal peptides. The absence of classical signal peptides from these two proteins suggested that ORF 13 and ORF 15 were to {{be located in the}} inner membrane of Escherichia coli; this observation was confirmed by TnphoA gene fusion studies. From the amino acid analysis of ORF 13 and ORF 15, the membrane topologies of these two proteins were predicted, with ORF 13 having one membrane spanning region and ORF 15 eight membrane spanning regions. Furthermore, TnphoA insertional mutagenesis in open reading frame (orf) 13 and orf 15 blocked the conjugal transfer of Tn 916 from B. subtilus into B. thuringiensis. Moreover, Tn 916 -dependent mobilization of <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid</b> pC 194 was also reduced by about 11 -fold and 680 -fold, respectively. The insertion of Tn 5 in the orf 2 l of Tn 916 was shown to reduce the transfer of Tn 916 by about 7000 -fold and the Tn 916 -mediated conjugal transfer of pC 194 by about 250 fold. Because the sequence analysis of orf 21 revealed that the putative ORF 21 has a strong homology with the SpoIIIE of the B. subtilus, the function of ORF 21 is proposed to be similar to the SpoIIIE. ORF 21 may play a crucial role as a DNA transport protein either within the cell or across the cell membrane during the conjugation...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli is not {{assumed to}} be {{naturally}} transformable. However, several recent reports have shown that E. coli can express modest genetic competence in certain conditions that may arise in its environment. We have shown previously that spontaneous lateral transfer of <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmids</b> occurs in a colony biofilm of mixed E. coli strains (a set of a donor strain harbouring a plasmid and a plasmid-free recipient strain). In this study, with high-frequency combinations of strains and a plasmid, we constructed the same lateral plasmid transfer system in liquid culture. Using this system, we demonstrated that this lateral plasmid transfer was DNase-sensitive, indicating {{that it is a}} kind of transformation in which DNase-accessible extracellular naked DNA is essential. However, this transformation did not occur with purified plasmid DNA and required a direct supply of plasmid from co-existing donor cells. Based on this feature, we have termed this transformation type as ‘cell-to-cell transformation’. Analyses using medium conditioned with the high-frequency strain revealed that this strain released a certain factor(s) that promoted cell-to-cell transformation and arrested growth of the other strains. This factor is heat-labile and protease-sensitive, and its roughly estimated molecular mass was between ∼ 9 kDa and ∼ 30 kDa, indicating that it is a polypeptide factor. Interestingly, this factor was effective even when the conditioned medium was diluted 10 – 5 – 10 – 6, suggesting that it acts like a pheromone with high bioactivity. Based on these results, we propose that cell-to-cell transformation is a novel natural transformation mechanism in E. coli that requires cell-derived DNA and is promoted by a peptide pheromone. This is the first evidence that suggests the existence of a peptide pheromone-regulated transformation mechanism in E. coli and in Gram-negative bacteria...|$|R

40|$|The High Pathogenicity Island of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP 32637 was {{previously}} {{shown to be}} horizontally transferable {{as part of a}} large chromosomal segment. We demonstrate here that at low temperature other chromosomal loci, as well as a non-mobilizable plasmid (pUC 4 K), are also transferable. This transfer, designated GDT 4 (Generalized DNA Transfer at 4 °C), required the presence of an IP 32637 endogenous plasmid (pGDT 4) that carries several mobile genetic elements and a conjugation machinery. We established that cure of this plasmid or inactivation of its sex pilus fully abrogates this process. Analysis of the mobilized pUC 4 K recovered from transconjugants revealed the insertion of one of the pGDT 4 -borne ISs, designated ISYps 1, at different sites on the transferred plasmid molecules. This IS belongs to the IS 6 family, which moves by replicative transposition, and thus could drive the formation of cointegrates between pGDT 4 and the host chromosome and could mediate the transfer of chromosomal regions in an Hfr-like manner. In support of this model, we show that a suicide plasmid carrying ISYps 1 is able to integrate itself, flanked by ISYps 1 copies, at multiple locations into the Escherichia coli chromosome. Furthermore, we demonstrate the formation of RecA-independent cointegrates between the ISYps 1 -harboring plasmid and an ISYps 1 -free replicon, leading to the passive transfer of the <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid.</b> We thus demonstrate here a natural mechanism of horizontal gene exchange, which is less constrained and more powerful than the classical Hfr mechanism, as it only requires the presence of an IS 6 -type element on a conjugative replicon to drive the horizontal transfer of any large block of plasmid or chromosomal DNA. This natural mechanism of chromosome transfer, which occurs under conditions mimicking those found in the environment, may thus {{play a significant role in}} bacterial evolution, pathogenesis, and adaptation to new ecological niches...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria {{belonging}} to the Gram-positive actinomycete species, Rhodococcus erythropolis, are diverse {{not only in terms}} of metabolic potentials but the plasmids they encode. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed three previously uncharacterized megaplasmids in the genome of Rhodococcus erythropolis AN 12. These megaplasmids, pREA 400, pREA 250 and pREA 100, migrate at approximately 400 kb, 250 kb and 100 kb, respectively. Genetic screening of an AN 12 transposon insertion library showed that two megaplasmids, pREA 400 and pREA 250, are conjugative. It is known for other bacterial systems that a relaxase encoded by the traA gene is required to initiate DNA transfer during plasmid conjugation. Sequences adjacent to the transposon insertion in megaplasmid pREA 400 revealed a putative traA-like open reading frame. A novel site-specific gene disruption method was developed to generate a traA mutation in AN 12, which allowed us to address the role of the traA gene for Rhodococcus megaplasmid conjugation. We found that the AN 12 traA mutant is no longer capable of transferring the pREA 400 megaplasmid to Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ 1. It was shown previously that the R. erythropolis AN 12 genome harbors a 6. 3 kb cryptic plasmid called pAN 12. (cont.) Here we show that pAN 12 is conjugatively mobilizable into other rhodococcal strains. A series of plasmid deletion constructs were tested for loss of mobility to identify the pAN 12 cis-acting conjugation requirement. In this way, an approximately 700 bp region was found to be required for plasmid transmission. A small 61 bp element within this region exhibited sequence similarity to the minimal 54 bp clt region known to be required for the conjugation of the streptomycete plasmid, pIJ 101. The functionality of these cis-acting elements appears to be conserved, as the addition of this pAN 12 clt-like region confers mobility to an otherwise <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid.</b> However, unlike pJI 101 which encodes all necessary factors for transfer, pAN 12 mobility is dependent on the presence of the AN 12 megaplasmid, pREA 400. by Joyce Chun-Yi Yang.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{mechanism}} of trimethoprim (TMP) -resistance is {{the acquisition of}} dihydrofolate reductase enzyme resistant to this drug. Previous molecular characterization of TMP-genes resistance in Chilean isolates of S. sonnei searching for dfrA 1 and dfrA 8, showed solely the presence of dfrA 8 (formerly dhfrIIIc). However, these genetic markers were absent in S. sonnei strains further isolated during an outbreak in 2009. To identify the TMP-resistance gene in these strains, a genomic DNA library from a TMP-resistant (TMPR) S. sonnei representative strain for the outbreak was used to clone, select and identify a TMP-resistance marker. The TMPR clone was sequenced by primer walking, identifying {{the presence of the}} dfrA 14 gene in the sul 2 -strA’-dfrA 14 -‘strA-strB gene arrangement, harbored in a native 6, 779 -bp plasmid. The same plasmid was isolated by transforming with a ~ 4. 2 MDa plasmid extracted from several TMPR S. sonnei strains into E. coli. This plasmid, named pABC- 3, was present only in dfrA 14 -positive strains and was homologous to a previously described pCERC- 1, but different due to the absence of an 11 -bp repetitive unit. The distribution of dfrA 1, dfrA 8 and dfrA 14 TMP-resistance genes was determined in 126 TMPR S. sonnei isolates. Most of the strains (96 %) carried only one of the three TMP-resistance genes assessed. Thus, all strains obtained during the 2009 -outbreak harbored only dfrA 14, whereas, dfrA 8 was the most abundant gene marker before outbreak and, after the outbreak dfrA 1 seems have appeared in circulating strains. According to PFGE, dfrA 14 -positive strains were clustered in a genetically related group including some dfrA 1 - and dfrA 8 -positive strains; meanwhile other genetic group included most of the dfrA 8 -positive strains. This distribution also correlated with the isolation period, showing a dynamics of trimethoprim genetic markers prevalent in Chilean S. sonnei strains. To our knowledge, dfrA 14 gene associated to a small <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid</b> was detected {{for the first time in}} Shigella. Apparently, the strain causing the outbreak must have been introduced, changing drastically the genetic distribution of trimethoprim resistance in Chilean S. sonnei strains...|$|E

The increasing incidence and spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbap-enemase (KPC) have been well documented among nosocomial K. pneumoniae infections in the northeastern United States (1, 2). Two scenarios contribute to the spread of these emerging patho-gens which challenge the design of effective infection control strat-egies.

40|$|The IncQ is a {{group of}} <b>non-conjugative</b> but mobilisable <b>plasmids</b> that are found and stably {{maintained}} {{in a wide range of}} bacteria contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and to the insurgence of multidrug resistant bacteria.

Typhimurium strains collected in Southern Italy from various hospitals and years of isolation. Bioinformatics analyses highlighted the presence of pNUC-like plasmids in pathogenic bacteria of various Enterobacteriaceae genera or species. Taken as a whole, these plasmids constitute a novel group of IncQ 1 plasmids that might have originated through recombination events between a tetR-tetA gene cluster (possibly derived from a Tn 1721) and a recipient IncQ 1 plasmid related to RSF 1010.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} thirty-six Salmonella enterica strains, {{isolated}} from humans, animals, environmental and plant sources in Australia from 23 serovars, were examined for the streptomycin resistance gene strA and strB, the sulfonamide resistance gene sul 2, and the tetracycline resistance gene tetA(A) and tetA(B). Thirteen strains {{were identified as}} containing the strA-strB genes located on the transposon Tn 5393. S. enterica serovar Hadar accounted for 11 of these strains, 6 of which were isolated from humans and 5 were from ducks. This investigation is therefore the first report of the Tn 5393 transposon being detected in bacterial strains from a human source in Australia. RSF 1010 plasmids were identified and extracted from 4 S. enterica strains, and were further confirmed by restriction enzyme profiling using PstI, SspI and EcoRV. Small <b>non-conjugative</b> <b>plasmid</b> p 9123 was extracted and characterised from 3 of the S. enterica strains and also confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. An RSF 1010 -like plasmid was also identified in 3 of the strains. This plasmid {{was found to be}} approximately 2. 6 kb larger than RSF 1010, and possibly derived from the RSF 1010 plasmid via insertion of the tetracycline resistance gene tetA(A) between strB and mobC genes. An IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 antibiotic resistance region was identified in 33 S. enterica strains, among these were 23 serovar Typhimurium isolates, 8 serovar Bovismorbificans, 1 serovar Senftenberg and 1 isolate where the serovar could not be conclusively identified. The 23 Typhimurium strains were further characterised by PCR and Southern hybridisation analysis using a blaTEM gene probe. The analysis identified two classes of antibiotic resistance gene clusters. Eleven S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains harboured an IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 -blaTEM- 1 -IS 26 antibiotic resistance gene cluster and another 10 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains contained an IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 -blaTEM- 1 gene cluster, without the IS 26 element downstream of the blaTEM- 1 gene. Two strains contain elements of these gene clusters but further investigation is needed to fully identify these. Further linkage PCR amplifications revealed that the IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 -blaTEM- 1 -IS 26 antibiotic resistance gene cluster was possibly inserted into the 3 P-CS of a class 1 integron (In 4 type) and truncated the 3 P-CS region. Three derivatives were identified, of which the dfrA 5 -intI 1 type was most commonly found downstream of the blaTEM- 1 -IS 26 region. Southern hybridisation analysis using an IS 200 gene probe revealed that strains which contain different antibiotic resistance gene clusters also display different but related IS 200 profiles. The antibiotic resistance gene clusters of 19 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains were transferred to an E. coli 294 Rifr recipient either by direct mating or triparental mating methods. These experiments confirmed that the antibiotic resistance gene clusters were located on conjugative or mobilisable plasmids. The antibiotic resistance gene clusters of 4 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains could not be transferred to the E. coli 294 Rifr recipient. These experimental results suggest that the antibiotic resistance gene cluster of IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 -blaTEM- 1 -IS 26 might move as one genetic element between distinct plasmid backbones...|$|E

40|$|The {{horizontal}} {{gene transfer}} facilitated by mobile genetic elements impacts almost {{all areas of}} bacterial evolution, including the accretion and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistance genes in the human and animal pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Genome surveys of staphylococcal plasmids have revealed an unexpected paucity of conjugation and mobilization loci, perhaps suggesting that conjugation plays only a minor role {{in the evolution of}} this genus. In this letter we present the DNA sequences of historically documented staphylococcal conjugative plasmids and highlight that at least 3 distinct and widely distributed families of conjugative plasmids currently contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus. We also review the recently documented “relaxase-in trans” mechanism of conjugative mobilization facilitated by conjugative plasmids pWBG 749 and pSK 41, and discuss how this may facilitate the horizontal transmission of around 90 % of plasmids that were previously considered non-mobilizable. Finally, we enumerate unique sequenced S. aureus plasmids with a potential mechanism of mobilization and predict that at least 80 % of all <b>non-conjugative</b> S. aureus <b>plasmids</b> are mobilizable by at least one mechanism.

Genes coding for MLS resistance are located on plasmids and one MLS resistance transposon has been described. MLS resistance genes have also been found in {{a large number of}} plasmid-free strains. Plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (Mdal) that code either for MLS or for both MLS and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Streptococcus faecalis) and G. These plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95 %). One smaller <b>non-conjugative</b> MLS resistance <b>plasmid</b> has been isolated from Str. sanguis (4. 5 Mdal). In group D (Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) streptococci, MLS resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). These multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. The MLS resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain oi Str. faecalis, are located on a transposon of 3 - 3 Mdal, Tn 977.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the carriage of β-lactamase genes in ampicillin-resistant (Ampr) Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates from human normal fecal flora. Methods: Ten Ampr E. coli strains isolated from the stool samples of 21 healthy persons with no antibiotic use during at least three months were screened for TEM-, SHV-, or OXA-type β-lactamase genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The susceptibility of the strains to antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion method, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin to the strains was determined by agar dilution method. Plasmid transfer assays were performed by broth mating technique. Plasmid DNA was isolated by alkaline lysis method. Digoxigenin-labeled TEM- 1 probe was used in hybridization assays. Results: Two of 10 strains were found to be carrier for only TEM-type β-lactamase gene (blaTEM) by PCR, and their resistances to ampicillin were conjugatively transferred to a recombinant E. coli K- 12 strain C 600. MIC of ampicillin to two representative strains and their transconjugants was detected as> 512 µg/ml. Moreover, β-lactamase inhibitor resistance was also observed in these two strains and their transconjugants. Digoxigenin-labeled TEM- 1 DNA probe was hybridized to some <b>non-conjugative</b> but mobilizable <b>plasmid</b> DNAs purified from two of the TEM-gene-carrying organisms. Conclusions: These results indicate that commensal E. coli strains carrying β-lactamase gene in the bowel environment could retain resistance determinants on small-sized resistance plasmids (R plasmids) and become a potential reservoir for resistance genes in the community, even in the absence of recent antibiotic consumption.

Salmonella enterica blood isolates were collected from clinically suspected enteric fever patients attending various hospitals in Kolkata, India from January 2009 to June 2013 and were tested for AMR profiles by standard protocols; for resistance gene transfer by conjugation; for resistance and virulence genes profiles by PCR; and for molecular subtypes by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). A total of 77 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and 25 Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A) from Kolkata were included in this study. Although multidrug resistance (resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole) was decreasing in S. Typhi (18. 2 %) and absent in S.
