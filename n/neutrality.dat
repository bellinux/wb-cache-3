5|$|Over {{the first}} months of the Second World War Norwegian <b>neutrality</b> was {{violated}} repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her <b>neutrality.</b> Initially the German view of Norwegian <b>neutrality</b> had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E
5|$|Political <b>neutrality.</b>|$|E
5|$|Strategic risk {{posed by}} German {{control of the}} Belgian and {{ultimately}} French coast was considered unacceptable. German guarantees of post-war behaviour were cast into doubt by her blasé treatment of Belgian <b>neutrality.</b> However, the Treaty of London had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium's <b>neutrality.</b> Moreover, naval war planning demonstrated that Britain herself would have violated Belgian <b>neutrality</b> by blockading her ports (to prevent imported goods passing to Germany) {{in the event of}} war with Germany.|$|E
5|$|The unbiasedness {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} given conditions of rational expectations and risk <b>neutrality,</b> the {{forward exchange rate}} is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Without introducing a foreign exchange risk premium (due to the assumption of risk <b>neutrality),</b> the following equation illustrates the unbiasedness hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|After Congress adjourned on August 6, 1861, Burnett {{returned}} home to Cadiz and spoke {{at a number of}} pro-Southern rallies. On September 4, 1861, Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk violated Kentucky's <b>neutrality</b> by ordering Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow to occupy Columbus. In response, Ulysses S. Grant captured Paducah on September 6, 1861. With <b>neutrality</b> no longer a tenable option, Burnett presided over a conference of Kentucky's Southern sympathizers that occurred at Russellville between October 29 and October 31, 1861. The self-appointed delegates to this conference called for a sovereignty convention on November 18, 1861 for the purpose of establishing a Confederate government for the state.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Denmark's <b>neutrality</b> in the First World War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 {{soldiers}} {{for the duration of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|At 04:00 on August 9 word reached Tokyo {{that the}} Soviet Union {{had broken the}} <b>Neutrality</b> Pact, {{declared}} war on Japan, and launched an invasion of Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|Brazil revoked its <b>neutrality</b> in the {{war between}} the United States and Germany on 1 June 1917, but did not declare war. At the same time, all German {{merchant}} ships interned in Brazilian harbors, 45 in all, were boarded and seized; most were unusable due to neglect or sabotage. On 28 June, Brazil revoked its <b>neutrality</b> between all of the Allied and Central Powers but again stopped short of declaring war; this move allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.|$|E

5|$|In early 1861 the {{critical}} border state of Kentucky had declared <b>neutrality</b> in the American Civil War. This <b>neutrality</b> was first violated on September 3, when Confederate Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, acting on orders from Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, occupied Columbus, Kentucky. The riverside town was situated on 180 foot high bluffs that commanded {{the river at}} that point, where the Confederates installed 140 large guns, underwater mines and a heavy chain that stretched a mile across the Mississippi River to Belmont, while occupying the town with 17,000 Confederate troops, thus cutting off northern commerce {{to the south and}} beyond.|$|E

5|$|Magoffin called another {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in May 1861. Again, the legislators refused to call a convention to determine the state's course in the war. Instead, they approved a resolution of <b>neutrality,</b> and Magoffin proclaimed this position on May 20, 1861. Later that month, Magoffin {{sent a letter to}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis asking that he recognize and honor Kentucky's <b>neutrality.</b> In August, he sent an identical letter to President Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the King and Government began to disagree. While the Government argued that the German invasion had violated Belgian <b>neutrality</b> and made Belgium one of the Allies, Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French forces into Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as a breach of its <b>neutrality.</b>|$|E
5|$|We're glad to {{see this}} {{short-lived}} debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net <b>neutrality</b> and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, the Norwegian government declared the country neutral in the conflict. Both warring sides subsequently stated that they would respect Norway's <b>neutrality,</b> provided that she protect her <b>neutrality</b> against trespasses by the other side. Koht was clear from early on that Norway should remain neutral, but also that in the event of her being forced to enter the war it was critical that it was {{on the side of the}} British.|$|E
5|$|A {{positive}} capsule {{review in}} the Los Angeles Times noted that the authors use logic to point out transparencies in the assertions of Transcendental Meditation. John Horgan, in his book Rational Mysticism, questions Persinger's <b>neutrality</b> and says that in his book he treats religious beliefs and spiritual practices as mental illness.|$|E
5|$|After it {{was clear}} that Austria-Hungary had lost World War I, the Austrian {{government}} decided to give Viribus Unitis, along with much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, to Yugoslavia, the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This move would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared <b>neutrality.</b> Following the transfer, she was renamed Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Clarke was promoted to lieutenant colonel and began working on intelligence tasks. He worked with Wavell in the Middle East to research possible Allied supply lines, undertook two trips to Norway (in an effort to maintain its <b>neutrality),</b> and conducted secret missions in Calais and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Because of its <b>neutrality</b> policy, the Swiss army {{does not}} {{currently}} {{take part in}} armed conflicts in other countries, but is part of some peacekeeping missions around the world. Since 2000 the armed force department has also maintained the Onyx intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications.|$|E
5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of <b>neutrality</b> since its {{independence}} in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to resist the occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by the German army.|$|E
5|$|Blakeley {{was again}} {{commissioned}} on 16 October 1939. She then joined the <b>Neutrality</b> Patrol until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entrance into World War II. She then began convoy {{duty in the}} Caribbean, including a February 1942 mission to guard a convoy carrying troops to garrison Curaçao in the Netherlands West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Britain saw the {{expedition}} {{as a serious}} threat. Britain and its ally, the Russian Empire, unsuccessfully attempted to intercept it in Persia {{during the summer of}} 1915. Britain waged a covert intelligence and diplomatic offensive, including personal interventions by the Viceroy Lord Hardinge and King George V, to maintain Afghan <b>neutrality.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1968 the Americans {{were well}} aware of the scope and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's <b>neutrality</b> since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|During the Interwar, Belgium {{pursued a}} policy of {{political}} <b>neutrality</b> and attempted to avoid confrontation with Nazi Germany. When the Phony War broke out, Pierlot became {{the leader of a}} tripartite national government of Catholics, Liberals and Socialists which stayed in power until the German invasion in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|From 1619 to 1640, George William was elector of Brandenburg and duke of Prussia. He strove, but proved {{unable to}} break the {{dominance}} of the Electorate of Saxony in the Upper Saxon Circle. The Brandenburg-Saxon antagonism rendered the defense of the circle ineffective, and it was subsequently overrun by Albrecht von Wallenstein during the Thirty Years' War. While George William had claimed <b>neutrality</b> before, the presence of Wallenstein's army forced him to join the Catholic-Imperial camp in the Treaty of Königsberg (1627) and accept garrisons. When the Swedish Empire entered the war and advanced into Brandenburg, George William again claimed <b>neutrality,</b> yet Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden compelled George William to join Sweden as an ally by occupying substantial territory in Brandenburg-Prussia and concentrating an army before the town walls of Berlin. George William did not conclude an alliance, but granted Sweden transit rights, two fortresses and subsidies. Consequently, Roman Catholic armies repeatedly ravaged Brandenburg and other Hohenzollern lands.|$|E
5|$|Gore {{repeated}} his <b>neutrality</b> {{eight years later}} during the Democratic presidential primaries of 2016 until endorsing Hillary Clinton on July 25, 2016, {{the first day of}} that year's Democratic National Convention.

5|$|He became {{president}} of the Norwegian League of Nations Society, and although the Scandinavian nations with their traditions of <b>neutrality</b> initially held themselves aloof, his advocacy helped to ensure that Norway became a full member of the League in 1920, and he became one of its three delegates to the League's General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re-established Swiss {{independence}} and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss <b>neutrality.</b> Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's borders have not changed since, except for some minor adjustments.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 Kentucky {{governor}} Beriah Magoffin appointed Buckner adjutant general, promoted him {{to major}} general, and {{charged him with}} revising the state's militia laws. The state was torn between Union and Confederacy, with the legislature supporting the former and the governor the latter. This led the state to declare itself officially neutral. Buckner assembled 61companies to defend Kentucky's <b>neutrality.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1949 Sweden {{chose not}} to join NATO and {{declared}} a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and <b>neutrality</b> in war. A modified version now qualifies non-alignment in peace for possible <b>neutrality</b> in war. This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however {{there has been an}} active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the post–Cold War world. These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force. Sweden have been active participants in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the pro-independence group People's Voice {{established}} a demonstration {{camp on the}} grounds of the Scottish parliament demanding independence. this camp was objected to as it risked infringing on the political <b>neutrality</b> of the parliamentary estate and prevented others from using the grounds. Sheriff officers issued the campers with a notice ordering them to leave, however the campers refused.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese {{forces in}} Manchukuo had {{sporadic}} border clashes with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing <b>neutrality</b> with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a <b>Neutrality</b> Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted {{the doctrine of}} Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.|$|E
5|$|Leopold III became King of the Belgians in 1934, {{following}} {{the death of his father}} in a mountaineering accident. Leopold was one of the key exponents of Belgian political and military <b>neutrality</b> before the war. Under the Belgian Constitution, the King played an important political role and served as commander-in-chief of the military, and personally commanded the Belgian army during the 18 Days' Campaign of May 1940.|$|E
