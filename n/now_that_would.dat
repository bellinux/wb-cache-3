5|$|Secondary School {{is a big}} {{waste of}} time. What are French {{teachers}} doing? None of us can speak French. How much maths can you do? Do you know any history? What is the point in training people {{to do things that}} none of us can do? The system seems designed to qualify you for the Indian Civil Service in 1911. We all leave school unable to drive! <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be quite handy.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 2016, The Weather Group {{announced}} a multi-year distribution agreement with fuboTV, in which Local Now and The Weather Channel {{would be included}} {{as part of an}} expanded service set to launch in early 2017, designed to compete with Sling TV and other OTT competitors such as PlayStation Vue and DirecTV <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> offer 70+ broadcast and cable networks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will he?" [...] asked Mark. <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be a {{great point}} gained, for Archdeacon Grantly {{was a close friend}} of Lady Lufton.|$|E
6000|$|Uncle Pentstemon, {{raising his}} voice defiantly: [...] "Trounce 'er again I would if she did as much <b>now.</b> <b>That</b> I <b>would!</b> Dratted mischief!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{railways}} have suffered," [...] said Tipps, laughing, [...] "for {{mother is}} so strongly set against them <b>now</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> not enter {{one for a}} thousand pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> they <b>would</b> {{think of}} asking, {{for a place}} like this, {{as much money as}} would buy a good {{wholesome}} ship--a regular A. No. 1." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on! don't bu'st it!" [...] exclaimed Pat sharply; there's {{all sorts}} and sizes here. [...] "There's a pair, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> fit Goliath." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the middle}} of August <b>now.</b> <b>That</b> <b>would</b> give us a full month in which to make {{arrangements}} and for them in which to get ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That wouldn't {{be looking}} up. Placed {{as he is}} <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be looking down; and he is so proud that he'll never do that. But come down, dear, else they'll wonder where we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{said just}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> be no punishment, and I {{was glad to}} hear it. Society is, as you say, open to you, and you will lose nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{little girl}} and the Rainbow's Daughter had both escaped the shower of heads, but they saw <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> be useless to try {{to run away from}} the dreadful Scoodlers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose, {{when you}} said just <b>now</b> <b>that</b> you <b>would</b> do {{anything}} for father, you didn’t mean it, then?" [...] said Joan. [...] "And {{when you said}} you’d die for me, you—" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that too. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be a saving,--without any fall. And if we were both there we could hardly fail {{to know what he}} was doing. You could offer that, couldn't you? You could say as much as that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, Mr. Dog, your weight's to the good, {{and that}} ear can be ironed out by any respectable dog--doctor. I bet there's a hundred men in Sydney right <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> fork over twenty quid {{for the right}} of calling you his." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Hugh is gone, and {{therefore}} I could not show him {{that in time}} to do anything; but if I were to do so, he would simply do nothing, and let her go to the hotel in London. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be unkind--would it not?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Suppose <b>now</b> <b>that</b> we <b>would</b> like {{to learn}} a {{nonlinear}} classification rule which corresponds to a linear classification rule for the transformed data points [...] Moreover, we are given a kernel function [...] which satisfies [...]|$|R
6000|$|He {{expected}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> they <b>would</b> believe him, and ask whom he {{was engaged}} to; but apparently they were still unable to realise it. He was obliged to go on. [...] "I'm engaged to Miss Pasmer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jeeves," [...] I said, [...] "you see how I {{am taking}} hold. You notice the grip I am getting on this case. No doubt you realize <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> pay you to study my methods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Honestly. But {{you spend}} a great deal there. Still, it is magnificent, is it not? If it were not for that blessed war there, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be the place for you, Don Ippolito. He tells me the Americans are {{actually}} mad for inventions. Your servant. Excuse the freedom, you know," [...] said the man, bowing and moving away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} colonel, [...] "you {{may have been}} right on the whole, but I don't think Kitty is showing any {{particular}} force of mind, just <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> fit her to live in Boston. My opinion is, that it's ridiculous for her {{to keep him in}} suspense. She might as well answer him first as last. She's putting herself under a kind of obligation by her delay. I'll talk to her--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{him what}} I say, all the same; {{and tell him}} that as I have {{hitherto}} had cause to be grateful to him for his kindness, so also I hope he will not put an end to that feeling by anything <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not be kind. If there be papers of Lord Ongar's, he can take them either to my lawyers, if that be fit, or to those of the family. You can tell him that, can you not?" ...|$|E
60|$|At breakfast, where Corey and {{his mother}} met the next morning before his father and sisters came down, he told her, with embarrassment which told much more, <b>that</b> he wished <b>now</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> go and call upon the Laphams.|$|R
6000|$|... "Up to {{a certain}} point. Beyond that, I warn you, I should have no pity. If you were a wise man, I think even <b>now</b> <b>that</b> you <b>would</b> thank me for my luncheon and take my hand and bid me farewell." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Plowman: <b>Now,</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> {{interfere}} with you sitting as a juror in this case? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do hope Jeanne is {{not going}} to break down," [...] Harry said as he walked towards his lodging. [...] "If she were to get laid up <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be the {{finishing}} touch to the whole affair; but perhaps, as she says, she will be all right in the morning. No doubt in that note Marie wrote as if she were sure of dying, and such a letter as that would be enough to upset any girl, even such a plucky one as Jeanne.|$|E
60|$|George Denbigh was open-hearted without suspicion, and a favorite. The {{first quality}} taxed his generosity, the second {{subjected}} him to fraud, {{and the third}} supplied him with the means. But these means sometimes failed. The fortune of the general, though handsome, was not more than competent to support his style of living. He {{expected to be a}} duke himself one day, and was anxious to maintain an appearance <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not disgrace his future elevation. A system of strict but liberal economy had been adopted in the case of his sons. They had, for the sake of appearances, a stated and equal allowance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fie upon thee, brother Thomas! Do {{you think}} I have less candour than thyself, that I would not {{acknowledge}} my own flesh and blood. I {{never saw the}} youngster, until within the last six months, when he was landed from the roadstead, and brought to Wychecombe, to be cured of his wounds; nor ever heard of him before. When they told me his name was Wycherly Wychecombe, I could do no less than call and see him. The poor fellow lay at death's door for a fortnight; and it was while we {{had little or no}} hope of saving him, that I got the few family anecdotes from him. <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be good evidence in law, I believe, Thomas." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{reduction}} in the number of civil servants and the abolition of tenure, for those hired from <b>now</b> on, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow the government to function with 2/3 of its current workforce. This would be coupled with increased salaries, for those <b>that</b> remain, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be pinned on performance evaluations.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton {{sank back}} in her corner, aware <b>now</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> {{not have had the}} {{strength}} to go to her husband even to save him from the awful disgrace of giving himself away to Breckon. [...] "And was that all?" [...] she faltered.|$|R
6000|$|Ransom {{stared at}} her, {{surprise}}d; he felt, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> always surprise him. [...] "Ah, don't be rough with me," [...] he said, in his soft Southern voice; [...] "don't {{you remember how}} you knocked me about when I called on you in Boston?" ...|$|R
60|$|By breakfast-time {{the news}} was all over town that I had sent a {{challenge}} and Steve Gillis had carried it. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> entitle us to two years apiece in the penitentiary, according to the brand-new law. Judge North sent us no message as coming from himself, but a message came from {{a close friend of}} his. He said {{it would be a good}} idea for us to leave the territory by the first stage-coach. This would sail next morning, at four o'clock--and in the meantime we would be searched for, but not with avidity; and if we were in the Territory after that stage-coach left, we would be the first victims of the new law. Judge North was anxious to have some object-lessons for that law, and he would absolutely keep us in the prison the full two years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whew!" [...] whistled the trapper. [...] "Well, well," [...] {{he murmured}} in an undertone, [...] "you're {{on the wrong}} scent this time altogether, Tim. Ye think yerself a mighty deal cliverer than ye are. Niver mind, the one that he says he loves more nor life'll turn up soon enough, no doubt. But I'm real sorry for the old 'un," [...] he added in an undertone, casting a glance of pity on the poor creature, who bent over the little fire {{in the middle of}} the tent, and gazed silently yet inquiringly at what was going on. [...] "She'll niver be able to stand a flight like this. The mere joltin' o' the nags 'ud shake her old bones a'most out of her skin. There are some Redskins <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> leave her to starve, but Whitewing'll niver do that. I know him better. Now then"--aloud--"have ye {{anything}} more for me to do?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{began their}} journey, however, together, {{and crossed the}} Alps side by side, muffled in one rug, {{on the top of}} the St. Gothard coach. Rowland was going to England to pay some promised visits; his {{companion}} had no plan save to ramble through Switzerland and Germany as fancy guided him. He had money, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> outlast the summer; when it was spent he would come back to Rome and make another statue. At a little mountain village by the way, Roderick declared that he would stop; he would scramble about a little in the high places and doze in the shade of the pine forests. The coach was changing horses; the two young men walked along the village street, picking their way between dunghills, breathing the light, cool air, and listening to the plash of the fountain and the tinkle of cattle-bells. The coach overtook them, and then Rowland, as he prepared to mount, felt an almost overmastering reluctance.|$|E
60|$|At last {{he reached}} the {{well-known}} woods near the bridge, and off in a little opening he saw Aunt Judy's cabin. It was so dark <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> not have known it was a cabin, {{had he not been}} so familiar with it.|$|R
60|$|Ozma and Dorothy {{could not}} refrain from {{laughing}} {{to see their}} dreaded enemies become as harmless as babies. There was no danger <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Oz <b>would</b> be destroyed. The only question remaining to solve was how {{to get rid of}} this horde of intruders.|$|R
60|$|The preacher, in his swift glance, had {{apparently}} not observed the half-hidden Cleve. Certainly it appeared <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> have no attention {{for any other}} than Kells. The bandit was a study. His astonishment was terrific and held him like a chain. Suddenly he lurched.|$|R
