2500|$|On February 6, 1898, it was {{reported}} that a Canadian shipbuilder, W.J.

5|$|After the Gibraltar hearings, Mary Celeste {{continued}} in service under <b>new</b> <b>owners.</b> In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her {{off the coast of}} Haiti, as part of an attempted insurance fraud.

5|$|After the war, {{the three}} {{surviving}} ships were decommissioned and later sold on 12 September 1874.

5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was done and the cemetery continued to revert to wilderness.

50|$|Another {{reason a}} <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> {{might want to}} cancel, is perhaps the buyer has made a large {{financial}} commitment in {{the excitement of the}} sales presentation, and now at home, the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> has buyers remorse. Or, the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> may not know exactly what was purchased and how that timeshare actually works, or didn't realize at the time of purchase that ownership maintenance fees are a lifelong commitment. Or, perhaps the <b>new</b> timeshare <b>owner</b> feels they haven't had the time to research the company the timeshare was just bought from, because it was purchased during the first visit to the timeshare resort.|$|R

40|$|Provide a brief {{description}} of the issue and reason for the proposed amendment. If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Overview The present Market Rules do not effectively address the financial risks to the IESO-administered markets from a) sales of registered facilities, and b) expiring letters of credit. A detailed description of these risks is provided below. Sales of Registered Facilities- Overview In a typical sale, a registered facility is sold to a <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> by an existing market participant (“MP”). In many cases, the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> is unaware of its obligations to become an authorized MP including obtaining an OEB license and posting prudential support. Since the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> is, in most cases, immediately drawing power from the date of sale, they are incurring obligations to the IESOadministered markets without providing prudential support that is designed to protect the market in the event the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> defaults. Currently, the Market Rules require MPs in section 2. 5 of Chapter 7 to advise the IESO of the transfer of registered facilities but many do not do so. The IESO usually becomes aware of such a sale long after the date of sale from either a request from the selling MP for the return of their prudential support, various news media distributions, IESO Market Entry notifications, and/or a change in electricity consumption by the <b>new</b> <b>owner.</b> During this “interim period”, from the date of sale until the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> posts prudential support and becomes an authorized MP, the market is exposed to financial risks. Generally, it can take a <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> between 2 to 5 months to meet all the market entry requirements to become an authorized MP including obtaining an OEB licence. This is not a hypothetical situation. The IESO has recently had to deal with a <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> of a registered facility missing a margin call and then defaulting on payment of several invoices before it became a fully authorized MP. Fortunately, the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> had posted prudential support which was sufficient to meet its obligations. But the IESO has had other situations where the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> has not posted prudential support in a timely manner...|$|R

After the purchase, Glu Mobile raised the fees being charged to publishers to provide online services for their games. The <b>new</b> <b>owners</b> then shut down {{a number of the}} online services for different games, including Neverwinter Nights 2. GameSpy claimed that the developers had allowed their contracts to lapse, and, after providing free services for a time, were no longer willing to continue.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} on March 28, 2011 that two former employees of The Washington Post, Bradley Graham, and his wife, Lissa Muscatine, had purchased the store from Meade and David Cohen.

40|$|Property sales involve {{two main}} {{contract}} partners, the buyer (the <b>new</b> <b>owner)</b> and the seller (the property owner). In {{some cases the}} property owner can have let a third person (the leaseholder) lease the property or the land. The rights and obligations that fall on the property owner, the leaseholder and the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> according to the Code of land laws can appear difficult and unclear, especially con-cerning reservation, the <b>new</b> <b>owner’s</b> duty to inspect the property {{and when he does}} not act in good faith, the formal requirement and when terms are changed. The work towards a more uniform interpretation of the Code of land laws should result in a greater correspondence between the rules of leasehold and property sales, the rules of leasehold should be interpreted in accordance with the rules of property sales. This should mean an increased responsibility for the property owner to reserve the lease and a de-creased duty for the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> to inspect the property. If the lease is only partially re-served, the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> is only bound by the leasehold to the parts which he understood from the reservation and the duty to inspect the property is limited to documents in the property owner’s possession. There are no criteria for when the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> is considered not being in good faith, but it should be all kinds of visible signs. Despite the formal requirements, oral agreements can bind the <b>new</b> <b>owner</b> to the leasehold, even though the possibilities for this are small. A complete disapproval of oral agreement would not constitute a good development of the Code of land laws...|$|R
