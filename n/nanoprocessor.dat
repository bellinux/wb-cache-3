40|$|Today's {{consumer}} market {{is driven by}} technology innovations. Many technologies that were not available {{a few years ago}} are quickly bing adopted into common use. Equipment for these services requires microprocessors inside and can be regarded as embedded systems. Embedded systems are computer systems that are well hidden inside devices. At the time of design, much is known about the operating conditions and requirements. Embedded systems are designed to meet these requirements at a minimal cost. To improve efficiency and throughput, real-time operating systems (RTOSs) can be used. However, RTOSs can create overhead in systems. Using hardware accelerators can significantly reduce overhead. In this work, we survey the major overhead in embedded systems and identify and analyze some of them in details. We then purpose and discuss <b>nanoprocessors,</b> as configurable hardware accelerators, to lower this system overhead.

40|$|Abstract — Several {{nanoscale}} computational fabrics {{based on}} various physical phenomena {{have been proposed}} in recent years. However, their integration with CMOS has only received limited attention. In this paper we explore some of these integration challenges focusing on registration and the overlay between layers. We propose and evaluate a new 3 D integration approach by carefully mixing standard CMOS design rules and nanoscale constraints. We address the following questions: (i) How much overlay precision is necessary? (ii) What is the impact on yield if different overlays are used?, and (iii) How can we mitigate the overlay requirements? For a <b>nanoprocessor</b> design implemented in N 3 ASIC (a hybrid nanowire-CMOS fabric) we show that a 100 % yield is achievable even for a today’s known overlay of 3 σ=± 8 nm (ITRS 2009).

The use of nanomaterials is very promising direction in nuclear power. Conditions of operation of structural materials in nuclear reactors, namely, high temperature (higher 300 °C for thermal reactors and higher 600 °C for fast reactors) which together with high density of neutrons (1021 - 1022 neutrons/cm- 2) cause the degradation of initial physical-chemical characteristics and the significant dimension changes.

40|$|DNA {{computing}} aims {{at using}} nucleic acids for computing. Since micromolar DNA solutions {{can act as}} billions of parallel <b>nanoprocessors,</b> DNA computers can in theory solve optimization problems that require vast search spaces. However, the actual parallelism currently being achieved {{is at least a}} hundred million-fold lower than the number of DNA molecules used. This is due to the quantity of DNA molecules of one species that is required to produce a detectable output to the computations. In order to miniaturize the computation and considerably reduce the amount of DNA needed, we have combined DNA computing with single-molecule detection. Reliable hybridization detection was achieved at the level of single DNA molecules with fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. To illustrate the use of this approach, we implemented a DNA-based computation and solved a 4 -variable 4 -clause instance of the computationally hard Satisfiability (SAT) problem...|$|R

QCA have a large potential in the development of circuits with high space density and low heat dissipation and allow the development of faster computers with lower power consumption. This paper discusses the design and construction of simple two bit arithmetic logic unit, four bit shifter and carry save in multiplier circuits. The advantage of this type of ALU is to construct functional unit all around the input lines and thereby reducing circuit complexity. Four bit shifter are constructed using serial AND and OR QCA circuits. QCA multiplier designed and constructed here has advantage of carry save in by delaying one clock cycle and no of bits can also be increased by adding the full adder stages.

This unique technology enables the possibility to design and build electronic components as well as complete devices (called nanomachines or nanodevices) at the nano scale. A nanodevice {{is expected to be}} an essential element able to operate in a nanonetwork, where a huge number of them would coordinate to acquire data, process the information gathered, and wirelessly transmit those data to end-points providing innovative services in many key scenarios, such as the human body or the environment. This paper is aimed at studying the feasibility of this type of device by carefully examining their main component parts, namely the <b>nanoprocessor,</b> nanomemory, nanoantenna, and nanogenerator. To this end, a thorough state-of-the-art review is conveyed to discuss, substantiate, and select the most suitable current technology (commercial or pre-commercial) for each component. Then, we further contribute by developing a complete conceptual nanodevice layout taking into consideration its ultra-small size (similar to a blood cell) and its very restricted capabilities (e. g., processing, memory storage, telecommunication, and energy management).

40|$|Nanoscale-computing fabrics {{based on}} novel {{materials}} such as semiconductor nanowires, carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc. have been proposed in recent years. These fabrics employ unconventional manufacturing techniques like Nano-imprint lithography or Super-lattice Nanowire Pattern Transfer to produce ultra-dense nano-structures. However, one key challenge that has received limited attention is the interfacing of unconventional/self-assembly based approaches with conventional CMOS manufacturing to build integrated systems. We propose a novel nanofabric approach that mixes unconventional nanomanufacturing with CMOS manufacturing flow and design rules to build a reliable nanowire-CMOS 3 -D integrated fabric called N 3 ASICs with no new manufacturing constraints. In N 3 ASICs active devices are formed on a dense semiconductor nanowire array and standard area distributed pins/vias, metal interconnects route signals in 3 D. The proposed N 3 ASICs fabric is fully described and thoroughly evaluated at all design levels. Novel nanowire based devices are envisioned and characterized based on 3 D physics modeling. Overall N 3 ASICs fabric design, associated circuits, interconnection approach, and a layer-by-layer assembly sequence for the fabric are introduced. System level metrics such as power, performance, and density for a <b>nanoprocessor</b> design built using N 3 ASICs were evaluated and compared against a functionally equivalent CMOS design. We show that the N 3 ASICs version of the processor is 3 X denser and 5 X more power efficient for a comparable performance than the 16 -nm scaled CMOS version without any new/unknown-manufacturing requirement. Systematic yield implications due to mask overlay misalignment have been evaluated. A partitioning approach to build complex circuits has been studied...|$|E
40|$|Radial core/shell {{nanowires}} (NWs) {{represent an}} important class of nanoscale building blocks with substantial potential for exploring fundamental electronic properties and realizing novel device applications at the nanoscale. Here, we report {{the synthesis of}} crystalline silicon/amorphous silicon (Si/a-Si) core/shell NWs and studies of crossed Si/a-Si NW metal NW (Si/a-Si × M) devices and arrays. Room-temperature electrical measurements on single Si/a-Si × Ag NW devices exhibit bistable switching between high (off) and low (on) resistance states with well-defined switching threshold voltages, on/off ratios greater than 10 4, and current rectification in the on state. Temperature-dependent switching experiments suggest that rectification {{can be attributed to}} barriers to electric field-driven metal diffusion. Systematic studies of Si/a-Si × Ag NW devices show that (i) the bit size can be at least as small as 20 nm × 20 nm, (ii) the writing time is 2 weeks, and (iv) devices can be switched> 10 4 times without degradation in performance. In addition, studies of dense one-dimensional and two-dimensional Si/a-Si × Ag NW devices arrays fabricated on crystalline and plastic substrates show that elements within the arrays can be independently switched and read, and moreover that bends with radii of curvature as small as 0. 3 cm cause little change in device characteristics. The Si/a-Si × Ag NW devices represent a highly scalable and promising nanodevice element for assembly and fabrication of dense nonvolatile memory and programmable <b>nanoprocessors.</b> Semiconductor NWs and carbon nanotubes have been explored as building blocks that might extend the remarkabl...|$|R
