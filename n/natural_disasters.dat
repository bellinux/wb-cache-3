40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} is aimed to reduce the level of depression, <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> anxiety and {{loneliness}} and to enhance the self-confidence and academic achievement of bereaved students affected by <b>natural</b> <b>disaster.</b> The Experimental method has been followed for the present study. The {{study was conducted in}} the coastal area of Nagappattinam district of Tamilnadu. Purposive sample of 300 male and female bereaved students affected by <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> studying in 10 differ-ent schools has been selected for the present study. The students selected are subjected to counselling programme developed by the researcher called “Grief Healing Integration and Adaptation Programme”. The duration of the program was 6 weeks (Six sessions for each school). Duration for each session was two hours. The Depression Scale, <b>Natural</b> <b>Disaster</b> Anxiety Scale, Loneliness Scale and Self-Confidence Scale has been developed and standardized by the investigator and administered before and after experimentation. The results of the study indicate that the level of depression, <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> anxiety and loneliness of bereaved students affected by <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> is high before experimentation. Further it indicates that the self-confidence and academic achievement of bereaved students affected by <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> is low before experimentation. It shows that the counselling programme adapted by the investi-gator is very effective to reduce depression, <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> anxiety and loneliness of bereaved students affected by <b>natural</b> <b>disaster.</b> It further shows that the counselling programme is very effective to enhance the level of self confidence and academic achievement of bereaved students affected by <b>natural</b> <b>disaster...</b>|$|R

How to understand the risk of <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> and assess regional <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> is important. <b>Natural</b> <b>disaster's</b> risk assessment is often thought difficult and complicated. Based on risk theories, in this paper, elements of <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> risk are classified. According to this, we set a conceptual risk model for regional <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> which briefly separates assessment course into three procedures: hazard analysis; vulnerability assessment and risk assessment. And for each procedure, different techniques or mathematical models are suggested to adopt according to their different purposes which would make the assessment course feasible and reasonable. It is hoped that the study could be a metric for prioritizing strategies for regional disaster mitigation or planning...|$|R

The aim is to provide logical proposes to reinforce for developing the Iranian <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> health information system. Methods & Materials: This is a descriptive and comparative study that was accomplished in form of cross sectional survey. The data was extracted from literature, papers, Iranian & foreigner journals, e-mails and other related document. Results: <b>Natural</b> <b>disaster</b> health information system in U. S. A illustrates that there is integration and consistency between responsibilities and roles are played between involving organizations and entities.
