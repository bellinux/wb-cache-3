A drive-in theater, with a capacity of 250 automobiles, was proposed in 1948, but never built.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson again moved on, {{this time}} {{accepting}} the player-manager role {{with the new}} Troy Trojans team who began {{their time in the}} National League in 1879, and would stay in that role until the team folded after the 1882 season. In 1883, he became the first manager {{in the history of the}} Philadelphia Phillies franchise, which was known at the time as the Quakers, but was relieved of command when the team won only four of its first 17games. On August 21 of that season, his Quakers traveled to Providence, Rhode Island to play the Grays. To increase ticket sales, he gave the day's pitching duty to Rhode Island <b>native</b> <b>Art</b> Hagan in hopes that Hagan's appearance would attract more locals to come watch the game. The strategy worked, but Hagen surrendered 28 runs and the Quakers made 20 errors behind him and did not score a run. Financially sound decision as it was, a bad decision for public relations as Ferguson was labeled a sadist for not relieving Hagen.|$|E

25|$|Yup'ik masks (kegginaquq and nepcetaq in Yup'ik, agayu in Cup'ig) are {{expressive}} shamanic ritual masks. One {{of their}} most popular forms of the Alaska <b>Native</b> <b>art</b> are masks. The masks vary enormously but are characterised by great invention. They are typically made of wood, and painted with few colors. The Yup'ik masks were carved by men or women, but mainly were carved by the men. They most often create masks for ceremonies but the masks are traditionally destroyed after being used. After Christian contact in the late 19th century, masked dancing was suppressed, and today it is not practiced {{as it was before}} in the Yup'ik villages.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{of these}} <b>native</b> <b>art</b> forms largely play to {{tourists}} or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms– including those heavily based {{on the use of}} often risqué and politically incorrect mimicry and parody– have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years. Indeed, contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites. Since 1930 when the first Malayalam film Vigathakumaran was released and over the following decade or two, Malayalam cinema had grown {{to become one of the}} popular means of expression for both works of fiction and social issues, and it remains so.|$|E

500|$|Pittsburgh <b>native,</b> <b>Art</b> Rooney founded his NFL team {{under the}} name the Pittsburgh Pirates, on July 8, 1933, for $2,500 ($ in present-day terms). The {{franchise}}'s first game, against the New York Giants, was held on September 20, 1933, at Forbes Field. The Giants won the game 23–2 in front of 25,000people. Rooney wrote of the game, [...] "The Giants won. Our team looks terrible. The fans didn't get their money's worth." [...] The Pirates would rebound to gain their first ever franchise victory a week later at Forbes Field, against the Chicago Cardinals. The NFL's Pirates were renamed the Steelers in 1940, and otherwise struggled during much of their three-decades of tenancy at Forbes. The club achieved its first winning record in 1942; its tenth season of existence. On November 30, 1952, the Steelers met the New York Giants at Forbes Field for a snowy afternoon game. Pittsburgh entered {{the game with a}} 3–6 record, but went on to set multiple team records, including scoring nine touchdowns, to win the game 63–7. Excited by their team's play, the 15,140spectators ran onto the field and began to tear the field goal posts out of the ground. The University of Pittsburgh's acquisition of Forbes Field in 1958 gave the Steelers some options, and they began transferring some of their home games to the much larger Pitt Stadium that year. The Steelers played their final game at Forbes Field on December 1, 1963. The franchise would move to Pitt Stadium exclusively the following season.|$|E
