5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds <b>new</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E

The story was criticized for lacking a cohesive narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said that when it works, the story was worthy of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E

In 1566, the triptych served as the model for a tapestry that hangs at El Escorial monastery near Madrid.|$|E

5|$|By 1978 {{the initial}} {{excavation}} work had uncovered {{a complete and}} coherent site with an intact ship structure and {{the orientation of the}} hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60-degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the Mary Rose survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed <b>new</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains of the hull if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.|$|E

Niebuhr sifted it carefully in order to separate out what genuinely reflected the actual events: stories sourced in persons with personal knowledge, as opposed to inventions created apart from the event and containing suspect information, e.g., legend or folktales thoroughly scrambled with myth and fiction. He relied {{in part on the}} emerging field of source criticism to shed <b>new</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old writings. Niebuhr's Roman History was highly praised.|$|E

25|$|EEG tracings from volunteers during orgasm {{were first}} {{obtained}} by Mosovich and Tallaferro in 1954. These research workers recorded EEC changes resembling petit mal or the clonic {{phase of a}} grand mal seizure. Further studies in this direction were carried out by Sem-Jacobsen (1968), Heath (1972), Cohen et al. (1976), and others. Sarrel et al. reported a similar observation in 1977. These reports continue to be cited. Unlike them, Craber et al. (1985) failed to find any distinctive EEG changes in four men during masturbation and ejaculation; the authors concluded that {{the case for the}} existence of EEG changes specifically related to sexual arousal and orgasm remained unproven. So disagreement arises as to whether the experiment conducted by Mosovich & Tallaferro casts a <b>new</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of orgasm.
