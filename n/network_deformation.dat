40|$|Materials with {{inherent}} network microstructures {{are commonly}} encountered in materials of artificial and natural origin. Examples are polymer elastomers, hydrogels, soft biological tissues, nonwoven fabrics, or cellular foams. On the microscopic level, {{those are all}} composed of elongated one-dimensional elements generally addressed as fibers. When macroscopically deformed, the underlying microstructure undergoes a peculiar deformation resulting in forces produced by the deformed filaments and their interaction within the irregular three-dimensional network. The knowledge about the micromechanics of random networks is therefore of major importance to understand the peculiar mechanical properties displayed by those soft materials. In this presentation, a new mean field approach to describe the microscopic deformation and the homogenization of their elastic response is proposed. Employing the concept of maximal advance paths, a kinematic link between its macroscopic affine path and its microscopic averaged deformation is found and solved numerically through a constraint minimization principle. Remarkably, the network functionality highly influences the constraint formulation. The more fibers are connected at a junction point, the higher is the probability to find among them a fiber oriented closely to the advance direction resulting in an affine <b>network</b> <b>deformation.</b> A non-affine <b>network</b> <b>deformation</b> is observed for a functionality of four, for which the constraint takes a particularly interpretable form, {{as soon as a}} nonlinear fiber response is valid...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A wavelet {{scattering}} network computes {{a translation}} invariant image representation which is stable to deformations and preserves high-frequency information for classification. It cascades wavelet transform convolutions with nonlinear modulus and averaging operators. The first network layer outputs SIFT-type descriptors, whereas the next layers provide complementary invariant information that improves classification. The mathematical analysis of wavelet scattering networks explains important properties of deep convolution networks for classification. A scattering representation of stationary processes incorporates higher order moments and can thus discriminate textures {{having the same}} Fourier power spectrum.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{demonstrate}} that {{the origin of the}} nonlinear elasticity of polymer networks rests in their nonaffine deformations. We introduce the affine length Raff, which separates the solid-like elastic deformations on larger scales from liquid-like nonaffine deformations on smaller scales. This affine length grows with elongation ì as Raff ì 3 / 2 and decreases upon compression as Raff ì 1 / 2. The behavior of networks on scales up to Raff is that of stretched or compressed individual chains (we call them affine strands). The affine strands are stretched in the elongation direction and confined and folded in the effective tubes in the compression direction. The fluctuations of affine strands determine the diameters of the confining tubes a, which change nonaffinely with the <b>network</b> <b>deformation</b> a ì 1 / 2.

It has been observed that axonal damage in traumatic brain injury leads to bundle disorientation, loss of axonal viability, and cognitive impairment. This study investigates the initial mechanical response of axonal microtubule bundles under uniaxial tension using a discrete bead-spring representation. Mechanisms of failure due to traumatic stretch loading {{and their impact on}} the mechanical response and stability are also characterized. This study indicates that cross-linked axonal microtubule bundles in tension display stiffening behavior similar to a power-law relationship from nonaffine <b>network</b> <b>deformations.</b> Stretching of cross-links and microtubule bending were the primary deformation modes at low stresses. Microtubule stretch was negligible up to tensile stresses of ∼ 1 MPa. Bundle failure occurred by failure of cross-links leading to pull-out of microtubules and loss of bundle integrity. This may explain the elongation, undulation, and delayed elasticity of axons following traumatic stretch loading.
