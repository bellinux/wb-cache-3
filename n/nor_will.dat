5|$|Meanwhile, Andy {{shows up}} at Ann's house wearing a fancy suit. He tells her he has matured, gotten an office job {{and would like to}} get back together, but Ann declines. The camera follows Andy as he leaves, {{revealing}} he is actually living in a tent inside the pit. During the Pawnee Today show, Leslie and Marcia argue fiercely. Leslie insists she has not taken a political position, even after Marcia brings up the recent party at the Bulge. They take several callers, all of whom agree that Leslie should resign. Fed up, Leslie adamantly insists she will not resign, <b>nor</b> <b>will</b> she annul the penguin wedding. Later, she visits Ann and insists that Ann go on a date with Mark. The episode ends with Leslie driving the penguins from the Pawnee Zoo to a zoo in Iowa, where same-sex marriage is legal.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, <b>nor</b> <b>will</b> the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, {{a genetic}} linkage test became {{available}} which appears promising. This {{is not a}} test which confirms if a dog has, or {{does not have the}} disease; <b>nor</b> <b>will</b> it definitively predict the disease, as even if a dog is a JDC carrier this does not guarantee its offspring will suffer the disease. It only links certain strains of DNA as carriers of JDC. This is significant in that these strains can now largely be deselected for in the breeding process, as has been successful with GM1 Storage Disease (see above). The test is not yet complete for every bloodline, and why the identified strains are implicated is still unknown, and so in essence the cause of the condition remains a mystery to be solved.|$|E
25|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that three more stores would open at Tuggerah on the New South Wales Central Coast, Woden in Canberra and Robina on the Gold Coast, Queensland. In total, at the time of launching its prospectus, Myer stated it had signed conditional lease agreements for 12 locations to open progressively from 2010 to 2013 with a plan to reach 80 stores by 2014. Myer has since announced that not all of the proposed store openings will occur. The proposed Myer store at East Maitland, west of Newcastle, New South Wales, will no longer open, <b>nor</b> <b>will</b> the store at Woden. It has been rumoured that stores at Tuggerah and Coomera, Queensland will no longer proceed, both of these locations are already served by nearby Myer stores.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016 {{there is}} no commercially {{available}} vaccine that is effective for hantavirus. A vaccine known as Hantavax has been under study since 1990. As of 2016, the development is in clinical phase 3 trial stage. This inactivated vaccine is thought not to be effective against European hantaviruses like the Puumala (PUUV) virus. There is no FDA approved vaccine available and a killed-virus vaccine is not being pursued because of the dangers associated with mass production under high containment {{as well as the}} unresolved questions about the efficiency of the vaccine. However, a number of labs have been working towards a vaccine that would deliver viral antigens by either DNA vectors or as recombinant proteins. While these recombinant vaccines are being developed they are not currently available <b>nor</b> <b>will</b> they be in the near future.|$|E
