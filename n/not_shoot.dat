The {{following}} day Bond watches a mercy flight bringing in maimed and injured Zanzarimi children; he dines alone and returns to his hotel to find that Breed has killed Ogilvy-Grant.|$|E
5|$|In Kamban's Ramavataram, Tara warns about Rama's {{plans to}} kill Vali. However, Vali dismisses her warning as unfounded, arguing that Rama, {{a man of}} dharma, would <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> him when he and Sugriva are in a duel. Vali leaves, {{promising}} Tara that he will slay Sugriva.|$|E
5|$|In films, the gunslinger often {{possesses}} a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen {{of the big}} screen. In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> to disarm or to impress, but to kill.|$|E

50|$|Spielberg {{is an avid}} film buff, and, when <b>not</b> <b>shooting</b> a picture, he {{will watch}} many films in a single weekend. He sees almost every major summer {{blockbuster}} in theaters if not preoccupied and enjoys most of them.|$|R
5|$|After fierce fighting, the Comanches fled. Ross {{and several}} of his men pursued the chief and a second, unknown, rider. As the Rangers neared, the second rider slowed and held a child over her head; the men did <b>not</b> <b>shoot,</b> but instead {{surrounded}} and stopped her. Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually shooting him three times. The chief refused to surrender, even after falling from his horse. Ross's cook, Anton Martinez, who had been a captive in Nocona's band, identified the fallen chief as Nocona. With Ross's permission, Martinez fired the shot that took Nocona's life. Nocona was the only Comanche male to die in the fighting; 13 Comanche women were also killed. Ross's men suffered no casualties.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17weeks. Photography {{then moved to}} the Sahara desert outside {{the small town of}} Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before {{completion}} of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E
5|$|After {{stopping}} one of Fat Tony's operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer {{unless he}} leaves town. Homer {{is unable to}} get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives {{with a few of}} his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—the characters of the Sopranos series. Just before they are about to kill Homer, someone shoots the mobsters and injures them. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation is how he became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his squad car. Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a scoped sporting rifle.|$|E
50|$|Tod departs but is soon {{surrounded}} by Hunter Boyd and his men. In gratitude for <b>not</b> <b>shooting</b> Tom Boyd {{when he had}} the chance, Hunter Boyd permits a horse and a four-hour headstart to Tod, then resumes the chase.|$|R
50|$|Example of {{spontaneous}} {{events that are}} <b>not</b> <b>shoots</b> include mistakes by wrestlers (these are known as botches) or matches where the wrestlers are good enough to not need to plan and rehearse beforehand and can make {{it up on the}} spot as time dictates.|$|R
40|$|Regeneration {{of whole}} plants from cell {{cultures}} {{has been a}} primary objective. Several cultivars cultured in a liquid medium (Miller, 1965) with 0. 5 mg/liter IAA and kinetin and 1. 0 mg/liter 2, 4 -D have developed compact spherical structures, 0. 5 to 2. 0 mm in diameter, composed of vascular elements enclosed in a compact sheath of parenchyma cells. These structures readily develop roots but <b>not</b> <b>shoots.</b> Altered levels and combinations of plant growth regulators have <b>not</b> promoted <b>shoot</b> differentiation in these cultures...|$|R
5|$|Levels {{include a}} variety of {{anthropomorphic}} vegetable enemies, such as potatoes and squash, each with different movement patterns and attacks. Levels can also include hazards, such as water or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Unlike the previous game, Keen can <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout the levels called flower power to throw at enemies. If an enemy is hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do not hit an enemy can be retrieved by the player. The player can also find food items {{in the form of}} sweets throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded if the player earns enough points, as well as figures of Keen that grant an extra life. Placed throughout the levels are collectible bombs, which the player must use at least twelve of in order to defeat the final boss of the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel {{arrived on}} 12 May 1915 {{and took over}} the {{critical}} sector, which included Pope's Hill and Quinn's, Courtney's and Steele's Posts, from Colonel John Monash. Open to Turkish observation on two sides, these four advanced posts {{at the top of}} Monash Valley were the linchpin of the defence. Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts. He also formed special sniper groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley. Chauvel's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Cannan was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major S. C. E. Herring was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E
60|$|The Times, I could see, was {{not going}} to be of much {{assistance}} to me. I lit a cigarette, and remarked that he was <b>not</b> <b>shooting.</b> He admitted the fact. Under the circumstances, it would have taxed him to deny it, but the necessity for confession aroused him.|$|R

5|$|Jacques {{joined the}} Quebec Citadelles in 1947. It was while {{playing for the}} Citadelles that Plante started to play the puck outside his crease. He {{developed}} this technique when he recognized that the team's defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante's unconventional playing style to be exciting, but it angered his managers. They believed that a goaltender should stay in net and let his players recover the puck. Plante {{had come to the}} conclusion that as long as he was in control of the puck, the opponents could <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> it at him – this is now standard practice for goaltenders. The same season, the Citadelles beat the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the league finals, with Plante being named most valuable player on his team. The Montreal Canadiens' general manager, Frank J. Selke, became interested in acquiring Plante as a member of the team. In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens' training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract with the Canadiens' organization. Plante played for Montreal's affiliate Royal Montreal Hockey Club, earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.|$|E
25|$|Greensome (also {{known as}} Scotch Foursomes): also called {{modified}} alternate shot, this is played in pairs; both players tee off, and then pick {{the best shot}} as in a scramble. The player who did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> the best first shot plays the second shot. The play then alternates as in a foursome. A variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's tee shots the opponents should use. The player who did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> the chosen first shot plays the second shot. Play then continues as a greensome.|$|E
25|$|Later, Hardin and Mac Young were {{supposedly}} stopped near Bellville, Texas by a posse under Sheriff Charles Langhammer of Austin {{on suspicion}} of being horse thieves. Hardin pulled his guns on Langhammer but did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> him, fleeing instead; Young was arrested and fined $100 for having a concealed pistol.|$|E

25|$|Soviet {{partisan}} units {{present in}} the area {{were aware of the}} massacres. On May 25, 1943, the commander of the Soviet partisan forces of the Rivne area stressed in his report to the headquarters that Ukrainian nationalists did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> the Poles but cut them dead with knives and axes, with no consideration for age or gender.|$|E
25|$|Weiss's son, Carl Weiss, Jr., {{an infant}} {{at the time}} of his father's death, has since vigorously disputed the assertion. In a 1993 {{interview}} on the NBC program Unsolved Mysteries, he proffered the assertion that Long was accidentally shot by one of his own bodyguards. Donald Pavy, a medical doctor and relative of Judge Pavy, conducted a scientific study of the case and concluded in his book Accident and Deception: The Huey Long Shooting that Weiss did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> the governor.|$|E
25|$|Strange and Quinn are {{employed}} to locate Olivia Elliot by Mario Durham. They find her quickly {{and pass the}} information to Durham. Durham rents a gun from Ulysses Foreman and approaches Elliot. They argue and he murders her and conceals her body in the woods. He returns the gun to Foreman and admits to firing it but claims he did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> anyone. Foreman rents the gun to Mario's brother Dewayne for Jerome Long. Mario goes into hiding with his friend Donut.|$|E

25|$|The {{first half}} of the National Championship Game {{featured}} 13 lead changes and the two evenly matched teams traded baskets. Duke held the largest lead of the half at six points. Wisconsin did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> well early, but managed 11 second chance points as they erased the deficit. At the half, the game was tied 31–31, marking the first such tie since 1988. Wisconsin, which led the nation in fewest committed fouls per game, recorded just two first half fouls. Duke meanwhile committed seven fouls. Jahill Okafor sat the final 4:47 of the first half after picking up two fouls.|$|E
25|$|Folorunso Owusu {{pleaded not}} guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of {{attempted}} murder against Nahom Tsezagab, two counts of aggravated assault, and one charge of reckless discharging of a firearm. (Multiple charges of criminal negligence causing bodily harm were severed in a pre-trial motion.) The defence maintained during the seven-week trial that Owusu was innocent and a victim of circumstance, shot while attending the party. The Crown provided a recording of Naod Tsegazab in the courthouse cells identifying Owusu, by nickname, as his brother's shooter. However, Naod testified that he invented the story to look tougher in jail, and Nahom Tsegazab testified that Owusu did <b>not</b> <b>shoot</b> him.|$|E
25|$|After limited fighting, the Comanches {{realized}} they were losing and attempted to flee. Ranger Ross {{and several of his}} men pursued the man whom they had seen giving orders. The chief was fleeing alongside a woman rider. As Ross and his men neared, she held a child over her head. The men did <b>not</b> <b>shoot,</b> but instead surrounded and stopped her. Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually shooting him three times. Although he fell off his horse, he was still alive and refused to surrender. Ross's cook, Antonio Martinez, who had been taken captive and tortured in Mexico after Nocona killed his family, identified him as Nocona. With Ross's permission, Martinez killed Nocona.|$|E
