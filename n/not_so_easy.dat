25|$|At {{the fifteenth}} attempt {{since the war}} we won at Melbourne...It was then that I felt that the great Australian team was just {{beginning}} to deteriorate. The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{disadvantages}} {{of the system}} were <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to address. For example, the gull-wing design makes creating a convertible version of the car harder, as the hinges would be removed with the roof, and standard doors would be needed for the convertible. Mercedes did so when replacing the gullwing coupe altogether with the 300SL roadster in 1958. It was never a concern for DeLorean since no convertible version was ever planned.|$|E

25|$|In this {{approach}} the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry {{a wealth of}} melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison {{between the two groups}} has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.|$|E
25|$|Immanuel Kant {{regarded}} masturbation as {{a violation}} of the moral law. In the Metaphysics of Morals (1797) he made the a posteriori argument that 'such an unnatural use of one's sexual attributes' strikes 'everyone upon his thinking of it' as 'a violation of one's duty to himself', and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that 'it is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use', but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that 'a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive'.|$|E

500|$|The film {{features}} a prevalent Moroccan chant {{of the phrase}} deshi basara (proper transliteration: Tījī basara’ah) (Arabic: تيجي بسرعة), which translates to [...] "rise up" [...] (literally: [...] "come quickly"). In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant {{to be used in}} the film's score. When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, [...] "The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing.

500|$|When Black {{opts for}} 10...Bxd2, {{he runs the}} risk to end up a tempo down over the 7.a3 {{variation}} and to be soon unable to meet White's positional threats on the queenside. White can avoid the push a2–a3 and continue with the standard plans of the 7.a3 variation. However, everything is not that bad for Black. First, to implement his plan White has to concentrate on development (9.Be2, 10.0-0) before he turns {{his attention to the}} queenside. That means Black has more time to organise his play than in the 7.a3 variation, notably to attempt a blockade of the c5-square. Moreover, as White does not put immediate pressure on Black's position, Black is not compelled to castle rapidly and he can keep his king in the centre for a longer time, or even castle queenside. Hence Lalic note that [...] "White has not wasted time with a2–a3, but in fact it is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to capitalise on this extra tempo." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Rowson, White's first {{advantage}} is that, [...] "The {{advantage of the}} first move has some similarities with the serve in tennis in that White can score an 'ace' (for instance with a powerful opening novelty), he has {{more control over the}} pace and direction of the game, and he has a 'second serve' in that when things go wrong his position is not usually losing." [...] Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, [...] "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players." [...] Third, some players are able to use the initiative to [...] "play a kind of powerful 'serve and volley' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess." [...] Fourth, [...] "If White wants to draw, it is often <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> for Black to prevent this. This {{advantage is}} particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition, because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether White is bluffing." ...|$|E
500|$|The move 6.Be3 {{takes the}} a7–g1 {{diagonal}} from Black's Bf8 and may in some lines prepare the long castle. After the mandatory 6...Bb4+ White can opt for 7.Nd2 {{to avoid having}} doubled pawns, but he {{must be prepared to}} sacrifice a pawn after 7...Qe7 8.Kf2!? Bxd2 9.Qxd2 Qxe4 10.Bd3 with piece activity for the pawn deficit, because the normal defence 8.Bd3? runs into 8...Qd6! and both the Bd3 and the f4-pawn are attacked. White does not need, however, bother too much about the doubled pawns and after 7.Nc3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 a peaceful black player might choose the quiet 8...b6!? followed by a normal development with d6/0-0/Bb7/Nd7/Re8/Nc5. Instead of 8...b6 a more adventurous black player could choose 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 f5!? as indicated by Borik, Tseitlin and Lalic, but in his more recent book Moskalenko thinks [...] "this move complicates the game too much". If the black player is neither peaceful nor aggressive, Lalic proposes an alternative with 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 0-0 10.Qd2 and only now that Black has his king safe shall he unleash 10...f5!?, when [...] "it is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> for White to meet [...] as the two main responses, 11.e5 and 11.exf5, allow Black promising chances with 11...d6 and 11...Nxf4 respectively".|$|E
