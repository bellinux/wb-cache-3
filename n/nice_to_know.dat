500|$|Laptop Magazines Michael Prospero {{praised the}} 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it [...] "bright and crisp". He further commented, [...] "While {{reflections}} from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's also <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> there's an antiglare option—though {{only for the}} higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally." [...] He also lauded {{the quality of the}} iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15" [...] model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are. It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that you people thought I did a good job. And don't forget that it was a good part, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and has been}} cited by many critics {{as one of the}} best in the series, with several commentators calling the twist ending shocking, unexpected and likely to change the direction of the entire series. Entertainment Weekly television writer Ken Tucker praised the twist of the episode, which he said [...] "sent the series spinning into a whole new direction for next season". Tucker praised the Dexter writing staff, [...] "for maintaining the suspense while creating a whole new world within the Dexter world: the awful universe of Trinity and his own trapped family." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun said the episode was good before the final scene, but that the twist shed a whole different light on several scenes. Harris said of the twist, [...] "It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> TV can still be that impactful, isn't it? But my God, what a stunner." ...|$|E

It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> we'll {{be back with our}} good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted with just the right about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{trained and}} rode his first World Grand Championship {{on the bay}} {{stallion}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held {{in front of a}} record crowd of 28,000. [...] "Rebel" [...] was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the [...] "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, [...] "I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've never seen anything like it. That made it twice as good. It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I've got that many friends and supporters." [...] The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired.|$|E
500|$|The reveal of Sheriff Lamb's {{death was}} not leaked {{anywhere}} online prior to the airing of [...] "Mars, Bars", something about which Muhney was happy. He stated that [...] "the surprise was the best part" [...] and that he disliked it when spoilers from other series were released early. After the episode's initial airing, Muhney reported that his inbox was flooded with emails from press members seeking interviews, stating that new messages came after the airing in each United States time zone. Some fans were upset about his death, and debate occurred online. However, Muhney also received messages {{of support for the}} character, commenting [...] "it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that he will be missed." [...] With the announcement of the Veronica Mars film in 2013, Zap2it speculated that Muhney might return; however, this was later revealed not to be the case when the official casting was announced. Thomas praised Daran Norris's performance in the episode, particularly his voice in the scene in which he defends Steve Botando in front of Sheriff Lamb. Thomas noted that Norris was also a voice actor and that he was particularly well-liked on the set for his humorous performances.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary reviews were mixed. Chris Welch of Melody Maker {{praised the}} musicianship {{of the band}} and Anderson's flute playing, writing also that [...] "the joke {{at the expense of}} a local {{newspaper}} wears thin rather rapidly, but should not detract from the obvious amount of thought and work that has gone into the production of Thick"; he described the music as a creative effort where [...] "the ideas flow in super abundance" [...] but that [...] "needs time to absorb" [...] and [...] "heard out of context of their highly visual stage act... does not have such immediate appeal". Tony Tyler in his review for New Musical Express generally appreciated the construction of the suites and the arrangements, but he had doubts about the album's possible success. He called Thick as a Brick [...] "Jethro Tull's own stand-or-fall epic after the lines of Tommy" [...] and [...] "an assault on the mediocrity and harshness of lower-middle-class existence in '70s Britain". Ben Gerson in Rolling Stone magazine called Thick as a Brick [...] "one of rock's most sophisticated and ground-breaking products". Going further, the reviewer stated: [...] "Martin Barre's guitar and John Evan's keyboards especially shine, and Ian's singing is no longer abrasive. Whether or not Thick As A Brick is an isolated experiment, it is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that someone in rock has ambitions beyond the four- or five-minute conventional track, and has the intelligence to carry out his intentions, in all their intricacy, with considerable grace." [...] Rolling Stones Dave Marsh gave it 2 out of 5 stars in The Rolling Stone Record Guide, judging it had [...] "relatively undifferentiated movements". American critic Robert Christgau disliked the album, calling it [...] "the usual shit: rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice)".|$|E

Nick recorded his new record at my studio, and then he was going to drop off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.'

2500|$|Australia did {{not make}} it out of the group stage in the 1983 Cricket World Cup, winning only two of their six matches played. Hughes' team was embarrassed by a loss in their first match against Zimbabwe, at the time a mainly amateur side. There was a chance that Australia could still make the semi-finals with a win against India. Hughes chose to sit out the match, to give a minor injury time to heal. In his absence the Australian team was {{dismissed}} for 129 and bundled out of the tournament. Hughes decision {{to pull out of the}} match drew some criticism from the Australian press: [...] "Hughes decision not to play was lamentable [...] this Australian team does not have a capable leader." [...] On his return to Australia, David Hookes publicly advocated for Rod Marsh to be appointed Australian captain in Hughes' place, saying on Adelaide radio, [...] "Maybe Kim has got to be an apprentice to someone everyone respects." [...] Hughes replied 'It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the Australian captain has got the support of his vice-captain." [...] Under some pressure from cricket officials, Hughes was persuaded that he should stand down from the captaincy and a letter was drafted to this effect; he changed his mind the following morning.|$|E

The young people talked across Mrs. March to each other, and said how charming the islands were, in their gray-green insubstantiality, with valleys furrowing them far inward, like airy clefts in low banks of clouds.
