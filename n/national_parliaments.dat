5|$|The {{nature of}} the European Parliament is better {{compared}} with the United States House of Representatives than with the <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> of the European Union. This is notable {{in terms of the}} committees being of greater size and power, political parties being very decentralised and it being separated from the executive branch (most national governments operate under a parliamentary system). A difference from all other parliaments is the absence of a Parliamentary legislative initiative. However, given that in most <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> initiatives not backed by the executive rarely succeed the value of this difference is in question. Equally, its independence and power means that the European Parliament has an unusually high success rate for its amendments in comparison to national parliaments; 80% average and 30% for controversial proposals.|$|E
5|$|The parliamentarians {{are known}} in English as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected {{every five years}} by {{universal}} adult suffrage and sit according to political allegiance; about a third are women. Before 1979 they were appointed by their <b>national</b> <b>parliaments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite this, {{the seat}} of the European Parliament remains controversial. The work of Parliament is divided between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, which is seen as a problem due to the large number of MEPs, staff, and {{documents}} which need to be moved. As the locations of the major seats have been enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, Parliament has no right to decide its own seat, unlike other <b>national</b> <b>parliaments.</b>|$|E

50|$|Gao/Bugotu is a {{single-member}} constituency of the <b>National</b> <b>Parliament</b> of Solomon Islands. Located on Santa Isabel Island, it {{was established}} in 1993 when the <b>National</b> <b>Parliament</b> was expanded from 38 to 47 seats.|$|R
5000|$|<b>National</b> <b>Parliament</b> has 65 members, elected every 5 {{years through}} party-list {{proportional}} representation voting. The {{three main components}} of concerning parliament in East Timor are the <b>National</b> <b>Parliament,</b> the Prime Minister, and the President.|$|R
5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President. This would be a stopgap solution until direct election became possible. Yet it would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E
5|$|Since 2003, Croatian {{foreign policy}} has focused on {{achieving}} the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union (EU). In December 2011, Croatia completed the EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking {{the end of a}} process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003. A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia's ICTY co-operation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of Croatia–Slovenia border disputes. The latter was resolved through an Arbitration Agreement of 4 November 2009, approved by <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> and a referendum in Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{differs from}} the other {{institutions}} in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU. Only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed {{in the field of}} the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the other fields the Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> holding the right in some respects. However, the Council and Parliament may request the Commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions. Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens are also able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but this is not binding.|$|E

25|$|The Treaty of Lisbon allows <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> {{eight weeks}} to study {{legislative}} proposals {{made by the}} European Commission and decide whether to send a reasoned opinion stating why the national parliament considers it to be incompatible with the principle of subsidiarity. <b>National</b> <b>parliaments</b> may vote to have the measure reviewed. If one third (or one quarter, where the proposed EU measure concerns freedom, justice and security) of <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> are in favour of a review, the Commission would have to review the measure and if it decides to maintain it, must give a reasoned opinion to the Union legislator as to why it considers the measure to be compatible with subsidiarity.|$|E

25|$|In June 2010, a broad {{agreement}} was finally reached on a controversial proposal for {{member states to}} peer review each other's budgets prior to their presentation to <b>national</b> <b>parliaments.</b> Although showing the entire budget to each other was opposed by Germany, Sweden and the UK, each government would present to their peers and the Commission their estimates for growth, inflation, revenue and expenditure levels six months before they go to <b>national</b> <b>parliaments.</b> If a country was to run a deficit, {{they would have to}} justify it {{to the rest of the}} EU while countries with a debt more than 60% of GDP would face greater scrutiny.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{each state}} is {{assigned}} seats in Parliament {{according to their}} population (again, with the smaller countries receiving more seats per inhabitant than the larger ones).

25|$|There {{was also}} a {{contrast}} with other Class A Mandates. By 1932 Iraq was independent, and Syria, Lebanon and Transjordan had <b>national</b> <b>parliaments,</b> Arab government officials up {{to the rank of}} minister, and substantial power in Arabs hands. In other Arab countries there were also indigenous state structures, except in some countries like Libya and Algeria, which, like Palestine, were subject to settler colonialism.|$|E
25|$|The Council's two {{statutory}} {{bodies are}} the Committee of Ministers, comprising the foreign ministers of each member state, and the Parliamentary Assembly, composed {{of members of}} the <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> of each member state. The Commissioner for Human Rights is an independent institution within the Council of Europe, mandated to promote awareness of and respect for human rights in the member states. The Secretary General heads the secretariat of the organisation. Other major CoE bodies include the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines.|$|E
25|$|The European Union, {{after the}} Lisbon Treaty entered into force, can be {{characterized}} as a transnational sui generis political and legal entity. The Institutions of the European Union derive their authority based upon sovereign rights delegated by member states to Brussels. Institutions of the European Union have no sovereign rights but may enter into treaties (subject to ratification in <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> of EU member states) in those fields where competence has been fully delegated to the European Union. Under international law, sovereign legitimacy resides in the national capitals of the member States of the European Union.|$|E

25|$|A {{succession}} of controversial political appointments {{to the highest}} offices of the Institutions of the European Union - who have failed to garner favourable public opinion for their vision of the European project and demonstrate leadership required to steer the European project - has resulted in successful electoral challenges to prevent any further devolution of sovereignty from the <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> to the Institutions of the European Union in Brussels. European electorates have become deeply suspicious of the democratic deficit, corporate lobbying activities and opacity of political arrangements brokered in Brussels. The transition from authoritarian rule to libertarian democracy has not been fully completed by Eastern European countries and is affecting the elimination of corruption & nepotism, religious & ethnic tolerance, humanitarian solidarity, respect of human rights, etc.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to the National Union of Seamen as a full-time official before being elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Hull East in 1970, succeeding Commander Harry Pursey, the retiring Labour MP. The defeated Conservative challenger was Norman Lamont. Previously, he had attempted to become MP for Southport in 1966, but came in second place, approximately 9,500 votes behind the Conservative candidate. From July 1975 to 1979, he concurrently served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and Leader of the Labour Group, when its members were nominated by the <b>national</b> <b>Parliaments.</b> In 1988 Prescott and Eric Heffer challenged Roy Hattersley for the deputy leadership of the party, but Roy Hattersley was reelected as deputy leader. Prescott stood again in the 1992 deputy leadership election, following Hattersley's retirement, but lost to Margaret Beckett.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{is divided}} between unicameral (single chamber) and {{bicameral}} (dual chamber) parliaments, with 15 unicameral <b>national</b> <b>parliaments</b> and 13 bicameral parliaments. The {{prime minister and}} government are usually directly accountable to the directly elected lower house and require its support to stay in office—the exception being Cyprus with its presidential system. Upper houses are composed differently in different member states: it can be directly elected like the Polish senate, indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures like the Federal Council of Austria, unelected, but representing certain interest groups like the National Council of Slovenia, unelected (though by and large appointed by elected officials) as a remnant of a non-democratic political system in earlier times (as in the House of Lords in the United Kingdom). Most (though not all) elections in the EU use some form of proportional representation. The {{most common type of}} proportional representation is the party-list system.|$|E
