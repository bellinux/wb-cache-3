40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} effect {{and characteristics of}} lens loop extracting <b>nucleus</b> <b>method,</b> water irrigation and nucleus fragmentation within anterior chamber in small incision cataract surgery with non-phacoemulsification. METHODS:There were 324 cases(324 eyes) with senile cataract randomly divided into three groups, by the lens loop extracting nucleus method(group A), water irrigation(group B) and nucleus fragmentation within anterior chamber(group C), to complete the process of nucleus division. The time of nuclear removal, complication during operation, the degree of edema of corneal endothelium {{on the first day}} after the surgery and visual acuity after surgery were observed and recorded. RESULTS:The average extracting nucleus time was 45 s in lens loop(group A); 34 s in water irrigation(group B) and 65 s in manual fragmentation(group C). The differences of average time are statistically significant(P P P > 0. 05). Regarding the visual acuity on the first day after surgery, the difference between group A and group C, group B and group C were statistically significant(P P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION:Manual fragmentation has obvious advantages in removing nuclear above Ⅳ grade; The water irrigation method has fewer complications with low incidence of corner edema, which is more preferable in removing the nuclear below Ⅳ grade...|$|E
40|$|Nabilone is a {{synthetic}} cannabinoid with a potent agonist effect on CB 1 cannabinoid receptors, {{involved in the}} regulation of nausea, vomiting, appetite, movement and pain. Several clinical trials confirm the effectiveness of nabilone in treating anxiety and pain associated with fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. Nabilone, in man, shows its analgesic/anti-inflammatory activity, and its modulation of allodynia without having significant psychotropic effects. Modification of endogenous cannabinoid (anandamide) {{has been found in}} animal model of pain, inflammation and neurological disease. Anandamide and cannabidiol are weak agonists of TPRV 1 receptors, normally activated by noxious physical/thermal stimuli or by inflammatory hyperalgesia. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of Nabilone and combination of acetaminophen plus caffeine in acute and chronic treatment on hyperalgesia induced by nitro-glycerine (NTG), using tail flick test, in rats. We choose nitro-glycerine as nitric oxide (NO) donor; infusion of NO induces delayed headache in migraineurs and activity of neurons in the spinal trigeminal <b>nucleus.</b> <b>Method</b> 12 Adult male Wistar rats (weight range: 180 - 355 g) were treated, in acute, with nabilone (2, 5 mg/kg p. o.), acetaminophen plus caffeine (400 mg/Kg p. o. + 52 mg/Kg p. o.); and, in chronic (8 days) with nabilone (1 mg/Kg p. o.), acetaminophen plus caffeine (200 mg/Kg p. o. + 26 mg/Kg p. o.), or vehicle, 1 h before the i. p. injection of NTG (10 mg/kg) (18 - 20 degrees C). Tail flick test was performed during acute treatment, 2 - 4 hours after injection of NTG; during chronic treatment after a period of 8 days. The test has been conducted with a tail flick device that use a 375 -W movie light focused on the rat’s tail (2 - 3 cm from the tip) by means of a condenser lens positioned below the light source. The latency time (sec) was evaluated as the time between the beginning of test and the deviation of tail. The highest execution time to avoid tissue damage was 15 sec. Results The treatment with nabilone increased the latency time, during tail flick test vs. controls; in fact the latency time was 15 ± 0. 8 sec. (mean ± SD) and 10 ± 0. 5 sec. (mean ± SD), respectively in acute and in chronic treatment; rats treated with acetaminophen, 400 or 200 mg/Kg p. o. plus caffeine 52 or 26 mg/kg p. o., respectively, in acute and in chronic administration did not show changes vs. controls (2, 7 ± 0. 3 sec.; ANOVA and Bonferroni‘ s test; p< 0. 05). Conclusion The data supported the efficacy of nabilone in the management of acute and chronic pain. Our main interest was to explore its potential use in the treatment of chronic headache, providing a novel target for an innovative therapeutic approach.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{create a}} more {{effective}} selection standard for early embryos, we developed a new grading system consisting of conventional morphological evaluation in combination with analysis of blastomere nuclei. METHODS: A total of 744 embryos used during 459 cycles of embryo transfer on day 2 and blastocyst transfer were subjected to retrospective analysis. The overall implantation rate was 15. 5 % (115 / 744). Morphological evaluation of the embryos was performed on day 2 by referring to both the size of blastomere and fragmentation (conventional method) and the nucleic features of the blastomeresÐeither multinucleated or anucleic (<b>nuclei</b> counting <b>method).</b> The implantation rate for every transferred embryo and blastocyst was examined. RESULTS: Although a high implantation rate was observed with the highest quality embryos as judged by either the conventional method (24. 1 %; 57 / 237) or the <b>nuclei</b> counting <b>method</b> (26. 1 %; 104 / 399), the <b>nuclei</b> counting <b>method</b> predicted implantation rate better than the conventional method. The embryos that {{were considered to be}} high quality according to the conventional method, but low quality according to the <b>nuclei</b> counting <b>method,</b> had a limited implantation success rate of 6. 3 % (4 / 66). Also, after blastocyst transfer, implantation occurred most often when high quality embryos evaluated by the <b>nuclei</b> counting <b>method</b> were used (25. 5 %; 25 / 98), while the blastocysts from low quality embryos seldom implanted (3. 2 %; 2 / 63).

40|$|The <b>nucleus</b> {{exchange}} <b>method</b> {{was originally}} developed for producing phenols from lignin. This method {{is a combination}} of alkylation and dealkylation in the presence of boron trifluoride and phenol. This method includes three reaction steps, which proceed simultaneously in the single reaction system containing phenol and boron trifluoride: first, the formation of diphenylmethane type structures by phenolation of the side chains; second, the exchange of lignin phenyl nuclei for phenol; finally, the demethylation of methoxyl group. That is, in this process, Cα-aryl carbon-carbon linkages in phenylpropane units are selectively and quantitatively cleaved,releasing phenyl nuclei typified by guaiacol from guaiacyl (softwood) lignins. The guaiacol subsequently is partially demethylated to catechol. In the present paper,the application of nucleus exchange technique to lignin structural analysis is discussed in detail,following the theory,mechanism,and procedure of <b>nucleus</b> exchange <b>method.</b> 核交換法は,リグニンの側鎖一芳香核間結合を選択的かつ定量的に解裂させる手法である。本法は，三フッ化ホウ 素およびフェノールの存在下における芳香核のアルキル化と脱アルキル化のコンビネーションに基づく。核交換法とニトロベンゼン酸化分解の併用によって，複合体からリグニンを単離することなくリグニンの芳香核組成が迅速に計算される。本手法は,特にリグニンの二次縮合構遷として重要なジフェニルメタン型構造単位の解析手段として有用である...|$|R

40|$|Background: Generating good {{training}} datasets {{is essential}} for machine learning-based <b>nuclei</b> detection <b>methods.</b> However, creating exhaustive nuclei contour annotations, to derive optimal training data from, is often infeasible. Methods: We compared different approaches for training <b>nuclei</b> detection <b>methods</b> solely based on nucleus center markers. Such markers contain less accurate information, {{especially with regard to}} nuclear boundaries, but can be produced much easier and in greater quantities. The approaches use different automated sample extraction methods to derive image positions and class labels from nucleus center markers. In addition, the approaches use different automated sample selection methods to improve the detection quality of the classification algorithm and reduce the run time of the training process. We evaluated the approaches based on a previously published generic nuclei detection algorithm and a set of Ki- 67 -stained breast cancer images. Results: A Voronoi tessellation-based sample extraction method produced the best performing training sets. However, subsampling of the extracted training samples was crucial. Even simple class balancing improved the detection quality considerably. The incorporation of active learning led to a further increase in detection quality. Conclusions: With appropriate sample extraction and selection <b>methods,</b> <b>nuclei</b> detection algorithms trained on the basis of simple center marker annotations can produce comparable quality to algorithms trained on conventionally created training sets...|$|R
