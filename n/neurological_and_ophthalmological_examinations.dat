40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{aimed to}} assess the {{presence}} of minor complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) referred to electroneurography (ENG) laboratory for evaluation of neuropathy. In addition, the relationship between duration of disease, electrophysiologic findings, neurological examination findings, plasma glycated hemoglobin A 1 C levels, glucose levels and microvascular complications were examined. Materials and Methods: One hundred seventy patients with type 2 diabetes were included. Age, gender, duration of disease, results of ophthalmological examinations, neuropathic complaints, electrophysiological examination results, neurological examination findings and laboratory examination results including blood glucose and A 1 C levels, presence of albuminuria were recorded retrospectively. Results: Abnormal ENG findings were found in one hundred forty patients (82. 4 %). In all patients, the rate of retinopathy was 34. 1 % {{and the rate of}} albuminuria was 19. 4 %. The rate of polyneuropathy (PNP(was 78. 2 % in patients with abnormal neurologic examination. Neuropathic complaints and PNP were found to be related with the presence of retinopathy. The rate of retinopathy was higher in patients with albuminuria. Significant relationship was found between disease duration and retinopathy, PNP and neuropathic complaints. Conclusions: This study emphasizes that detailed history, <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> are easy, cost-effective and reliable examinations in follow-up of type 2 diabetics.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the prevalence and the outcome of OPG in 200 NF 1 patients (122 males and 78 females, aged 1 - 25 years) followed up to 16 years (mean of 6 years). METHODS: All children were evaluated by a detailed physical, <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examination.</b> Fifteen out of 200 (7. 5 %) of these patients (7 males, 8 females) were identified with evidence of optic pathway tumours. RESULTS: Nine children had symptoms such as endocranial hypertension, seizures, headache; 4 patients only showed anomalies at ophthalmological examination; 2 patients had no symptoms or signs. All children had evidence of optic pathway tumour on magnetic resonance imaging. Three had a prechiasmal tumour, 2 had a chiasmal tumour, 1 had prechiasmal/chiasmal tumour, 2 had a prechiasmal/chiasmal and postchiasmal tumour, 2 had a chiasmal and postchiasmal tumour, 4 had a massive involvement of the optic system, 1 child exhibited a bilateral involvement of the optic nerves with additional impairment of the chiasm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated {{disease of}} the Central Nervous System with two major {{underlying}} etiopathogenic processes: inflammation and neurodegeneration. The latter determines the prognosis of this disease. MS is {{the main cause of}} non-traumatic disability in middle-aged populations. FINDINGS: The MS-VisualPath Cohort was set up to study the neurodegenerative component of MS using advanced imaging techniques by focusing on analysis of the visual pathway in a middle-aged MS population in Barcelona, Spain. We started the recruitment of patients in the early phase of MS in 2010 and it remains permanently open. All patients undergo a complete <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examination</b> including measurements of physical and disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale; Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite and neuropsychological tests), disease activity (relapses) and visual function testing (visual acuity, color vision and visual field). The MS-VisualPath protocol also assesses the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), general quality of life (SF- 36) and visual quality of life (25 -Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire with the 10 -Item Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement). In addition, the imaging protocol includes both retinal (Optical Coherence Tomography and Wide-Field Fundus Imaging) and brain imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Finally, multifocal Visual Evoked Potentials are used to perform neurophysiological assessment of the visual pathway. DISCUSSION: The analysis of the visual pathway with advance imaging and electrophysilogical tools in parallel with clinical information will provide significant and new knowledge regarding neurodegeneration in MS and provide new clinical and imaging biomarkers to help monitor disease progression in these patients...|$|R

Our study was a cohort one, with an index and a comparison group. Neonatal medical records of all preterm newborns admitted to our centre between 1991 and 1997 were reviewed and selected patients were recalled. The sample population included two matched groups of children aged 6 — 12 years, 86 twins and 86 singletons, submitted to paediatric, <b>neurological,</b> psychological, <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations.</b> Inclusion criteria were twin pregnancy and gestational age 27 — 36 weeks for index group; same gestational age, but single pregnancy, for the comparison group. All children underwent paediatric and neuropsychiatric examinations, cognitive assessment, and psychological evaluation by standardized tests for screening of learning specific disorders and language difficulties, <b>and</b> finally, <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examination.</b> In order to study their role in predicting neuropsychological outcome, we examined some perinatal prognostic factors by statistical analysis.

40|$|Purpose:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the genetic cause of early-onset autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia associated with retinal dystrophy in a consanguineous family. Methods:An affected 6 -month-old child underwent <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations.</b> Genetic analyses included homozygosity mapping, copy number analysis, conventional polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and whole-exome sequencing. Expression analysis of GRID 2 was performed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Results:A homozygous deletion of exon 2 of GRID 2 (p. Gly 30 _Glu 81 del) was identified in the proband. GRID 2 encodes an ionotropic glutamate receptor known to be selectively expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, we demonstrated GRID 2 expression in human adult retina and retinal pigment epithelium. In addition, Grid 2 expression was demonstrated in different stages of murine retinal development. GRID 2 immunostaining was shown in murine and human retina. Whole-exome sequencing in the proband did not provide arguments for other disease-causing mutations, supporting the idea that the phenotype observed represents a single clinical entity. Conclusion:We identified GRID 2 as an underlying disease gene of early-onset autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with retinal dystrophy, expanding the clinical spectrum of GRID 2 deletion mutants. We demonstrated for the first time GRID 2 expression and localization in human and murine retina, providing evidence for a novel functional role of GRID 2 in the retina.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe leukoencephalopathy, lacunar infarcts, microbleeds and macrobleeds in the context of a collagen IV A 1 mutation. Methods: We examined a family with autosomal dominant porencephaly, in whom a defect in collagen IV A 1 was detected recently. The patients underwent <b>neurological,</b> <b>ophthalmological,</b> <b>and</b> cardiological <b>examinations</b> and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Electron microscopy of a skin biopsy was performed. Extensive laboratory screening was performed for thrombophilia and increased bleeding tendency. Results: The porencephaly was symptomatic in the infantile period in two patients, whereas it led to only minor neurological dysfunction in their affected mother. However, she experienced development of recurrent strokes in her 40 s. In addition to the porencephaly, all patients had a leukoencephalopathy, which was most severe in the mother. Her magnetic resonance imaging results also showed lacunar infarcts, macrobleeds and a multitude of microbleeds. No other risk factors for recurrent stroke were found. Electron microscopy showed interruptions of the basement membrane of skin capillaries and inhomogeneous thickening of the basement membrane with pools of basement membrane fragments. Interpretation: Leukoencephalopathy, ischemic infarcts, microbleeds, and macrobleeds are indicative of an underlying microangiopathy, of which the best-known causes are hypertension, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Mutations in collagen IV A 1, a major component of the vascular basement membrane, appear to be another risk factor...|$|R

Methods: All affected individuals underwent a detailed <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>and</b> clinical <b>examination.</b> Blood {{samples were collected}} and genomic DNAs were extracted. A genome-wide scan was performed with polymorphic microsatellite markers. Logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were calculated, and Eph-receptor type-A 2 (EPHA 2), residing in the critical interval, was sequenced bidirectionally. Results: The clinical <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> suggested that all affected individuals have nuclear cataracts. Genome-wide linkage analyses localized the critical interval to a 20. 78 cM (15. 08 Mb) interval on chromosome 1 p, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 5. 21 at θ= 0.

40|$|An {{integrated}} farming system between rice and beef cattle was initiated in 2000 in Sukamandi, West Java. However, since 2002 some cattle were suffering from <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> ophthamological signs, {{and some of}} them were found dead after consuming rice straws. Field studies showed that 6 out of 12 cattle were suffered from eye disorders such as blindness, corneal opacity and sereous lacrimation. Two of 6 cattle were severely affected. But, neurological signs were not found during field observation. Pesticide analysis in rice straws shows that both groups of pesticide, organochlorines (OP) and organophosphates (OP) were detected. Residues of OC were higher than OP as shown as 14. 41 vs 2. 84 ppm (before processing) for OC and 1. 80 vs 0. 0003 ppm (processed) for OP consisting aldrin, lindane, dieldrin, endosulfan and chlorpyrifos methyl. There was only OC detected in sera consisting lindane (0. 6 – 37. 6 ppb); heptachlor (0. 03 – 4. 4 ppb); and aldrin (0. 8 – 20. 4 ppb) with an average total of 21, 4 ppb. The <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> signs were suspected to be due to organophosphates (OPs) contaminated-rice straws and any other factors such as insufficient vitamin A, magnesium and calcium. Feed replacement with fresh grasses for two cattle reduced corneal changes. Similar symptoms were also reproduced in Wistar rats dosed intraperitoneally with chlorpyriphos methyl. Clinical signs included incoordination, cachexia, eye disorder and corneal opacity. Necropsy showed hepatic injury (hepatic necrosis, mottling of hepatic surface and pale); pale kidneys; swollen of spleen and hyperaemic brain. Microscopic changes were found in brain, liver and eyes.

All cases underwent full gynecological <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> including Schirmer test and tear film break-up time(BUT) and followed up for at least 3 mo. RESULTS: The mean age of all the patients was 31. 03 ± 6. 97 y. There was no statistical significance between the groups in relation to age, parity and gravidity. The combined pills showed the highest percentage for dry eye followed by Mesocept then Depo-Provera then progesterone only pills then Implanon and no dry eyes in the control group. CONCLUSION: Contraceptive methods containing both estrogen and progesterone {{are more likely to have}} dry eye than those who used progesterone only contraceptive methods...|$|R
40|$|Osteomas {{involving}} the anterior cranial base are quite rare lesions. Intracranial and orbital extension of these tumors, causing <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> symptoms <b>and</b> signs {{is a rare}} event. Two such cases are reported. In the first one, the tumor arose from the frontal sinus and extended upward to the medial and superior wall of the right orbital cavity and {{the lower part of}} the right frontal convexity. In the second case the osteoma arose from the left orbital roof and extended to {{the lower part of the}} homolateral frontal convexity and the splenoid wing. After the operation the symptoms disappeared and the cosmetic deficits were corrected. Skull-films, CT and MR well define the bony extension and the displacement of the orbital and intracranial structures. Indications to the surgery include progressive ophthalmologic and neurologic signs and significant cosmetic deformations. The surgical techniques and the postoperative complications are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Pycnodysostosis {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive skeletal dysplasia caused by absence of active cathepsin K. Intracranial hypertension represents a rarely reported, life threatening complication of pycnodysostosis. We describe, for the first time, two children with pycnodysostosis who presented with raised intracranial pressure and {{were found to have}} intracranial venous sinus hypoplasia. The combination of Sinus Hypoplasia and Intracranial Hypertension in Pycnodysostosis (SHIHP) has not been previously reported. In a patient with pycnodysostosis, <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> assessment is necessary and MR Brain including venography should be considered. The management of such a patient is challenging in particular due to the uncertainty as to the mechanism of the raised intracranial pressure in the face of small ventricles and an open fontanelle. Multidisciplinary team management including the geneticist, ophthalmologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, and the metabolic bone team is required. Surgical options include CSF diversion and cranial vault remodelling. The interplay of venous sinus hypoplasia, intracranial vault abnormalities, and raised intracranial pressure in a patient with pycnodysostosis shall be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Castor beans, {{sometimes}} used in traditional therapies, contain ricin {{one of the}} most toxic substances known. It may cause an acute and potentially fatal gastroenteritis in addition to <b>neurological</b> <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> lesions. Poisoning may also lead to delayed visceral damages; however, the latter is quite rare. The toxicity is dose related and depends on the amount of castor beans ingested. There is no specific treatment and symptomatic management to reduce the load of the toxin needs to be initiated quickly and early when a case of poisoning is suspected so that serious complications will be avoided. Increasing the awareness of the population to the dangers of ricin would be a way to avoid the utilisation of castor seeds in traditional therapies. Here we are reporting a case of mild poisoning after ingestion of a single castor bean. The patient, who presented at Nizwa Hospital, Oman, fortunately recovered completely as the ingested dose was quite small...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the frequency of association between Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Graves Ophthalmopathy (GO) using the responses to diagnostic tests for MG (fatigue and neostigmine tests) by measuring horizontal saccadic eye movements (SEM). METHODS: For this paper a random investigation was performed on eleven patients, affected by Graves' disease (GD) at the department of Molecular and Clinical Endocrinology and Oncology and department of Neurology of University of Federico II of Naples, for one year. Eleven patients (11 F), were subjected to endocrinological <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> (TSH IRMA, TT 3 -RIA, TT 4 -RIA, TgAb, TPOAb, orbit ultrasonography or computed tomographic scans) and computerized analysis of saccadic eye movements (SEM); the fatigue and neostigmine tests were performed by means of SEM analysis in seven of this patients. RESULTS: Our results have reported that a positive response to the diagnostic tests for MG is present in 41. 6 % of hyperthyroid patients with GO, further supporting the hypothesis of a common autoimmune pathogenesis is present between these pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: SEM analysis may be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of GO...|$|R
40|$|Case report: A 9 -year-old male Bull Terrier was {{presented}} for a 3 -month {{history of a}} progressive, non-painful conjunctival mass of the right eye. The mass was exophytic and located in the temporal bulbar conjunctiva. No adhesion to the sclera was detected. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of a conjunctival neoplasia was made. Complete physical <b>and</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>examinations</b> of the dog, as well as complete blood count, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis, thoracic radiography, echocardiography and abdominal ultrasonography, were performed. The mass was surgically removed and a double freeze–thaw cycle of cryotherapy was performed locally. Histological examination of the removed tissue showed a well-delineated, non-encapsulated mass composed of spindle cells in loose myxomatous stroma. No nuclear atypia was observed in the tumour cells. A positive Alcian blue stain confirmed the mucin origin of the stroma. Tumour cells stained positive on immunohistochemistry for vimentin and negative for cytokeratins. A diagnosis was made of conjunctival myxoma. No evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases was identified during the 24 -month follow-up period. Conclusion: To {{the best of the}} authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on a conjunctival myxoma in dogs...|$|R
