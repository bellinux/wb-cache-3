50|$|Aluminium makes brass {{stronger}} and more corrosion-resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing. Tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in seawater applications (<b>naval</b> <b>brasses).</b> Combinations of iron, aluminium, silicon and manganese make brass wear and tear resistant.|$|R

40|$|Construction for a 19 th-century Confederate ironclad ram {{known as}} CSS Georgia began in March 1862 after the Ladies Gunboat Association of Savannah, Georgia raised the {{necessary}} funds. However, Georgia never saw action and {{spent most of}} its career moored on the Savannah River. The Confederates intentionally sunk Georgia as General William T. Sherman?s troops approached Savannah in 1864 to prevent its capture by Union forces. It spent the next 150 years {{at the bottom of the}} channel. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Savannah District, in partnership with Panamerican Consultants, Inc., the Conservation Research Laboratory (CRL) at Texas A&M University, and the U. S. Naval History and Heritage Command, organized the recovery of thousands of artifacts and sent many of them to the CRL for subsequent conservation. This vast collection of artifacts includes a set of <b>brass</b> <b>naval</b> instruments known as gun sights. Their use enhanced the accuracy of guns during engagements at sea. Additionally, Georgia yielded brass percussion locks that facilitated the instantaneous discharge of naval guns. They represent one of the largest archaeologically recovered collections of naval gun sights and percussion locks from this era. A brief historical survey of the introduction of guns at sea places the naval gun sights and percussion locks within a broader context. Between the 16 th-century and the Civil War, the world?s navies placed different kinds of sighting mechanisms on guns and these continued to improve until their culmination in the form of the complex naval gun sights and percussion locks recovered from Georgia. The design and use of the Georgia gun sights reflects an understanding of the physical properties of a projectile in flight. The evolution of naval gunnery, sighting mechanisms used on guns, and the scientific understanding of the physical properties of a projectile in flight all form a strong basis from which a detailed analysis of the naval gun sights and percussion locks under study can be made. This research sheds more light on aspects of naval gunnery during the Civil War...|$|R

40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} for subjecting protein crystals to hyperbaric pressures of oxygen gas {{in order to promote}} enzymatic reaction. Crystals of an oxygenase or oxidase enzyme are grown anaerobically by hanging drop vapor diffusion, under crystallization conditions modified to eliminate combustible materials such as plastic coverslips and grease. The crystalline enzyme: substrate complex can then be exposed to oxygen gas at pressures up to 60 bar using a custom-built device or "bomb. " In this way, reaction is initiated synchronously throughout the crystal and subsequent flash freezing allows the trapping of enzyme:product complexes in high occupancy. These complexes can then be structurally characterized by conventional monochromatic X-ray crystallography. The bomb is furnished from <b>naval</b> <b>brass</b> and lubricated with Fomblin RT 15 perfluorinated polyether grease in order to ensure compatibility with the highly oxidizing environment...|$|E
40|$|A plasma-source, {{simultaneously}} detecting, Mattauch-Herzog {{mass spectrograph}} for multi-element analysis was developed. Simultaneous detection should improve throughput, precision, and sensitivity over those instruments that use quadrupole or sector mass spectrometers. The new instrument is compact (approximately 80 cm in length) {{and is designed}} to detect a complete atomic mass spectrum in two mass windows that straddle but avoid argon. The design and some figures of merit are presented. With a dc glow discharge source, a precision of 0. 5 % determined from eight consecutive 10 -s images was obtained for Cu isotope ratios in <b>Naval</b> <b>Brass</b> B. With the same sample, nickel and lead were detected at limits of 8 and 1 ppm. Measured Mg isotope ratios with an inductively coupled plasma source were within 4 % of the expected values. The resolution at full width at half maximum is currently limited to approximately 60, {{in part because of}} poor peak shape. The origin of this peak shape has been determined to lie within the array detector and possibly results from its interaction with the fringing magnetic fields produced by the second sector...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSurface {{treatments}} of engineering materials have recently become important for serviceable engineering components. Many {{techniques such as}} thermal and thermo-chemical surface treatments {{have been used to}} develop surface characteristics of materials. Presently, high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spray is considered as the best method of producing a high-quality hard metal coating due to its moderate process temperatures and high gas velocities. Hardness is the most important property, which influences considerably service life characteristics of coatings. HVOF spray parameters, namely oxygen flow rate, LPG flow rate, powder feed rate, spray distance playsa major role in determining the hardness of coating. In this study, WC- 10 Co- 4 Cr coatings were deposited on <b>naval</b> <b>brass</b> substrates by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spray process. The aim of this work is to develop an empirical relationship to predict the hardness of WC- 10 Co- 4 Cr coatings incorporating HVOF spray parameters using statistical tools such as design of experiments, analysis of variance and regression analysis. Statistical calculations showed that the effects of the four variables on the hardness were different. Moreover, {{the results of this study}} may help to control the spray parameters of HVOF process to achieve higher coating hardness...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFifteen polymer coatings were evaluated {{for their ability}} to promote and sustain dropwise condensation of steam to enhance the heat transfer capability of steam condensers. Of the fifteen coatings, nine employed a fluorcpolymer as a major constituent. Of the other six, four were hydrocarbons, one a chlorocarbon and one a silicone. Each coating was applied to four different metal substrates: brass, copper, <b>naval</b> <b>brass,</b> and titanium. while exposed to steam at atmospheric pressure, each coating was visually evaluated for its ability to promote dropwise condensation. Observations were conducted over a period of 4000 hours. Hardness and adhesion tests were performed on selected specimens both before and after exposure. On the basis of sustained performance, six coatings were selected for heat transfer performance evaluation. A separate apparatus was used in which coated copper tubes were mounted horizontally in a test section through which steam flowed vertically downward. Vapor-side heat-transfer coefficients were inferred from overall measurements. Test results indicate that the outside condensing coefficient can be increased by a factor of five to eight through the use of polymer coatings to promote dropwise condensation.

40|$|In present {{scenario}} CNC {{turning operation}} plays {{a vital role}} in metal based manufacturing industries. Therefore selection of optimum machining parameters, Tool geometry and cutting condition etc. for the variety of materials is an important and complicated task for the manufacturing industries in providing best quality at less cost to the customers. In this research work CNC turning operation is carried out using L 9 Taguchi orthogonal arrays on <b>Naval</b> <b>brass</b> C 360 coated carbide insert and influence of CNC turning process parameters like Cutting Speed, Feed and Depth of Cut are analysed for two output objectives like material removal rate and surface roughness. The optimum sets of turning process parameter as well as combined effect of considered response are estimated using Taguchi technique application. In this analysis it is found that depth of cut has the largest effect on metal removal rate and feed rate has the largest effect on the surface roughness. It can be observed that depth of cut has the largest effect on metal removal rate and feed rate has the largest effect on the surface roughness of C 360 brass by turning on CNC. The optimum turning condition for material removal rate isspindle speed (1600 rpm), feed rate (0. 20 mm/rev.) and depth of cut (0. 8 mm). The optimum condition for surface roughness is spindle speed (1400 rpm), feed rate (0. 20 mm/rev.) and depth of cut (0. 2 mm) ...|$|E
