5|$|Great mullein {{has been}} used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and {{breathing}} ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an astringent and emollient, as it contains mucilage, several saponins, coumarin and glycosides.

50|$|The {{formulation}} of statistical ensembles used in physics has <b>now</b> been <b>widely</b> adopted in other fields, {{in part because}} it has been recognized that the canonical ensemble or Gibbs measure serves to maximize the entropy of a system, subject to a set of constraints: this is the principle of maximum entropy. This principle has <b>now</b> been <b>widely</b> applied to problems in linguistics, robotics, and the like.|$|R

5|$|In 1933 Andrei Kolmogorov {{published}} in German {{his book on}} the foundations of probability theory titled Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, where Kolmogorov used measure theory to develop an axiomatic framework for probability theory.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of HHT remained a clinical one until the genetic defects that cause HHT {{were identified by}} a research group at Duke University Medical Center, in 1994 and 1996 respectively. In 2000, the international scientific advisory committee of HHT Foundation International published the <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> used Curaçao criteria. In 2006, a group of international experts met in Canada and formulated an evidence-based guideline, sponsored by the HHT Foundation International.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Massenet was {{regarded}} by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> accepted as well-crafted and intelligent products of the Belle Époque.|$|E

5|$|Despite his mixed legacy, Sargsyan is <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> {{recognized}} as a national hero {{across the political spectrum}} and by the public. Given the honorific Sparapet, he made significant contributions to the establishment of Armenia as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the Armenian Army. He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections. Sargsyan was awarded the highest titles of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh—National Hero of Armenia and Hero of Artsakh.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth {{into three}} {{categories}} according {{to the amount of}} precipitation they received. In this <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without precipitation, arid lands have less than 250mm (10in) of annual precipitation, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500mm (10–20in). Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since, {{the film has}} {{generated}} significant academic attention with regard to its thematic symbolism, and is <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> {{regarded as one of}} Lynch's major works and one of the greatest films of the 1980s. Publications including Sight & Sound, Time, Entertainment Weekly and BBC Magazine have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time. In 2008, Blue Velvet was chosen by the American Film Institute {{as one of the greatest}} American mystery films ever made.|$|E

5|$|Knight {{presented}} an elaborate conspiracy theory involving the British royal family, freemasonry and the painter Walter Sickert. He {{concluded that the}} victims were murdered to cover up a secret marriage between the second-in-line to the throne, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, and Annie Elizabeth Crook, a working class girl. There are many facts that contradict Knight's theory, and his main source, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press {{that it was a}} hoax. Most scholars dismiss the theory and the book's conclusion is <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> discredited.|$|E
5|$|The Blues and the Greens {{were now}} more than simply sports teams. They gained {{influence}} in military, political, and theological matters, although {{the hypothesis that the}} Greens tended towards Monophysitism and the Blues represented Orthodoxy is disputed. It is <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> believed that neither of the factions had any consistent religious bias or allegiance, {{in spite of the fact}} that they operated in an environment fraught with religious controversy. According to some scholars, the Blue-Green rivalry contributed to the conditions that underlay the rise of Islam, while factional enmities were exploited by the Sassanid Empire in its conflicts with the Byzantines during the century preceding Islam's advent.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of universally accepted conventions for {{the naming of}} organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks {{the starting point of}} consistent use of binomial nomenclature. During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed {{what became known as the}} Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> used in the biological sciences. A previous zoologist Rumphius (1627–1702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus.|$|E

5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> regarded as a later construct {{and may have been}} the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as Candida Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, it is clear that Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, {{the film}} {{significantly}} under-performed {{at the box}} office, making $31.3 million worldwide against a budget of $70–80 million, which was blamed on an unusually poor marketing campaign. However, the film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for several awards, winning nine Annie Awards out of 15 nominations. Through home video releases and television syndication, the film gathered a cult following and is <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> regarded as a modern animated classic. In 2015, an extended, remastered version of the film was re-released theatrically, which saw a home video release the following year.|$|E
5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films <b>now</b> <b>widely</b> regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E
