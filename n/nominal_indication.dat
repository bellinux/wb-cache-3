40|$|Prevalence of {{coronary}} heart disease (CHD), of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) and of the metabolic syndrome are in Mauritius amongst {{the highest in the}} world. As T 2 DM and CHD are closely associated and have both a polygenic basis, we conducted a 10 cM genome scan with 403 microsatellite markers in 99 independent families of North-Eastern Indian origin including 535 individuals. Families were ascertained through a proband with CHD before 52 years of age and additional sibs with myocardial infarction (MI) or T 2 DM. Model-free two-point and multipoint linkage analysis were performed using the Mapmarker-Sibs (MLS) and maximum-likelihood-binomial (MLB) programs for autosomal markers and the Aspex program for chromosome X markers. In a second step, additional markers were studied to increase the genetic map density in three regions on chromosomes 3, 8 and 16 where initial indication for linkage was found. Our data show suggestive linkage with CHD on chromosome 16 p 13 -pter with the MLS statistics at 8. 69 cM (LOD = 3. 06, P = 0. 00017) which partially overlaps with a high pressure (HBP) peak. At the same locus, a <b>nominal</b> <b>indication</b> for linkage with T 2 DM was found in 35 large T 2 DM Pondicherian families also having Indian origin. With respect to region 8 q 23, we found suggestive linkage with T 2 DM (LOD = 2. 55, P = 0. 00058) as well as with HBP. On 3 q 27, we replicated previous indication for linkage found in Caucasians (for the metabolic syndrome and for diabetes) according to the categorized trait for CHD and MI with the MLB statistics (LOD = 2. 13, P = 0. 0009). The genome scan also revealed nominal evidence of linkage with CHD on 10 q 23 (LOD = 2. 06, P = 0. 00188). Interestingly, we detected in the same region overlapping linkages with three QTLs: age of onset of CHD (LOD = 2. 03), HDL cholesterol (LOD = 1. 48) and LDL/HDL ratio (LOD = 1. 34). Ordered-subset analysis based on family body mass index ranking replicated finding on 2 q 37 for T 2 DM (at Calpain 10 locus). These results show the first evidence for susceptibility loci that predispose to CHD, T 2 DM and HBP {{in the context of the}} metabolic syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Digital road {{databases}} {{are widely}} used in many facets of our daily life. Most of these databases come with a <b>nominal</b> quality <b>indication,</b> but often more detailed quality descriptions regarding possible errors, the positional accuracy, and information on the completeness of the vector data are desirable. In this paper an approach for the quality description of road data from the Authoritative Topographic Cartographic Information System (ATKIS) of Germany is introduced. The work is embedded in a project initiated by the German Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG), which is interested in an automation of the road data verification process. How existing road vectors from ATKIS can be assessed by combining the information coming from several object extraction algorithms is investigated. These objects are modeled in the so called relationship model where the topologic and geometric relation between roads and other objects are given. For example a row of trees is often parallel to roads and has a minimum and a maximum distance from the carriageway. Every extracted object- such as rows of trees extracted from aerial imagery- may then support a given ATKIS road. If it does not coincide with the model it gives evidence against the ATKIS road. The Hint-Theory is used which {{is derived from the}} Dempster-Shafer Theory of evidence to combine all information related to an ATKIS road segment. Example results show that the introduced procedure is able to yield reliable information on the quality of ATKIS objects. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} some quench tests addressed to study the dynamic effects in the 1 -m-long 120 -mm-aperture Nb 3 Sn quadrupole magnet, i. e., HQ 02 b, designed, fabricated, and tested by the LHC Accelerator Research Program. The magnet has a short sample gradient of 205 T/m at 1. 9 K and a peak field of 14. 2 T. The test campaign has been performed at CERN in April 2014. In the specific tests, which were dedicated to the measurements of the dynamic inductance of the magnet during the rapid current discharge for a quench, the protection heaters were activated only in some windings, {{in order to obtain}} the measure of the resistive and inductive voltages separately. The analysis of the results confirms a very low value of the dynamic inductance {{at the beginning of the}} discharge, which later approaches the <b>nominal</b> value. <b>Indications</b> of dynamic inductance variation were already found from the analysis of current decay during quenches in the previous magnets HQ 02 a and HQ 02 a 2; however, with this dedicated test of HQ 02 b, a quantitative measurement and assessment has been possible. An analytical model using interfilament coupling current influence for the inductance lowering has been implemented in the quench calculation code QLASA, and the comparison with experimental data is given. The agreement of the model with the experimental results is very good and allows predicting more accurately the critical parameters in quench analysis (MIITs, hot spot temperature) for the MQXF Nb 3 Sn quadrupoles, which will be installed in the High Luminosity LHC...|$|R
