In this respect, the recent opening of the Australian-funded Friendship Bridge not only provides a much-sought physical link between Thailand and Laos but also a symbolic statement of the crossing of the Mekong-as-political-boundary by the integrative force of the Mekong-as-a-NET...|$|E
40|$|In {{the decades}} ahead, Northeast Asia {{will be the}} {{critical}} region on the global stage. Interaction among and between Northeast Asian societies is rapidly advancing, both at official and non-official levels. Among the latter, {{one of the most}} promising developments is the emergence of <b>Natural</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Territories</b> (NETs), <b>economic</b> entities that cross political boundaries, taking advantage of the complementarity of neighboring regions, combining resources, manpower, capital, technology and managerial skills. With political barriers being progressively lowered, this trend is certain to be expanded in the years ahead. It is clear that no analysis of the inter-state relations within Northeast Asia can be sound without a careful examination of the domestic conditions—current and future—governing each nation. The paper weaves domestic and foreign policies together, indicating their reciprocal effect...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the state to state level of relations, economic cooperation and regionalism is showing marked progress below the central government level in Northeast Asia. Subnational authorities are linking up to form networks of bilateral and multilateral relationship of increasing scope and density in {{a broad range of}} activities, especially in the areas of trade and investment. The subnational authorities most active in promoting regional cooperation tend to be those in the NET (<b>natural</b> <b>economic</b> <b>territories)</b> around the rim of Japan Sea. The motivating factors behind the Japanese subnational actors participating in the Japan Sea process are the desire to escape economic backwardness and lack of faith in solutions coming from the central government. The strategic objectives of these authorities is to strengthen its export orientations, developing production and services targeting overseas markets. Becoming an intermediary for expanded trade between the developed Pacific side of Japan and the Northeast Asia NET in {{the opposite side of the}} Japan Sea is another important reason for active involvement in the process. The subnational actors, despite lack of support from Tokyo, are making striking advances in the key dimensions used to measure regionalism, using their own limited resources and by relying on allies in the private sector both at the local and national level. Characterizing such Japanese approach to building international cooperation and promoting Northeast Asian regionalism among subnational actors is the aim of this analysis. ...|$|R

The question is asked {{as to whether the}} reverse is true, i. e. does being a resident unit of a currency union imply being a resident unit of at least one member country of the union? In other words, can the existence of a currency union create a residence status additional to the residence status of the component economies of the currency union? 2. In the first place, this paper discusses the issue of the residence status of a currency union central bank (CUCB) in a currency union.
