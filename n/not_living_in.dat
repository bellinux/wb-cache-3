5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live {{part of their lives}} in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals <b>not</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E

25|$|FATCA {{is used by}} {{government}} personnel to detect indicia of U.S. persons and their assets and to enable cross-checking where assets have been self-reported by individuals to the IRS or to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

25|$|Modern {{oral traditions}} also related that the Mandinka kingdoms of Mali or Manden had already existed several centuries before Sundiata's {{unification}} {{as a small}} state just {{to the south of}} the Soninké empire of Wagadou, better known as the Ghana Empire. This area was composed of mountains, savannah and forest providing ideal protection and resources for the population of hunters. Those <b>not</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the mountains formed small city-states such as Toron, Ka-Ba and Niani. Through the oral tradition of griots, the Keita dynasty, from which nearly every Mali emperor came, traces its lineage back to Lawalo, one of the sons of Bilal, the faithful muezzin of Islam's prophet Muhammad, who was said to have migrated into Mali and his descendants established the ruling Keita dynasty through Maghan Kon Fatta, father of Sundiata Keita.|$|E
500|$|Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians ( [...] 870 - 12 June 918) ruled Mercia in the English Midlands from 911 {{until her}} death. She was the eldest {{daughter}} of Alfred the Great, {{king of the}} Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith. Æthelflæd was born around 870 {{at the height of}} the Viking invasions of England. By 878 most of England was under Danish Viking rule, East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings, but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people <b>not</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying Æthelflæd to Æthelred.|$|E
500|$|According to Stevens, {{in one of}} {{his first}} games as head coach, he was nervous and [...] "felt like our team played on edge" [...] because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in {{difficult}} game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. [...] "I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach," [...] he told himself. Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on [...] "the next play" [...] rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, [...] "When those big runs [...] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game." [...] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with [...] "positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, <b>not</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> fear of being yanked for making a bad play.|$|E
