5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support this assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon whether or <b>not</b> <b>there</b> are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as {{to the meaning of}} such symbols.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} links epilepsy and coeliac {{disease and}} non-celiac gluten sensitivity, while other evidence does <b>not.</b> <b>There</b> {{appears to be}} a specific syndrome which includes coeliac disease, epilepsy and calcifications in the brain. A 2012 review estimates that between 1% and 6% of people with epilepsy have CD while 1% of the general population has the condition.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the tribes}} were better {{represented}} in the republican government. In 1969, sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council. Under Iryani, the sheikhs, particularly the ones who fought for the republicans and were close to the mediation attempt. By {{the end of the}} war there was a breach between the older and more liberal politicians and republican sheiks, and certain army sheiks and activists from South Yemen. In the summer of 1972, a border war broke and ended with a declaration from both North Yemen and South Yemen that they would reunite, but they did <b>not.</b> <b>There</b> were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.|$|E

5|$|Malcolm II {{was born}} to Kenneth II of Scotland. He was {{grandson}} of Malcolm I of Scotland. In 997, the killer of Constantine is credited as being Kenneth, son of Malcolm. Since there is no known and relevant Kenneth alive at that time (King Kenneth having died in 995), it is considered an error for either Kenneth III, who succeeded Constantine, or, possibly, Malcolm himself, the son of Kenneth II. Whether Malcolm killed Constantine or <b>not,</b> <b>there</b> {{is no doubt that}} in 1005 he killed Constantine's successor Kenneth III in battle at Monzievaird in Strathearn.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 June, Nelson's fleet passed the French in the darkness, {{overtaking}} the slow invasion convoy without realising how close they were to their target. Making rapid time on a direct route, Nelson reached Alexandria on 28 June and discovered that the French were <b>not</b> <b>there.</b> After {{a meeting with the}} suspicious Ottoman commander, Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim, Nelson ordered the British fleet northwards, reaching the coast of Anatolia on 4 July and turning westwards back towards Sicily. Nelson had missed the French by less than a day—the scouts of the French fleet arrived off Alexandria in {{the evening of}} 29 June.|$|E
5|$|Pat Nixon had an {{interest}} in adding artifacts to the Executive Mansion, and built on Jacqueline Kennedy's more publicized efforts. She added more than 600 paintings and furnishings to the White House and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration. She created the Map Room and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine others. She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white. She ordered the flag flown, day and night, even when the president was <b>not</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rachel Green flees {{her wedding}} day and seeks out {{childhood}} friend Monica Geller, a New York City chef. They become roommates, and Rachel joins Monica's social circle of single people in their mid-20s: struggling actor Joey Tribbiani, business professional Chandler Bing, masseuse and musician Phoebe Buffay, and newly divorced paleontologist Ross Geller, Monica's older brother. To support herself, Rachel becomes a waitress at Central Perk, a Manhattan coffeehouse where the group often hangs out; when <b>not</b> <b>there,</b> the six are usually at Monica and Rachel's nearby West Village apartment, or Joey and Chandler's across the hall.|$|E

5|$|Sei Shōnagon, {{author of}} The Pillow Book, {{had been in}} service as lady-in-waiting to Teishi when Shōshi came to court; it is {{possible}} that Murasaki was invited to Shōshi's court as a rival to Shōnagon. Teishi died in 1001, before Murasaki entered service with Shōshi, so the two writers were <b>not</b> <b>there</b> concurrently, but Murasaki, who wrote about Shōnagon in her diary, certainly knew of her, and to an extent was influenced by her. Shōnagon's The Pillow Book may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight Teishi's court, known for its educated ladies-in-waiting. Japanese literature scholar Joshua Mostow believes Michinaga provided Murasaki to Shōshi as an equally or better educated woman, so as to showcase Shōshi's court in a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were <b>not</b> <b>there.</b> The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{executed}} Mstislav of Kiev and the Kievan nobles {{with the}} traditional Mongol caveat reserved for royalty and nobility: without shedding blood. Mstislav and his nobles were buried and suffocated under the Mongol general's victory platform at the victory feast. Meanwhile, Mstislav the Bold managed to reach {{the western side of}} the Dnieper with what remained of his army. To stop the Mongols from crossing to the western side of the Dnieper, Mstislav destroyed all the boats he could find.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 122* Hector Hugh Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 84. After the battle, the people of Rus trembled in fear of this unknown scourge who had emerged from the frontier and destroyed the flower of their army. However, the Mongols were <b>not</b> <b>there</b> to conquer, and merely marched east after plundering.|$|E

5|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} honor killing {{in that day}} was a duel. Despite Cooke's admonition that Sharp would not accept a challenge to duel, Beauchamp traveled to Frankfort to gain an audience with him. He had recently been named the state's attorney general by Governor John Adair. Beauchamp's account of the interview states that he bullied and humiliated Sharp, that Sharp begged for his life, and that Beauchamp promised to horsewhip Sharp every day until he consented to the duel. For two days, Beauchamp remained in Frankfort, awaiting the duel. He discovered that Sharp had left town, allegedly destined for Bowling Green. Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green, {{only to find that}} Sharp was <b>not</b> <b>there</b> and was not expected. Sharp was saved from Beauchamp's first attempt on his life.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the advance}} party of the Alsos Mission moved to Normandy in August 1944, where it joined T-Force, a similar {{formation}} to S-Force, at Rambouillet, where it was preparing for the liberation of Paris. An Alsos Mission team including Pash and Calvert reached Joliot-Curie's house in the Paris suburbs on 24 August to find that he was <b>not</b> <b>there,</b> but at his laboratory at the Collège de France. The next day they reached the Porte d'Orléans where they encountered troops of the French 2e Division Blindée, who were engaged in liberating the city, and came under small arms fire from the German defenders. The Alsos Mission replied with their M1 carbines and Thompson submachine guns {{as they made their}} way through the back streets to the college, where they found Joliot-Curie in his office.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{returned}} with The Hawk Is Dying (2007), also starring Michael Pitt. It {{tells the story}} of George (played by Paul Giamatti), trying to find meaning in his life by training a wild red-tailed hawk. Williams portrayed Pitt's girlfriend, the only person who understands George's growing obsession. The film earned $7,000 domestically playing at one theater. Five months after giving birth, Williams was back, appearing in The Hottest State, a film by Ethan Hawke, adapted from his 1996 book. Critics panned it for being too pretentious and self-aware. Variety writer Leslie Felperin believed the film underused Williams as a former lover of one of the main characters. It did a limited theatrical run beginning August 24, ultimately grossing $137,340. Williams played Edie Sedgwick, muse of Andy Warhol, {{as a part of the}} biographical ensemble piece I'm <b>Not</b> <b>There,</b> inspired by the musician Bob Dylan.|$|E

5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was {{acting as the}} abbot's diocesan bishop, {{appears to have been}} tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was <b>not</b> <b>there.</b> Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these claims are valid or <b>not,</b> <b>there</b> {{can be little doubt}} that the entire campaign was poorly conducted, and as a result there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E
