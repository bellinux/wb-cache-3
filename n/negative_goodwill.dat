UBI Banca would also recapitalized for a maximum of €400 million in order to counter-weight the effect of bad will (<b>negative</b> <b>goodwill).</b> On 18 January the bid was accepted and signing the contract. n 10 May, the transaction was completed. On the same day, a plan to merge the 3 banks into UBI Banca was also announced. In June 2017, about 167,006,712 number of new shares were offered to the existing shareholders for €2.395 each (a discount compared to market value), in order to raise aforementioned €400 million for the completion of the acquisition of the 3 banks.|$|E
40|$|Under current GAAP, initial bargain-purchase amounts, {{also known}} as <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill</b> (NGW) or the excess of the fair value of {{acquired}} net assets over {{the cost of an}} acquisition, are typically reduced or eliminated altogether by being allocated against the fair values of certain acquired assets such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Any <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill</b> that is not offset against these assets is reported in the income statement as an extraordinary gain. However, in a joint effort with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has developed a replacement for current GAAP, which, among other things, requires that all NGW, without offset, is to be immediately recognized as a gain. This report outlines the current and proposed accounting treatment of <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill</b> and their impact upon financial statements as well as their implications for financial analysis. For a sample of companies, we find material increases in assets, shareholders' equity and net income under the proposed new treatment. - 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Background: Goodwill {{has always}} been {{frequently}} discussed {{and a lot of}} scientific research has been done regarding factors that affect companies’ impairment of goodwill. Previous research has concluded that companies reporting low results are more prone to do impairments of goodwill than companies reporting better results which possibly {{can be seen as a}} form of earnings management. Purpose: The purpose of this essay is to examine if goodwill impairments occur to a greater extent among Swedish listed companies when the companies are reporting lower earnings. A subsidiary purpose is to see if there has been an improvement since 2008 regarding the size of reported goodwill in comparison to equity in the years 2009 - 2011. And to analyze the development of the companies goodwill impairments in relation to reported goodwill. Methodology: Three quantitative studies have been performed for the years 2009 - 2011 where all the listed companies on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm have been included. Relevant information has been collected from the companies’ annual reports for further statistical testing of possible correlations. Results and conclusions: For the years 2009 and 2010 there was a significant negative correlation between listed companies’ reported earnings and goodwill impairments as well as between <b>negative</b> earnings and <b>goodwill</b> impairments. This means that the previous research suggesting that companies are more likely to use goodwill impairments when they report lower earnings holds. There was no significant relationship in the year 2011 regarding the listed companies earnings and goodwill impairments as well as between <b>negative</b> earnings and <b>goodwill</b> impairments. There have been no major changes in the relationship between goodwill impairments and reported goodwill for the years 2009 - 2011. Even with comparison to the result of 2008 there have not been any big changes. The ratio of the companies’ goodwill and their equity for the years 2009 - 2011 has been on a steady level. But compared to the situation in 2008 when the ratio was 30 percent, we conclude that an improvement has occurred. Suggestions for further research: Examine other variables impact on goodwill impairments...|$|R

Index funds, known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were recently {{introduced into the}} Brazilian market, make diversification straightforward to accomplish. This paper investigates the effi-ciency of the valuation process of the Ibovespa iShares {{with respect to the}} fair value of the shares. For this purpose, a high-frequency time series analysis of ETFs and Ibovespa was used, followed by strategy simulations that included goodwill and <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill</b> between asset sets with and without transaction costs. To avoid data-snooping effects on the transaction outcomes, a time series bootstrap was applied. The results initially indicated share-pricing inefficiency because the inclusion of goodwill and <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill</b> in the strategy resulted in returns of 172. 5 % above the fund’s index. Additionally, it became apparent that even with the introduction of operating costs, the gains continued to exhibit inefficiency. However, after applying the bootstrap technique, the results did not suggest excess returns, which could be attributed to data snooping. Therefore, the results demonstrate the impossibility of agents earning abnormal returns from the differences between the values of the ETF share and its corresponding index, thereby indicating that the Ibovespa iShare fund pricing is efficient...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of a {{monopolist}} firm which advertises a product in a segmented market where a constant exogenous interference is present. Using the framework of Nerlove- Arrow advertising model, we describe the interference using a constant negative addendum in the goodwill ODE. This effect may vary over the different market segments. Hence, we admit that the firm goodwill concerning any segment may become negative and we associate 0 demand with <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill</b> values. By using the simplest demand model, i. e. a piece- wise linear function, we formulate a nonsmooth infinite horizon optimal control problem. The features of an optimal advertising policy depend on the different effects in each segment of the advertising effort and of the exogenous interference. We describe an optimal solution for a single wide-spectrum medium, which requires a constant advertising effort after some finite time. We characterize the segment sets which may be a possible target for the firm using a given advertising medium...|$|E
40|$|SFAS 141 (R), Business Combinations, {{includes}} {{significant changes}} to the accounting and disclosure requirements for acquisitions made at less than fair value. Under new rules, acquisition-related gains, asset valuations and shareholders’ equity will be higher in transactions yielding <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill,</b> a financial statement element referred to henceforth as a bargain purchase amount. In years after the acquisition, operating earnings will be reduced as increased asset valuations are amortized or depreciated. Disclosure requirements contained in the revised standard provide financial statement readers with new insights into why firms are able to effect acquisitions at less than fair value. In reviewing 71 acquisitions, we find several reasons {{for the existence of}} such bargain purchase gains, ranging from financial distress of the target, to special characteristics of the acquiring firm, to flaws in the bidding process. These findings have implications for investors, who must analyze bargain purchase transactions, for CFOs and other corporate managers, who must implement the new standard’s provisions, and for regulators, who must determine whether the new standard is being properly applied...|$|E
40|$|De acordo com a {{literatura}} de gestão de risco, a diversificação contribui para a mitigação do risco. Neste sentido, os fundos de índice Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), recém-introduzidos no mercado brasileiro, permitem sua fácil execução. Dentro deste contexto, o presente artigo investiga a eficiência do processo de valuation das cotas do fundo iShare Ibovespa com relação ao seu valor justo. Para isto, primeiramente é empregada uma análise das séries temporais de alta frequência do ETF e Ibovespa, seguido de simulações de estratégias que contemplem ágios/deságios entre as séries dos ativos, sem e com custos de transação. A fim de evitar efeitos de Data-Snooping nos resultados das operações, foi aplicado um Bootstrap para séries temporais. No primeiro momento os resultados apontam para uma ineficiência do apreçamento das cotas, visto que a incorporação de ágios/deságios na estratégia produziu retornos de 172, 5 % acima de seu índice. No segundo, verifica-se que mesmo com a introdução dos custos operacionais, os ganhos ainda assim apresentam ineficiência. Entretanto, a partir da técnica de Bootstrap, os resultados não apontaram para retornos excedentes, o que pode ser atribuído meramente ao fenômeno de Data-Snooping. Os resultados evidenciam, portanto, a inviabilidade dos agentes em auferir rendimentos anormais a partir de divergências entre os valores da cota do ETF e seu respectivo índice, o que indica uma eficiência nas precificações das cotas do fundo iShare Ibovespa.

40|$|We {{propose the}} model of a firm that advertises a product in a {{homogeneous}} market, where a constant exogenous interference is present. Using the framework of Nerlove and Arrow's advertising model, {{we assume that the}} interference acts additively on goodwill production as a negative term. Hence we allow, that the goodwill may become negative and we associate a zero demand with <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill</b> values. We consider a piecewise linear demand function and formulate a nonsmooth optimal-control problem with an infinite horizon. We obtain that an optimal advertising policy exists and takes one of two forms: either a positive and constant advertising effort, or a decreasing effort starting from a positive level and eventually reaching the zero value at a finite exit time. In the former scenario, the demand is always positive and the firm stays in the market in the long run; in the latter, the demand becomes zero in the short run, and afterward, the firm goes out of business. In both cases we have an explicit representation of the optimal control, which is obtained through the study of an auxiliary smooth optimal-control problem. It is interesting that the fundamental choice between staying in the market and going out of business at some time depends both on the interference level and on the initial goodwill level...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the accounting treatment of goodwill, namely, its recognition, assessment and accounting, {{as part of}} the patrimonial assets of an economic entity. Specific, due to its structure, to any blocks of companies, the goodwill re{{presents the}} cost surplus of an active block to the market value of the net purchased assets. Why would anyone pay for a company more than its actual accounting worth? Because the extra price is usually attributed to those intangible elements that cannot be assessed separately but whose horizon of expectation is usually related to prospective economic advantages such as the clientele, the top commercial location, the employees' level of training, market shares, good relationships with the employees, the suppliers, the banks etc. Many of the Romanian economic entities were sold at a price that was inferior to their accounting value because, following their assessment, the experts were able to ascertain the following: the existence of fixed assets that needed to be scrapped; the existence of stocks that were either depreciated or difficult to sell; the existence of outstanding debts that were either uncertain of lost for good; the existence of major debts carrying interest. The effect of such assessments led to a reduced marked value of all assets and an increased market value of the debts, or in other words, the possibility of a badwill occurrence. The relationship goodwill – badwill, specific to the blocks of trading companies, represents a current challenge in the recognition and evaluation of the goodwill in compliance with the current Romanian legislation as harmonized with the international accountancy standards. positive goodwill, <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill,</b> tangible assets, goodwill generated in-house, retrievable valu...|$|E
40|$|When buying {{enterprises}} as {{a property}} complex, firm-the buyer {{can pay for}} it as excess cost of the acquired entity on its balance sheet, and an amount less than {{the value of the}} assets on the balance sheet of the acquiree. Based on the requirements of the Russian legislation, in the account of the buyer acquires an intangible asset that distinguishes the Russian from the international practice. International financial reporting standards do not recognize goodwill an intangible asset of the buyer enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to specify the Russian practice of accounting transactions in the purchase of enterprises as property complex. The article presents a definition of the property complex, based on the requirements of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, highlighted the stages of transfer of the property complex of the specified accounting documents that must be decorated, the analysis of the approaches of domestic and foreign authors to the recognition and measurement of goodwill, studied the specificity of the requirements of the Russian normative-legislative acts to the category “goodwill”, “intangible asset”. Based on the requirements of the Russian legislation, a positive goodwill is recognized in intangible asset (goodwill), in contrast to the <b>negative</b> <b>goodwill</b> (badwill), which immediately applies on other income of the organisation – the buyer of the enterprise – a property complex. On the positive business reputation, then the requirements of the Russian legislation, a positive goodwill is recognized intangible asset. In this paper, the authors proposed a model accounting for the purchase of enterprise as property complex as a result of which the acquisition price of an enterprise as a property complex exceeds its carrying amount of the assessment, therefore, in accounting, the buyer acquires an intangible asset {{in the form of a}} positive business reputation, compiled and substantiated recommended to reflect this fact of financial and economic activities of the correspondence of accounts...|$|E
