2500|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{induction meter}} operates by counting the revolutions of a non-magnetic, but electrically conductive, metal disc {{which is made}} to rotate at a speed proportional to the power passing through the meter. [...] The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> is thus proportional to the energy usage. The voltage coil consumes a small and relatively constant amount of power, typically around 2 watts which is not registered on the meter. [...] The current coil similarly consumes {{a small amount of}} power in proportion to the square of the current flowing through it, typically up to a couple of watts at full load, which is registered on the meter.|$|E
2500|$|Megavoltage {{computed}} tomography (MVCT) {{is a medical}} imaging technique that uses the Megavoltage range of X-rays to create an image of bony structures or surrogate structures within the body. The original rational for MVCT was spurred by the need for accurate density estimates for treatment planning. Both patient and target structure localization were secondary uses. A test unit using a single linear detector, consisting of 75 cadmium tungstate crystals, was mounted on the linear accelerator gantry. The test results indicated a spatial resolution of [...]5mm, and a contrast resolution of 5% using this method. While another approach could involve integrating the system directly into the MLA, it would limit the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> to a number prohibitive to regular use.|$|E

40|$|Disks of a {{eutectic}} Cu–Ag alloy were {{processed by}} high-pressure torsion (HPT) up to 20 revolutions {{to reveal the}} microstructural evolution and mechanical properties. Both the Cu and Ag phases were thinned continuously with increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions.</b> After 20 revolutions, the alternating Cu and Ag phases were significantly refined and became fibrous with dimensions as thin as 5 nm. The strain hardening behavior of the Cu–Ag alloy was characterized after different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> HPT <b>revolutions,</b> and a saturation microhardness was attained. It is shown that the tensile fracture mode changed from necking to fully brittle shearing with increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions,</b> and some shear offsets with sizes of ? 5 – 20 ?m were observed on the fracture surfaces. Based on the abnormal saturation microhardness value of the eutectic alloy, the strengthening mechanisms of various Cu–Ag alloys are discusse...|$|R
2500|$|Post First World War German {{fighters were}} fitted with {{electrical}} synchronizers. [...] In such a gear, a contact {{or set of}} contacts, either on the propeller shaft itself, or some {{other part of the}} drive train revolving at the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> per minute, generates a series of electrical pulses, which are transmitted to a solenoid driven trigger motor at the gun. Experiments with these were underway {{before the end of the}} war, and again the LVG company seems to have been involved: a British intelligence report from 25 June 1918 mentions an LVG two-seater fitted with such a gear that was brought down in the British lines. It is known that LVG built 40 C.IV two-seaters fitted with a Siemens electrical synchronizing system.|$|E

6000|$|Captain Maury, of the American Navy--whose {{interesting}} {{book has}} been already referred to--invented an instrument for sounding the deep sea. Here is his own description of it:--"To the lead was attached, upon {{the principle of the}} screw-propeller, a small piece of clock-work for registering the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> made by the little screw during the descent; and it having been ascertained by experiment in shoal water that the apparatus, in descending, would cause the propeller to make one revolution for every fathom of perpendicular descent, hands provided with the power of self-registering were attached to a dial, and the instrument was complete. It worked beautifully in moderate depths, but failed in blue water, from the difficulty of hauling it up if the line used were small, and from the difficulty of getting it down if the line used were large enough to give the requisite strength for hauling it up." [...] One eccentric old sea captain proposed to sound the sea with a torpedo, or shell, which should explode the instant it touched the bottom. Another gentleman proposed to try it by the magnetic telegraph, and designed an instrument which should telegraph to the expectant measurers above how it was getting on in the depths below. But all these ingenious devices failed, and it is probable that the deepest parts of the ocean-bed still remained untouched by man.|$|E
60|$|The Swanzy {{establishment}} {{has set up}} {{an exceptionally}} light battery of twelve stamps, made in sections for easier transport. Neither here nor {{in any of the}} mines have stone-breakers or automatic feeders yet been introduced: the stuff is all hand-spalled. One small 'Belleville' drives the stamps, another works the Tangye pump, and a third turns the saw-mills. I will notice a few differences between the Swanzy system and that of Effuenta. The wooden framework of the stamp-mill is better than iron. The cam-shaft here carries only single, not double cams, a decided disadvantage: in order to strike the same number of blows per minute it has to make double the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions.</b> Moreover, by some unhappy mistake, it is too far from its work, and the result is a succession of sharp blows on the tappets, with injury to all the gear. On the other hand proper fingers are fitted to the stamps: this is far better than supporting them by a rough chock of wood. At Crockerville, as at Effuenta, only six of the twelve stamps were working: there the pump was at fault; here the blanket-tables had not been made wide enough. I could hardly estimate the total amount of ore brought to grass, or its average yield: specimens of white quartz, with threads, strings, and lobs of gold, have been sent to England from Crocker's Reef. The best tailings are reserved either for treatment on the spot or for reduction in England. The mine, as regards present condition, is in the stage of prospecting upon a large and liberal scale. The stamps are chiefly used to run through samples of from 50 to 100 tons taken from the various parts of the property: in this way the most exact results can be obtained. During my visit they were preparing to work a hundred tons from Aji Bipa, the fourth and furthest butte to the north-west.|$|E

40|$|This paper treats {{a control}} {{technique}} designed to maximise the working of a rotary permanent magnet magnetic refrigerator (RPMMR).
