40|$|Restrictive {{measures}} (or sanctions) form {{an important}} part of the European Union’s (EU’s) foreign policy toolbox. Studying the conditions under which the EU imposes sanctions is therefore imperative for understanding EU’s role in the global arena. This article aims at modelling the use of EU sanctions particularly in response to intra-state conflicts in its neighbourhood. Four variables (trade linkage with the EU as whole; trade linkage with individual Member States; democracy level of the potential target state; and violence level of the intra-state conflict) are tested against data from ten intra-state conflicts from EU’s neighbourhood using a comparative mixed-method methodology of fuzzy-set analysis and process-tracing. We identify the lack of strong trade linkage between individual Member States and the potential target state as a sufficient condition for the imposition of sanctions. In addition, the presence of bilateral trade links is a necessary, and if the potential target state is a democracy, sufficient condition for the <b>non-imposition</b> <b>of</b> sanctions...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{reliance on}} information technology to support business processes has emphasised {{the need for}} information security mechanisms. This, however, has resulted in an ever-increasing workload in terms of security administration. Policy-based approaches have been proposed, promising to lighten the workload of security administrators. Separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> is one <b>of</b> the principles cited as a requirement when setting up these policy-based mechanisms. Different types <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> policies exist. They can be categorised into policies that can be enforced at administration time, viz. static separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements and policies that can be enforced only at execution time, viz. dynamic separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements. This paper deals with specifying static separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements in role-based workflow environments. It proposes a mathematical model based {{on the concept of}} “conflicting entities ” to express static separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements. It provides a detailed explanation of the integrity checking that must take place at administration time to ensure that specified separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> requirements are honoured...|$|R
