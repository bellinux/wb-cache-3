The payload of LISA Pathfinder is the so-called LISA Technology Package, which is designed to measure relative accelerations between two <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> in <b>nominal</b> free fall. The diagnostics subsystem consists of several modules, one of which is the magnetic diagnostics unit. Its main function is the assessment of the differential acceleration noise between the <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> due to magnetic effects. This subsystem is composed of two onboard coils intended to produce controlled magnetic fields at the location of the <b>test</b> <b>masses.</b> These magnetic fields couple with the remanent magnetic moment and susceptibility and produce forces and torques on the <b>test</b> <b>masses.</b> These, in turn, produce kinematic excursions of the <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> which are sensed by the onboard interferometer. We prove that adequately processing these excursions, the magnetic properties of the <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> can be estimated using classical multi-parameter estimation techniques. Moreover, we show that special processing procedures to minimize the effect of the multi channel cross-talks are needed. Finally, we demonstrate that the quality of our estimates is frequency dependent. We also suggest that using a multiple frequency experiment the global estimate can be obtained {{in such a way that}} the results of the magnetic experiment are more reliable. Finally, using our procedure we compute the the contribution of the magnetic noise to the total proof-mass acceleration noise.

40|$|In {{this work}} I {{describe}} {{the development of}} an electrostatic positioning system (EPS) for improving the starting conditions of the <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> in a free fall experiment to test the weak equivalence principle. The equivalence of intertial and gravitational mass is one of the fundamental principles in physics. One version of this principle is the weak equivalence principle (WEP), also known as Universality of Free Fall (UFF). It says, a <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> with neglectible self gravitation behaves independently of its properties in a gravitational field. In the recent centuries, the WEP has been investigated by using different methods. My literature recherche shows, that surprisingly few free fall experiments using macroscopic <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> have been performed. And their results have not reached the accuracy of other methods jet. At the drop tower Bremen, a free fall experiment using high precision, Supraconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) sensors was developed. In 2001 it tested the WEP by measuring the difference between the accelerations of two <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> falling freely with an accuracy up to $ eta 10 - 7 $. By improving the different components of the Experiment and especially the starting conditions of the <b>test</b> <b>masses,</b> an improvement in the accuracy of several orders should be possible. The center of <b>mass</b> of the <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> should be positioned in the same place within 0. 3 mircometer und their velocities should be minimized to 0. 1 m/s. Therefore, a electrostatic positioning system (EPS) in axial direction was developed und the first results of the characterisation of the protoptype are presented in this work. The experimental set-up and the controller are described in detail. Characteristic parameters of the system are defined and the experiments to determine them are described. By using a high precision weighing balance, the force exerted on the <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> by the EPS was measured. This results help to modell the system. Measurements of different positionings of the <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> were used to determine the position resolution of the EPS and other characteristic parameters. A suprising result of these measurements is the EPS can be used with and without the wire connected to the <b>test</b> <b>mass</b> for electrically grounding it. The parameters of the controller had not been changed between both measurements and only the scaling factor to convert the voltage signals into position signals changes slightly. The results of the characterisation provide new aspects for simplifing and improving the axial EPS and developing an radial EPS in the future. The combination of both EPS will improve the starting conditions of the <b>test</b> <b>masses</b> and therefore the conditions for the SQUID sensors significantly. This will be a main step in improving the accuracy of free fall test of the WEP up to $ eta 10 - 13 $...|$|R
